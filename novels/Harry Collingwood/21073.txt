a pirate of the caribbees by harry collingwood a very wellwritten book about the efforts of a young officer courtenay to bring to book a wicked pirate morillo it all seems very likely and believable despite the usual ration of shipwrecks captures hurricanes founderings and so forth makes a very good audiobook nh a pirate of the caribbees by harry collingwood chapter one a frigate fight in midatlantic eight bells there sleepers dye hear the newsrouse and bitt my hearties show a leg eight bells courtenay and keene says he will be much obliged if you will relieve him as soon as possible these words delivered in a tone of voice that was a curious alternation of a high treble with a preternaturally deep bassdue to the fact that the speakers voice was breakingand accompanied by the reckless banging of a tin pannikin upon the deal table that adorned the midshipmens berth of hm frigate althea instantly awoke me to the disagreeable consciousness that my watch below had come to an end especially as the concluding portion of the harangue was addressed to me personally and accompanied by a most uncompromising thump upon the side of my hammock so i surlily growled an answer all right young un theres no occasion to make all that hideous row just see if you can make yourself useful by finding black peter will you and telling him to brew some coffee the lad was turning away to do my bidding when a pattering of naked feet became audible as their owner approached while a husky voice ejaculated whos dat axin for brack petah was it you mistah courtenay and at the same instant the shining goodnatured grinning visage of a gigantic negro appeared in the narrow doorway through which the fellow instantly passed into the berth bearing a big pot of steaming hot coffee ay you black demon i it was answered i is that coffee you have there then find my cup and fill it theres a good fellow and ill owe you a glass of grog hi yi answered the black his eyes sparkling and his teeth gleaming hilariously who you call brack demon eh sah who eber hear of brack demon turnin out at four oclock in de mornin to make coffee for young gentermen eh and about de grog mistah courtenay how many glasses do dis one make dat you now owe me eh sah ansah me dat sah you don keep no account i expecs sah but i do dis one makes seben mistah courtenay and id be much obleege sah if youd pay some of dem off it am all bery well to say youll owe em to me sah but whats de use ob dat if you don nebber pay me eh pay you you rascal shouted i as i sprang to the deck and began hastily to scramble into my clothes do you mean to say that you have the impudence to actually expect to be paid is it not honour and reward enough that a gentleman condescends to become indebted to you pay indeed why what is the world coming to i wonder bravo courtenay well spoken shouted young lindsay the lad who had so ruthlessly interrupted my slumbers how well you express yourself you ought to be in parliament man give it him again bring him to his bearings the impudence of the fellow is getting to be past endurance now then you black swab wheres the sugar do you suppose we can drink that stuff without sugar after a search of some duration the sugar was eventually found in a locker in loving contiguity to an open box of blacking some boot brushes a box of candles a few fragments of brown windsorone of which had somehow found its way into the bowland a few other fragrant trifles in my haste to get on deck and betrayed by the feeble light of the pursers dip which just sufficed to render the darkness visible i managed to convey this stray morsel of soap into my coffee along with the sugar wherewith i intended to sweeten it and only discovered what i had done barely in time to avoid gulping down the soap along with the scalding liquid into which i had plunged it a midshipman however soon loses all sense of squeamishness so i contented myself with muttering a sea blessing upon the head of the unknown individual who had deposited this matter in the wrong place and dashed up the hatchway to relieve the impatient keene i shivered and instinctively buttoned my jacket closely about me as i stepped out on deck for mild and bland as the temperature actually was it felt raw and chill after the close stifling atmosphere of the midshipmans berth it was very dark for it was only just past the date of the new moon and the thin silver sicklewhich was all that the coy orb then showed of herselfhad set some hours before moreover there was a thin veil of mist or sea fog hanging upon the surface of the water through which only a few of the brighter stars could be faintly distinguished near the zenith there was no windit had fallen calm the night before about sunset and we were in the horse latitudesand the frigate was rolling uneasily upon a short steep swell that had come creeping up out from the northeast during the middle watch the precursor as we hoped of the northeast tradesfor we were in the very heart of the north atlantic and bound to the west indies i duly received the anathemas of my shipmate keene at my tardy appearance on deck hurled a properly spirited retort after him down the hatchway and then made my way up the poop ladder to tramp out my watch on the lee side of the deckif there can be such a thing as a lee side when there is no wind it was dreary work this tramping fore and aft fore and aft with nothing whatever to engage the attention and nothing to do i therefore eagerly watched for and hailed with delight the first faint pallid brightening of the eastern sky that heralded the dawn for with daylight there would at least be the ships toilet to makethe decks to holystone and scrub brasswork and guns to clean and polish the paintwork to wash sheets and braces to flemishcoil and mayhap something to see as well as the possibility that with the rising of the sun we might get a small slant of wind to push us a few miles nearer to the region where the trade wind was merrily blowing the dawn came slowlyor perhaps it merely seemed to my impatience to do soand with daylight the mist that had hung about the ship all night thickened into a genuine unmistakable fog so thick that when standing by the break of the poop it was impossible to see as far as the jibboom end the fog made mr hennesey our second lieutenant and the officer of the watch uneasyas well it might for we were in the early spring of the year and great britain was at war with france spain and holland at that time the three most formidable naval powers in the world next to ourselves and the chances were that every second ship we might meet would be an enemyand at length just as seven bells were being struck he turned to me and said mr courtenay you have good eyes just jump up on to the mainroyal yard will you and take a look round this fog packs close but i do not believe it reaches as high as our mastheads and i feel curious to know whether anything has drifted within sight of us during the night i touched my hat and forthwith made my way into the main rigging glad of even a journey aloft to break the dismal monotony of the blind grey stirless morning and in due time swung myself up on to the slender yard the sail of which had been clewed up but not furled but alas the worthy second luff was mistaken for once in his life it was every whit as thick up there as it was down on deck and not a thing could i see but the fore and mizzenmasts with their intricacies of standing and running rigging their tapering yards and their broad spaces of wet and drooping canvas hanging limp and looming spectrally through the ghostly mistwreaths i was about to hail the deck and report the failure of my experimental journey but was checked in the very act by feeling something like a faint stir in the damp heavy air about me another moment and a dim yellow smudge became visible on the port beam which i presently recognised as the newly risen sun struggling to pierce with his beams the ponderous masses of white vapour that were now slowly working as though stirred by some subtle agency by imperceptible degrees the pallid vision of the sun brightened and strengthened and presently i became conscious of a faint but distinct movement of the air from off the port quarter to which the cloths of the sail against which my feet dangled responded with a gentle rustling movement on deck there i shouted it is still as thick as a hedge up here sir but it seems inclined to clear and i believe we are going to have a breeze out from the northeast presently so much the better answered the second luff ignoring the first half of my communication stay where you are a little longer if you please mr courtenay ay ay sir answered i settling myself more comfortably upon the yard and while the words were still upon my lips the stagnant air about me once more stirred the great spaces of canvas beneath me swelled sluggishly out with a small pattering of reefpoints from the three topsails and a gentle creak of truss and parrel as the strain of the filling canvas came upon the yards and i saw the brightening disc of the sun begin to sweep round until it bore broad upon our larboard quarter then some sharp words of command from the poop in mr henneseys wellknown tonesdulcet as those of a bullfrog with a bad coldcame floating up to me followed by the shrill notes of the boatswains pipe and his hoarse bellow of hands make sail a few minutes of orderly confusion down on deck and on the yards below me now ensued and when it ceased the althea was running square away before the languid but slowly strengthening breeze with studdingsails set on both sides meanwhile the log was gradually clearing for it was now possible to see to a distance of fully three lengths of the ship on either hand before the curling and sweeping wreaths of vapour shut out the tiny dancing ripples that seemed to be merrily racing the ship to port and starboard occasionally a break or clear space in the fogbank swept down upon and overtook us when it would be possible to see for a distance of a quarter of a mile for a few seconds then it would thicken again and be as blinding as ever but every break that came was wider than the one that preceded it showing that the windward edge of the bank was rapidly drawing down after us and as these breaks occurred indifferently on either side of or sometimes on both sides at once with now and then a clear space right astern to give a spice of variety to the proceedings my eyes as may be guessed were kept pretty busy at length an opening very considerably wider than any that had thus far reached us came sweeping down upon our starboard quarter and as i peered into it endeavouring to pierce the veil of fog that formed its farther extremity i suddenly became aware of a vague shape indistinctly perceptible through the intervening wreaths of mist that were now sweeping rapidly along before the steadily freshening breeze i saw it but during the wink of an eyelid when it was shut in again but i knew at once what it was it could be but one thinga ship and i forthwith hailed on deck there theres a strange sail about a mile distant sir broad on our starboard quarter thank you mr courtenay promptly responded the second what do you make her out to be it is impossible at present to say anything definite about her sir i answered i saw her but for a second and then only very indistinctly but she loomed up through the fog like a craft of about our own size very well sir answered hennesey stay where you are and keep a sharp lookout for her next appearance once more i returned the stereotyped ay ay sir as i sent my glances searching round the ship for further openings the next that overtook us swept down upon our port quarter it was fully a mile and a half wide and when it bore about four points abaft the beam another shape slid into it not vague and shadowy this time as the other shape had been but clearly distincta frigate unmistakably under a similar spread of canvas to our own and as nearly as possible our own size so close indeed was the resemblance that for a second or two i was disposed to fancy that by some strange trick of light and reflection the fog was treating me to a picture of the old althea herself but a more steadfast scrutiny soon dispelled the illusion there were certain unmistakable points of difference between this second apparition and ourselves some of which were so strongly characteristic that i at once set her down as a french frigate the plot was thickening and it was not wholly without a certain feeling of exhilaration that i again hailed the deck a frigate broad on our port quarter sir with a very frenchified look about her thank you again mr courtenay answered hennesey with an unmistakable ring of delight in his jovial irish accent which by the way had a trick of growing more pronounced under the influence of excitement ah true for you there she is he continued i have her mr hudson have the kindness to jump below and fetch me my glass will ye and look alive you shmall anatomy a gentle ripple of subdued laughter from the forecastle at this sally of our genial second floated up to me from the forecastle a glimpse of which i could just catch under the foot of the foretopsail and i could see that the men were all alive down there with pleasurable excitement at the prospect of a possible fight young hudsona smart little fellow barely fourteen years old and the most juvenile member of our messwas soon on deck again with the second lieutenants telescope but by this time the fog had shut the stranger in again so for the moment friend henneseys curiosity had to remain unsatisfied not for long however the presumably french frigate had not been lost sight of more than two or three minutes when i caught a second glimpse of the other craftthe one first sightedon our starboard quarter there is the other fellow sir i shouted you can see her distinctly now and she too is a frigate and french unless i am greatly mistaken by the powers mr courtenay i hope you may be right answered hennesey ay there she is he continued as plain as mud in a wineglass and if she isnt french her looks belie her mr hudson you spalpeen slip down below and tell the captain that there are a brace of suspiciouslooking craft within a mile of us and ye may call upon misther dawson and impart the same pleasant information to him then turning his beaming phiz up to me he continued mr courtenay its on the stroke of eight bells but all the same youd better stay where you are for the present until the fog clears since you know exactly the bearings of those two craft and ill thank ye to keep your weather eye liftin young gentleman there may be a whole fleet of frenchmen within gunshot of us for all that we can tell ay ay sir i cheerfully answered my curiosity having by this time got the better of my keen appetite for breakfast moreover having been the discoverer of the two sail already sighted i was anxious to add to the prestige thus gained by being the first to sight any other craft that might happen to be in our neighbourhood my stay aloft however was not destined to be a long one for the fog was now clearing fast and within ten minutes it had all driven away to leeward of us revealing the fact that there were but the two sail already discovered in sightunless there might happen to be others so far ahead as to be still hidden in the fogbank to leeward but before i left the royal yard i had succeeded in satisfying myself by means of my glasswhich had been sent up to me bent on to the signal halliards that the two strangers were frigates and almost certainly french they were exchanging signals at a great rate but we could make nothing of their flags which at least proved that they were not british to make assurance doubly sure however we had hoisted our private signal to which neither ship had been able to reply there was no doubt that they were enemies and this fact having been satisfactorily established i was permitted to descend and snatch a hasty breakfast and a hasty one it was for i had scarcely been below five minutes when we were piped to clear for action and i was obliged to hurry on deck again but a hungry midshipman can achieve a good deal in the eating line in five minutes and in that brief interval i contrived to stow away enough food to take the keen edge off my appetite promising myself that i would make up my leeway at dinnertimeprovided that i was still alive when the hour for that meal came round this last thought sobered me down somewhat and to a certain extent subdued my hilarious spirits but they rose again as upon gaining the deck i looked round and saw the cheerful yet resolute faces of the captain and officers and noted the gaiety with which the men went about their duty the strangers had by this time shown their buntingthe tricolourso there was no further question of their nationality or of the fact that we were booked for a sharp fight for they had the heels of us and were overhauling us in grand style we could not therefore have escaped had we been ever so anxious to do so and had we made the attempt we should certainly have been quite justified for it had now been ascertained that they were both fortygun ships while we mounted only thirtysix pieces on our gun deck escape however was apparently the very last thought likely to occur to captain harrison for although he kept the studdingsails abroad while the ship was being prepared for action no sooner had the first lieutenant reported everything ready than the order was given to shorten sail and a pretty sight it was to see how smartly and with what beautifully perfect precision everything was done at once the studdingsails all collapsing and coming in together at exactly the same moment that the three royals were clewed up and the flight of staysails on the main and mizzen masts hauled down very prettily done mr dawson said the skipper approvingly our friends yonder will see that they have seamen to deal with at all events even though we cannot sport such a clean pair of heels as their own the two frenchmen were by this time within less than half a mile of us converging upon us in such a manner as to range up alongside the althea within the toss of a biscuit on either hand but neither of them manifested the slightest disposition to follow our example by shortening sail perhaps they believed that were they to do so we should at once make sail again and endeavour to escape whereas by holding on to everything until they drew up alongside us we should fall an easy prey to their superior strength if indeed we did not surrender at discretion and truly the two ships formed a noble and a graceful picture as they came sweeping rapidly down upon us with every stitch of canvas set that they could possibly spread their white sails towering spirelike into the deep tender blue of the cloudless heavens with the delicate purple shadows chasing each other athwart the rounded bosoms of them as the hulls that upbore them swung pendulumlike with a little curl of snow under their bows over the low hillocks of swell that chased them sparkling in the brilliant sunlight like a heaving floor of sapphire strewed broadcast with diamonds they stood on silent as the grave until the craft on our larboard quarterwhich was leading by about a couple of lengthshad reached to within a short quarter of a mile of us when as we all stood watching them intently a jet of flame followed by a heavy burst of white smoke leapt out from her starboard bow port and the next instant the shot went humming close past us to dash up the water in a fountainlike jet a quarter of a mile ahead of us that i take it is a polite request to us to heaveto and haul down our colours remarked captain harrison to the first lieutenant with a smile well we may as well return the compliment mr dawson try a shot at each of them with the sternchasers if we could only manage to knock away an important spar on board either of them it might so cripple her as to cause her to drop astern leaving us to deal with the other one and settle her business out of hand yes aim at their spars mr dawson it would perhaps have been better had we opened fire directly they were within range but i was anxious not to make a mistake now that they have fired upon us however we need hesitate no longer the order was accordingly given to open fire with our sternchasers and in less than a minute the two guns spoke out simultaneously jarring the old hooker to her keel we were unable for a moment to see the effect of the shots for the smoke blew in over our taffrail completely hiding our two pursuers for a few seconds but when it cleared away a cheer broke from the men who were manning the after guns for it was seen that the flyingjib stay of our antagonist on the port quarter was cut and the sail towing from the jibboom end a neat hole in her port foretopmast studdingsail showing where the shot had passed the other gun had been less successful the shot having passed through the head of the second frigates foresail about four feet below the yard and half way between the slings and the starboard yardarm without inflicting any further perceptible damage very wellmeant let them try again exclaimed the skipper approvingly and as the words issued from his lips we saw the two pursuing frigates yaw broadly outward as if by common consent and the next instant they both let drive a whole broadside at us i waited breathlessly while one might have counted onetwo and then the sound of an ominous crashing aloft told me that we were wounded somewhere among our spars a block followed by a shower of splinters came hurtling down on deck breaking the arm of a man at the aftermost quarterdeck gun on the port side and then a louder crash aloft caused me to look up just in time to see our mizzentopmast go sweeping forward into the hollow of the maintopsail which it split from head to foot the mizzentopgallant mast snapping short off at the cap as it swooped down upon the maintopsail yard two topmen were swept out of the maintop by the wreckage in its descent and terriblyone of them fatallyinjured and there were a few minor damages which however were quickly repaired then as some hands sprang aloft to clear away the wreck our sternchasers spoke out again the one close after the other and two new holes in the enemys canvas testified to the excellent aim of our gunners but unfortunately that was the extent of the damage both shots having passed very close to but just missed important spars the french displayed very creditable smartness in getting inboard the flyingjib that we had cut away for them and by the time that this was accomplished they had drawn up so close to us that by bearing away a point or two to port and starboard respectively both craft were enabled to bring their whole broadsides to bear upon us which they immediately did taking in their studdingsails and otherwise reducing their canvas at the same time until we were all three under exactly the same amount of sailexcepting of course that we had lost our mizzentopsail with all above it while theirs still stood intact as for us our guns were all trained as far aft as the portholes would permit and as our antagonists ranged up on either quarter within pistolshot each gun was fired pointblank as it was brought to bear and now the fight began in real grim downright earnest the crew of each gun loading and firing as rapidly as possible while the french poured in their broadsides with a coolness and precision that extorted our warmest admiration despite the disagreeable fact that they were playing havoc with us fore and aft one of our guns having been dismounted within three minutes of the arrival of the enemy alongside us while the tale of killed and wounded was growing heavier with every broadside that we received but if we were suffering severely we were paying our punishment back with interest as we could see by glancing at the hulls of our antagonists the sides of which were torn and splintered and pierced all along the broad white streak that marked the line of portssome of which were knocked two into onewhile their yellow sides were here and there broadly streaked with crimson as the blood drained away through their scuppers it is true they were fighting us two to one but after all their advantage was more apparent than real for running level with us as they were they could only fight one of their batteries while we were fighting both ours and our gunsevery one of them doubleshottedwere being better and more rapidly served than theirs i will not attempt to describe the fight in detail for indeed any such attempt could only result in failure and as a matter of fact there was very little to describe we simply ran dead away to leeward the three of us fighting almost yardarm to yardarm and exchanging broadsides as rapidly as the guns could be loaded and run out after the first ten minutes of the fight there was little or nothing to be seen for the wind was fast dropping again and the three ships were wrapped in a dense white pall of smoke that effectually concealed everything that was going on at a greater distance than some fifty feet from the observer the most impressive characteristic of the struggle was noisethe incessant crash of the guns the discharge of which set up a continuous tremor of the ship throughout the entire fabric of her the rending and splintering of timber as the enemys shot tore its way through the frigates sides the shrieks and groans of the wounded and dying cut into at frequent intervals by some sharp order from the captain or the first lieutenant the curt commands of the captains of the guns stop the vent run in sponge load run out and so on the creak of the tackle blocks the rumble of the gun carriages the clatter of handspikes the dull thud of the rammers driving home the shot the rattling volleys of musketry from the marines on the poop the occasional rending crash of a falling spar and the terrific babble of the frenchmen on either side of us sounding high and clear in the occasional brief intervals when all the guns happened to be silent together for a momenti can only compare it all to the horrible confusion raging through the disordered imagination of one in the clutches of a fiercely burning fever our people fought grimly and in silence save for an occasional cheer at some unusually successful shot but the frenchmen jabbered away incessantly sometimes reviling us and shaking their fists at us through their open ports and more often squabbling among themselves at length when the fight had lasted about half an hour the wind dropped to a dead calm and the frenchman on our starboard side who had forged somewhat ahead of us made an effort to lay himself athwart our bows before he lost way altogether but we were too quick for him for his mainmast was towing alongside and stopped his way so we did with him what he tried to do to us driving square athwart his bows as his bowsprit came thrusting in between our fore and main masts when we lost not a moment in lashing the spar to our main rigging but after all it resolved itself into tit for tat for the other fellow put his helm hard aport and just managed to drive square athwart our stern where he raked us most unmercifully for fully five minutes until he drove clear bringing down all three of our masts before he left us of course we could only retaliate upon him with our sternchasers which we played upon him with considerable effect but what we lacked in the way of adequate retort to him we amply made up for to his consort raking her time after time with such goodwill that in a few minutes her bows were battered into a mere mass of torn and splintered timber somebody on board her cried out that they had struck but as her marines kept up their fire upon us from the poop while her maindeck guns continued to blaze away whenever she swung sufficiently for any of them to bear no notice was taken of this intimation and presently our skipper gave the order to cut her adrift so that her people might have no chance to boarda proceeding that would have proved exceedingly awkward for us in our then weakened condition but it presently became evident that they had no thought of boarding us on the contrary their chief anxiety was clearly to escape from the warm berth that they had thrust themselves into for a few minutes later the fire on both sides having slackened somewhat we observed that both craft had their boats in the water and were doing their best to tow off from us and almost immediately afterwards the french ceased firing altogether i believe our skipperfireeater though he wasfelt unfeignedly thankful at this cessation of hostilities for he immediately followed suit giving the order for the men to leave the guns and proceed to repair damages this was no light task for not only were we completely dismasted but the hull of the ship was terribly knocked about the carpenter reporting five feet of water in the hold and twentyseven shotholes between wind and water apart from our other damages which were sufficiently serious moreover our butchers bill was appallingly heavy the list totalling up to no less than thirtyeight killed and one hundred and six wounded out of a total of two hundred and eighty chapter two the althea founders the french having ceased firing and manifesting an unmistakable anxiety to withdraw from our proximity we bestowed but little further attention on them for it quickly became clear to us that our own condition was quite sufficiently serious to tax our energies to the utmost the first task demanding the attention of the carpenter and his mates was of course the stoppage of our leaks and a very difficult task indeed it proved to be owing to the rapidity with which the water was rising in the hold by manning the pumps however and employing the entire available remainder of the crew in baling we succeeded in plugging all the shotholes and clearing the hold of water by noon when the men were knocked off to go to their wellearned dinner then indeed we found time to look around us and to ask ourselves and each other where the french were and what they were doing there was no difficulty in furnishing a reply to either question for our antagonists were only a bare four miles off and close together but bad as our own plight was theirs was very much worse for we now saw that the frigate which we had raked so unmercifully was in a sinking condition having settled so low in the water indeed that the sills of her maindeck ports were awash and dipping with every sluggish heave of her upon the low and almost imperceptible swell while her own boats and those of her consort were busily engaged in taking off her crew with the aid of my telescope i could distinctly see all that was going on and i saw also that the end of the gallant craft was so near as to render her disappearance a matter of but a few minutes hungry therefore as i was i determined to remain on deck and see the last of her nor had i long to wait i had scarcely arrived at the decision that i would do so when as i watched her through my glass i saw the boats that hung around her shoving off hurriedly one after the other until one only remained presently that one also shoved off and loaded down to her gunwale pulled as hastily as her overloaded condition would permit toward the other frigate she had scarcely placed half a dozen fathoms between herself and the sinking ship before the latter rolled heavily to port slowly recovered herself and then rolled still more heavily to starboard completely burying the whole tier of her starboard ports as she did so she hung thus for perhaps half a minute settling visibly all the time finally she staggered as it were once more to an even keel but with her stern dipping deeper and deeper every second until her taffrail was buried while her battered bows lifted slowly into the air when the inclination of her decks rapidly growing steeper she suddenly took a sternward plunge and vanished from sight in the midst of a sudden swirl of water that was distinctly visible through the lenses of the telescope the occupants of the boat that had so recently left her saw their danger and put forth herculean efforts to avoid it they were too near however to escape and despite all their exertions the boat was caught and dragged back into the vortex created by the sinking ship into which she too disappeared but a few seconds afterwards i saw heads popping up above the water again here and there while a couple of boats that had just discharged their cargo of passengers dashed away to the rescue and were soon paddling hither and thither among the little black spots that kept popping into view all round them i waited until all had seemingly been picked up and then went below to secure what dinner might be remaining for me when after a hurried meal i again went on deck the horizon away to the northward and eastward was darkening to a light air from that quarter that came gently stealing along the glassy surface of the ocean first in catspaws then as a gentle breathing that caused the polished undulations to break into a tremor of laughing ripples and finally into a light breeze before which the surviving french frigate bore up with squared yards leaving us unmolested meanwhile the crew having dined turned to again for a busy afternoons work which consisted chiefly in clearing away the wreck of our fallen spars and saving as many of them and as much of our canvas and running gear as would be likely to be of use to us in fitting the ship with a juryrig and so well did the men work that by sunset we were enabled to cut adrift from the wreck of our lower masts and to bear up in the wake of the frenchman who by this time had run us out of sight in the southwestern quarter but tired as the men were there was no rest for them that night for it was felt to be imperatively necessary to get the ship under canvas again without a moments delay moreover despite the fact that the shotholes had all been plugged it was found that the battered hull was still leaking so seriously as to necessitate a quarter of an hours spell at the pumps every two hours the hands were therefore kept at work watch and watch all through the night with the result that when day broke next morning we had a pair of sheers rigged and on end ready to rear into position the spars that had been prepared and fitted as lower masts the end of that day found us once more under sail after a fashion and heading on our course to the southward and westward for the following two days all went well with us save that the ship continued to make water so freely as to necessitate the use of the pumps at the middle and end of every watch a fair breeze driving us along under our jurycanvas at the rate of five to six knots per hour toward evening however on the second day signs of a change of weather began to manifest themselves the sky to windward losing its rich tint of blue and becoming pallid and hard streaked with mares tails and flecked with small smokylooking swiftflying clouds while the setting sun as he neared the horizon lost his radiance and became a mere shapeless blotch of angry red that finally seemed to dissolve and disappear in a broad bank of slatehued vapour the sea too changed its colour from the clear steelblue that it had hitherto worn to the hue of indigo smirched with black moreover i heard the captain remark to mr dawson that the mercury was falling and that he feared we were in for a dirty night and indeed so it seemed for about the middle of the second dogwatch the wind lulled perceptibly and we had a sharp rainsquall soon after which it breezed up again the wind coming first of all in gusts and then in a strong breeze that as the night wore on steadily increased until it was blowing half a gale with every indication of worse to come the sea too rose rapidly and came rushing down upon our starboard quarter high steep and foamcrested causing the frigate to roll and tumble about most unpleasantly under her juryrig and short canvas altogether the prospects for the night were so exceedingly unpromising that i must plead guilty to having experienced a selfish joy at the reflection that it was my eight hours in when i went on deck at midnight that night i found that the wind had increased to a whole gale with a very high and confused sea running over which the poor maimed althea was wallowing along at a speed of about eight and a half knots with a dismal groaning of timbers that harmonised lugubriously with the clank of the chain pumps and the swash of water washing nearly kneedeep about the decksfor the hooker laboured so heavily that she was leaking like a basket necessitating the unremitting use of the pumps throughout the watch andworst of allkeene whispered to me that even with the pumps going constantly the water was slowly but distinctly gaining and thus it continued all through the middle watch it was hoped that the gale would not be of long duration but at eight bells next morning the news was that the mercury was still falling while the wind instead of evincing a disposition to moderate blew harder than ever and oh what a dreary outlook it was when swathed in oilskins i passed through the hatchway and stepped out on deck the sky was entirely veiled by an unbroken mass of dark purplish slate coloured cloud that was almost black in its deeper shadows with long tattered streamers of dirty whitish vapour scurrying wildly athwart it a heavy leadenhued whitecrested foamflecked sea was running and in the midst of the picture was the poor crippled frigate rolling and labouring and staggering onward like a wounded seabird under her jury spars and spraydarkened canvas with a miniature ocean washing hither and thither athwart her heaving deck and a crowd of panting straining halfnaked men clustering about her pumps while others were as busily employed in passing buckets up and down through the hatchways the whole set to the dismal harmony of howling wind hissing spray the wearisome and incessant wash of water and the groaning and complaining sounds of the labouring hull the skipper and the first luff were pacing the weather side of the poop together in earnest converse and at each turn in their walk they both paused for an instant as by mutual consent to cast a look of anxious inquiry to windward presently i saw the carpenter coming along the deck with the sounding rod in his hand i intercepted him just by the foot of the poop ladder and remarked well chips what is the best news you have to tell us the best news echoed chips with a solemn shake of the head there aint no best mr courtenay its all worst sir theres over four foot of water in the hold now and its gainin on us at the rate of five inches an hour and if this here gale dont break pretty quick i wont answer for the consequences and up he went to make his report to the skipper this was bad news indeed especially for the unfortunate men who were compelled by dire necessity to toil unceasingly at the backbreaking labour of working the pumps but i felt no apprehension as to our ultimate safety five inches of water per hour was a formidable gain for a leak to make in spite of all the pumping and baling that could be accomplished yet it would take so many hours at that rate to reduce the frigate to a waterlogged condition that ere the arrival of that moment the gale would certainly blow itself out the labouring and straining of the ship would cease the leak would be got under control again and all would be well but when at noon that daythe gale showing no symptoms whatever of abatementthe captain gave orders for the upperdeck guns to be launched overboard i began to realise that our condition was such as might easily become critical and when about half an hour before sunset orders were given to throw the maindeck guns overboard it became borne in upon me that matters were becoming mighty serious with us with the approach of night the gale seemed rather to increase in strength than otherwise while the sea was certainly considerably heavier and the worst of it was that there was no indication of an approaching change for the better as for the poor althea she certainly did not labour quite so heavily now that she was relieved of the weight of her guns but the water in the hold still gained steadily upon the pumps and the more experienced hands among us were beginning to hint at the possibility of our being compelled to leave her and take to the boats and these hints received something of confirmation when shortly after the commencement of the first watch the carpenter and his mates were seen going the rounds of the boats and examining into their condition with the aid of lanterns nevertheless and despite these omens the men stuck resolutely to the pumps and the baling all through the night the captain and the first lieutenant animating and encouraging them by their presence throughout the long dismal dreary hours of darkness about three bells in the morning watch the welcome news spread throughout the ship that the mercury had at length begun to rise again and with the approach of dawn it became apparent that the gale was breaking the sky to windward gave signs of clearing and hope once more sprang up within our breasts but the men although still willing and even eager to continue the heartbreaking work of pumping and baling were by this time utterly worn out the water in the hold steadily and relentlessly gained upon them despite their most desperate efforts and by the arrival of breakfasttime it had become perfectly apparent to everybody that the poor old althea was a doomed ship if however there was any doubt as to this in the minds of any of us it was quickly dispelled for after breakfast the order was passed to knock off baling and the men thus relieved were at once set to work under the first and second lieutenants the one party to prepare a sea anchor and the other to attend to the provisioning of the boats and get them ready for launching i was attached to the first lieutenants party or that which undertook the preparation of the sea anchor and as the idea impressed me as being rather ingenious i will describe it for the benefit of those who may feel interested in such matters prefacing my description with the explanation that in consequence of the springing up of the gale so soon after our action with the frenchmen our juryrig was of a very primitive and incomplete character such as would enable us to run fairly well before the wind but not such as would permit of our lyingto hence the need for a sea anchor now that the necessity had arisen for us to launch our boats in heavy weather the sea anchor was the offspring of the first lieutenants inventiveness and it consisted of an old foretopsail bent to a couple of booms of suitable length and stoutness the head of the sail was bent to one of the booms with seizings in much the same manner as it would have been bent to a topsail yard while the clews were securely lashed to the extremities of the other boom then to the boom which represented the topsail yard was attached a crowfoot made of two spans of stout hawser having an eye in the centre of them to which to bend the cable the lower boom was well weighted by the attachment to it of a number of pigs of iron ballast as well as our stream anchor after which the starboard cable was paid out and passed along aft outside the fore rigging the end being then brought inboard and bent on to the crowfoot the whole was then made up as compactly as possible with lashings after which by means of tackles aloft it was hoisted clear of the bulwarks and lowered down over the side the lashings were then cut and the sail dropped into the water opening out as it did so when the lower boom sinking with the weight attached to it a broad surface was exposed acting as a very efficient sea anchor at the moment when everything was ready to let go the ships helm was put hard over bringing her broadsideon to the sea when as she drove away to leeward she brought a strain upon her cable that at once fetched her up head to wind this part of the process having been successfully accomplished it was an easy matter to bend a spring on to the cable and heave the ship round broadsideon to the sea once more in which position she afforded an excellent lee under the shelter of which to launch our boats which but for this contrivance must have inevitably been swamped by the time that all this was done the boats were ready for launching and the captain gave orders for this to be at once proceeded with beginning with the launch this being the heaviest boat in the ship and the most difficult to get into the water i felt exceedingly doubtful as to the ability of our juryspars to support the weight of so heavy a craft but by staying them well the delicate task was at length successfully accomplished when the worst cases among the wounded were brought on deck and carefully lowered over the side into the boat beneath the doctor with his instruments and medicinechest being already there to receive them and as soon as she had received her complement the launch was veered away to leeward at the end of a long linebut still under the shelter of the ships hullto make room for the first cutter the rest of the boats followed in successionthe men preserving to the very last moment the most admirable order and disciplineuntil only the captains gig of which i was placed in command remained the proper complement of this boat was six men in addition to the coxswain but in order that the woundedwho were placed in the launch and the first and second cuttersmight be as little crowded as possible the remainder of the boats received rather more than their full complement in consequence of which my crew numbered ten all told instead of seven we were the last boat to leave the ship the skipper having gone below to his cabin for some purpose at the last minute and i assure you that the bustle and excitement of getting the men out of the ship being now all over i found it rather nervous and trying work to stand there in the gangway waiting for the reappearance of the captain on deck for the ship was by this time in a sinking condition and liable to go down under our feet at any moment having settled so low in the water that she rolled her closed maindeck ports completely under with every sickly lurch of her upon the still heavy sea that was now continuously breaking over her while the water could be distinctly heard washing about down below at length the skipper came out of his cabin bearing in his hand a large japanned tin box jump down mr courtenay and stand by to take this box from me he cried and down the side i went needing no second bidding the box was carefully passed down to me and i stowed it away in the sternsheets when i had done so and looked up at the ship captain harrison was standing in the gangway with his hat in his hand looking wistfully and sorrowfully along the deserted decks and aloft at the juryspars that with their rigging so pathetically expressed the idea of a mortally wounded creature gallantly but hopelessly struggling against the death that was inexorably drawing near some such fancy perhaps suggested itself to him for i distinctly saw him dash his hand across his eyes more than once at length he turned descended the sideladder and watching his opportunity sprang lightly into the boat shove off mr courtenay he ordered as he wrapped himself in his boat cloak shove off i reiterated in turn and forthwith away we went the men nothing loath as i could clearly see for the ship was now liable to founder at any moment indeed the wonder to me was that she remained afloat so long for she had by this time sunk so deep that her channels were completely buried only showing when she rolled heavily away from us poor old barkie what a desolate and forlorn object she looked as we pulled away from her with little more than her bulwarks showing above water with the seas making a clean breach over her bows continually as she rolled and plunged with sickening sluggishness to the great ridges of steelgrey water that incessantly swooped down upon her and into which her bows pinned down by the weight of water within her hull occasionally bored as though tired of the hopeless struggle for existence she had at length summoned resolution to take the final plunge and so end it all again and again i thought she was gone but again and yet again she emerged wearily and heavily out of the deluges of water that sought to overwhelm her but at length an unusually heavy sea caught her with her bows pinned down after a plunge into the trough clear green and unbroken it brimmed to her figurehead and poured in a foaming cataract over her bows sweeping the whole length of her from stem to stern until her hull was completely buried as the wave left her it was seen that her bows were still submerged and a moment later it became apparent that the end had come and she was taking her final plunge there she goes shouted one of the men and as the fellow uttered the words the captain rose to his feet in the sternsheets and doffed his hat as though he had been standing beside the grave of a dear friend watching the dear old barkie as with her stern gradually rising high she slid slowly and solemnly out of sight the occupants of the boats giving her a parting cheer as she vanished the captain stood motionless until the swirl that marked her grave had disappeared then he replaced his hat resumed his seat and remarked give way men mr courtenay be good enough to put me aboard the launch if you please chapter three the gig is caught in a hurricane upon reaching the launch the captains first care was to satisfy himself as to the wellbeing and comfort of the poor wounded fellows aboard her but the doctor had already attended to this matter with the result that they were as comfortable as the utmost care and forethought could render them the master meanwhile had been ascertaining the exact latitude and longitude of the spot where the frigate had gone down and he now communicated the result of his calculations to the captain who thereupon gave orders for the boats to steer southwest on a speed trial for the day the leading boat to heaveto at sunset and wait for the rest to close i had not the remotest notion as to the meaning of this somewhat singular order but my obvious duty was to execute it so i forthwith made sail upon the gig and a very few minutes sufficed to demonstrate that we were the fastest boat of the whole squadron nor was this at all surprising for the gig was not an ordinary service boat she was the captains own private property having been built to order from his own design with a special view to the development of exceptional sailing powers boatsailing being quite a hobby with him she was a splendid craft of her kind measuring thirty feet in length with a beam of six feet and she pulled six oars she was a most beautiful model of the whaleboat type doubleended with quite an unusual amount of sheer fore and aft which gave her a fine bold buoyant bow and stern moreover these were covered in with light turtleback decks that forward measuring six feet in length while the after turtleback measured five feet from the sternpost she was fitted with a keel nine inches deep amidships tapering off to four inches deep at each end was rigged as a schooner with standing fore and main lug and a small jib and with her ordinary crew on board and sitting to windward required no ballast even in a fresh breeze small wonder therefore was it that having such a boat under us we had run the rest of the fleet out of sight by midday the wind still blowing strong although it was moderating rapidly the first lieutenant was like the captain fond of inventing and designing things but his speciality took the form of logs for determining the speed of craft through the water and in the course of his experiments he had provided each of the frigates boats with an ingenious spring arrangement which attached to an ordinary fishingline with a lead weight secured to its outer end which was continuously towed astern registered the speed of the boat with a very near approach to perfect accuracy the day passed uneventfully away the wind moderating steadily all the time and the sun breaking through considerably before noon enabling me to secure a meridian altitude wherefrom to compute my latitude the sea too was going down and when the sun set that night the sky wore a very promising fineweather aspect as the great golden orb vanished below the horizon we rounded the boat to lowered our sails and moored her to a sea anchor made of the oars lashed together in a bundle with the painter bent on to them and later on when it fell dark we lighted a lantern and hoisted it to our foremasthead as a beacon for which the other boats might steer the gig had behaved splendidly all through the day never shipping so much as a single drop of water and now that she was riding to her oars she took the sea so easily and buoyantly that i felt as safe as i had ever done aboard the poor old althea herself and unhesitatingly allowed all hands to turn in as best they could in the bottom of the boat undertaking to keep a lookout myself until the other boats had joined company the first boat to make her appearance was the service gig in charge of mr flowers the third lieutenant she ranged up alongside and hoveto about two hours after sunset soon afterwards following our example by throwing out a sea anchor then came the first and second cutters in command of the first and second lieutenants the first cutter arriving about an hour after mr flowers while the second cutter appeared about a quarter of an hour later the launch followed about half an hour astern of the second cutter but this was not to be wondered at the former being rather deep owing to the very generous supply of water that the doctor had insisted on carrying for the comfort of the wounded then some threequarters of an hour later came the jollyboat in charge of the boatswain and finally the dinghy carrying four hands and in charge of my friend and fellowmid jack keene turned up close upon midnight long ere this however we had each in succession spoken the launch reporting the distance that we had traversed up to sunset and with the data thus supplied the master had gone to work upon a calculation which formed the basis of a sort of table showing the ratio of the speeds of the several boats with the aid of which the officer in charge of each boat could estimate with a moderate degree of accuracy the position of each of the other boats at any given momentso long that is to say as the wind held fair enough to allow the boats to steer a given course a copy of this table was then furnished to the officer in command of each boat after which the captain ordered mr flowers to make the best of his way to barbadoes with instructions to report the loss of the frigate immediately upon his arrival with a request to the senior naval officer that a craft of some sort might be forthwith despatched in search of the other boats similar instructions were next given to me except that my port of destination was bermuda of course we each carried a written as well as a verbal message to the senior naval officer of the port to which we were bound and equally of course it was impressed upon us both that if we happened to encounter a friendly craft en route and could induce her to undertake the search it would be so much the better having received these instructions and taken young lindsay out of the launch which was a trifle overcrowded i at once made sail and parted company the occupants of the other boats giving us the encouragement of a farewell cheer as we did so they also making sail at the same time on a westsouthwesterly course which would afford them about an even chance of being picked up by a craft either from bermuda or barbadoes while in the event of their being found by neither they stood a very good chance of hitting off one or another of the leeward islands for the remainder of that night we sped gaily onward with the wind about two points free making splendid progress although i am bound to admit that with the height of sea and the strength of wind that still prevailed there were moments when the task of sailing the boat became exciting enough to satisfy the cravings of even the most exacting individual lindsay and i relieved each other at the tiller watch and watch with one hand forward to keep a lookout ahead and to leeward the rest of the poor fellows being so thoroughly worn out by their long spell at the pumps that rest and sleep was an even more imperative necessity for them than it was for us by the time of sunrise the wind had dwindled away to a topgallant breeze with a corresponding reduction in the amount of sea we were therefore enabled to shake out the double reef that we had thus far been compelled to carry in our canvas while the aspect of the sky was more promising than it had been for several days past the weather was now as favourable as we could possibly wish the wind being just fresh enough to send us along at top speed gunwaleto under whole canvas while the sea was going down rapidly but as the day wore on the improvement in the weather progressed just a little too far it became even finer than we wished it the wind continuing to drop steadily until by noon we were sliding over the long mountainous swell at a speed of barely four knots with the hot sun beating down upon us far too ardently to be pleasant needless to say we kept a sharp lookout for a sail all through the day but saw nothing the flyingfish that sparkled out from the ridges of the swell and went skimming away to port and starboard gleaming as brilliantly in the strong sunlight as a handful of new silver dollars being the only objects to break the solitude that environed us by sunset that day the wind had died completely out leaving the ocean a vast surface of slowmoving glassy undulations and i was reluctantly compelled to order the canvas to be taken in the masts to be struck and the oars to be thrown out then indeed as the night closed down upon us and the stars came winking one by one out of the immeasurable expanse of darkening blue above us the silence of the vast ocean solitude that hemmed us in became a thing that might be felt so oppressive was it that as by instinct our conversation gradually dwindled to the desultory exchange of a few whispered remarks uttered at lengthening intervals until it died out altogether while the profound stillness of air and ocean seemed to become accentuated rather than broken by the measured roll of the oars in the rowlocks and the tinkling lap of the water under the bows and along the bends of the boat we pulled four oars only instead of six in order that we might have two relays or watches who relieved each other every four hours the men pulled a long steady easy stroke of a sort that enabled them to keep on throughout the watch without undue fatigue by taking a five minutes spell of rest about once an hour but it was weary work for the poor fellows after all and our progress soon became provokingly slow about three bells in the middle watch that night as i half sat half reclined in the sternsheets drowsily steering by a star and occasionally glancing over my shoulder at the ruddy glowing sickle of the rising moon then in her last quarter we were all suddenly startled by the sound of a loud deepdrawn sigh that came to us from somewhere off the larboard bow apparently at no great distance from the boat and while we sat wondering and listening with poised oars the sound was repeated close aboard of us but this time on our starboard quarter accompanied by a soft washing of water and turning sharply i beheld right in the shimmering golden wake of the moon a huge black shapeless gleaming bulk noiselessly upheave itself out of the black water and slowly glide up abreast of us until it was alongside and all but within reach of our oars a whale whispered one of the men in tones that were a trifle unsteady from the startling surprise of the creatures sudden appearance ay replied the man next him and that was another that we heard just now bull and cow most likely i only hopes they havent got a calf with em because if they have the bull may take it into his head to attack us theyre mighty shorttempered sometimes when they have young uns cruisin in company i minds one time when i was aboard the old walrusa whaler sailin out of dundeethat was afore i was pressed another long sighlike expiration abruptly interrupted the yarn and close under our bows there rose another leviathan so closely indeed that unless it was a trick of the imagination i felt a slight tremor thrill through the boat as though he had touched us involuntarily i glanced over the side and it was perhaps well that i did so for there right underneath the boat far down in the black depths i perceived a small faint glimmering patch of phosphorescence that as i looked grew larger and more distinct until in the course of a very few seconds it assumed the shape of another monster rising plumb underneath us back water men back water for your lives there is one of them coming up right under our keel i cried and at the words the men dashed their oars into the water and we backed out of the way just in time to avoid being hove out of the water and capsized this fellow happening to come up with something very like a rush meanwhile others were rising here and there all around us until we found ourselves surrounded by a school of between twenty and thirty whales it was a rather alarming situation for us for although the creatures appeared perfectly quiet and welldisposed there was no knowing at what moment one of them might gather way and run us down either intentionally or inadvertently while there was also the chance that another might rise beneath us so rapidly as to render it impossible for us to avoid him one of the men suggested that we should endeavour to frighten them away by making a noise of some sort but the former whaler strongly vetoed this proposition assertingwhether rightly or wrongly i know notthat if we startled them the chances were that those nearest at hand would turn upon us and destroy the boat we therefore deemed it best to maintain a discreet silence and in this condition of unpleasant suspense we remained floating motionless for a full halfhour the whales meanwhile lying as motionless as ourselves when suddenly a stir seemed to thrill through the whole herd and all in a moment they got under way and went leisurely off in a northerly direction to our great relief we gave them a full quarter of an hour to get well out of our way and then the oars dipped into the water once more and we resumed our voyage at daybreak the atmosphere was still as stagnant as it had been all through the night the surface of the ocean being unbroken by the faintest ripple save where about a mile away broad on our starboard bow the fin of a solitary shark lazily swimming athwart our course turned up a thin blue wedgeshaped ripple as he swam there was however a faint scarcely perceptible mistiness in the atmosphere that led me to hope we might get a small breeze from somewherei little cared wherebefore the day grew many hours older at nine oclock i secured an excellent set of sights for my longitudehaving taken the precaution to set my watch by the ships chronometer before parting company with the launchand it was depressing to find after i had worked out my calculations how little progress we had made during the twentyone hours since the previous noon as the morning wore on the mistiness that i had observed in the atmosphere at daybreak passed away but the sky lost its rich depth of blue while the sun hung aloft a dazzling but rayless globe of palpitating fire a change of some sort was brewing i felt certain and i was somewhat surprised that with such a sky above us the atmosphere should remain so absolutely stagnant as the day wore on the thin scarcely perceptible veil of vapour that had dimmed the richness of the sky tints in the early morning gradually thickened and seemed to be assuming somewhat of a distinctness of shape i just succeeded in securing the meridian altitude of the sun for the determination of our latitude but that was all half an hour after noon the haze had grown so dense that the great luminary showed through it merely as a shapeless blur of pale watery radiance and within another hour he had disappeared altogether from the overcast sky still the wind failed to come to our help the atmosphere seemed to be dead so absolutely motionless was it and although the sun had vanished behind the murky vapours that were stealthily and imperceptibly veiling the firmament the heat was so distressing that the perspiration streamed from every pore the manipulation of the oars grew more and more languid and at length as though actuated by a common impulse the men gave in declaring that they were utterly exhausted and could do no more and i could well believe their assertion for even i whose exertions were limited to the steering of the boat felt that even such slight labour was almost too arduous to be much longer endured the oars were accordingly laid in we went to dinner and then the men flung themselves down in the bottom of the boat and with their pipes clenched between their teeth fell fast asleep an example which was quickly followed by lindsay and myself despite all our efforts to the contrary when i awoke it was still breathlessly calm and i thought for a moment that night had fallen so dark was it but upon consulting my watch i found that it still wanted nearly an hour to sunset but heavens what a change had taken place in the aspect of the weather during the four hours or so that i had lain asleep in the sternsheets of the boat it is quite possible that had i remained awake i should scarcely have been aware of more than the mere fact that the sky was steadily assuming an increasingly sombre and threatening aspect but awaking as i did to the abrupt perception of the change that had been steadily working itself out during the previous four hours it is not putting it too strongly to say that i was startled for whereas my last conscious memory of the weather before succumbing to the blandishments of the drowsy god had been merely that of a lowering overcast sky that might portend anything but probably meant no more than a sharp thunder squall i now awakened to the consciousness that the firmament above consisted of a vast curtain of frowning murky blackgrey cloud streaked or furrowed in a very remarkable manner from about eastsouth east to westnorwest the lower edges of the clouds presenting a curious frayed appearance while the clouds themselves glowed here and there with patches of lurid fiery red as though each bore within its bosom a fiercely burning furnace the ruddy light of which shone through in places i had never before beheld a sky like it but its aspect was sufficiently alarming to convince the veriest tyro in weatherlore that something quite out of the common was brewing so i at once awoke the slumbering crew to inquire whether any of them could read the signs and tell me what we might expect the newlyawakened men yawned stretched their arms above their heads and dragged themselves stiffly up on the thwarts gazing with looks of wonder and alarm at the portentous sky that hung above them well if we was in the chinese seas i should say that a typhoon was goin to bust out shortly observed one of thema grizzled mahogany visaged old salt who had seen service all over the world but he continued they dont have typhoons in the atlantic not as ever ive heard say no they dont have typhoons here but they has hurricanes which i take to mean pretty much the same thing remarked another you are right tom said i thus put upon the scent as it were a chinese typhoon and a west indian hurricane are the same thing under different names a third name for them is cyclone and as this threatening sky seems to remind dunn so powerfully of a chinese typhoon depend upon it we are going to have a taste of a west indian hurricane or cyclone i have read somewhere that they frequently originate out here in the heart of the atlantic if were agoin to have a typhoon or a hurricane or a cyclone whichever you likes to call itall i say is the lord ha mercy upon us remarked dunn big ships has all their work cut out to weather one o them gales so what are we agoin to do in this here open boat id like to know have you ever been through a typhoon dunn i asked yes sir i have and more than one of em was the reply i was caught in one off the paracels in the old audacious frigateas fine a seaboat as ever was launchedand in less time than it takes to tell of it we was dismasted and hove down on our beamends and it took us all our time to keep the hooker afloat and get her into hongkong harbour and the very next year i was catched againin the bashee channel this timein the lively schooner of six guns we knowed it was comin it gived us good warnin and left us plenty of time to get ready for it so mr barkerthe lieutenant in commandgived orders to send the yards and both topmasts down on deck and rig in the jibboom and then he stripped her down to a closereefed boom foresail but we capsizedreglarly turned turtlewhen the gale struck us and only five of us lived to tell the tale as to this here boat if a hurricane anything at all like them chinee typhoons gets hold of her why we shall just be blowed clean away out o water and up among the clouds and thats just whats goin to happen if signs counts for anything wherewith the speaker thrust both hands into his trouser pockets disgustedly spat a small ocean of tobaccojuice overboard and subsided into gloomy silence it was a sufficiently alarming retrospect in all conscience to which we had just listened and the prophetic utterance wherewith it had been wound up while powerfully suggestive of a highly novel and picturesque experience in store for us was certainly not attractive enough to cause us to look forward to its fulfilment with undisturbed serenity nevertheless i did not feel like tamely giving in without making some effort to save the boat and the lives with which i had been entrusted so i set myself seriously to consider how we could best utilise such time as might be allowed us in making some sort of preparation to meet the now confidentlyexpected outburst i looked over our resources and found that they consisted in the main of eight oars two boathooks two masts two yards three sails half a coil of twoinch rope that some thoughtful individual had pitched into the boat when getting her ready for launching half a coil of ratline and two large balls of spun yarn due to the forethought of the same or some other individual a painter some ten fathoms long and the boats anchor together with the gratings stretchers and other fittings belonging to the boat and a few oddments that might or might not prove useful was it possible to do anything with these after considering the matter carefully i thought it was the greatest danger to which we were likely to be exposed seemed to me to consist in our being swamped by the flying spindrift and scudwater or by the breaking seas and if we could by any means contrive to keep the water out there was perhaps a bare chance that we might be able to weather the gale and after a little further consideration i thought that what i desired to do might possibly be accomplished by means of the boats sails which were practically new and made of very light but closely woven canvas that ought to prove watertight so having unfolded my ideas to the men we all went to work with alacrity to put them to the test of actual practice of course it was utterly useless to think of scudding before the gale our only hope of living through what was impending depended upon our ability to keep the boat riding bowson to the sea and to do this it became necessary for us to improvise a sea anchor again this was easily done by lashing together six of our eight oars in a bundle three of the blades at one end and three at the other with the boat anchor lashed amidships to sink the oars somewhat in the water and give them a grip of it a span made by doubling a suitable length of our twoinch rope was bent on to the whole affair and the boats painter was then bent on to the span when the apparatus was launched overboard and our sea anchor was ready for service our next task was to cut the two lugsails adrift from their yards the mainsail was then doubled in half and one end spread over the fore turtleback and drawn taut over this outside the boat and under her keel we then passed a length of our twoinch rope girding the boat with it and confining the fore end of the sail to the turtleback when with the aid of one of the stretchers we were able to heave this girth rope so taut as to render it impossible for the sail to blow away but before heaving it taut we passed a second girthrope round the boat over the after turtleback next connecting both girthropes together by lengths of rope running fore and aft along the outside of the boat underneath the edge of the top strake the doubled mainsail was then strained taut across the boat and its edges tucked underneath the fore andaft lines outside the boat the foresail was treated in the same way but with its fore edge overlapped by about a foot of the after edge of the mainsail our girthropes were then hove taut with the finished result that we had a canvas deck covering the boat from the fore turtle back to within about six feet of the after one the edges of the sails were next turned up and secured by seizings on either side and our deck was complete but as it then stood i was not satisfied with it for at the after extremity of it there was an opening some six feet long and as wide as the boat through which a very considerable quantity of water might enterquite enough indeed to swamp the boat and with our canvas deck lying flat as it then was there was no doubt that very large quantities of water would wash over it and pour down through the opening should the sea run heavily our deck needed to be sloped upward from the forward to the after end of the boat so that any water which might break over it would flow off on either side before reaching the opening to which i have referred we accordingly laid the boats mainmast along the thwarts fore and aft amidships and lashed the heel firmly to the middle of the foremost thwart then by lashing our two longest stretchers together we made a crutch for the head or after end of the mast to rest in when by placing this crutch upright in the sternsheets against the backboard we were able to raise the mast underneath the sails until it not only formed a sort of ridgepole converting the sails into a sloping roof but it also strained the canvas as tight as a drumhead rendering it so much the less liable to blow away while it at the same time afforded a smooth surface for the water to pour off and it also possessed the further advantage that it gave us a little more headroom underneath the canvas deck or roof this completed our preparationsnone too soon for it was now rapidly growing dark and the light of our lantern was needed while putting the finishing touches to our work our task accomplished we of course at once extinguished our lantern for candles were scarce with usand we then for the first time became aware of the startling rapidity with which the night seemed to have fallen for with the extinguishment of the lantern we found ourselves enwrapped in darkness so thick that it could almost be felt this however proved to be only transitory for with the lapse of a few minutes our eyes became accustomed to the gloom and we were then able not only to discern the shapes of the vast pile of clouds that threateningly overhung us but also their reflections in the oilsmooth water the latter made visible by the dull ruddy glow emanating from the clouds themselves which was even more noticeable now than it had been before nightfall and which was so unnatural and appalling a sight that i believe there was not one of us who was not more or less affected by it it was the first time that i had ever beheld such a sight and i am not ashamed to confess that the sensation it produced in me was for a short time something very nearly akin to terror so dreadful a portent did it seem to be and so profoundly impressed was i with our utter helplessness away out there in midocean in that small frail boat with no friendly shelter at hand and nothing to protect us from the gathering fury of the elementsnothing that is to say but the hand of god andi say it with shamei thought far too little of him in those days not the least trying part of it all was the painful tension of the nerves produced by the suspensethe enforced waiting for the awful ordeal that lay before us there was nothing for us to do nothing to distract our attention from that awful threatening sky that looked as though it might momentarily be expected to burst into a devastating flame that would destroy the world some of the men indeed frankly avowed that the sight was too terrible for them and crept away under the canvas where they disposed themselves in the bottom of the boat and strove to while away the time in sleep at lengthit would be about the close of the second dogwatchwe became conscious that the swell which had almost entirely subsided was gathering weight again coming this time out from the northwest at first the heave was only barely perceptible but within half an hour it had grown into a succession of long steep undulations running at right angles athwart the old swell causing the boat to heave and sway with a singularly uneasy movement and frequent vicious jerky tugs at her painter then we noticed that the cloudswhich had hitherto been motionless or so nearly so that their movement was not to be detected were working with a writhing motion as though they were chained giants enduring the agonies of some dreadful torture while the awful ruddy light which they emitted glowed with a still fiercer and more lurid radiance lighting up the restlessly heaving ocean until it burned like the flood of phlegethon anon there appeared a few scattered shreds of smoky scud speeding swiftly athwart the fiery canopy and almost immediately afterwards with a low weird wailing sound there swept over us a scurrying blast that came and was gone again in a second it came out from the northwest and judging that this was probably the direction from which the gale itself would come we at once rigged out over the stern one of the two oars remaining in the boat and swept the bows of the gig round until they pointed due northwest scarcely had we accomplished this when a second scuffle came whistling down upon us from the same direction and before it had swept out of hearing astern there arose a low moaning to windward that increased in strength and volume with appalling rapidity the sky suddenly grew black as ink ahead a lengthening line of ghostly white appeared stretching along the horizon ahead and bearing down upon us with frightful speed the moan grew into a deep thunderous howling roar and from that to a yell which might have issued from the throats of a million fiends in torment the white wall of foam and the yelling fury of wind struck us at the same instant and the next thing i knew was that i was lying flat in the sternsheets hatless and with my face stinging as though it had been cut with a whip while the boat trembled and quivered from stem to stern with the scourging of wind and water and the spray blew in a continuous sheet over the opening above me and into the sea astern not a drop falling into the boat the longexpected hurricane was upon us and now all that remained was to see how long our frail craft could withstand the onslaught of the terrific forces arrayed against her chapter four we fall in with and capture a schooner the air was thick with scudwater so thick indeed that it was like fog it being impossible to see farther than some twenty fathoms from the boat this scudwater swept horizontally along in a perfect deluge and stung like shot when by way of experiment i exposed one of my hands to it as for the wind it was like an invisible wall driving along it was simply impossible to stand up against it it scourged the surface of the ocean into a level plain of white froth which was torn away and hurled along like a shower of bullets our sea anchor fortunately maintained a sufficient hold upon the water to keep the gig riding head to wind but that was as much as it could do with the painter strained taut for its whole length the boat was driving away to leeward sternfirst at a speed ofaccording to my estimatefully seven miles an hour and it was perhaps a fortunate thing for us that such was the case for had we been riding to a sea anchor powerful enough and sunk deep enough in the water to have held us nearly stationary i believe we should have been swamped within five minutes of the outburst of the hurricane even as it was and despite all the precautions that we had taken to make our canvas covering perfectly secure the wind tugged at it and beat upon it with such vehement fury that i momentarily expected to see it torn bodily off the boat and go driving away to leeward in tatters probably the thorough soaking that it almost instantly receivedand which caused the fabric to shrink up and strain still tighter than it was beforemay have had something to do with the stubborn resistance that it offered to the gale be that as it may it held intact and to that circumstance i attribute the fact that the gig was not instantly swamped but no woven fabric however stoutscarcely wood itselfcould long withstand such a furious pelting of scudwater as our sails were now enduring and in about ten minutes the water began to drip through first in single drops here and there then in a few small streams that rapidly increased in number until there seemed in the thick darkness to be hundreds of them for in endeavouring to avoid one stream we only succeeded in encountering two or three more to add to the unpleasantness of the situation it was impossible for us to light the lantern for although we were sheltered from the direct violence of the gale by the canvas the wind somehow managed to penetrate beneath creating quite a formidable little scuffle there and easily frustrating all our efforts to obtain a light and very soon we had another annoyance to contend with in the shape of a gradual accumulation of water in the boat whether caused by a leak in the hull or by the drainage of the water through the canvas we knew not but it obliged us to have recourse to baling which proved to be a singularly awkward operation in such cramped quarters and such pitchy darkness the first mad fury of the outburst lasted for about threequarters of an hourit seemed a perfect eternity to us in our condition of overpowering suspense but i do not believe it was longer than three quarters of an hour at the utmostand then it subsided into a heavy gale of wind and the sea began to get up so rapidly that within another hour we were being flung hither and thither with such terrific violence that in a very short time our bodies were covered with bruises while some of the men actually became seasick and now too a new danger threatened us for as the sea rose it commenced to break and it was not long ere we had the seas washing in rapidly increasing volume over the boat and pouring down through the opening over the sternsheets this kept us baling in good earnest not only with our solitary bucket but with hats and boots as well to save the boat from being swamped and the bitterest hardship of it all was that there was no relief not a moments intermission throughout the whole of that dreadful interminable night we were in continuous peril of death with every breath that we drew every second saw us trembling upon the verge of eternity and escaping destruction as by a constantly recurring succession of miracles it was a frightful experience so frightful that language is utterly powerless to describe it the most eloquent pen could do no more than convey a poor feeble and miserably inadequate idea of the terror and suffering of it no one who has not undergone such an experience can form the remotest conception of its horrors all things mundane have an end however sooner or later and at length the welcome light of day once more made its appearance piercing slowly and with seeming reluctance through the dense canopy of black storm torn cloud and flying scud that overhung us and then we almost wished that it had remained night so dreary and aweinspiring was the scene that met our aching gaze the heavens gave no sign of relenting the sky looked wild as everalthough the awful ruddy glow had long since faded out from the cloudswhile the ocean seemed to be lashed and goaded by the furious wind into an endless succession of rushing mountain waves every one of which as it swept with hissing foamwhite crest down upon us seemed mercilessly bent upon our destruction as i stood up and gazed about mefor i could do so now by leaning well forward against the windit seemed a marvellous thing to me that the gig continued to live through it for light and buoyant though she was every sea she met swept her from stem to stern and it was plain enough to us all now that it was nothing but the canvas covering that saved her as it was we shipped so much water that it was as much as three of us could dothat being all who could work in the opening at one timeto keep her from filling to add still further to our misery we were one and all by this time dead tired worn out in fact with the terror and anxiety of the past night yet we dared not yet attempt to seek the comfort and refreshment of sleep for our critical situation continued to demand our utmost watchfulness and our unremitting exertions and when at length we sought to renew our strength by means of a meal the grievous discovery was made that the whole of our small stock of ships bread was spoiled and rendered uneatable by the salt water and as though this misfortune was not in itself sufficiently serious when we sought to quench our thirst we discovered that the bung of the waterbreaker had somehow got out of the bunghole allowing so much salt water to mingle with our small stock of fresh that the latter had been rendered almost undrinkable our first gleam of hope and encouragement came to us about half an hour before noon that day when our anxious watching was rewarded by the appearance of a small momentary break in the sky low down toward the horizon to windward it showed but for a moment and then was lost again but presently a wider and more pronounced break appeared which did not vanish on the contrary it widened until presently a fitful gleam of wan and watery sunshine pierced through it and lighted up the bleak desolate expanse of raging ocean for a few seconds and almost simultaneously with the welcome appearance of this transient but welcome gleam of pallid sunshine we became aware of a slight but unmistakable diminution in the fury of the gale a change productive of such profound relief to us worn out as we all were by longprotracted toil and anxiety that we actually greeted it with a feeble cheer nor was the hope thus aroused fallacious for from this moment the sky began to clear until within a couple of hours the stormclouds had all swept away to leeward leaving the sky a clear pure blue streaked here and there it is true with a tattered trailing streamer of pinky grey that however soon vanished and once more we revelled in the glorious warmth and radiance of the unclouded sunlight while the wind dropped so rapidly that but for the sea which still ran with dangerous weight we might have made sail again by sunset as it was we were all so completely worn out that i think we were really thankful for an excuse to leave the boat riding to her sea anchor a few hours longer while we sought and obtained what was even more necessary to us than food and drinksleep all actual danger was by this time past so we arranged that each of us should keep a look out for an hour while the rest slept there being sufficient of us to carry us through the night at this rate and i undertook to keep the first look out that hour was i think the longest sixty minutes i had ever up to then experienced for now that constant watchfulness was no longer necessary to insure our safety the incentive to watchfulness was gone and overtaxed nature craved so vehemently for repose that the effort to remain awake was absolutely painful i continued however to perform the task that i had undertaken and when my hour had expired flung myself down in the sternsheets where i instantly sank into a profound and dreamless sleep having first of course aroused young lindsay and cautioned him to maintain a bright lookout for passing shipsa caution which i gave orders should be passed on from man to man throughout the night when i awoke i found that i had maintained all through the night the precise attitude in which i had flung myself down to sleep some hours before it appeared to me that i had not stirred by so much as a hairs breadth all through those hours of unconsciousness i awoke spontaneously with the light of the sun shining strongly through my still closed eyelids the first thing after that of which i became conscious was that the boat was rising and falling easily with a long steady swinging motion then i opened my eyes and immediately noticed that the sun was some two hours high a very soft warm gentle breeze fanned my cheek and the only audible sounds were the snores and snorts of many sleepers near me mingling with the gentle lap of water along the boats planking all hands save myself were sound asleep i was not greatly surprised at this though naturally a trifle vexed that my orders as to the maintenance of a lookout had not been more strictly observed but it was not until i had risen to my feet and flung an inquiring glance round the horizon that i realised how miserably unfortunate this negligence had been for there away in the western board distant some fourteen miles gleamed the sails of a large ship and a more intent scrutiny revealed the tantalising circumstance that she was steering such a course as had undoubtedly carried her past us about an hour before daybreak at a distance of little more than three miles and had a proper watch been maintained we could have intercepted and boarded her without difficulty whether she happened to be a friend or an enemy was a matter of very secondary import just then in our miserable plight as regarded our stock of provisions and water our situation was such that even to have fallen into the hands of the enemy would have been better than to be left as we were i at once roused all hands and we forthwith went to work to cut adrift the sails that had served us so well and to bend them afresh to the yards while the others hauled aboard our sea anchor cut its lashings adrift and took to the oars with the object of going in pursuit of the distant sail for there was yet a chance for us if we could keep her in sight long enough there was just a possibility that some one or another of her crew working aloft might cast a glance astern and catch sight of our tiny sail when he would at once recognise it as that of a boat and report it when if the skipper happened to be a humane man he would assuredly heaveto and wait for us to close so we all went to work with a will and soon had the boat all ataunto once more and in pursuit of the stranger as fast as oars and sails together could put her through the water but the experience of the first hour sufficed to demonstrate beyond all question the hopelessness of our attempt to overtake the ship she was leaving us rapidly and unless someone aloft happened to sight us our prospects of rescue so far as she was concerned were not worth a moments consideration the men partially restored by their nights sound sleep toiled like tigers at the oars in their anxiety to prolong the chance of our being sighted to the latest possible moment frequently relieving each other but it was all of no avail strive as they would the stranger steadily increased her distance from us until after we had been in pursuit of her for fully three hours the heads of her royals sank below the western horizon and we lost her for good and all then the men sullenly laid in their oars declaring that they were worn out and could do no more then they began to savagely inquire among themselves who was the individual to whose culpable carelessness we were all indebted for our present disappointment the culprit was soon discovered in the person of a little welshmanthe man whose watch followed lindsays this man declared that he had remained awake throughout his watch and had duly called his successor before resuming his slumbers but there was some reason to doubt this statement and even if it happened to be true he was still culpable according to his own showing for he was obliged to confess that he had not waited to assure himself that his successor was properly awakened but had satisfied himself with a single shake of the sleepers shoulder accompanied by the curt announcement that it was time to turn out and had then flung himself down and gone to sleep as for the man whom the welshman was supposed to have awakened he disclaimed all responsibility upon the ground that if called at all which he did not believehe had been called so ineffectively as to be quite unconscious of the circumstance at the conclusion of the inquiry his comrades were so furiously incensed with the welshman for his culpablealmost criminalneglect that they seemed strongly disposed to take summary vengeance upon him and it needed the exertion of all my authority to protect the fellow from their violence which broke out anew when at noon we went to dinner and were compelled to make out the best meal we could upon raw salt beef washed down with water so brackish that we could scarcely swallow it reduced to such a condition as this it will scarcely be wondered at that i should be brought to something very nearly approaching despair when my observations that day revealed the disconcerting fact that thanks to our excessive drift during the gale we were still fully six hundred miles from our port of destinationa distance which we scarce dared to hope might be covered even under the most favourable circumstances in less than five days but it soon appeared as though even this protracted period of privation and exposure was to be increased for as the afternoon wore on the wind still continuing to drop grew so light that our speed dwindled down to a bare three knots by the hour of sunset and by midnight it had still further fallen to such an extent that our sails became useless to us and the oars had once more to be resorted to the return of daylight found us in the midst of a stark calm under a cloudless sky out of which the sun soon began to dart his scorching beams so pitilessly that the task of pulling shortly became a labour little less than torture to people in our exhausted condition indeed so severe did the men find it that after persevering until about four bells in the afternoon watch they gave it up declaring themselves to be quite incapable of further exertion and thus for the remainder of the day we lay motionless upon that oilsmooth sea under the blistering rays of the burning sun with our tongues cleaving to our palates as we began to experience the first fierce torments of unquenchable thirst for our supply of waterall but undrinkable as it waswas growing so short that it became imperatively necessary to husband it with the most jealous care and to reduce our allowance to the very smallest quantity upon which life could possibly be sustained the men sought to forget their sufferings in sleep disposing themselves in the bottom of the boat under the shelter of the now useless sails but i was far too anxious to be able to sleep for i began to realise that our boat voyage threatened to develop into an adventure that might easily terminate in a ghastly tragedy half an hour before sunset i called the men and we went to supper and with the going down of the sun the oars were once more thrown out and we resumed our weary voyage all hands of us being equally anxious to avail ourselves to the utmost of the comparatively cool hours of darkness to shorten as much as possible the distance that still intervened between us and deliverance all through the hot and breathless night we toiled in an unspeakable agony of thirst and when morning once more dawned out of a brilliant and cloudless sky my companions presented so wild and haggard an appearance with their cheeks sunken with famine and their eyes ablaze with the fever of thirst and starvation that they were scarcely recognisable half an hour after sunrise we partook of our loathsome breakfast of putrid meat and nauseous water and then composed ourselves to sleepif we could through the long hours of the blazing day maintaining however a one man hourly watch in order that we might be duly warned of any change in the weather and late that afternoon a change camea change of so welcome a character that i believe i may without exaggeration say it saved our lives for about noon when i was aroused by the man on watch to get the meridian altitude of the sun for the determination of the latitude i observed a bank of purplegrey clouds gathering in the southwestern quarter their rounded edges as sharply denned as though they had been cut out of paper there was no mistaking their character they portended a thunderstorm and a thunderstorm we had about four oclock that afternoon of truly tropical violence there was not a breath of wind with it but it brought us a perfect deluge of rainthrice welcome and blessed rainpouring from the overcharged clouds in sheets of warm water soft and sweet as nectar we let not a drop escape us that it was possible to save we saw that it was coming and prepared for it by spreading the sails across the boat and caught the welcome stream in the depressions that we had arranged for its reception drinking out of the hollowed canvas until we could drink no more then as the rain still continued to fall we did a desperate deed we threw away every drop of our drinking water in the hope of being able to refill our breakers with the sweet fresh rainwater and we were successful god in his infinite mercy allowed the floodgates of heaven to remain open until we had filled every available receptacle at our disposal and then the rain ceased the storm drifted away to the north eastward and the sun disappeared below the horizon in a blaze of cloudless splendour but our sufferings were not yet over for now that the hellish torments of thirst were assuaged the pangs of hunger assailed us with redoubled fury hourly growing in intensity until sometime during the night while lindsay and i were asleep and the boat was in charge of one of the menthey became so utterly unendurable that in a fit of madness the famished crew fell upon the slender remainder of our stock of eatables devouring the whole at one fell swoop except lindsays and my own portion which despite their famished condition they loyally set aside for us another day of breathless calm another twelve hours of scorching heat under the rays of the pitiless sun and then with nightfall the men once more threw out their oars and resumed the heartbreaking task of shortening by a few miles the still formidable stretch of ocean that lay between us and safety but nothing that we could say would induce a single one of them to accept ever so small a share of the provisions that they had apportioned as the share belonging to lindsay and myself they declared that their last meal had so far satisfied and reinvigorated them that they were no longer hungry while one or two of them spoke hopefully of the possibility that they might catch a fish or two on the morrow it was somewhere about ten oclock that night that we detected the first symptoms of another change in the weather the first subtle indication that the long period of calm which had so nearly destroyed us was about to end and best of all the indication was of such a character as permitted us to indulge the hope that although the calm was about to give way to a breeze we were likely to be favoured with weather fine enough to permit of our pursuing our voyage under the most favourable conditions this symptom of approaching change merely consisted in the gathering in the heavens of a thin veil of mottled fineweather cloud just dense enough to obscure most of the lesser stars and render the night rather dark while a few of the brighter stars peeped through the openings between the clouds at tolerably frequent intervals permitting us to steer our course without having recourse to the lantern or compass the prospect of a coming breeze seemed to cheer the men and endow them with renewed vigour for they gave way with something like a will while they occasionally went so far as to exchange a muttered ejaculation of encouragement one with another it happened to be my trick at the yokelines until midnight i having relieved young lindsay at four bells i was sitting in the stern sheets with my eyes intently fixed upon a particularly bright star that gleamed out through the clouds at frequent intervals right over the boats nose at an altitude of about thirty degrees above the horizon and which i had consequently selected as a suitable guide to steer by it is a curious fact wellknown to sailors that an object can be better seen on a dark night at sea by looking at the sky slightly above or to one side of it rather than directly at it hence it was that as i kept my eye intently fixed upon the star immediately ahead i suddenly became aware of the presence of a small dark object some three points on our starboard bow i immediately looked straight at it but could then see nothing whereupon i looked into the sky rather above the point where i knew it to be when i again caught sight of it to make quite sure i sheered the boat some four points off her course when it became quite distinct although only as a small black shapeless shadow against the dark sky immediately ahead i held up my hand warningly to the men and at the same moment gave the order oars the men somewhat wonderingly instantly obeyed staring hard at me inquiringly while two or three who were lying down in the bottom of the boat trying unavailingly to sleep raised themselves upon their elbows as though to ascertain what was the matter lads said i in low cautious tones not a sound for your lives there is a small craft of some sort out there becalmed and it is my intention to run her alongside but we cannot of course tell whether she is a friend or an enemy so i think it will be well for us to get alongside without attracting the attention of her crew if we can manage it if she proves to be a friend well and good but if she is an enemy we must take her at all costs for we are in a starving condition as you are all aware while we are still five days distant from bermuda and i do not believe we could possibly live to reach the island without provisions so muffle your oars as well as you can have your cutlasses ready and i will put you alongside hush not a sound that craft is a good three miles away but sounds travel far on such a night as this and we must not allow the crew of her to discover that we are in their neighbourhood now muffle your oars and we will soon find out who and what she is without a moments hesitation the men forthwith proceeded to muffle their oars with portions of their clothing and in another five minutes we were heading for the small dark blot when we had been pulling silently for about a quarter of an hour a small thin sound came creeping across the water to us that within another five minutes had resolved itself into the strains of the marseillaise played upon an accordion and sung by a fairly good tenor voice to which several others were almost instantly added that was sufficient the craft whatever else she might be was assuredly french and we were relieved of the anxiety of approaching a vessel uncertain as to whether she was friend or foe the song was sung through to the end with great enthusiasm and then after a slight pause another song was started also french so far as could be made out it was cut short however before a dozen bars had been reached by a hoarse gruff voice loudly demanding in clear unmistakable french what in the name of all the saints the singer meant by arousing all hands at that hour of the night with his miserable braying this rendered assurance doubly sure and we proceeded with increased cautionif that were possiblelaying in all but a single pair of oars with the double object of resting the men as much as possible prior to the attack and at the same time approaching our quarry slowly enough to allow her crew to coil away about the decks and go to sleep again if they would paddling slowly and with the utmost circumspection taking care that the oars entered and left the water without the slightest splash we were a full hour and more traversing the distance that separated us from the stranger but long ere we reached her we had made her out to be a schooner of somewhere about one hundred and forty tons and by her taunt spars as well as by the fact of her being where she wasnicely in the track of our homewardbound west indiameni judged her to be a privateer when first discovered she must have been lying nearly broadsideon to us but the swing of the swell gradually slewed her as we stealthily approached until she presented her stern fairly at us affording us an admirable opportunity to get alongside her undetected and this we did gliding up under her starboard quarter and alongside and actually climbing in on deck over her low bulwarks before the alarm was raised then from the neighbourhood of the wheel there suddenly arose a muttered execration in french followed by a sharp inquiry in the same language of who goes there british i answered in the inquirers own lingo surrender or we will drive every man of you overboard the british ah sacrrre yes monsieur oh yes we surrender gurgled the man as i seized him by the throat and threatened him with my cutlass while lindsay led the hands forward to the forecastle there were a few drowsily muttered ejaculations in that direction quickly succeeded by a volley of execrations a scuffling of feet the slamming of the hatch over the forescuttle and lindsay sang out that the schooner was ours even as he did so two figures in rather scanty clothing rushed up on deck through the companion and before i could fully realise what was happening one of them snapped his pistol at me while the other aimed a blow at my head with a sword fortunately the bullet missed me finding its billet in the body of the man whose throat i still grasped while i managed to catch the blow of the other fellow on my own blade and in a moment we were at it hammer and tongsthat is to say the swordsman and myself the other fellow making a dash at me now and then aiming fierce blows at me with the buttend of his pistol until in selfdefence i seized my opportunity and cleft his skull with my cutlass at the same instant that i launched out with my left hand and sent his companion reeling to the deck with a blow planted fairly between the eyes at this moment young lindsay came rushing aft with half a dozen of our fellows at his heels to know what was the matter so bidding a couple of the men to securely bind the prisoners i descended the companion ladder with lindsay at my heels to see whether there were any more frenchmen to be fought there were not however the close stuffy little cabin was empty so we went on deck again and leaving two men to keep watch and ward at the after end of the ship went forward where i personally superintended the operation of effectually securing the crew who we afterwards passed down into the hold the cook however we left free and being ravenously hungry gave him orders to at once light the galley fire and cook us the best meal the ship could afford all hands taking the keen edge off our appetites meanwhile by munching some excellent biscuits that lindsay discovered snugly stored away in the pantry our next care was to hoist in the gig that had served us so well and this done we settled down to wait for our dinner and the breeze that promised to come ere long chapter five we proceed in search of the altheas boats he wind came away about an hour and a half before sunrise a gentle breeze out from the northeast coming down to us first of all in the form of a few wandering catspaws that just wrinkled the oilsmooth surface of the ocean and were gone again and finally settling into a true breeze that fanned us along at a speed of some four knots the schooner proving to be a fairly speedy little vessel long ere this however i had carefully thought out a line of action for myself in order that when the wind came i might be prepared for it it will be remembered that before parting company with the launch i had been furnished by the master with a table showing the relative speeds of the various boats and from that moment i had with the assistance of the table carefully calculated the supposed position of each boat at noon so that i now knew to within a few miles where any particular boat ought to be looked for upon the assumption that all had gone well with them and somehow i thought it had i was very strongly impressed with the belief that the gale which we had encountered had not extended far enough to the southeast to reach the launch and the rest of the squadron flowers it might have overtaken but my observations upon the bearings of the centre of the storm and its direction led me to entertain a very strong hope that the rest of the boats had escaped this being so i determined to act upon the assumption that they had done so and to proceed in search of them in the direction where they ought upon that assumption to be found of course with their different rates of sailing they would now be strung out in a fairly long line and the question that exercised me most strongly was whether i should first seek the leading boat and having found her dodge about in waiting for the others or whether i should first seek the dinghy and having found her run down the wind in the track of the others the direction from which the wind might happen to spring up would necessarily influence my decision to a great extent but when it came away out from the northeast and i discovered that the schooner could fetch upon an easy bowline the spot where the sternmost boat might be expected to be found i hesitated no longer but at once made up my mind to first look for the dinghy as the morning wore on the breeze freshened somewhat and the schooners speed increased to fully seven knots i employed the early part of the forenoon in satisfying myself that the prisoners were properly securedtaking the precaution to have them all put in irons as in the exhausted condition of my own crew i could not afford to run any unnecessary risksand as soon as i had eased my mind of that anxiety i personally investigated the condition of the schooners storeroom to my great joy i discovered that we possessed an ample supply of provisions and water together with a liberal quantity of wines spirits and other luxuriesenough of everything in fact to maintain the whole of the survivors of the althea upon full allowance for at least a month the schooner moreovershe proved to be the susanne privateer of saint malowas nearly new a stout substantially built little craft of one hundred and thirtyfour tons register as tight as a bottle well found and armed with six long sixpounders in her batteries with a long ninepounder mounted on a pivot on her forecastle and her magazine nearly full nothing of any importance happened either on that day or the next except that the sky gradually became overspread with those peculiar patches of fleecelike clouds called tradecloudsshowing that at length we had hit off the northeast trade winds that seemed to have been evading us for so long according to my reckoning and upon the assumption that the wind would now hold fairly steady we ought to hit off the track of the boats about six bells in the morning watch on the third morning after the capture of the schooner which would allow us some eleven hours of daylight in which to prosecute our search and to give ourselves the best possible chance of finding the objects of our quest i took care on the preceding midnight to haul the schooner as close to the wind as she would lie so that there should be no possibility of hitting upon their track to leeward instead of to windward of them and so running away from instead of after them and at six bells on that morning i was called in accordance with previous instructions in order that i might work up the reckoning to the very last moment and so make certain of getting as accurately as possible upon the track my calculations now showed that it would be nearly eight bells instead of six before we should reach the imaginary line for which we were making and at a quarter to eighthaving previously sent a hand aloft to take a careful look roundi gave the order to up helm and bear away upon a westsouthwest course and to pack the studdingsails upon the little hooker the menthanks to good feeding and all the rest i could give them consistent with the maintenance of proper disciplinehad by this time completely recovered from the effects of our boat voyage and were one and all as keen as needles on the lookout for the boats from the moment that we squared away the watch all but the helmsman taking to the riggingwithout any orders from meimmediately that they had finished breakfast and disposing themselves upon the royal and topgallant yards in their eagerness to catch the earliest possible glimpse of their shipmates i calculated that at about five bells in the forenoon watch we ought to overtake the dinghythe slowest boat in the fleetand as that moment drew near our anxiety reached a most painful pitch the men on the yards straining their eyes to the utmost as they peered intently into the distance from right ahead to broad on either beam carefully and slowly scanning the horizon for the little blot of gleaming canvas that should proclaim the success of our quest but the fateful moment came and went leaving the horizon a blank noon arrived and i secured an excellent observation for my latitude by means of which i was enabled to check my previous dead reckoning which tallied to within less than a mile of what it ought to be and still there was no sign of the missing boat although my calculations showed that we had overrun by some fifteen miles the spot where we expected to find her i hailed the yards inquiring whether there was any possibility of our having run past the dinghy without observing her but the men assured me that they had maintained so bright a lookout that had she been anywhere within the boundaries of our horizon they would assuredly have seen her this was rather disconcerting yet i felt that i had no real cause for disappointment the boats might have met with rather fresher winds than i had estimated for in which case the likelihood was that they were still many miles ahead of us my calculations had been based upon the supposition that they had been evenly maintaining the same rate of speed from the moment when we parted with them and i knew that this was in the last degree improbable yet it was the only basis i had upon which to make my calculations for it was impossible for me to judge by the weather which we had ourselves experienced of one thing i felt tolerably well convinced which was that keeping so much farther to the southward than we had done in the gig the other boats would not have met with the calms that had so seriously delayed us and that consequentlyunless they too had been caught in the hurricane that had so nearly proved our destructionthey must be somewhere directly ahead of us as we were then steering there was nothing for it therefore but to keep all on as we were until we found them in this condition of anxiety and suspense we continued to run away to the westsouthwest until sunset without sighting anything and then fearful of running past one or more of the objects of our quest during the nighttime without seeing them i hove the schooner to under foresail and jib with the topsail aback so that we might remain as nearly as possible where we wereexcepting for our lee driftall through the night i also caused three lanterns to be hoisted one over the other from our maintopmast stay as a fairly conspicuous signal pretty certain to attract attention in the event of either of the boats coming within sight of us during the hours of darkness and of course gave the strictest injunctions for the maintenance of a bright lookout all through the night the night passed uneventfully and at daybreak after having first gone aloft and personally but unavailingly examined the horizon and the entire visible expanse of the ocean through the ships telescopean excellent instrument by the waywe made sail again upon the schooner and resumed our search shortly after breakfast i secured an observation for my longitude and having worked out my calculations found that if the boats were still afloat and had continued to steer the course which i had been told they would we must certainly find them that day as on the preceding day the men spent their watch upon the yards maintaining so keen a lookout that even i anxious as i was felt satisfied they would allow nothing to escape them yet the day passed and evening arrived without the discovery of any sign of the missing boats while my anxiety grew more painfully intense with the lapse of every hour of daylight and when at length the night closed down upon us and the stars came winking mistily out from between the driving clouds the conviction came to me that something had gone lamentably wrong and that to continue the search any further in the direction that we had been pursuing would be useless the question was what had happened i could think of but two possible explanations of our failure to find the boats one of which was that they had been fallen in with and been picked up by a passing ship while the other was that they had experienced bad weather which had driven them out of their course if the first explanation happened to be the correct one well and goodour missing comrades were safe but if the second explanation was to account for our nonsuccess in what direction ought we to continue our search the question was a very difficult one to answer with any approach to accuracy but an approximation to the truth might be arrived at i reasoned thus the boats were undoubtedly within the limits of the trade wind when we parted with them and the only disturbing influence that they would be likely to meet with in that region would be that of the hurricane that we had encountered reasoning thus i went below and produced a chart of the north atlanticit was a french one reckoning its longitude from the meridian of paris but that difficulty was to be easily overcomeand upon it i forthwith proceeded to prick off as accurately as the data in my possession would permit first the spot where we had parted company with the other boats secondly our own course and distance up to the moment when the hurricane struck us and thirdly the supposititious course and distance of each of the boats up to the moment when the hurricane would probably strike them the observations i had personally made as to the bearing and course of the centre of the storm had originally led me to the conclusion that the other boats had probably escaped it altogether and now as i went over the matter afresh i could not persuade myself that they had encountered anything worse than a mere fringe of it a breeze strong enough perhaps to compel them to run before it for a few hours but nothing more assuming then this to be the case i calculated as nearly as i could the probable direction of the wind when the gale struck them and the number of hours during which they would be likely to be compelled to run before it pricking off upon the chart their probable whereabouts at the moment when they would be likely to find themselves once more able to head for say saint thomas or saint kitts from this point i laid off a course for the former island and then calculated their probable position on that line at the moment compared this with the position then occupied by the schooner and thus arrived at the new direction in which i ought to seek for them having reached thus far i went on deck set the new course and then with lindsays assistance went over all my calculations again verifying every figure of them luckily for our anxiety the trade wind was now blowing so fresh that on an easy bowline as we were a whole mainsail foresail and topsail with royal and topgallant sails stowed was as much as we could stagger under the little witch dancing along at a good clean eleven knots under this canvas the consequence being that in thirtyeight hours from the moment of bearing up we had reached the spot where i intended that my new search for the missing boats should begin this time however i intended to adopt a course of procedure exactly opposite to that which i had followed while prosecuting my former search then i had gone to windward of the spot when i expected to find the boats and had run down to leeward along the course which i thought it probable they had taken but now my uncertainty as to their precise position necessitated a search over a belt of ocean several miles in width i therefore determined to get well to leeward of the spot where my calculations indicated that i ought to find them and from there work to windward on an easy bowline making stretches of some twentysix miles in length i had already ascertained the height of our royal yard above the sealevel and from that had calculated that a lookout stationed at that elevation would command a circular area having a radius of thirteen miles if therefore i made stretches across a circle of twentysix miles diameter i should practically command a belt of ocean of fiftytwo miles in width and this i deemed sufficient for my purpose accordingly having reached our cruisingground at two bells in the forenoon watch and having one hand on the royal yard as a lookout with two more on the topsail yard by way of additional precaution we made our first reach of thirteen miles in a southeasterly direction then nothing being in sight we tacked and stood to the northward for twenty six miles still nothing in sight so we hove about again and this time reached to the southward and eastward for a distance of twentysix miles continuing our search thus throughout the entire day without success at sunset we hove about again and reaching to the northward until we had arrived at the track which the boats if still afloat would probably pass over we hoveto for the night hoisting three lanterns as before to attract their attention should they happen to arrive within sight of us during the hours of darkness it was some relief to us that the night was tolerably clear with a fair sprinkling of stars and a moon well advanced in her first quarter so that during the first half of the night we had a very fair amount of light i did not keep the lookout men aloft at night deeming it useless as the light althoughas i have saidfairly good was not bright enough to reveal a small object like a boat at a greater distance than some two or three miles and up to that distance it was possible to see really better from the level of the deck than from the more lofty elevation of the yards but i had three men continuously on the lookout at the same time namely one on the jibboom end and one each to port and starboard in the waist we were hoveto on the starboard tack needless to say that although we had these three men thus stationed for the express purpose of keeping a lookout and doing nothing else lindsay and i also kept our eyes well skinned going even to the length of blinding the skylight with an old sail in order that our eyes might not be dazzled by even the dim light of the cabin lamp it happened to be my eight hours in that night and i had taken advantage of the circumstance to turn in early for the anxiety attending upon this dishearteningly fruitless search was beginning to tell upon me and i had suffered for the last night or two from an inability to sleep on this particular occasion however i felt somewhat drowsy and therefore went to my bunk in the hope of getting two or three hours rest and as a matter of fact i did sleep but my rest was so disturbed by frightful dreams of men enduring unheardof suffering in open boats that at length awaking in a paroxysm of horror i turned out and went on deck to find that it was seven bells and that under any circumstances i should have been called in another halfhour the moon was within a very short time of setting when i reached the deck and i stood watching her halfdisc creeping insensibly nearer and nearer to the horizon lighting up the sky that way with a soft mysterious brownishgreen light and casting a long tremulous wake of ruddy gold athwart the tops of the running surges lindsay was standing beside me yawning the top of his head nearly off poor lad for although he too was anxious as to the fate of those who we were seeking his anxiety had not thus far interfered with his rest and his watch was now so nearly up that he was quite ready for the four hours sleep that awaited him i was in the very act of telling him that as i should not go below again he might turn in if he chosemy eyes being all the while fixed upon the setting moonwhen suddenly almost immediately under the luminary i caught a momentary glimpse of a small black objectsmall as a pinheadas it were hoveup on the back of a sea against the luminous sky stopping short in what i was saying i sprang to the rail and from thence into the main rigging half a dozen ratlines of which i ascended in order to gain a horizon clear of the run of the nearer seas from this elevation i again looked out instinctively shading my eyes under my hand and in another moment i had again caught sight of the object and not only so but had also detected an intermittent flashing as of the moonlight off the wet blades of oars a boat a boat i shouted in the fulness of my delight hurrah lads we have one of them at last let draw the jibsheet fill the topsail up helm there my man and let her go broad off as i rapidly issued these orders i swung myself out of the rigging and running to the binnacle took the bearing of the moon allowing half a point to the northward of her as the course to steer for the boat where is the gunner i shouted pass the word for mr robbins here i am sir answered robbinsfor my words had thrilled through the little craft like an electric shock and already the watch below were scrambling up through the hatchway carrying their clothing in their hands in their eagerness to get a glimpse of the newly discovered boat mr robbins said i have the goodness to clap a blank cartridge into one of the guns and fire it as an encouragement to those poor fellows out there they will guess by our firing that we have seen them ay ay sir answered robbins shambling away with alacrity upon his errand and a few minutes later one of our guns rang out what i hoped would prove a thricewelcome message to our shipmates somehow i never for a moment doubted that it was one of the frigates boats that i had seen i felt as sure of it as though we had her already alongside although of course i could form no sort of surmise as to which of them it would prove to be it took us but a very few minutes to run down to the boat when judging our distance we roundedto and laid the topsail aback so close to windward of the little craft that one of our people was able to heave a ropesend into her and we hauled her alongside then to our supreme disappointment we discovered that it was not either of the boats that we were looking for but the longboat of a merchantman with eleven people in her all of whom were in a very wasted and exhausted condition partly from famine and partly from wounds most of them being swathed about the head or limbs with bloodstained bandages concealing our disappointment as well as we could we helped the poor creatures up over the sidediscovering during the process that the rescued party were our fellowcountrymenand then having removed everything from the boat that promised to prove of the slightest value we cast her adrift having no room on our decks for her meanwhile the unhappy strangers being too weak to stand had sunk down upon the deck pointing to their parched throats and feebly gasping the word water in response to which appeal some of our own people had gone to work under my supervision to supply them cautiously with small quantities of water slightly dashed with brandy this treatment had a wonderfully stimulative and revivifying effect upon them so much so indeed that they managed to stagger to their feet and earnestly beg for food this of course we supplied them with forthwith in the form of ships bread broken small and softened by steeping in weak brandy and water i gave them this pending the preparation of a more substantial and appetising meal by the cook and it was perhaps well that circumstances obliged me to do so for i afterwards learned that the administration of a solid substantial meal to people in their famished condition would probably have had fatal results having satisfied to some small extent their first ravenous craving for food and drink we got them below and provided them with such makeshift sleeping accommodation as the resources of the schooner would permit that they might seek in sleep such further recuperation as was to be obtained pending the production of the meal in preparation for them having thus disposed of the rescued men nothing remained for us but to await with such patience as we could muster the return of daylight to enable us to resume the search for the lost frigates boats it was nearly noon next day ere any of the rescued party appeared on deck the first to do so being a fine sailorlylooking man of some forty or fortyfive years of age who introduced himself to me as captain tucker of the late british barque wyvern of bristol outwardbound to the west indies with a general cargo of considerable value he informed me that all had gone well with him until eight days previously when about noon a strange sail was sighted in the south western board standing to the northward closehauled on the starboard tack you may be sure said tucker that i kept a sharp eye upon her for i knew that for every honest merchantman that i happened to meet down here i was likely to meet with a dozen rogues in the shape of picaroons privateers or other craft of the enemy or even our own men owarno offence meant to you in saying so mr courtenay but you know sir as well as i do that some of our menowar treat british merchantmen pretty nearly as bad as if they were enemies boarding them and impressing all their best men and leaving them with so few hands that if they happen to meet with bad weather its ten chances to one of their being able to take their ship to her destination well knowing this i kept both eyes on the stranger which i soon made out to be an uncommonly smart and heavy brigantine that closehauled as she was seemed to be travelling three feet to our one she had a particularly wicked look about her that i didnt half like and i liked it still less when having drawn well up on our larboard beam at a distance of some five miles i suddenly discovered that she was edging away for us we were already under stunsails so i could do no more in the way of making sail but we mounted eight brass ninepoundersvery pretty pieces they were tooso i had them cleared away and loaded in readiness for the worst for i took her to be a french or spanish privateer and i had no notion of yielding my ship to any such vermin without making a fight for it and my own lads were quite of the same mind as myself not liking the idea of being locked up for years in a french or a spanish prison well sir that brigantine came bowling along at such a pace that within half an hour of the time when i noticed her to be edging down for us she was within gunshot and no sooner was this the case than yawing broad off for a moment she pitched a shotan eighteenpounder i took it to beacross our forefoot as a polite hint to us to heaveto but i wasnt in the humour for heavingto just then so i hoisted my ensign and kept all on as i was going i expected that seeing this the brigantine would give us a sight of her bunting and open fire upon us in good earnest but she didnt do either she just kept edging away until in another five minutes she was broad on our larboard quarter running the same way that we were and creeping up with the evident intention of running us alongside seeing this i ordered mr thomson my mate to ram an extra shot down upon the top of those we had already loaded our guns with and to depress the muzzles so that we could fire down upon the brigantines low deck as she ranged up alongside but i tell you sir that i didnt half like the look of things for by this time the craft was so close to us that we saw down upon her decks quite distinctly and she seemed to be full of menswarthy greasy blackbearded cutthroats every one of them if looks went for anything in another minute or so she was within biscuittoss of usso close that we could hear the hissing shear of her sharp stem through the water and the moan of the wind in the hollows of her canvaswhen up jumps a fellow upon her rail and hailed us in what i took to be spanishit wasnt french i know because i can speak a little of that lingoat the same time pointing to his gaffend up to which another ruffian at once began to hoist a black flag so ho thinks i so its pirates we have to deal with eh well that means neck or nothing so here goes and with that i sings out to the mate to throw open the portswed kept them closed until nowand let the rascals have it hot no sooner said than done thomson gave the word the ports were thrown open the ninepounders run out and the next second four of our shot went smashing through the brigantines bulwarks bowling over like ninepins every man that happened to be standing in their way the man on the rail jumped down off his perch as nimbly as if he was scalded and i heard him shout carrrramba or something like it as he waved his hand to the man at the wheel at the same moment the brigantine delivered her broadside and before the smoke had time to clear away i heard and felt the crash of her as she dropped alongside us fair in the waist the next secondso it seemed to me our rail was alive with the dirty garlicsmelling blackguards who came swarming over upon our decks until it seemed that there was no room for more well i had a pair of pistols and a sword and each of our lads had his cutlass and for three or four minutes there was as pretty a fight as youd wish to see going on aboard the old wyvern then while i was doing my best to hold my own against four of the rascals who came crowding round me i got a knock on the head from behind that made me see about a million stars before i dropped senseless to the deck chapter six we find the launch how long i remained unconscious i dont know but it must have been at least half an hour i should say for when at length i came round i found myself lying bound hand and foot on the deck along with such of my crew as had not been killed in the defence of the ship while the wyvern was hoveto under topsails with her hatches off and a regular mob of the dirty greasy spaniards swarming round the main hatchway and hoisting out the cargo that another gang was breaking out down below they had hoisted out all our boats too i soon found and were using them to transfer such goods as they required to the brigantineall that is to say except the longboat which for some reason that i did not then understand was lying unused in the starboard gangway they took their time over the job of picking and choosing from among the stuff that we carried but i noticed that all the while they had a hand aloft on the mainroyal yard keeping a lookout they kept at it until it was too dark to see what they were about and then they left us one boat remaining alongside for fully twenty minutes after the rest had gone while some of her people were busy down below at length however they shoved off as well leaving me and my people lying on the deck trussed up like so many chickens two or three minutes later i heard some orders given immediately followed by the cheeping of blocks and the creaking of yard parralls by which i knew that they were filling upon the brigantine and leaving us i could not understand why they had left us all there alive but bound hand and foot as we were i suspected some villainy however and my first idea was that they had set the barque on fire but i could not detect any smell of burning and then the thought came to me that perhaps they had scuttled her intending us to go down with the ship the idea of either fairly made my blood run cold i can tell you but it stirred me up too and i went to work to see if i could work my hands free i might just as well have tried to fly the scoundrels had made sure work of me and no mistake then i sang out to the others to try if they could work themselves adrift and after a bit first one and then another answered that it was no use they were lashed altogether too securely well lads says i if none of us can work ourselves free im afraid its all up with us for my notion is that those spanish devils have scuttled the ship and if so it wont be so very long before shell founder taking us with her that set the men muttering among themselves and presently the man that was lying nearest me said if you can manage to work your way near enough to me sir for me to get a feel of your lashings with my fingers ill see what i can do towards loosenin of em for yer all right my lad says i i will no sooner said than done i worked and wriggled myself up alongside of him somehow and presently i felt his fingers fumbling about with my lashings this particular chap i ought to tell you was uncommonly clever with his fingers especially in the matter of handling rope and sure enough in about twenty minutes im blessed if he hadnt worked those lashings so loose that i presently managed to slip my hands clear of em altogether the moment that i was free i set to work to chafe my fingers and get the life back into themfor they had lashed me so tight that i had lost all feeling in my handsand as soon as i was able to tell once more that id got a complete set of fingers i whipped a knife out of my pocket and cut the lashings off my feet after which i went the round of the party cutting them adrift as quick as i could then while they were getting the benumbed feeling out of their limbs i swung myself down through the open hatchway to investigate it was as i had feared they had scuttled the ship for already there was something like three feet of water in the hold you may be sure i didnt waste much time down below after making that discovery i just scrambled up on deck again as quick as ever i could and told the men what had happened the barque was bound to go of coursewe could do nothing to keep her afloatso i jumped to the side to see after the boats they were gone all but the long boat which as i told you just now was lying in the starboard gangway i crossed the deck to take a look at her and then saw why the pirates had left her there unused she was stove in on the starboard side her planks being crushed and her timbers broken over a space measuring some six feet by two as she was then she would not float two minutes she would have filled the moment we dropped her into the water but when chips came to overhaul her he had a notion that he could patch her up enough to make her carry us as a matter of fact it rested between that and the whole lot of us drowning for the barque was filling so fast that there was no time for us to put a raft together so the carpenter fetched his tools and went to work there and then the rest of us lending a hand and fetching things as chips sung out for them first of all he gently coaxed the broken timbers and planking back into their places as nearly as he could get them then he got a couple of strips of canvas big enough to cover the hole one of which he dressed with tallow on both sides working the grease well into the fabric then with small flatheaded tacks spaced close together he nailed this first piece of canvas over the hole allowing it plenty of overlap then he took the other piece of canvaswhich was cut an inch larger each way than the first piecetarred it well and strained it tightly over the first piece then he cut a third piece of canvas which he fixed over the hole on the inside of the boat nailing the bottom and two ends of the canvas so that it formed a sort of pocket then he got a lot of oakum which he first soaked in tar and then stuffed into this pocket arrangement until it was packed as tightly as it was possible to pack it this was to keep the broken planks and timbers in place and finally he nailed up the top of the pocket declaring as he flung down his tools that the boat was now ready for hoisting out and it was high time too for by the time that the job was finished the barque had settled to her chainplates and was liable to go down under our feet at any moment accordingly we hooked on the tackles and watching the roll of the ship managed to hoist out the boat and get her into the water without accident then we hurriedly pitched into her a couple of breakers of water and such provisions as we could lay our hands upon and that wasnt much for by this time the cabin was all afloat and the lazarette under waterand tumbled over the side into her i only waiting long enough behind the others to secure the ships papers and the chronometer we shoved off in a hurry i can tell you for while i was securing those few matters that ive just mentioned the poor old hooker gave an ugly lurch or two that told me her time was up and sure enough we hadnt pulled above fifty fathoms away from her when down she went sternfirst our first anxiety was of course as to the carpenters repairing job but we soon found that we neednt greatly trouble ourselves about that there was just a draining of water that somehow worked its way through but a few minutes spell with the baler about once an hour was sufficient to keep the boat fairly dry and comfortable all the same i wasnt very keenly anxious for a long boat voyage in such a craft as that so we shaped a course to the westard hoping to fall in with and be picked up by an outwardbounder of some sort but not a blessed sail did we see for seven mortal days until we sighted your upper canvas last night and pulled so as to cut you off and if you hadnt picked us up i believe we should all have been dead by this time for our provisions soon ran out and when it was too late we discovered that both our breakers were full of salt instead of fresh water such was the tragic story related by the skipper of the illfated wyvern a story that was replete with every element necessary for the weaving of a thrilling romance yet it was told baldly and concisely without the slightest attempt at embellishment told precisely as though to be attacked by pirates to have ones ship rifled and scuttled ones boats stolen and then to be left bound hand and foot on deck to helplessly perish were one of the most ordinary and commonplace incidents imaginable truly they who go down to the sea in ships and do business on the great waters meet with so many extraordinary experiences and see so many strange and unaccountable sights that the capacity for wonder is soon lost and the most astonishing andto shoreabiding folkincredible occurrences are accepted as a matter of course during the whole of that day we continued to make short tacks to windward as before with half the watch aloft on the look out but nothing was sighted and at nightfall we again hoveto maintaining our position as nearly as possible in the same spot until the next morning with the first sign of daylight i sent aloft the keenestsighted man we had on board that he might take a good look round ere we filled upon the schooner to resume our disheartening search so eager was i that when the man reached the royal yard the stars were still blinking overhead and down in the western sky and it was too dark to see to any great distance but the dawn was paling the sky to windward and as the cold weird mysterious pallor of the coming day spread upward and warmed into pinkish grey and from that into orange and from orange to clearest primrose dyeing the weltering undulations of the lowrunning sea with all the delicate shifting tints of the opal i saw the fellow aloft suddenly rise to his feet and stand upon the yard with one arm round the masthead to steady himself against the quick jerky plunges of the schooner while he shielded his eyes with the other hand as he steadfastly gazed into the distance to windward royal yard there do you see anything i hailed eagerly and the sudden ecstasy of renewed hope which sprang up within my breast now fully revealed to me how nearly i had been driven to the confines of despair by the longprotracted nonsuccess of the search upon which i had so confidently entered i aint quite sure sir was the unsatisfactory reply that came down to me its still a trifle dusky away out there but i thought just now thatay there it is again theres something out there sir about six or seven mile away but i cant yet tell for certain whether its a boat or no its somewheres about the size of a boat sir keep your eye on it i answered i will get the glass and have a look for myself so saying i went hastily to the companion removed the ships telescope from the beckets in which it hung there and quickly made my way aloft now said i as i settled myself upon the yard where is the object dye see that long streak of light shootin up into the sky from behind that bank of cloud sir responded the man well its about half a pint or maybe nearer a pint to the southard of that ah i see it ejaculated i as i caught sight for a moment of a small scarcely distinguishable speck that appeared for an instant and then vanished again apparently in the hollow between two waves a few seconds later i caught it again and presently i had it dancing unsteadily athwart the field of the instrument but even then i was unable to definitely settle whether it was or was not a boat as the man at my side had remarked it looked like a boat it was about the size of a boat as seen nearly endon but there was no indication of life or movement about it it seemed to be floating idly to the run of the seas just at this moment the suns upper limb flashed into view over the edge of the cloudbank darting a long gleam of golden radiance athwart the heaving welter to the schooner and i looked again half expecting to catch the answering flash of wet oarblades but there was nothing of the kind to be seen undoubtedly however there was something out theresomething that might prove to be a boatand i determined to give it an overhaul without loss of time so carefully noting its bearing and distance and cautioning the lookout not to lose sight of it for an instant i descended to the deck and straightway gave the necessary orders for making sail and beating up to it the object being nearly dead to windward it was a full hour before we reached it but little more than half that time sufficed to satisfy us that it really was a boat and a further quarter of an hour established the fact that it was none other than the altheas launch but my heart was full of foreboding as i observed that although we fired gun after gun to attract attention there was no answering sign of life to be discovered on board her although from the moment when she became visible from the deck either lindsay or i kept the telescope constantly bearing upon her yet the depth at which she floated in the water showed that she was not empty lindsay suggested that her crew might have been taken out of her by some craft that had fallen in with her and that the reason why she floated so deep was that she was halffull of water but i could not agree with this view there was a buoyancy of movement about her as she rose and fell upon the surges which was convincing proof to my mind that she was loaded down with something much more stable than water at length when we had drawn up to within a cables length of her the man on the royal yard sang out that there were people in her but that they were all lying down in the bottom of the boat and appeared to be dead we shall have to pick her up ourselves said i to lindsay let one hand stand by to drop into her from the fore chains with a ropesend as we bring her alongside lay your topsail aback mr lindsay and let your jibsheet flow if you please and as i sprang up on the rail to con the schooner alongside lindsay gave the necessary orders with the topsail aback and the mainsheet eased well off the schooner went drifting slowly down toward the launch that as we now approached her looked old battered and weatherstained almost out of recognition we steered so as to shave past her close to windward and as she came drifting in under our fore chains the man who was waiting there with a ropesend dropped neatly into her and springing lightly along the thwarts into the eyes of her deftly made fast the rope to the iron ring bolt in her stem then he turned himself and looked at the ghastly cargo that the boat carried and as he gazed he whitened to the lips and a look of unspeakable horror crept into his eyes as he involuntarily thrust out his hands as though to ward off the sight of some dreadful object and well he might for as i gazed down into that floating charnelhouse i turned deadly sick and faint as much at what met my sight as at the horrible odour that rose up out of her and filled my nostrils the boat seemed to be full of dead lying piled upon one another as though they had been flung there yet the first glance assured me that some of those who were on board her on the night when i parted company in the gig were now missing the captain and the doctor were lying side by side in the sternsheets the rest of the illfated party were lying heaped one upon the other or doubled up over the thwarts in the other part of the boat the two masts were standing but the sails were lowered and lay unfurled along the thwarts on top of the oars and boathook there was no trace of food of any kind to be seen and the waterbreakers were without bungs and to all appearance empty so ghastly and repulsive was the sight which the boat presented that our people hung in the wind for a moment or two when i ordered them to jump down into her and pass the bodies up over the side but they rallied at once and followed me when i led the way the skipper and the doctor were both lying upon their faces and as i raised the former and turned him over it is difficult to say which shocked me most whether the startling ease with which i lifted his wasted body or the sight of his withered drawn and shrunken featureswhich were so dreadfully altered that for a moment i was doubtful whether it really was or was not the body of captain harrison that i held in my arms i passed him up out of the boat without difficulty and then did the same with the doctor it struck me that the latter was not quite dead and i sang out to lindsay to get some very weak brandy and water and moisten the lips of each man as he was passed up on deck for if life still lingered in any of them it might be possible to save them even now by judicious and careful treatment ten of our inanimate shipmates we singled out as possibly alive but with the rest the indications of dissolution were so unmistakable that i deemed it best not to interfere with them but to cover the bodies with a sail weight it well down with ballast pigs and then pull the plug out of the boat and cast her adrift after reading the burial service over the poor relics of humanity that she contained that however was a duty that might be deferred until we had attended to those who had been passed up out of her as possibly alive we therefore dropped her under the stern and allowed her to tow at the full scope of a complete coil of line while we devoted ourselves to the task of attempting to resuscitate the other ten as i had suspected the doctor proved to be alive for after diligently painting his blue and shrivelled lips for about a quarter of an hour with a feather dipped in weak brandy and water his eyelids quivered a fluttering sigh passed his lips followed by a feeble groan and his eyes opened fixing themselves upon lindsay and myself in a glassy unrecognising stare water water for the love of god he murmured in a thick dry husky whisper i raised his head gently and rested it against my shoulder while lindsay held the pannikin of weak grog to his lips for a few seconds he seemed to be incapable of swallowing then like a corpse galvanised into the semblance of life he suddenly seized the edge of the pannikin between his clenched teeth as in a vice and held it until he had drained it to the dregs luckily there were but two or three spoonfuls left in it oras he afterwards assured methat draught would probably have been his last ah he ejaculated with a sigh of unspeakable relief nectar nectar give me more adding quickly no no not yet not yet a single teaspoonful every five minutes oh my god what anguish why did i not die is that courtenay or am i dreaming where is the captain i whipped off my jacket and placed it under his head as i allowed him to sink gently back on the deck for at this moment lindsay whispered to me that the captain was coming round and i turned to render what assistance i could captain harrisons eyes were now open but it was perfectly plain to us both that his wandering glances were as yet devoid of recognition and it was not until some ten minutes later that he began to evince some understanding of who we were and what had happened his first inquiry was after the wellbeing of those who had been with him in the boat and to this i felt constrained to give an evasive but encouraging reply as he was so terribly weak that i feared the effect upon him of a straightforward answer giving the actual state of the matter we got him and the doctor down below and put them to bed as quickly as possible and by the time that this was done the other eight poor souls had also been successfully brought round when they too were conveyed below and made as comfortable as circumstances would permit this done we disposed of the dead with all due reverence and then resumed our search to windward with renewed hope arising out of the happy discovery of the launch it was drawing well on toward eight bells in the afternoon watch that day when the man whom i had stationed in the cabin to keep an eye upon the captain and the doctor came up on deck with the news that both were now awake and that the captain wished to see me i at once obeyed the summons and was greatly rejoiced to find that both of my patients were much stronger and wonderfully the better in every way for their long sleep they lost no time in explaining that they were ravenously hungry whereupon i sent word forward to the galley and in less than five minutes both were busily engaged in disposing of a bowl of strong broth prepared from two of the small remaining stock of chickens that we had found on board the schooner when we took her the moment that the soup had disappeared the captain began to ask me questions in reply to which i gave him a succinct account of our adventures from the moment when we parted company from the rest of the boats and when i had finished he paid me a high compliment upon what he was pleased to term the skill and judgment that i had displayed throughout he then recounted what had befallen the launch from which i learned that the entire flotilla of boats had remained togetherthe faster boats accommodating their pace to the slower craftuntil caught in the tailend of the hurricanewhich with them only reached the strength of a moderate galewhen they were perforce compelled to separate from which time the launch had seen none of the others again it appeared that the launch deeply loaded as she was suffered very nearly as much as we in the gig did the few in her who were capable of doing any work having their hands full in keeping her above water the sea had broken over them heavily all but swamping them upon several occasions and destroying the greater part of their provisions so that within three days after the cessation of the gale they found themselves without food and face to face with starvation then followed a terrible story of protracted suffering ending in many cases in madness and death of fruitless effort to work the heavy boat and finally of utter helplessness despair andoblivion the captain informed me that he had little hope that any of the other boats had outlived the gale but believed that if they were still afloat they would be found some forty miles or so to the northward and eastward of where we had fallen in with the launch in that direction therefore we continued our search scouring the whole ocean thereabout over an area of fully one hundred miles square but we found none of the other boats and at length when we had been cruising for a full week the captain who by this time was rapidly regaining strength reluctantly gave the order for us to desist and bear up for jamaica and i may as well here mention that none of the other boats were ever again heard of there being little doubt that they all foundered during the gale chapter seven a daring act of piracy the captain having thus sorrowfully and reluctantly abandoned all hope of finding the missing boats at once became keenly anxious to reach port royal with all possible expedition in order that the painful business of our trial by courtmartial for the loss of the frigate might be got over without delay we therefore carried on night and day and so smartly did the little schooner step out that on the seventh day after bearing up we found ourselves at daybreak within sight of turks island running in for the windward passage before the rather languid trade wind most of the people were by this time getting about once more so that with our own men and the wyvern party our decks looked rather crowded and as we went below to breakfast the captain remarked upon it expressing his satisfaction that the time was so near at hand when we could exchange our cramped quarters aboard the schooner for the more roomy ones to be found in the kingston hotels or the houses of the hospitable jamaica planters we were still dawdling over breakfast in the close stuffy little cabin of the schooner when lindsay who was looking out for me poked his head through the open skylight to report that there were two sail aheada ship and a brigantinehoveto in somewhat suspicious proximity and that captain tuckerwho had been aloft to get a better view of the strangersdeclared his belief that the brigantine was none other than the piratical craft the crew of which had pillaged and destroyed the wyvern how do they bear mr lindsay demanded the captain straight ahead sir answered lindsay and how far distant was the next question about ten miles sir replied lindsay and what are we going at the present moment asked the captain lindsay withdrew his head from the skylight to glance over the rail and then replaced it again to answer a bare five sir i should say the wind seems to be growing more scant shall i heave the log sir no thank you answered the captain i have no doubt your judgment is nearly enough correct for all practical purposes mr lindsay let a hand be sent aloft to keep an eye on the strangers and tell him to report anything unusual that he may see i shall be on deck myself in a few minutes excusing myself i slipped up on deck to have a look at the two craft the upper canvas of which was visible above the horizon directly ahead of us as lindsay had said the one was a fullrigged ship while the other was a fine big brigantine both were hoveto and in such close proximity that the merest tyro might shrewdly guess at what was going on there just beyond the horizon but to make assurance doubly sure i took the ships glass and went up on the topgallant yard from whence i was able to obtain a full view of them it was as i had expected boats were passing rapidly to and fro between the two craft those which left the ship being heavily laden while those which left the brigantine were light i was still aloft working away with the telescope when the captain emerged from the companionway and at once catching sight of me hailed well mr courtenay what do you make of them it is undoubtedly a case of piracy sir i replied the brigantine is rifling the ship and the latter has all the appearance of a british west indiaman whew i heard the skipper whistle as he walked to the rail and looked thoughtfully down at the foam bubbles that were gliding past our bends if she is an indiaman she will have passengers aboard her he remarked to the doctor who at that moment joined him the doctor seemed to acquiesce although he spoke in so low a tone that i could not catch his words the two stood talking together for a few minutes and then the captain hailed me again what do you judge our distance from those two craft to be mr courtenay he asked a good eight miles sir i should say answered i thank you mr courtenay you may come down sir returned the skipper which i took to be a hint that he wanted me i accordingly slung the glass over my shoulder swung myself off the yard on to the backstay and so descended to the deck did you notice whether they seemed to have more wind than we have inquired the captain as i joined him pretty much the same sir i should think answered i it looks as though it would fall calm before long i am afraid not no such luck remarked the skipper cocking his weather eye skyward and carefully studying the aspect of the heavens i fervently wish it would then we could nab that fellow beautifully with the boats might we not try sir as it is inquired i eagerly we have enough peoplethat is counting the wyverns men who i have no doubt would all volunteer i hastened to add as my eye fell upon three or four of those whom we had taken out of the launch and who what with starvation and their still unhealed wounds looked more fit for a hospital than for boat duty thank you mr courtenay answered the skipper with a smile evidently reading my unspoken thoughts no i am afraid it would not do in the first place i question whether we really have sufficient men to justify such an attempt and in the next place if we had it would still be desirable in my opinion to defer the attempt until we are much nearer at present nobody can tell what we are the schooner is such a small affair that i am in hopes the brigantine will take no notice of us until we are within striking distance of her while if i were to send the boats away she would probably make off at once no it is rather trying to the patience to remain idly aboard here drifting along at this snails pace but i am convinced that it is the correct thing to do perhaps if we show only a few men about the decks the brigantine may be tempted to tackle us ah if only she would sir i ejaculated with such intensity of feeling that the captain laughed why i declare you are developing into a regular fireeater he exclaimed think of the passengers sir some of them women most likely i said i am thinking of them sir answered the captain through his clenched teeth and with a sudden glitter in his eye that foreboded evil to the brigantines people should we be fortunate enough to get within striking distance of them i turned away and walked forward to where i saw black peter the whilom servant of the midshipmens mess aboard the althea he was one of those whom we had found still alive in the launch and he had picked up wonderfully since then having become almost his old self again he was lounging on the forecastle near the port cathead with his bare brawny arms crossed on the rail as he gazed ahead at the two craft with which we were slowly closing peter said i get the grindstone ready and green get the cutlasses up on deck and give them a thorough good sharpening we may want them by and by ay ay sir answered green with a grin as he shambled away to get the weapon while peter bestirred himself with alacrity to prepare the grindstone for its work by drawing a bucket of water and pouring it into the trough a few minutes later peter his eyes gleaming with excitement and every one of his ivories bared in a broad grin of delight was whirling the handle round at a furious speed as green and another hand stood on either side of the stone each pressing a bare blade to its fiercely buzzing disc we continued to drift along at an exasperatingly slow pace before the languid breeze until we had arrived within about four miles of the two craft when the skipper gave orders to clear the decks and cast loose the guns but he instructed me that the galley fire was not to be extinguished and the magazine opened until the last moment apparently he had his doubts as to the probability of the brigantine attacking us and if so his doubts were soon confirmed for when we had reduced the distance by another mile the lookout aloft reported that the brigantine was filling away and in another minute or two she turned her stern to us rigged out her studdingsail booms and went off before the wind setting her studdingsails as she went ah ejaculated the captain it is as i feared she smells a rat and does not mean to wait for us hoist out the gig at once mr courtenay and pull for your life to that ship too probably it is a case of the wyvern over again and if there are any people left aboard her they must be saved let the men go fully armed but do not take more than the boats proper complement as you are not likely to have any fighting to do while you may want all the room in the boat that you can spare we were by this time moving so slowly that it was unnecessary to heave to in order to hoist out the gig no time therefore was lost in getting her into the water and within five minutes of the issuing of the order by the captain we were afloat and away from the schooner with the mena picked crew consisting of the strongest and smartest men in the shipbending their backs as they drove the beautifully modelled boat at racing speed through the water we had barely got away however before i detected light wreaths of smoke curling up between the masts of the distant ship and at the same moment i observed that although her mainyards were still braced aback she seemed to be no longer hoveto for as i watched her bows fell off until she was nearly before the wind and she went drifting slowly away to leeward sometimes heading in one direction and sometimes in another yawing about all over the place with a difference of fully four points on either side of the general direction in which she was driving this was most exasperating as although she was drifting slowly she was still drifting and that too in the same general direction that we were steering thus prolonging the time that must necessarily elapse ere we could overtake her while it would greatly increase the expenditure of energy on the part of the oarsmen to enable us to get alongside give way with a will men i cried the rascals have not only set fire to the ship but they have also cast loose her wheel so that she is now running away from us to leeward the harder you pull the sooner shall we catch her and the better chance will there be for us to put out the fire and remember for aught that we know her crew may be lying there upon her deck bound hand and foot utterly helpless to roast alive unless we can get alongside in time to save them this appeal was not without effect upon the men hard as they had been pulling they now put out every available ounce of strength they possessed their brawny muscles standing out like ropes upon their bare arms while the perspiration literally poured off them and the stout ash blades bent like wands as they all but lifted the gig clean out of the water at every stroke we tore along over the low oillike ridges of the swell at the speed of the dolphin leaving the schooner as though she were at anchor yet to my eager impatience our headlong pace seemed to be little better than a crawl for the light wreaths of smoke that i had seen winding lazily upward from the ships hull and twining about her spars increased in volume with startling rapidity while it momentarily grew darker in colour until within ten minutes of its first appearance it had become a dense cloud of duncoloured smoke completely enveloping the ship in the heart of which long forking tongues of flickering flame presently appeared they had apparently set fire to the poor old barkie in at least half a dozen places and she was burning like matchwood pull men pull i cried or we shall be too late she is well alight even now and in another quarter of an hour she will be a blazing furnace if she goes on at her present rate heaven above if there are people aboard her what must their feelings be now a groan of sympathy burst from the men in response to this ejaculation of mine and they tugged at the oars with a strength and energy that filled me with amazement we were coming up with the ship hand over hand but fast as the boat flew the fire grew still faster and presently i saw the flames climbing aloft by way of the welltarred shrouds until they reached the sails when there arose a sudden blaze of flame among the spars and in two or three minutes every shred of canvas had been consumed and the crawling tongues of fire were circling about the masts and yards feebly at first but steadily increasing until they were all ablaze meanwhile the ship deprived of her canvas gradually fell broadsideon to the wind and from that position as gradually drifted round until she lay bowson to us by this time we were within threequarters of a mile of her and now that she was no longer driven to leeward by her sails we neared her rapidly but my heart sank within me as i watched her for the destruction of her sails which i had at first thought a fortunate circumstanceinasmuch as she no longer blew away from usi now recognised as a dreadful happening for stationary as she now lay on the water the light draught of wind had full power to fan the fire that raged aboard her and by the time that we drew up under her bows and hooked on to her bobstay she was a roaring mass of flames from stem to stern i shinned up the bobstay and so got on to her bowsprit and from there made my way into her head but i could go no farther for the fore part of her deck was a sheet of fire upon which no living thing could exist for more than a few seconds of unspeakable torment and even where i stood the heat was all but unendurable i could not see very far aft for the flames and smoke her forescuttle was open and a pillar of flame roared out of it as from a chimney on fire and some ten feet abaft it was her foremast ablaze from the deck to the truck and immediately abaft it again was the blazing framework of what had shortly before been a deckhouse beyond that i could see nothing one thing was quite certain and that was that if there were living people still aboard herwhich i could not believe possiblethey must be aft and it was there that we must seek them so i scrambled down into the gig again and ordered the men to back off and pull round under the ships stern they lost no time in obeying my order and it was well for us all that they exhibited so much alacrity for as we swept round and gave way an ominous cracking and rending sound was heard aboard the ship and a moment later her blazing foremast toppled over and fell with a crash into the sea missing the gig by a bare boathooks length look out for the other masts theyll be comin down too in a jiffy sang out one of the men and they all pulled for their lives but the alarm was a false one the main and mizzen masts standing for full ten minutes longer but when we got under the ships stern it became perfectly clear that no living thing could be aboard her for she was even more fiercely ablaze aft than she was forard the whole of her from the mainmast to the taffrail being a veritable furnace of roaring flame with tongues and jets of fire leaping from her cabin windows and from every port and scuttle it was impossible to board her in this direction it would have simply been an act of suicide to have attempted it even her outside planking right down to the waters edge was so hot that it was unbearable to the touch and it was beyond all doubt that if those fiends in the brigantine had left the crew or any portion of them on board the unhappy creatures must have perished long ere we had reached the illfated craft i therefore took a note of her namethe kingston trader of bristoland reluctantly gave the word to haul off to a safe distance to wait until the schooner should run down and pick us up this occurred about a quarter of an hour later and the moment that the gig was fairly clear of the water we crowded sail after the brigantine but fast as the schooner was the pirate craft easily ran away from us and by sunset had vanished below the horizon nothing further of importance happened to us until our arrival at port royal which occurred on the evening of the following day when we just saved the last of the sea breeze into the harbour the captain went ashore and reported himself that same night dining with the admiral afterwards but i did not go ashore until late the next day as there was a great deal of business that i had to attend to captain harrison was of course most anxious that our trial by courtmartial for the loss of the frigate should take place as speedily as possible because he could not hope for another command until that was over and it happened by a quite exceptional piece of luck that there were enough ships in the harbour to allow of its being held at once it was consequently arranged to take place on board the flagship on the fourth day following our arrival it was of course only a formal affair the loss of the frigate being due to causes quite beyond our control unless indeed we had chosen to run from the two french ships instead of fighting themso it was soon over and before noon we were all honourably acquitted and our sidearms returned to us with much congratulatory handshaking on the part of the officers present captain harrison the doctor lindsay and i were invited to dine with the admiral at his pen that evening and we accordingly drove out with the last of the daylight arriving at the house just as the sun was setting over hunt bay the admiral was the very soul of hospitality and we were therefore a large party several officers from up park camp and a sprinkling of civilians being present to take off the salt flavour likely to prevail from a too exclusive gathering of the naval element as our host laughingly put it somewhat to my surprise i found myself the lion of the evening captain harrison having most generously made the utmost of my exploit in capturing the french schooner and my subsequent search for the frigates boats and so many compliments were paid me that being still young and comparatively modest i had much difficulty in maintaining my self possession and making suitable replies after dinner and while the rest of us were chatting and smoking over our wine the admiral apologising for being obliged to temporarily absent himself withdrew taking captain harrison with him they were absent for nearly an hour and when they returned there was noticeable in the skippers manner a subdued but joyous exultation that told of good news i did not however learn what it was until we had left the pen and were driving back to our hotel in kingston by the dazzling silver radiance of a tropical full moon and prior to that the admiral had said to me as i bade him goodnight come and see me in my office tomorrow about noon mr courtenay i want to have a talk to you as soon as we were clear of the pen grounds and fairly on our road to kingston the skipper said to me mr courtenay do you happen to have noticed that fine frigate the minerva lying just inshore of the flagship yes sir i have said i she is a beauty and is said to be a wonderful sailer especially on a taut bowline i heard yesterday that her captain is ashore down with yellow fever very true answered the skipper the poor fellow died this morning and the admiral has been pleased to give the command of her to me i congratulate you with all my heart sir said i i thought i could read good news in your face this evening when you returned to the diningroom she is a magnificent vessel and i sincerely hope that you will have abundant opportunity to distinguish yourself in her and i hope sir that you will take me with you thank you courtenay thank you exclaimed the skipper evidently touched by the sincerity of my congratulations if we can only manage to fall in with the enemy frequently enough never fear but i will distinguish myselfif i live as to taking you with me i would do so with the greatest pleasure and as a matter of course were i permitted to have my own way but i believe from what the admiral let drop to me tonight that he has his own plans for you and if so you may rest assured that they will be far more to your advantage than would be your accompanying me to the minerva let me seehow much longer have you to serve before you are eligible for examination only four days more sir i answered with a laugh then i shall go up as early as possible only four days more exclaimed the skipper in surprise i thought it was more like two months only four days i assure you sir repeated i um well i suppose you know best was the answer given in a musing tone to which was presently added so much the better so much the better may i ask sir whether that remark has any reference to me i inquired certainly courtenay certainly there cannot be any possible objection to your asking but i am not bound to answer am i replied the skipper with a laugh no he continued i must not tell you anything except that i have reason to believe that the admiral is very much pleased with your behaviour and that he contemplates marking his approval in a manner which i am sure will be very pleasing to yourself and that was all i could get out of the gallant captain but it was sufficient to cause me to pass a sleepless night of pleasurable speculation prompt to the second i presented myself at the admirals office next morning and was at once shown into the great mans presence morning mr courtenay exclaimed he as i entered bring yourself to an anchor for a minute or two will ye until i have signed these papers then i shall be free to have a talk to you jenkins clear away a chair for mr courtenay the orderly sergeant reverently removed a pile of books and papers from a chair dusted it and placed it near an open window and i amused myself by looking out upon the busy scene in the harbour while the admiral proceeded to scrawl his signature upon document after document there he exclaimed with a sigh of relief as he signed the last one and pushed it away from him thank goodness that job is finished now mr courtenayby the way captain harrison told me last night that he believed you would soon be eligible for your examination is that so yes sir answered i i shall have served my full time in three days more three days exclaimed the admiral is that all i replied that it was and i understand that you are a good seaman and navigator resumed the admiral i suppose you have no fear of failing when you go up for your examination i modestly replied that i had not provided that i was treated fairly and had not a lot of catchquestions put to me just so responded the admiral musingly your navigation i have no doubt is all right he continued and of course you can work a ship when she is all ataunto but suppose you belonged let us say to a frigate and at the end of an engagement you found yourself in command and your ship unrigged what is the first thing you would do i considered for a moment and then proceeded to describe the steps i should take under such circumstances the admiral listening all the time intently but uttering no word and giving no sign of any kind to indicate whether my reply was satisfactory or not until i had finished when he said very good mr courtenay very good indeedon the whole have you ever helped to fit out a ship yes sir answered i i was aboard the poor old althea during the whole time that she was in the hands of the riggers ah he exclaimed and you heartily wished yourself anywhere else than there ill be bound but it has done you good young gentleman you have profited by your experience i can see and will perhaps some day be deeply thankful for the knowledge you then gained now supposing that you found yourself on a lee shore in a heavy gale of wind with all your masts gone what steps would you take for the preservation of the ship and the lives of your crew again i replied at length stating that i should anchor the moment that the ship drifted into a suitable depth of water letting go both bowers backing them up with the sheet anchors and shackling the remainder of the bower cables on to those of the sheet anchors which latter i should then veer away upon to within a few fathoms of the clinch and suppose that having done this your ship dragged or parted her cables what then persisted the admiral then sir said i we could only trust in gods mercy while standing by to take care of ourselves and each other as soon as the ship should strike good exclaimed the admiral a very excellent and proper answer mr courtenay now he continued i have been asking you these questions with a purpose i wanted to ascertain for myself whether i should be justified in sending you away in command of that little schooner that you took so cleverly and i think i shall i believe you will do exactly for the work i have in my mind for you sickness and casualties together have played havoc among the officers on this station of late to such an extent that i have not nearly as many as i want consequently i am only too glad to meet with young gentlemen like yourself who have made good use of their opportunities these waters are swarming with the enemys privateerswith a sprinkling of pirates thrown in it would appear from what the skipper of the unfortunate wyvern says and they must be put downsunk burned destroyed by any means that can best be compassed or better still captured i therefore propose to fit out that little schooner of yours and to place you in command of her for the especial purpose of suppressing these pests and incidentally capturing as many of the enemys merchantmen as you can fall in with now how dye think youll like the job i replied delightedly that nothing could possibly suit me better that i was inexpressibly grateful for the confidence he was about to repose in me and that i would leave nothing undone to prove that such confidence was justified very well then that is settled observed the admiral genially we will have the schooner overhauled at once and made ready for sea as quickly as may be then you can go to sea for a month there will be an examination next month for which you must arrange to be in port and thenhaving passed as i feel certain you willyou shall have your commission and be off to sea again to win your next step chapter eight we capture a spanish indiaman the schooner was turned over to the dockyard people that same afternoon and duly surveyed and on the following day when i presented myself at the admirals office the old boy handed me a list as long as the main bowline setting forth the several alterations deemed necessary to fit the little craft for his majestys service here mr courtenay just run your eye over that list and tell me what you think of it he cried as he passed it to me across the table i ran my eye over it new gang of rigging fore and aftnew bulwarks six feet high fitted with hammock rail etcetera completedeck strengthened by doubling the deckbeamsnew coamings to hatchwaysand so on and so on until my imagination had conjured up a picture of the trim little susanne transmogrified out of recognition and so stiffened and hampered by her extra deckbeams and new rigging that we should have reason to deem ourselves fortunate should we ever succeed in screwing six knots out of her on a bowline the admiral must have beheld my face growing ever longer as i worked my way through this precious list to the end of it for when i had finished it and looked up at him blankly he laughed aloud as he exclaimed why boy what is the matter with you your face is as long as a fiddle oh sir i exclaimed in accents of despair you surely will not allow thosethosedockyard people to completely ruin the poor little hooker by making all these alterations and additions to her she is a new vessel siri understood from the mate of her that this was her first voyage she is as sound and strong as wood and iron can make her and any attempt to further strengthen her can only result in the destruction of her sailing powers then as to those high bulwarks sir what will be the use of them they will not afford us an atom of protection while they will make her sag away to leeward like a barge and this new gang of rigging the admiral again burst out laughing there there he said soothingly as he held up his hand to stop me dont distress yourself any further mr courtenay ill go aboard her myself this afternoon and see how much of this she really requires before signing the order meanwhile go aboard yourself and draw up a list of such alterations and additions as you may think needful and hand it to me when i come down to have a look round i did so and the upshot of it all was that i eventually wheedled the admiral into consenting that the schooner should remain absolutely untouched above the deck the only alterations made in her consisting in an extension of the cabin and forecastle accommodation the enlargement of the magazine and the substitution of iron ballast for the stones which the frenchmen had considered good enough to keep the little hooker on her feet i had some difficulty in gaining my patrons consent to the retention of the low light bulwarks with which the craft was fitted the admiral being strongly of opinion that they ought to be high enough and stout enough to shelter us from musketry fire moreover i think he considered that we looked altogether too rakish and piratical as we then were but i represented to him that under certain conditions this might be advantageous rather than otherwise and in the end the kindhearted old fellow indulgently let me have my way the result of this was that within a fortnight of our arrival we were at sea again with the little shiprechristened by the name of the ternsmelling outrageously of fresh paint to the unmitigated disgust of the thirty six stout fellows who were quartered in her forecastle young lindsay with many apologies to captain harrison elected to unite his fortunes with mine rather than turn over to the minerva and i was also given another lada very quiet ladylike young fellow named christieto bear us both company and do duty as master black peter also came to the conclusion that there would be more scope for his talents aboard the schooner than in the frigate and without asking anybodys leave installed himself unceremoniously and as a matter of course in the position of cabin servant we weighed about five oclock in the evening with the last of the sea breezea very smart handsome privateer schooner named the coquette being in companyand just managed to sneak through the narrow channel between gun and rackum cays when the wind dropped dead and left us in the east channel in the midst of a glassy calm rolling our rails under to the furious swell that came sweeping along past plum point the coquette was within biscuittoss of us and she too was rolling and tumbling about to such an extent that i every minute expected to see her roll her sticks away this lasted for close upon two hours during which the sun went down in a blaze of splendour and lavish magnificence of colour such as i have never beheld outside the limits of the west indian waters then just as the burning glories of the west were fading into sober grey while hesperus beamed softly out with momentarily increasing effulgence in the darkening blue of the eastern sky a gentle breeze came stealing to us off the land to which both schooners with a mutual challenge to each other gladly trimmed their canvas and away we both went hugging the palisades closely for the sake of the smoother water until plum point was passed when we gradually drew away from each other the coquette shaping a course for morant point while i edged away for the island of martinique having formed the opinion that some of the more knowing of the enemys homewardbound merchant skippers might endeavour to slip out of the caribbean between the islands of martinique and dominica in the hope of thereby eluding our cruisers and privateers most of which chose the neighbourhood of the windward passages for their cruisingground by the end of the second dogwatch the breeze had freshened so much that it became necessary to hand our royal and topgallant sail and soon afterwards the wind hauled gradually round until it became the true trade wind piping up to the strength of half a gale and compelling us to haul down a single reef in our big mainsail and two reefs in our topsail under which the little beauty lay down and thrashed through it with all the life and go of a thoroughbred racer the coquette was still in sight some eight miles away to windward and famous as she was for her speed i had the supreme delight of observing that we had headreached upon her to the extent of quite two miles and now we began to discover the great advantage of having exchanged our stone ballast for iron the schooner being not only much stiffer under her canvas but also more lively than before it was grand sailing weather the breeze although strong being perfectly steady while the sea was long and regular allowing the little hooker plenty of time to rise to each as it came rushing down upon her with hissing crest all agleam with sparkling seafire and it was exhilarating to stand right away aft close by the weather taffrail and watch the little beauty as she tore along with breathless speed through the dusky night the sky was clear as a bell save for a few detached fleeces of tradecloud that came swooping along at frequent intervals athwart the stars so that there was plenty of light to see by and it was as intoxicating as wine to merely stand abaft there as i did feeling the strong rush of the wind past me and drinking in its invigorating freshness and coolness as the deck heaved and plunged beneath my feet and the bending masts swayed and reeled to and fro the trucks sweeping long arcs among the dancing stars and the wind piping high and shrill through the rigging as the schooner leaped and plunged irresistibly forward with a storm of spray flashing in over her weather cathead and blowing aft as far as the mainmast at every buoyant upward leap of her to meet the sea while a whole niagara of hissing foamwith an understratum of whirling clouds of lambent green seafirewent swirling past the lee rail at a speed that made one giddy to look at five bells in the first watch saw us fairly abreast at morant point and then as the night was clear and the breeze steady i went below and turned in nothing of any importance occurred during the next few days and carrying on upon the schooner to the last stitch that she could stagger under we arrived off the northern extremity of the island of martinique exactly at midnight on the fifth night after leaving port royal i considered that we had now reached our cruisingground and that there was consequently no need for any further hurry we therefore shortened sail to doublereefed mainsail fore staysail and jibfurling all our square canvasand leisurely passed through the channel between martinique and dominica until we were some sixty miles to windward of both islands when we headed the little hooker to the northward and ratched as far as the latitude of antigua then heaving about and returning over the same ground again the first two days of our cruising proved utterly barren of results but the time was by no means wasted for having sedulously exercised the crew in the working of the guns and in cutlass drill every day during our passage across from port royal i now rigged up a floating target and gave them a little firing practice taking care to have a man on the royal yard to give us timely notice of the appearance of any sail that perchance might be frightened away by the sound of firing and i was soon gratified at the discovery that i numbered among my crew several very fairly clever marksmen it was within a few minutes of sunset on the evening of the third day of our cruise that being again off the northern extremity of martinique and heading to the southward the lookout aloft reported the upper canvas of what looked like a large ship standing out closehauled between that island and dominica i immediately got the ships telescope and went aloft with it being just in good time to catch a glimpse of the royals and heads of the topgallant sails of a ship steering a course that would carry her some six miles to the northward of us having made as sure as i could of her bearing distance and course i descended to the deck and gave orders to wear ship after executing which manoeuvre we hauled down all our canvas and lay in wait for the approaching craft the schooner although under bare poles headreaching at the rate of about two miles per hour i estimated that the distance of the stranger from us was then some twentyfive miles and if she was making a speed of eight knotswhich was a fairly liberal allowanceit would afford us ample time to drift fairly athwart her hawse and this i hoped to do undiscovered as i believed that from the cut of her canvas she was a merchantman belonging to one or another of our enemies and i was most anxious that she should not take fright and bear up for either of the islands involving us in a long sternchase with possibly a cuttingout job at the end of it if she should succeed in reaching the refuge of a harbour the evening was fine with a moderate breeze from about eastnortheast and not very much sea running the swell however was high enough to hide us for at least half the time and although the stars soon beamed forth brilliantly while a thin silver sickle of moon hung high aloft the conditions generally seemed fairly promising for success of course i gave the most stringent orders that no lights whatever should be permitted to show aboard the schooner and i was careful to remain on deck myself to see that these orders were rigorously observed the canvas of the stranger seemed to grow upon the horizon very slowly and the time of waiting for her approach appeared long but at length by four bells in the first watch she had drawn up to within about three miles of us and i gave the word to see all clear for sheeting home and hoisting away at a moments notice for the time had now arrived when if anything like a proper lookout was being kept on board her we might be discovered at any instant but minute after minute passed and she still came steadily on heeling slightly to the steady trade wind and bowing solemnly over the undulating swell with a curl of white foam under her bluff bows that made her appear to be travelling at about three times her actual speed we had by this time forereached athwart her forefoot and were edging along at a pace that promised to place us about half a mile to windward of her by the time that she would be crossing our stern and now i kept the nightglass immovably bearing upon her watching for the sudden yaw that should indicate the discovery of a possible enemy in her path i had by this time made up my mind that she was a spaniard and the mere fact of her adventuring herself thus alone instead of availing herself of a convoy was to me sufficient assurance that she went heavily armed and manned it also suggested the possibility that she might be carrying an exceptionally rich freight it sometimes happening that the skipper of such a ship especially if he chanced to be a man of daring and courage preferred to take his chance of making the voyage alone rather than risk being cut off from the convoy by the swarm of privateers and picaroons that hovered upon its skirts almost from the moment of its sailing to that of its arrival our people were by this time all at their stations with sheets and halliards in their hands ready to sway away at the first word of an order from me and it was not so dark but that i was able to see out of the corner of my eye the nudges and gestures of delight which they interchanged as the great stately indiaman swept at length athwart our stern dark and silent as a phantom up helm and wear her round i shouted all necessity for further concealment being now at an end sheet home and hoist away forard hold on aft with your peak and throat halliards until we are fairly round starboard braces round in trim aft the starboard headsheets now hoist away your mainsail ah they see us at last there she bears away steady there with your lee helm my man do not let her come to just yet keep the chase upon your weather bow she must not be allowed to get to leeward of us mr lindsay just pitch a shot athwart her hawse as a hint that we wish her to heaveto the shot was fired and another and yet a third but the stranger took no notice whatever the object of her captain being apparently to bear away across our bows and so get before the wind when of course the cloud of studdingsails that her rig allowed would afford her a very important advantage over the schooner but i was not going to permit that if i could help it and it soon became perfectly clear that we could the schooner having the heels of the ship although we were soon under the lee of the latter with her sails partially becalming ours at length finding that we could outsail the indiaman i luffed close in under her lee and hailed in the best spanish that i could muster ho the ship ahoy heaveto and strike sir to his britannic majestys schooner tern the only reply to this was a rattling volley of musketry evidently aimed at me as i stood on the weather rail just abaft the main rigging for i heard the bullets whistling all round my head if you dont heaveto sir i exclaimed angrily by heaven i will fire into and sink you schooner ahoy who are you now came a hail in very indifferent english from the ship and in the dim starlight i could just make out the shape of a shadowy figure standing by the mizzen rigging this schooner sir is his britannic majestys schooner tern as i have already had the honour to inform you do you intend to heaveto sir or will you compel me to fire into you i retorted in english this time the figure vanished from the lee rail of the ship without making any reply to my question and annoyed at being treated in this curious fashion i turned my face inward and shouted let her go off a little mr lindsayjust far enough to enable us to fire at his riggingand then see whether a broadside will bring the fellow to his senses i leapt down off the rail and turned to walk aft when the figure suddenly popped into view again aboard the indiaman and shouted no no senor do not fire for the love of god we have several ladies aboard here and i will surrender rather than that they should be hurt i surrender sir i surrender and the next instant i heard the same voice shouting in spanish an order for the crew to lay aft and back the mainyard as the broad mainsail of the ship collapsed and shrivelled into massive festoons to the hauling of the crew upon the clewgarnets buntlines and leechlines preparatory to backing the maintopsail we too shortened sail in readiness to heaveto at the same moment as the prize and five minutes later i found myself with my sword drawn and a dozen stout fellows armed to the teeth at my heels standing upon the quarterdeck of the stranger with a little crowd of welldressed men evidently spaniardscuriously regarding me and my following by the light of a couple of lanterns that someone had placed on the capstan head bueno exclaimed a fine sailorlylooking elderly man all is well they are undoubtedly english and we have therefore nothing to fear and so saying he stepped forward and handed me his sheathed sword as i doffed my hat and held out my hand to receive the weapon i could not help saying pardon senor but may i be permitted to ask an explanation of that remark assuredly noble sir answered the spaniard returning my bow with a dignified grace that excited my keenest envy the explanation is perfectly simple the fact is that when your schooner suddenly appeared just now as though she had risen from the bottom of the sea my first impression was that we had been unfortunate enough to stumble across the path of my detested countryman pedro morillo and i was determined to sink with my ship and all on board her rather than surrender to him and pray senor who is this man pedro morillo of whom you speak and why should he require a countryman of his own to surrender to him and why should you be so very strongly averse to falling into his power demanded i ah senor it is easy to see that you are a stranger to these waters or you would not need to ask for information respecting that fiend morillo answered the spaniard he is a cruel avaricious and bloodthirsty pirate sparing neither man nor woman friend nor foe but little is really known about him senor for those who meet him rarely survive to tell the tale but there have been one or two who by a miracle have escaped him and it is from them that we have gained the knowledge that it is better to perish by his shot than to fall alive into his hands is the vessel by means of which he perpetrates his piracies a brigantine very handsome and wonderfully fast i inquired suddenly bethinking me of poor captain tucker and his story certainly senor that answers perfectly to the description of the accursed guerrilla have you seen her of late but no of course you have not or you would not now be here for morillo is said to be especially vindictive against the english inflicting the most atrocious tortures upon all who fall into his hands in the dim light we at first mistook your schooner for the guerrilla and that is why we fired upon you as we did permit me senor to express my profound regret at my so unfortunate mistake and my extreme gratification that it was not followed by a disastrous result at this compliment we of course exchanged bows once more after which i took the liberty of addressing to this very polite and polished skipper a few questions with regard to his ship coupled with a hint that i was anxious to complete without delay my arrangements for placing a prize crew on board and bearing up for jamaica our prize i then learned was the dona dolores of cadiz a spanish west indiaman of eleven hundred and eightyfour tons register homeward bound from cartagena maracaibo and la guayra with a very valuable general cargo and twentyeight passengers ten of whom were ladies captain manuel fernandezthe skipperwas most polite and anxious to meet my views in every way at least so he informed me he conducted me into the ships handsome saloon and introduced me to his passengersthe female portion of which seemed to be frightened nearly out of their witsand was kind enough to promise me that if it would be agreeable to me the whole of his people should assist my prize crew to work the ship this suggestion however did not happen to be agreeable to me so i was compelled to explain as politely as i could phrase it that my duty compelled me not only to decline his magnanimous offer but to secure the whole of his crew officers and men below and also to remove all arms of every description from the ship after which if he would give me his parole it would afford me much pleasure to receive him as a guest on board the schooner i could see that this was a bitter pill for the haughty don to swallow but i was politely insistent and so of course he had to yield which he eventually did with the best grace he could muster and an hour later the dolores with christie the masters mate in command and ten of our lads as a prize crew was bowling along before the wind with studdingsails set aloft and alow while the tern followed almost within hail it being my intention to escort so valuable a prize into port and thus take every possible precaution against her recapture chapter nine we encounter and fight the guerrilla on the morning but one succeeding the capture of the doloresthe schooner and her prize then being some two hundred and forty miles to the westward of dominicaa sail was discovered at daybreak some twelve miles to the southward and westward of us beating up against the trade wind closehauled upon the starboard tack and a few minutes later she was made out to be a brigantine we paid but scant attention to her at first craft of her rig being frequently met with in the caribbean trading to and fro between the islands but when the stranger almost immediately after her rig had been identified tacked to the northward as though with the intention of getting a closer look at us i at once scented an enemy and possessing myself of the telescope forthwith made my way into the fore crosstrees for the purpose of subjecting her to a rigorous examination wondering meanwhile whether by any adverse chance the stranger might eventually turn out to be the notorious pirate morillo in his equally notorious brigantine the guerrilla i had no sooner got the craft fairly within the field of the instrument than i discovered my conjecture to be correct a score of trifling details of rig and equipment becoming instantly recognisable as identical with similar peculiarities already noticed by me when i before saw the pirate vessel such is the perversity of blind fortune under ordinary circumstances nothing would have pleased me better than to meet this audacious outlaw and his cutthroat crew in a clear sea and to try conclusions with them but now i was hampered with the possession of a valuable prize which i was most anxious to take safely into port while my little force was seriously weakened by the withdrawal of the prize crew which i had been obliged to put on board the dolores it was therefore not wholly without apprehension that under these untoward circumstances i witnessed the approach of the formidable brigantine i would have preferred to have met her if possible upon somewhat more equal terms but there she was doubtless bent upon the capture of the dolores and there was nothing for it but to prepare for her as warm a reception as it was in our power to give i therefore descended to the deck and gave orders to call all hands and clear for action at the same time signalling to christie that the stranger in sight was a pirate and that he was to keep out of harms way during the impending action keeping on upon his course and leaving us in the schooner to deal with the intruder our preparations were soon complete but none too soon for approaching each other as we were at a good pace the space between the brigantine and ourselves narrowed very rapidly nevertheless there was time when all was done to say a few words to the men so as i anticipated that the struggle upon which we were about to engage would be a tough one i called them aft and said my lads you have all heard of the atrocious pirate morillo who haunts these waters you have heard something of his doings from those poor fellows belonging to the wyvern who were picked up by us when we were searching for the altheas boats and you saw for yourselves a specimen of his handiwork in the blazing hull of the kingston trader the unfortunate crew of which ship only too probably perished with her the scoundrel and his gang of coldblooded murderers are aboard that brigantine and after what you have heard and seen i need not tell you what is likely to be the fate of any of us or of those aboard the dolores should we be so unfortunate as to fall into their hands they are undoubtedly about to attempt the capture of the spaniard now it is for you to say whether they shall do so or whether you will send them all to the bottom of the sea instead which is it to be men put us alongside of her mr courtenay sir and well soon show you and them toowhich its to be answered one of the men the rest instantly corroborating the remark by such exclamations as ay ay well give em their gruel never fear well spoke tommy true for you my son and so on very well said i that is the answer i expected now go to your guns men and see that you make every shot tell while clearing for action we had also made sail and shot ahead of the dolores and within five minutes of the moment when the crew went back to their guns we were within half a mile of the brigantine which craft was then crossing our bows tearing through the long low swell like a racing yacht with a storm of diamond spray flashing up over her weather bow at every graceful plunge of her into the trough she was a beautiful vessel long and low with enormously taunt raking masts and a phenomenal spread of canvasa craft well worth fighting for and i thought what a proud day it would be for me if perchance i should be fortunate enough to capture and take her triumphantly into port royal harbour she was now well within range so i sang out to lindsay who was looking after matters on the forecastle to know whether the nine pounder pivot gun was ready all ready sir and bearing dead on the brigantine was the answer then heave a shot across the rascals forefoot at once shouted i and you my man hoist away the ensign at the flash of the gun i continued to the fellow who was standing by the peak signal halliards as the words left my lips there was a ringing report and a smart concussion and springing upon the weather rail i was just in time to see the shot neatly strike the water immediately under the brigantines figurehead the spray from it leaping up and leaving a dark stain upon the foot of her foretopmast staysail well aimed exclaimed i exultantly if you will all do as well as that throughout the fight lads you will soon give a good account of her while i was still speaking there came an answering flash from the brigantine which at the same moment boldly ran up a black flag at her gaffend and ere the report had time to reach us a ninepound shot crashed fair into our bows raking us fore and aft and carrying off the top of our unfortunate helmsmans head as it flew out over our taffrail the poor fellow sank to the deck all in a heap without a groan without a quiver of the body and i sprang to the wheel just in time to save the schooner from broachingto anyone hurt there forard i shouted for i saw two or three men stooping as though to help someone yes sir answered one of the men poor tom parsons have had his chest tore open and i doubt its all over with him you must avenge him then i shouted back load again and give it her between wind and water if you can they were already reloading the gun even as i spoke and a minute later the piece again rang out the shot striking the brigantines covering board fair and square close to her midship port and making the splinters fly in fine style we were now so close to her that we could see that her decks seemed to be full of men and i thought i heard a shriek as our shot struck her reply was almost instantaneous her whole starboard broadside being let fly as she shot into the wind in stays and once more the shotfive ninepounderscame crashing in through our bulwarks filling the air with a perfect storm of splinters but happily hurting no one but myself a large jagged splinter struck me in the left shoulder lacerating the flesh rather badly but one of the men sprang to my assistance and quickly bound it up up helm my man and let her go off until our starboard broadside bears said i to the man who now relieved me at the wheel adding in a shout to the crew stand by your starboard guns and fire as they come to bear upon her bang bang bang our modest broadside of three sixpounders spoke out almost simultaneously i did not see the shot strike anywhere but almost immediately afterwards down came her maintopmast and the peak of her mainsail her mainmasthead had been shot away and the dolores at least was safe for the pirates having lost their aftersail would now be compelled to make a running fight of it before the wind which would enable christie to haul his wind and get out of danger our men raised a cheer at their lucky shot and i determined not to throw away the least advantage gave orders to port the helm and bring the schooner to the wind on the starboard tack so getting the weathergage of the brigantine as we roundedto our antagonist fell off the two craft thus presenting their larboard broadsides to each other and both being ready we fired at precisely the same moment the report of the two discharges being so absolutely coincident that i did not know the brigantine had fired until her shot came smashing in through our bulwarks wounding five men and rendering one of our sixpounders useless by dismounting it so close were we to each other by this time that before we could load again the brigantine had passed astern of us and none of our guns would bear upon her or hers upon us her crew were doing their utmost to keep her close to the wind but with the peak of her mainsail down she would not lay any higher than within about eight points and i determined to take the utmost advantage of her comparatively helpless position while i might for a lucky shot on her part might make her case ours at any moment i therefore signed to the helmsman to put down his helm and at the same moment gave the order ready about helms alee the nimble little schooner spun round upon her heel as smartly as a dancing girl presenting her starboard broadside to the brigantine stand by your starboard broadside and fire as your guns bear shouted i and as we swept round almost square athwart our antagonists stern the sixpounders once more spoke out one shot striking the stern of her fair amidships and smashing her wheel to pieces while the other two took her in the larboard quarter at an angle that must have caused them to traverse very nearly threequarters of the length of her deck before they passed out through her starboard bulwarks the brigantine no longer under the control of her helm fell off until she was running dead before the wind when the pirates trimmed their yards square and a moment later i saw a number of her hands in the fore rigging swarming aloft the moment that her starboard broadside could be brought to bear upon us she fired and the next moment our bowsprit and foretopmast both went the former with the flyingjib towing under the bows while the latter dangled to leeward by its rigging with the royal towing in the water alongside our lads having by this time reloaded the starboard guns again fired hulling the pirate and then by my orders left their guns to clear away the wreck for encumbered as we now were with the jib under the bows and the square canvas hanging over the side the schooner was gradually comingto although her helm was hard aweather this ended the fight for when i next found time to look at the brigantine she had studdingsail booms rigged out on both sides and her people were busy getting the studdingsails upon her while the straight wake that she was making showed that they had already contrived to rig up some temporary contrivance for steering her seeing this i at once hove the schooner to and went to work to repair damages for now that i had had the opportunity to discover the stuff of which senor morillo was made it struck me as by no means improbable that the moment he had repaired his damages he would return and attack us afresh altogether the fight had not lasted longer than some eight or ten minutes at the utmost but during that short time we had lost two men killed outright while sixincluding myselfwere wounded four of them severely christie recognising that his duty was to take care of the prize had hauled his wind when we passed ahead of him and was now about a mile to windward with his maintopsail to the mast but when he saw that the fight was over he filled away and came booming down to us sweeping close athwart our stern and heavingto close to leeward of us as he bore down upon us i saw him in the mizzen rigging speaking trumpet in hand and when he was within hailing distance he hailed to ask if he could be of any assistance adding that one of the passengers professed to be a doctor and had chivalrously offered his services should they be required this was good news to me indeed for being a small craft we carried no surgeon and but for this proffered help our poor wounded lads would have been obliged to trust pretty much to chance and such unskilled help as we could have afforded them among ourselves i hailed back expressing my thanks for the offer and at once sent away a boat for the medico not caring that christie should run the risk of sending away a boats crew out of his own scanty company in about ten minutes the boat returned bringing in her a little swarthy burntup specimen of a spaniard and a most portentouslooking case of surgical instruments but although by no means handsome senor pacheco soon proved himself to be both warmhearted and skilful ministering to the wounded with the utmost tenderness and with a touch as light and gentle as a womans when he had attended to the others i requested him to oblige me so far as to bind up my shoulder afresh which he at once did informing me at the same time that it was an exceedingly ugly wound and that i must be particularly careful lest gangrene should supervene in which case if my life could be saved at the expense of my arm i should have reason to esteem myself exceptionally fortunate he remained on board chatting with me for about an hour after he had coopered me up and very kindly promised to visit me and his other patients again in the afternoon if i would send a boat for him but he declined my invitation to breakfast upon the plea that he had already taken first breakfast while it was still too early for the second he was full of polite compliments and congratulations upon our having beaten off such a desperado as morillo was known to be and graphically described the consternation that had prevailed in the cabins of the dolores when the brigantine was identified as the notorious guerrilla contrary to my expectations and greatly to my relief the pirates did not return to attack us and as a measure of precautionin case the idea should occur to morillo later onas soon as our damages were repaired i stood to the northward and westward all that day shaping a fresh course for morant point at sunset that evening the sun went down in a heavy bank of clouds that had been gathering on the western horizon all the afternoon and slowly working up against the windan almost certain precursor of a thunderstormand as the dusk closed down upon us the wind began to grow steadily lighter until by the end of the first dogwatch the air was so scant as to barely give us steerageway the night closed down as dark as a wolfs mouthso dark indeed that standing at the taffrail i could only barely and with the utmost difficulty trace the position of the main rigging against the intense blackness of the sky as for the dolores we lost sight of her altogether and could only determine her position by the dim uncertain haze of light that faintly streamed above her high bulwarks from the skylight of her saloon or by the momentary gleam of a lantern passing along her decks and blinking intermittently through her open ports this intense darkness lasted only about half an hour however when sheetlightning began to flicker softly low down upon the western horizon causing the image of the shipnow some two miles astern of usto stand out for an instant like a cunningly wrought model in luminous bronze against the ebony blackness of the sky behind her with the settingin of the lightning the last faint breathing of the wind died away altogether leaving us and the spaniard to box the compass in the midst of a glassy calm the sweltering heat of which was but partially relieved by the flapping of our big mainsail as the schooner heaved languidly upon the low swell that came creeping down upon us from the northeast the night seemed preternaturally still the silence which enveloped us being so profound that the noises of the shipthe occasional heavy flap of her canvas accompanied by a rain like pattering of reefpoints the creak of the jaws of the mainboom or of the gaff overhead on the mast the jerk of the mainsheet tautening out suddenly to the heave of the schooner the kicking of the rudder and the gurgling swirl of water about it and along the bendsonly served to emphasise while they broke in upon it with an irritating harshness altogether disproportionate to their volume so intense was the silence outside the ship that one seemed constrained to listen intently for some sound some startling cry to come floating across the glassy water to break it and the suspense and anxiety of waiting despite ones better judgment for such a sound caused the discordant noises inboard to quickly become acutely distressing at least such was my feeling at the time a feeling that possibly may have grown out of the increasing smart of my wound which was now giving me so much pain that i had little hope of getting any sleep that night especially as the heat below was absolutely stifling graduallyso gradually that its approach was scarcely perceptiblethe storm worked its way in our direction the brighter glimmer and increasing frequency of the sheetlightning alone indicating that it was nearing us until just about eight bells in the dogwatch the first faint mutterings of distant thunder became audible while the vast piles of sooty cloud that overhung us seemed momentarily to assume new and more menacing shapes as the now almost continuous quivering of the lightning revealed them to us anon low down in the western sky there flashed out a vivid sunbright stream of fire that distant as it was lighted up the whole sea from horizon to horizon tipping the ridges of the swell with twisted lines of gold and transfiguring the distant dolores into a picture of indescribable fairylike beauty as it brought sharply into momentary distinctness every sail and spar and delicate web of rigging tracery a low deep rumble of thunder followed which was quickly succeeded by another flash nearer and more dazzlingly brilliant than the first and now the storm seemed to gather apace the lightningflashes following each other so rapidly that very soon the booming rumble of the thunder became continuous as did the blaze of the sheetlightning which was now flickering among the clouds in half a dozen places at once bringing out into powerful relief their titanic masses weirdly changing shapes and varied hues and converting the erstwhile cimmerian darkness into a quivering supernatural light that caused the ocean to glow like molten steel and revealed every object belonging to the ship as distinctly as though it had been illuminated by a portfire so vivid and continuous was the light that i not only distinctly saw the fin of a shark fully half a mile distant but was also able to watch his leisurely progress until he had increased his distance so greatly as to be no longer distinguishable the continuous quivering flash of the sheetlightning among the clouds afforded of itself a superbly magnificent spectacle but the beauty of the display was soon still further increased by a wonderfully rapid coruscating discharge of forklightning between cloud and cloud as though the fleecy giants were warring with each other and exchanging broadsides of jagged whitehot steel the thunder that accompanied the discharge giving forth a fierce crackling sound far more closely resembling that of an irregular volley of musketry than it did the deep hollow booming crash that followed the sparklike stream of fire that lanced downward from cloud to ocean a few minutes more and the storm was right overhead with the lightning hissing and flashing all about us and the thunder crackling and crashing and booming aloft with a vehement intensity of sound that came near to being terrifying the whole atmosphere seemed to be aflame and the noise was that of a universe in process of disruption suddenly the schooner seemed to be enveloped in a vast sheet of flame at the same instant that an earsplitting crash of thunder resounded about us there was a violent concussion and when a few seconds later i recovered from the stunning and stupefying effect of that terrific thunderclap it was to become aware that the foremast was over the side and the stump of it fiercely ablaze there was no necessity to pipe all hands for the watch below now came tumbling up on deck alarmed at the shock and in a few minutes we had the buckets passing along fortunately we were able to effectively attack the fire before it had taken any very firm hold and a quarter of an hour of hard work saw the flames extinguished but it was a narrow escape for the schooner and all hands of us the most serious part of it was the loss of our foremast which completely disabled us for the moment we went to work however to save the sails yards rigging and so on attached to the shivered mast and before morning we had got a jurylowermast on end and secured by which time the storm had cleared away the wind had sprung up again and the dolores had borne down and taken us in tow fortunately the wind was fair for us and it held and still more fortunately no enemy hove in sight to take advantage of our crippled condition we consequently arrived safely in fort royal harbour in due course on the eighth day after the occurrence of the accident and forthwith received our full share of congratulations and condolences from all and sundry from the admiral downward the congratulations of course being upon our good luck in having effected the capture of so valuable a prize as the dolores while the condolences were offered pretty equally upon our having met with the accident and our having failed to capture morillo and his wonderful brigantine chapter ten senor jose garcia meanwhile my wounded shoulder had been giving me a great deal of trouble becoming very inflamed and refusing to heal so that upon my arrival in port royal i was compelled to at once go into the hospital where for a whole week it remained an open question whether it would not be necessary to amputate the arm fortunately for me the head surgeonsandy mcalisterwas a wonderfully clever fellow of infinite patience and inflexible determination and having expressed the opinion that the limb could be saved he brought all the skill and knowledge of which he was possessed to the task of saving it with the result that in the end he was successful but it meant for me three weeks in the hospital at the end of which time i was discharged not as cured but as in a fair way to be provided that i took the utmost care of myself and strictly adhered to the regimen which the worthy mcalister prescribed for me by the time that i was free of the hospital the saucy little tern was beginning under the hands of the repairers to look something like her old self again and i was kept busy from morning to night attending to a hundred and one details connected with her refit nevertheless i found time to present myself for examination and having passed with flying colours next day found myself a fullfledged lieutenant thanks to the very kindly interest taken in me by my genial old friend the admiral to that same kindly interest i was also indebted for the friendly overtures made by and the hospitable invitations without number received from the planters and other persons of importance belonging to the island but i had my duty to attend to and my wound to think of and i therefore very sparingly accepted the invitations that came pouring in upon me nevertheless i made many new friends and enjoyed my short spell ashore amazingly the admiral was as i have already said particularly kind to me in every way and in nothing more so than in the unstinting commendation which he bestowed upon my conduct during my first brief cruise in the tern yet despite all this it was not difficult for me to perceive that the reflection that morillo and his gang were still at large greatly nettled him and that i could not find a surer way to his continued favour than by finding and capturing or destroying the audacious pirate accordingly i made what inquiries i could relating to the whereabouts of the fellows headquarters and also instructed black peter to try his luck in the same direction but up to within twentyfour hours of the time when the schooner would again be ready for sea neither of us had met with the slightest success when however the twentyfour hours had dwindled down to ten i received the welcome intimation that black peter had at length contrived to get upon morillos trail the information was brought to me by black peter himself who having secured an afternoons liberty which he broke by coming aboard about tenthirty instead of at six oclock pm presented himself considerably the worse for liquor i regret to sayat my cabin door beaming hilariously all over his sable countenance as he stuttered weell mmistah cournay i ggot him a las sah got who you black rascal and what do you mean sir by breaking your leave and then presenting yourself in this disgraceful condition you are drunk sir too drunk to stand steadily too drunk to speak plainly and i should only be giving you your deserts if i were to turn you over to the masteratarms what have you to say for yourself eh sir i fiercely demanded wha have i to sssay for shelf mistah ccournay ha ha i has pplenty to ssshay why sah iiive ggot him sah got who you villain got who i reiterated whywhymm morthe pirate blurted peter finding himself unable to successfully pronounce morillos name do you mean to say that you have succeeded in obtaining news of morillo peter i demanded eagerly my anger at the fellows condition at once giving way to the keenest curiosity ijust dat sah no less answered peter nodding his head as he leered at me with a drunken look of preternatural smartness then said i go and get somebody to pump cold water upon your head until you are sober after which you may come back here and tell me all about it and if you fail to give a good account of yourself stand clear my man i fancy a taste of the cat will do you no harm peter regarded me with horror for a moment as the sinister meaning of this threat dawned upon his muddled senses then he drew himself up to his full height saluted with drunken gravity and vanished into the outer darkness as he stumblingly made his way up the companion ladder and forard about a quarter of an hour later he returned comparatively sober and saluting again stood in the doorway waiting for me to question him so there you are again eh remarked i very well now peter if you are sober enough to speak plainly i should like to know what you meant by saying that you have got morillo the pirate do you mean that you have actually found and captured the fellow well no mistah courtenay i dont dissactly mean that no such luck sah but ise got de next best ting sah ise got a man who says he knows where morillos to be foun answered peter um well that is better than nothingif your friend is to be trusted said i who is he and where did you run athwart him he aint no friend ob mine answered peter virtuously indignant at so insulting an insinuation hes jus a yaller mana halfbreeddat i met at a rum shop up in kingston i heard him mention morillos name so i jined him in a bottle ob rumwhich i paid for out ob my own pocket mistah courtenayand axed him some questions he wouldnt say much but he kep on boastin dat he knew where morillo could be found any timeexcep when he was at sea so i made him drunk wid my rum mistah courtenay and den brought him aboard here instead ob puttin him aboard his own footy little felucca in kingston harbour i see and where is the fellow now peter inquired i where is he now sah repeated peter why sah he is on deck comfortably asleep between two ob de guns where i put him when i come aboard very good peter i begin to think you were not so very drunk after all answered i well pleased but it will not do to leave him on deck all night i continued he will get sober and give us the slip so to make quite sure of him stow him away down below and have a set of irons clapped on him when we are fairly at sea tomorrow i will have him up on deck and see what can be made of him meanwhile peter he is your prisoner remember and i shall hold you responsible for him now go and turn in and beware how you appear before me drunk again early next morning i presented myself at the admirals office timing myself so as to catch the old gentleman immediately upon his arrival from kingston when having reported the tern as ready for sea i received my orders to sail forthwith and also written instructions in reference to the especial object of my cruise these i was by no means surprised to find indicated that while doing my utmost to harass the enemy i was to devote myself especially to the task of hunting down and cutting short the career of morillo the pirate and his gang of cut throats we weighed shortly before noon beating out against a sea breeze that roared through our rigging with the strength of half a gale and when we were fairly clear of the shoals i gave orders for black peters prisoner of the previous night to be brought on deck a minute or two later the fellowa halfcaste spanish negrostood before me and when i beheld what manner of man he was i could readily believe him to be on terms of friendly intimacy not only with morillo but with all the human scum of the caribbean the rascal presented a not altogether unpicturesque figure as he stood in the brilliant sunlight poising himself with the careless easy grace of the practised seaman upon the heaving lurching deck of the plunging schooner for he was attired in a white shirt with broad falling collar loosely confined at the neck by a black silk handkerchief blue dungaree trousers rolled up to the knee and secured round the waist by a knotted crimson silk sash and his head was enfolded in a similar sash the fringed ends of which drooped upon his left shoulder but it was the fellows countenance that riveted my attention despite myself it was of itself ugly enough to have commanded attention anywhere but to its natural ugliness there was added the further repulsiveness of expression that bespoke a character notable alike for low unscrupulous cunning and the most ferocious cruelty but for the fact that he had been encountered upon ground whereon neither morillo nor any of his gang would have dared to show themselves i could readily have believed that he not only had a pretty intimate knowledge of the movements and haunts of the pirates but that he was probably a distinguished member of the gang well my fine fellow pray what may your name be i demanded in english as he was led up and halted before me too mosh me no speakee anglish he promptly replied shrugging his shoulders until they touched the great gold rings that adorned the lobes of his ears and spreading out his hands palms upward toward me what do you speak then i demanded still in english for somehow i did not for a moment believe the rascals statement me espanol he answered with another shrug and flourish of his hands good then remarked i in spanish i will endeavour to converse with you in your own tongue what is your name i am called jose garcia senor he answered and you were born i continued interrogatively in the city of havana thirtytwo years ago senor was the reply then if you are a spaniardand consequently an enemy of great britainwhat were you doing in kingston i demanded ah no senor he exclaimed protestingly i am no enemy of great britain although born a spaniard i have lived in jamaica for the last fifteen years earning my living as a fisherman fifteen years i repeated strange that you should have lived so long among englishspeaking people without acquiring some knowledge of their language and still more strange that you should have spoken english last night in the grog shop in the presence and hearing of my steward how do you account for so very singular a circumstance as that the fellow was so completely taken aback that for a few seconds he could find no reply then seemingly convinced that further deception was useless he suddenly gave in exclaiming in excellent english ah sir forgive me i have been lying to you with what purpose i demanded instinct perhaps he answered with a short uneasy laugh the moment i was brought on deck i recognised that i was aboard a british shipofwar and i smelt danger ah i remarked you afford another illustration of the adage that a guilty conscience needs no accuser what have you been doing that you should smell danger upon finding yourself aboard a british mano war i have been doing nothing but i feared that you intended to impress me answered the fellow so i am returned i but not for long if you behave yourself and when you have rendered the service which i require of you you shall be richly rewarded according as you serve me faithfully or otherwise andandwhat is this service sir demanded he with some slight uneasiness of manner you last night boasted that you could at anytime find morillounless he happened to be at sea i said now i want to find morillo tell me where i may meet with him and you shall receive fifty pounds within an hour of the moment when i shall have carried his ship a prize into port royal harbour morillo who is morillo he demanded trying unsuccessfully to assume an air of ignorance and indifference at the mention of the name he is the pirate of whom you were speaking last night i answered sharply for i suspected that he was about to attempt further deception with me i must have been drunk indeed to talk about a man of whom i have never heard he exclaimed with a hollow pretence at a laugh do you mean to tell me that you do not know morillo or anything about him i demanded angrily now take time to consider your answer i want the truth and the truth i am determined to have by one means or another you have attempted to deceive me once beware how you make such an attempt a second time now what do you know of morillo the pirate nothing the fellow answered sullenly but there was a shrinking of himself together and a sudden grey pallor of the lips that told how severe a tax upon his courage it wasunder the circumstancesto utter the lie think again i said pulling out my watch i will give you five minutes in which to overhaul your memory if by the end of that time you fail i must endeavour to find means to refresh it what will you do demanded the fellow with a scowl that entirely failed to conceal the trepidation which my remark had caused him i made no reply whatever but rose walked to the binnacle took a squint at the compass and then a long look aloft as i turned over in my mind the idea that had suggested itself to me asking myself whether i should be justified in carrying it into action i believed i now pretty well understood the kind of man i had to deal with i took him to be a treacherous unscrupulous lying scoundrel and a coward withalas indeed such people generally areand it was his cowardice that i proposed to play upon in order to extort from him the information i desired to obtain in a word my plan was to seize him up and threaten to flog him if he refused to speak my only difficulty arose from a doubt as to how i ought to proceed in the event of my threat failing to effect the desired result should i be justified in actually carrying my threat into execution for after all the fellow really might not know anything about morillo his remarks to black peter on the previous night might be nothing more than boastful lies and if they were all the flogging i might give him could not make him tell that of which he had no knowledge but somehow i had a conviction that he could tell me a great deal that i should be glad to know if he only chose so i finally decided that if he continued contumacious i would risk giving him a stroke or two being guided in my after conduct by his behaviour under the lash by the time that i had fully arrived at this resolution the five minutes grace had expired and i returned to where the fellow still stood guarded by a jack with drawn cutlass well i demanded which is it to be will you speak freely or must i compel you i have nothing to say and i demand to know by what authority i have been kidnapped and brought aboard this accursed schooner was the reply did i not tell you a few minutes ago that you are impressed i answered you have been brought aboard here in order that you may render me a service which i am convinced you can render if you will when that service has been faithfully performed i will not only set you free again but i will also handsomely reward you you know what the service is that i require of you once more will you or will you not render it i repeat that i have nothing to say put me in irons again if you choose you cannot make a man tell that which he does not know answered garcia and as he spoke he turned away seeming to consider that the dialogue was at an end here not so fast my joker interrupted the seaman who had the fellow in charge seizing garcia unceremoniously by the back of the neck and twisting him round until he faced me again it aint good manners sonny to turn your back upon your superiors until they tells you that theyve done with you and that you can go the halfbreed turned upon his custodian with a snarl and a drawing back of his upper lip that exposed a whole row of yellow fangs while his hand went as from long habit to his girdle as though in quest of a knife but the look of contemptuous amusement with which the sailor regarded him cowed the fellow and he again faced me meekly enough now said i your little fit of petulance being over let me ask you once more and for the last time will you or will you not afford me the information i require no senor englishman i will not i am a spaniard and morillo is a spaniard and nothing you can do shall induce me to betray a fellow countryman is that plain enough for you quite i answered and almost as satisfactory as though you had replied to my question you have as good as admitted that you can if you choose tell me what i want to know now it remains for me to see whether there are any means of compelling you to speak take him away forard and keep a sharp eye upon him i continued to the sailor who had him in charge and as you go pass the word for the carpenter to rig the grating perhaps a taste of the cat may loosen this gentlemans tongue the cat exclaimed the halfbreed wheeling suddenly round as he was being led away do you mean that you are going to flog me certainly unless you choose to speak of your own free will answered i very well then i will speak and your blood be on your own head he hissed through his clenched teeth i will direct you how to find morillo and when you have found him he will amply avenge your insult to me and your audacity in seeking him he will make your life such an unendurable torment to you that you will pray him with tears of blood to put you out of your misery and i shall be there to see you suffer and to laugh in your face as he refuses to grant you the boon of a speedy death that is all right i answered cheerfully i must take the risk of the fate you have so powerfully suggested and now that matter being disposed of i shall be glad to hear from you how i am to find your friend the fellow regarded me in stupid surprise for a moment as though he could not understand his failure to terrify me by his vaguely awful threat then with a gesture that i interpreted as indicative of his final abandonment of me to the destruction that i seemed determined to court he said do you know anything of the grenadines senor no i answered nothing except that they exist and that they form a practically unbroken chain of islets stretching between the islands of saint vincent and grenada that is so he assented one of the most important of these islets is situate about thirteen miles to the northward of grenada and is called cariacou it is supposed to be uninhabited but it is nothing of the kind morillo has taken possession of it and established quite a little settlement upon it there is a snug harbour at its southwestern extremity affording perfect shelter and concealment for his brigantine and all round the shore of the harbour he has built storehouses and residences for himself and his people i pray only that he may be at home to give you a fitting reception i am much obliged for your kind wish i replied drily and now just one question moreis this harbour of which you speak difficult of access are there any rocks or shoals at its entrance or inside no none whatever it can safely be entered on the darkest night was the answer good i returned that will do for the present senor garcia and many thanks for your information you will observe that i have accepted as true every word that you have spoken but i should like you to think everything over again and satisfy yourself that you have made no mistake because i warn you that if you have you will be shot on the instant you may go he was forthwith marched away and placed in close confinement below for my interview with him had convinced me that the fellow was as malignantly spiteful as a snake and would willingly destroy the ship and all hands if an opportunity were afforded himafter which i retired to my cabin got out the chart and set the course for the island of cariacou a course which we could just comfortably lay with yards braced taut against the lee rigging and all sheets well flattened in the trade wind was blowing fresh enough to compel us to furl our topgallant sail but it was steady and under a whole topsail and mainsail the little hooker drove ahead over the long regular ridges of swell at a good honest nineknot pace hour after hour as steadily as the chronometer itself we sighted the island some sixteen miles distant on the evening of our fourth day out and i at once shortened sail and hoveto in order that i might carry out a little plan which i had concocted during our run across chapter eleven cariacouand afterward as soon as the darkness had closed down sufficiently to conceal our movements i filled away again upon the schooner and stood in until we were within two miles of the southern extremity of the islandwhich also forms the southern headland of the harbour mentioned by garcia when having run well in behind the head i again hoveto and launching the dinghy proceeded toward the harbours mouth my crew being two men who like myself were armed to the teeth we pulled in with muffled oars and in due time arrived within a stones throw of the shore the coast here proved to be precipitous and rocky the swell which set round the southern extremity of the island breaking with great violence upon the shore and rendering landing absolutely impossible moreover the night was so dark thatalthough in every other respect admirably suited for my purposeit was impossible to clearly see where we were going and two or three times we inadvertently got so close to the rocks that we narrowly and with the utmost difficulty avoided being dashed upon them at length however we rounded the southernmost head and entered the harbour and almost immediately afterwards made out a narrow strip of sandy beach upon which i landed without difficulty leaving the two men to look after the dinghy and lay off a few yards from the shore ready to pull in again and take me aboard at a moments notice if necessary having landed i ascended a rather steep grassy slope some seventy or eighty feet high and stood to look about me the harbour was quite a spacious affair the entrance being about half a mile wide while the harbour itself seemedso far as i could make out in the darknessto be quite two miles long the general shape of this inlet immediately suggested to me the conviction that if as garcia had informed me morillo really had established his headquarters here he would be almost certain to have constructed a couple of batteriesone on each headlandto defend the place and i at once set about the task of ascertaining how far my conjecture might happen to be correct toward the eastward from where i had halted the land continued to rise in a sort of ridge culminating in what had the appearance of a knoll and it struck me that if a battery really existed on that side of the harbour i ought to find it not far from this spot i accordingly wended my way toward it as best i could forcing a passage for myself through the grass and scrub with a most unpleasant conviction that i might at any moment place my hand or foot upon a venomous snake or reptile of some sort and finally after about twenty minutes of most unpleasant scrambling found myself alongside the knoll which as i had more than half suspected now proved to be nothing less than a rough earthwork mounting four thirtytwo pounders my devious path had brought me to the face of the battery so i had to clamber up the steep face of the slope before i could get a view of the interior this i did entering the battery through one of the embrasures when i found myself standing upon a level platform constituting the floor of the battery keeping carefully within the deep shadow of the gun and crouching down upon my hands and knees i at once proceeded to reconnoitre the place and presently made out a couple of huts the smaller of which i concluded must be the magazine while the larger probably accommodated the garrison both were in utter darkness however and my first impression was that they were untenanted but to make quite certain i crept very softly up to the larger building and finding a closed door listened intently at it for a few seconds i heard nothing save the sough of the night breeze through the branches of some cottonwood trees that grew close at hand but presently i detected a sound of snoring in the interior which as i listened grew momentarily more distinct and unmistakable the sounds certainly emanated from more than one sleeper i thought that there were probably at least three or four of them at work but my hearing was not quite keen enough to enable me to accurately differentiate the sounds and thus arrive at the correct number of those who emitted them they were however sound asleep and therefore not likely to be disturbed by a slight noise moreover the hut was well to windward and the sough and swish of the wind through the cottonwoods seemed powerful enough to drown such slight sounds as i might be likely to make so i stole softly across the open area to the nearest gun which i at once proceeded to carefully spike with the aid of some nails and a leathercovered hammer with which i had provided myself despite the deadening effect of the leather the hammer still made a distinct clink which to my ears sounded loud enough to wake the dead but a few seconds anxious work sufficed to effectually spike the first gun and as nobody appeared to have heard me i then proceeded to spike the next and the next until i had rendered all four of them harmless this done i slipped out of the same embrasure by which i had entered and successfully made my way back to the beach and to the spot off which the dinghy lay awaiting me the presence of a battery on the south head of the harbour entrance convinced me that there must also be a similar structure on the north head as soon therefore as i found myself once more aboard the dinghy i headed her straight across the mouth reaching the northern side in about twenty minutes half an hours search enabled me to find the battery which i was looking forwhich proved to be a pretty exact counterpart of the one i had already visitedand here again i succeeded in spiking all four of the guns without discovery this i regarded as a fairly successful nights work so as we should have to be stirring pretty early in the morning i now returned to the schooner and having hove her to with her head off shore turned in and had a good nights rest at daybreak on the following morning i was called by black peter and within ten minutes i was on deck we were then some eight miles off the land with the schooner heading to the eastward but we at once wore round and bore straight away for the harbours mouth clearing for action and making all our arrangements as we went an hours run with the wind well over our starboard quarter brought us off the mouth of the harbour which we at once entered and as soon as we were fairly inside the schooner was hoveto and two boats were lowered each carrying eleven men armed to the teeth in addition to the officer in command one of the boats was commanded by christie and the other by lindsay and their mission was to capture the two batteries commanding the harbours mouth and blow them up before the spiked cannon could be again rendered serviceable i brought the telescope to bear upon the batteries as soon as we were far enough inside the harbour to get a sight of them and was amused to observe that there was a terrible commotion going on in both our presence had been promptly discovered and the first attempt to open fire upon us had resulted in the discovery that their guns were all spiked of course it was by no means an easy matter to estimate the strength of the garrisons of these batteries but i calculated that it would probably total up to about thirty men to each battery and as they would be nearly or quite all spaniards i felt that the boats crews which i had sent away would be quite strong enough to satisfactorily account for them nor was i disappointed for although the pirates opened a brisk musketry fire upon our lads the moment that they were fairly within range the latter simply swarmed up the hill and carried the two batteries with a rush the pirates retreating by the rear as the terns clambered in through the embrasures the moment that the boats shoved off from the schooners side i saw that the spirit of emulation had seized upon the two crews for they both went away at a racing pace and their actions throughout were evidently inspired by this same spirit the result of which was that the two batteries were destroyed within five minutes of each other while the whole affair from the moment when the boats shoved off to the moment when they arrived alongside again was accomplished within an hour and a quarter and that too without any loss whatever on our side or even a wound severe enough to disable the recipient the pirates were less fortunate their loss in the two batteries amounting to five killed and at least seven wounded severely enough to render them incapable of escaping these seven were brought on board by our lads and secured below immediately upon their arrival meanwhile i had not been idle for while the boats were away i had employed my time in making with the aid of the telescope a most careful inspection of this piratical stronghold and i was obliged to admit to myself that it would be difficult to imagineand still more difficult to finda spot more perfectly adapted in every way for its purpose the harbour itself was spacious enough to hold a fleet and almost completely landlocked so that once inside a ship was perfectly concealed while the fact that the opening faced in a south westerly direction rendered it absolutely safe in all weathers and so far as enemies were concerned the two batteries at the harbours mouth were so admirably placed that they ought to have proved amply sufficient for the defence of the place and no doubt they would have so proved in other hands or had a proper lookout been kept that they had fallen so easily to us was the fault not of morillo but of the man whom he had left in command at the bottom of the bay or inletfor it partook of the nature of the latter rather than of the formerlay the settlement that morillo had established consisting of no less than seventeen buildings there was also a small wharf with a brig lying alongside it the moment that the boats arrived alongside i ordered the men out of them and had them dropped astern when sail was made and we stood down toward the settlement with our ensign flying at the gaffend as we drew near i was able to make out that here too our presence was productive of a tremendous amount of excitement and presently fire was opened upon us from a battery of six ninepounders that had been constructed on the rising ground immediately to the rear of the wharf while the black flag was boldly run up on a flagstaff close at hand it did not suit my purpose however to engage in a running fight i therefore bore down upon the brigdischarging our port broadside at the battery when we were within pistolshot of itand running alongside grapnelled her this done every man jack of us swarmed ashore lindsay holding the wharf with a dozen of our lads while christie and i with the remainder of the crew made a rush for the battery and took it ten minutes sufficed us to spike the guns and blow up the magazine which done we found ourselves masters of the whole place the inhabitants having taken to flight the moment that this third battery fell into our hands we now proceeded to make a leisurely inspection of the place with the result that we discovered it to be quite a miniature dockyard with storehouses masthouses rigging and saillofts all complete in fact there was every possible convenience for repairing and refitting a ship nor was this all there was also a large magazine full of ammunition quite an armoury of muskets pistols and cutlasses and several dismounted guns ranging from sixpounders to thirtytwo pound carronades while the storehouses were well stocked with provisions and stores of every possible description one large building immediately facing the wharf was apparently used as a receptacle for plunder for we found several bales of stuff that had evidently formed part of a cargo or cargoes but there was surprisingly little of it which was accounted for later on by the discovery that the brig was full of plunder to the hatches in addition to the buildings which were in use as stores there were two most comfortably fitted up as barracks while at the back of the settlement and well up the side of the hill stood a little group of seven handsome timber dwellinghouses each standing in its own garden and nestling among the lofty trees that clothed the hillside having secured complete possession of the place my first care was to have the small amount of plunder that lay in the storehouse and the guns conveyed on board the tern and sent down her main hatchway this job took us about two hours during which a few shots were occasionally fired at us from the woods but as the bullets all fell short we did not trouble ourselves to go in pursuit of the individuals who were firing upon us our next act was to blow up the magazine thus destroying the whole of the pirates stock of ammunition and when this had been successfully accomplished we went systematically to work and set fire to the whole of the storehouses and barracks one after the other until the whole place was in flames finally we turned our attention to the seven dwellinghouses on the hillside these proved to our astonishment to be most elegantly and sumptuously furnished in every respect the only peculiarity noticeable being a lack of uniformity among the articles contained in some of the houses plainly showing that they had been gathered together at different times and from different places evidences of female influence were abundantly present in all these houses from which we assumed that they formed the abode of morillo and his most important subordinates during their short sojourns in port the six largest of these buildings we set fire to leaving the seventh as a refuge for the unfortunate women who were doubtless concealed at no great distance in the adjacent woods the burning of these houses completed the destruction of the settlement which was accomplished absolutely without casualties of any kind on our side we waited until the houses were well ablaze and then retreated in good order to the harbour a few shots being fired at us here and there from ambush as we went but as we were well out of range i took no notice of them and in due time we arrived once more on the wharf our next business was to take possession of the brig which we did forthwith christie with eight hands going on board her as a prize crew she was a beamy bluffbowed motherly old craft named the three sisters hailing out of portofspain and was evidently british built her whole appearance being that of a sober honest slowgoing trader such as one constantly meets with doing business among the islands her hold however was full of booty and i conjectured that morillo had through his agents purchased her in a perfectly straightforward manner for use in the conveyance of booty from cariacou to such ports as afforded opportunity for its disposal without the asking of too many inconvenient questions it was the work of but a few minutes for the prize crew to transfer their few belongings from the schooner to the brig and this done we got both craft under way and stood out to seathe brig under every stitch of canvas that she could show to the breeze while the schooner under topsail foresail and jib had to heaveto at frequent intervals to wait for her my first intention was to send the brig to port royal in charge of the prize crew alone remaining off the island in the tern until morillo should appearas he would be certain to do sooner or laterin his brigantine a little reflection however caused me to alter my plans and to determine upon escorting the three sisters to her destination lest she should haply encounter morillo on the way in which case the fate of her defenceless prize crew would probably be too dreadful to bear thinking about as soon therefore as we were clear of the harbour i set the course for jamaica and away we both went cheek by jowl the brigwith a roaring breeze over her starboard quarter reeling off her six and a half knots per hour with as much fuss and splutter as though she were going fifteen for the first two days nothing of any importance occurred on the third night out from cariacou howeveror to be strictly accurate about two oclock in the morningit being my watch on deck the night dark and somewhat overcast two sails were sighted on our starboard bow heading to the eastward on the port tack and steering a course which would bring them close to us one of them was a craft of considerable size the other a small vessel and from the moment that these two facts became apparent i made up my mind that one was the prize of the other though which of the two was the captor there was just then no means of ascertaining the smaller craft was perhaps a privateer and the big one her prize orquite as likelythe big craft might be a frigate and the small craft her prize in either case however it behoved me to be very careful for one of the two was almost certain to be an enemy and if she happened to be also the captor of the other it was more than probable she would tackle us from the moment therefore when we first sighted them i never allowed the nightglass to be off them for more than a few seconds at a time when first discovered they were hull down and only just distinguishable in the darkness as two vague blots of black against the lowering gloom of the night sky but the trade wind was piping up rather stronger than usual that night while we and the strangers were approaching each other on a nearly straight line we consequently closed each other rapidly and within about twenty minutes from the moment of their discovery we were able to make out that one of the twain was a fullrigged ship while the other seemed to be a large brigantine and a few minutes later i discovered that the ship was showing a much broader spread of canvas than the brigantine thus proving the latter to be the faster craft of the two it was scarcely likely therefore that the ship was a frigate and if not that she must be a merchantman and doubtless the prize of the brigantine at this point the question suggested itself to me might not the brigantine be morillos craft she appeared to be about the same size so far as it was possible to distinguish in the darkness and if so it would fully account for the boldness with which she held on upon her course instead of heaving about and endeavouring to avoid a possible enemyfor doubtless they had made us out almost if not quite at the same time as we had discovered them i most fervently hoped it might be as i surmised for if so i should have the fellow at advantage inasmuch as he would doubtless have put a fairly strong prize crew on board the ship which would proportionately weaken his own crew full of the hope that this ishmael of the sea might be about to place himself within my power i caused all hands to be called and having first made sail sent them to quarters the gunner at the same time descending to the magazine and sending up a plentiful supply of powder and shot by the time that we were ready the brigantine and her consort had neared us to within a couple of miles the two craft closing meanwhile doubtless for the purpose of communicating instructions that they were quite prepared to fight aboard the brigantine was perfectly evident for we could see that her deck was lit up with lanterns the light of which shining through her ports enabled me to ascertain that she mounted six guns of a side both craft held their luff but it was now quite clear that the brigantine was much the faster and more weatherly of the two she walking away out to windward of the big fellow as though the latter had been at anchor the moment that she made sail in answer to our challenge and now ensued a little bit of manoeuvring on both sides with the twofold object of discovering whether the stranger happened to be an enemy and if so to secure the weathergage of him we had the advantage however as we were running free and could haul our wind at any moment and this advantage i kept by hauling up on the starboard tack and then heaving in stays with the topsail aback waiting for the brigantine to close which she presently did ranging up within biscuit toss of our lee quarter she was now so close to us that despite the darkness it was quite possible to make out details and it was with a feeling of mingled disgust and disappointment that i discovered that whatever she might be she certainly was not morillos beautiful but notorious brigantine she was however in all probability an enemyit seemed to me that so far as i could make out in the uncertain light of the partially clouded stars she had a french look about herso with the idea of securing the advantage of the first hail i sprang upon the rail as she ranged up alongside and hailed in spanish ho the brigantine ahoy what vessel is that the belle diane french privateer what schooner is that came the reply also in spanish of the most execrable kind uttered with an unmistakable french accent his britannic majestys schooner tern monsieur to which ship i must request you to surrender or i shall be under the painful necessity of blowing you out of the water answered i firmly persuaded of the policy of rendering oneself as formidable as possible to ones enemy but my wellmeant endeavour proved to be a signal failure the enemy was not in this case to be so easily frightened les anglais mille tonneres i heard the frenchman in the brigantines main rigging exclaim as he waved his clenched fist in the air then he retorted in what he doubtless believed to be the purest english vat is dat you say monsieur angleeshman if i do not surrendaire you vill blow me out of de vattar ha ha sacre it is i monsieur who vill blow dat footy leetle schooner of yours into ze sky if you do not surrendaire yourshelf plus promptement eh all right monsieur blaze away then as soon as you like retorted i in the best attempt at french i could muster then to my own people who were at quarters stand by starboard guns wait until she rolls toward us now fire our imposing broadside of three guns rang out at the precise moment when the brigantine rolled heavily toward us exposing her deck to our fire and i heard the shot go crashing through her bulwarks to the accompaniment of sundry yells and screams that told me they had not been altogether ineffective almost at the same instant three of her guns replied but their muzzles were so deeply depressed and she was just then rolling so heavily toward us that the shot struck the water between her and ourselves and we neither saw nor felt any more of them meanwhile our square canvas being aback our antagonist swept rapidly ahead of us seeing which i filled upon the schooner and bore up under the brigantines stern raking with our port broadside as we crossed her stern immediately hauling my wind and making a halfboard across her stern again to regain my position upon her weather quarter our starboard guns were by this time reloaded and we gave her the three of them doubleshotted as we recrossed her and the tremendous clatter with the howls and shrieks that followed this discharge showed that we had wrought a considerable amount of execution among the frenchmen theres something gone aboard of him but what it is i cant make out exclaimed lindsay who was standing close beside me ah he continued i see what it is now it is her mainboom that we have shot away i can see the outer end of it towing overboard and see she is paying off with the loss of their aftersail they can no longer keep their luff it was even as lindsay had said we had shot away the brigantines mainboom and thus rendered her big powerful mainsail useless so that despite the lee helm that they were giving her she was gradually falling off until within a minute or two she was nearly dead before the wind this placed her almost completely at our mercy for we were now enabled to sail to and fro athwart her stern raking her alternately with our port and starboard guns and with our ninepounder as well while she could only reply with two guns which her people had run out through her stern ports still although disabled she was by no means beaten her plucky crew keeping up a brisk fire upon us from these two guns until by a lucky broadside we dismounted them both but even then they would not give in despite the relentless fire that we continued to pour into them they contrived after a time to get two more guns into position with which they renewed their fire upon us as briskly as ever this sort of thing however could not continue for very long our fire was so hot and our guns were so well aimed that we fairly drove the plucky fellows from the only two guns that they could bring to bear upon us and within a couple of minutes of the cessation of their fire a lantern was waved aboard the brigantine and someone hailed that they surrendered while at the same moment all sheets and halliards were let go and her canvas came down by the run as a further intimation that they had had enough of it upon this we of course at once ceased firing and ranged up alongside the prize hailing her that we would send a boat aboard then for the first time we discovered that both our large boats were so severely damaged that neither of them would float whereupon lindsay offered to board the prize in the dinghy with two hands and take possession accordingly the little cockleshell of a craft was dropped over the side and in less than two minutes my chum hailed to say that he was safely aboard and that the execution wrought by our fire had been terrible the brigantine having lost nearly half her crew both the captain and the chief mate being among the killed he added that the brigantines longboat was undamaged and that he proposed to hoist her out with the assistance of the prisoners and send her to us by the two hands who had manned the dinghy if we would look out to pick her up in the event of their being unable to bring her alongside to this i of course agreed and a quarter of an hour later the boat was safely alongside us with a prize crew of twelve picked men tumbling themselves and their traps into her meanwhile what had become of the three sisters and the big ship i looked round for them and behold there they both were about half a mile to windward and bearing down upon us in company phew thought i here is a nice business while we have been playing the game of hammer and tongs down here the big shipdoubtless manned by a strong prize crewhas run alongside the old brig and taken her and yetcan it be so christie has eight hands with him and i believe the fellow would make a stout fight for it before giving in i cannot understand it but we shall soon see if they have captured him we shall have to recapture him that is all then turning to the men who were busy securing the guns and repairing such slight damage as had been inflicted upon our rigging i said avast there with those guns load them again lads for we may have to fight once more in a few minutes here is the big ship running down upon us and it looks very much as though she had taken the brig fill your topsail and let draw the headsheets getting sufficient way upon the schooner we tacked and stood toward the newcomers passing close under the stern of the ship with the intention of hailing her but before i could get the trumpet to my lips a figure sprang into the ships mizzen rigging and christies wellknown voice hailed tern ahoy is mr courtenay aboard ay ay i answered i am here mr christie what are you doing aboard there why answered christie i am in charge you know seeing you busy with the brigantine i thought i might as well try my luck at the same time so i managed somehow to put the brig alongside this ship and andwell we just took her well done mr christie i shouted but before i could get out another word my voice was drowned in the roaring cheer that the terns gave vent to as they heard the news told in christies usual gentle drawling tones and by the time that the cheers had died away the two craft had drawn so far apart that further conversation was for the moment impossible chapter twelve i become the victim of a villainous outrage making room christie presently hauled to the wind and hoveto and some ten minutes later he presented himself on board the schoonerbrought alongside by the ships gig manned by four of the ships crewto report his own share in the incidents of the night from this report i gathered that like myself at first he had mistaken the french privateer for morillos brigantine and had also arrived at the conclusion that the ship was a prize of the latter he had kept a keen watch upon the movements of the schooner until it had become apparent that we intended to attack the supposed pirate when he at once turned his attention to the ship with the object of ascertaining whether with such a phenomenally slow craft as the three sisters anything could be done with her he believed that with luck it could as he felt pretty certain that the attention of the ships prize crew would be fully occupied in watching the manoeuvres of the brigantine and the schooner and trusting to this he hauled his wind until he had placed the brig in position the merest trifle to windward of the course that the ship was steering when taking his chance of having thus far escaped observation he clewed up and furled everything afterwards patiently awaiting the development of events and now ensued a very curious and amusing thing it having transpired that the french prize crew of the ship had seen the brig and had at once jumped to the conclusion that she was a prize to the schooner the curious behaviour of the three sisters had puzzled them not a little at the outset but when we opened fire upon the brigantine they knew at once that we must be an enemy and supposing that the prize crew of the brigwhom they rashly judged to be their own countrymenhad taken advantage of our preoccupation to rise and recapture their vessel they immediately bore down to their assistance this lucky mistake enabled christie to fall alongside the ship without difficulty when laying aside for the nonce his gentle ladylike demeanour he led his eight men up the ships lofty sides and over her high bulwarks on to her deck where the nine of them laid about them with such good will that after about a minutes resistance the astounded frenchmen were fain to retreat to the forecastle where in obedience to christies summons they forthwith flung down their arms and surrendered at discretion then clapping the hatch over them and stationing two men with drawn cutlasses by it as a guard christie proceeded to liberate the imprisoned crew of the shipwhich he discovered to be the british west indiaman black prince homewardbound at the time of her capture two days previously with an exceedingly valuable general cargoand then sent his own men back to the three sisters which had all this time been lying alongside secured to the indiaman by grapnels the brig then cast off and the two craft forthwith bore down upon us to report the fight between ourselves and the brigantine being by that time over by the time that our own and the brigantines damages had been repaired it was daylight and we were all ready for making sail once more but before doing so i caused the whole of the frenchmen to be removed to the schooner where they were first put in irons and then clapped safely under hatches after which i visited first the belle diane and then the indiaman i must confess i was astonished when i beheld the effect of our fire upon the former i could scarcely credit that so much damage had been inflicted by our sixpounders in so short time her stern above the level of the coveringboard being absolutely battered to pieces while the shot had also ploughed up her decks fore and aft in long scoring gashes so close together and crossing each other in such a way as showed what a tremendous raking she had received she began the action with fiftyseven men all told out of which eighteen had been killed outright and the remainder with one solitary exception more or less seriously wounded looking upon the paths our shot had ploughed along her deck i was only surprised that any of her people were left alive to tell the tale in addition to this five of her twelve guns were dismounted and her rigging had been a good deal cut up but this was now of course all knotted and spliced by lindsays people she was a very fine vessel of three hundred and fortyfour tons measurement oak built copper fastened and copper sheathed to the bends very shallowdrawing only eight feet of waterand very beamy with most beautiful lines her spars looked enormously lofty compared with our own as i stood on her deck and gazed aloft and her canvas had evidently been bent new for the voyage she had only arrived in west indian waters a week previously from brest and the black prince was stated to be her first prize having given the diane a pretty good overhaul and satisfied myself that her hull was sound i gave lindsay his instructions and then proceeded on board the black prince where i arrived in good time for breakfast and where i made the acquaintance not only of her skippera fine greyheaded sailorly man named blatchfordbut also of her thirtytwo passengers eighteen of whom were males while the remainder were of the gentler sex the wives and daughters mostly of the male passengers there were no young children among them fortunately my appearance seemed to create quite a little flutter of excitement among the petticoats and also not a little astonishment apparently for i overheard one of the matrons remark to another behind her fan why he is scarcely more than a boy the black prince was a noble ship of twelve hundred and fifty tons frigatebuilt and only nine years old splendidly fitted up and full to the hatches of coffee tobacco spices and other valuables she also had a reputation for speed which had induced her skipper to hazard the homeward voyage alone instead of waiting for convoy the poor old fellow was of course dreadfully cut up at his misfortunefor having been in the enemys hands more than twentyfour hours she was a recapture in the legal sense of the term and as such we were entitled to salvage for her however unfortunate as was the existing state of affairs it was of course vastly better than that of a few hours before and he interrupted himself in his bemoanings to thank me for having rescued him out of the hands of those philistines the french privateersmen i informed him that it would be my duty to take him into fort royal but he received the news with equanimity explaining that even had i not insisted on it he should certainly after his recent experience have availed himself of my escort to return to kingston and there await convoy i breakfasted with him and his passengers and then leaving christie aboard as prize master returned to the schooner and we all made sail in company arriving at port royal five days later without further adventure the admiral was as might be expected immensely pleased at our appearance with three prizes in company and still more so when i reported to him the discovery and destruction of morillos headquarters you have done well my boy wonderfully well better even than i expected of you said he shaking me heartily by the hand go on as you have begun and i venture to prophesy that it will not be long before i shall feel justified in giving you tother swab pointing as he spoke to my single epaulet to say that i was delighted at my reception but very feebly expresses the feelings that overwhelmed me as the kind old fellow spoke such generous words of appreciation and encouragement of course i knew that i had done well but i regarded my success as due fully as much to good fortune as to my own efforts and i was almost overwhelmed with joy at so full and complete a recognition of my efforts so astonished indeed was i that i could only stammer something to the effect that our success was due quite as much to the loyalty with which christie and lindsay had seconded me and the gallantry with which the men had stood by me as it was to my own individual merits thats right my boy remarked the admiral i am glad to hear you speak like that no doubt what you say is true but it does not detract in the least from the value of your own services i always think the better of an officer who is willing to do full justice to the merits of those who have helped him and your promotion will not come to you the less quickly for having helped your shipmates to theirs you have all done well and i will see to it that you are all adequately rewarded christie and lindsay by getting their step and you by getting a somewhat better craft than the little cockleshell in which you have already done so well i am of opinion that all you require is opportunity and by the piper you shall have it and the old gentleman kept his word for when i went aboard the tern on the following dayi dined and slept at the house of some friends a little way out from kingston that nightchristie and lindsay met me with beaming faces and the information that the former had got his step as master while lindsay had received an acting order as lieutenant pending his passing of the necessary examination the only drawback to this good news was the intelligence that the man garcia had mysteriously disappeared during the night leaving not a trace of his whereabouts behind him an hour or two later i went ashore and waited upon the admiral at his office in accordance with instructions received from him on the previous day and upon being ushered into his presence he at once began to question me relative to the qualities of the diane i was able to speak nothing but good of her for indeed what i had seen of her during the passage to port royal had convinced me that she was really a very fine vessel in every respect a splendid seaboat wonderfully fast and i had no doubt a thoroughly wholesome comfortable craft in bad weather just so commented the admiral when i had finished singing her praises what you have said quite confirms my own opinion of her which is that in capable hands she may be made exceedingly useful moreover she is more nearly a match for morillos brigantine than is the little tern eh well my lad i have been thinking matters over and have made up my mind that she is good enough to purchase into the service so i will have it seen to at once and of course i shall give you the command of her she will want a considerable amount of attention at the hands of the shipwrights after the mauling that you gave her but you shall supervise everything yourself and they shall do nothing without your approval so see to it that they dont spoil her i notice that she mounts six sixes of a side now i propose to alter that arrangement by putting four long nines in place of those six sixes with an eighteenpounder on her forecastle and with such an armament as that and a crew to match you ought to be able to render an exceedingly good account of yourself what do you think of my idea i replied truthfully that i considered it excellent in every way and we then launched into a discussion of minor details with which i need not weary the reader at the end of which i went aboard the tern and paid off her crew preparatory to her being turned over to the shipwrights along with her prize it happened that just about this time there was an exceptionally heavy press of work in the dockyard for there had been several frigate actions of late and the resources of the staff were taxed to the utmost to effect the repairs following upon such events and to get the ships ready for sea again in the shortest possible time with the result that such small fry as the diane and the tern were obliged to wait until the heaviest of the work was over and the frigates were again ready for service it thus happened that although i contrived to worry the dockyard superintendent into putting a few shipwrights aboard the diane three weeks passed and still the brigantine was very far from being ready for sea during this time i made my headquarters at mammy wilkinsons hotel in kingstonthat being the hotel especially affected by navy menalthough i was seldom there the planters and bigwigs of the island generally proving wonderfully hospitable and literally overwhelming me with invitations to take up my abode with them but about the time that i have mentioned it happened that certain alterations were being effected aboard the brigantine which i was especially anxious to have carried out according to my own ideas i therefore spent the whole of the day for several days in succession at the dockyard going up to kingston at night and sleeping at the hotel it was during this interval that one night about ten oclock a negro presented himself at the hotel inquiring for me and upon my making my appearance in the entrancehall the fellowa fullblooded african dressed very neatly in a white shirt and white duck trousers both scrupulously clean for a wonderapproached me and ducking his head respectfully inquired you massa courtenay sar capn ob de manowar schoonah tern well yes i replied my name is courtenay and i commanded the tern up to the time of her being paid off so i suppose i may fairly assume that i am the individual you have been inquiring for what is it you want with me you know a genterman namd lindsay sar asked the negro instead of replying to my question certainly i do answered i what of him why sar he hab got into a lilly scrape down on de wharf and de perlice hab put him into de lockup dey don beliebe dat he am mano war bucra and he say will you be so good as to step down dere an identerfy him an bail him out lindsay got into a scrape repeated i incredulously i cannot believe it what has he been doing dat i cannot say sar answered the black i only know dat a perliceman come out ob de door ob de lockup as i was passin by and asked me if i wanted to earn fibe shillin and when i say yes he take me into de lockup and interdooce me to young bucra who say him name am lindsay and dat if i will take a message to you he will gib me fibe shillin when i come back wid you it is very extraordinary i muttered i cannot understand it but i will go with you of course wait a moment until i fetch my cap so saying i left the fellow and hastened to my room where closing the door i opened my chest and furnished myself with a supply of money and then closing and locking the chest i hastened away to where the negro was waiting for me as i passed through the hall several men of my acquaintance were lounging there smoking and one of them hailed me with hillo courtenay whither away so fast my lad it was on the tip of my tongue to explain to them my errand but i bethought me just in time that if lindsay had been doing anything foolish he might not care to have the fact blazoned abroad so i kept my own counsel merely replying that i was called out upon a small matter of business and so effected my escape from them into the dark street oh here you are exclaimed i as the negro emerged at my appearance from the deep shadow of the hotel portico now then which way is mr lindsay in the town jail no sar no he am in de harbour lockup answered my guide dis way sar it am not so bery far the harbour lockup queried i where is that i didnt know that there was such a place oh yes sar dar am you follow me sar i show you de way sar answered the negro all right heave ahead then said i and away we went a little way down the main street and then turned to the right plunging into one of the dark narrow side streets which then intersected the town of kingston keep close to de wall sar cautioned my guide dere am a gutter in de middle ob de road and if you steps into dat you go in ober your shoes in muck i could well believe this for although it was too dark in this narrow lane to see anything the abominable odour of the place told me pretty well what its condition must be we plodded on for nearly ten minutes winding hither and thither and penetrating deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of dark crooked lanes but gradually edging nearer to the harbour while as i thought working our way a considerable distance to the westward presently my guide who had been humming some negro melody to himself lifted up his voice in a louder key and began to chant the praises of a certain lubly chloe whose eyes were like the stars and whose breaf was like the rose the fellow had a wonderfully melodious voice and in listening to him as he strode easily along at a swinging pace improvising verse after verse in honour of the unknown chloe i lost my bearings as well as my count of time and was only brought back to a consciousness of the present by suddenly finding my head closely enveloped in what seemed to be a blanket while at the same instant my feet were tripped from under me so that i should have fallen forward but for the restraining influence of the blanket and of a pair of arms that gripped mine tightly behind my back so that i was instantly overpowered and effectually precluded from making the slightest effort to free myself then before i had time to realise what was happening i was lifted off my feet and despite my desperate struggles and ineffectual efforts to shout for assistance carried in through an open doorway and flung upon my face upon the ground where someone at once knelt upon me and securely lashed my hands behind my back some other individual at the same instant lashing my ankles firmly together dere dat will do peter i tink him cannot do much harm now remarked the voice of my whilom guide and as the fellow spoke i was relieved of the very considerable weight that had been pressing upon me and holding me down then i was rolled over on my side and as the blanket that enveloped my head and very nearly suffocated me was cautiously removed i felt the prick of something sharp against my left breast and the same voice that had spoken before observed massa courtenay we hab no wish to hurt you sah but it am my painful duty to warn you dat if you sing out or make de slightest attempt to escape i shall be obleeged to dribe dis lilly knife ob mine home to yo heart sar so now you knows what you hab to expec does you understan what i say sah certainly i do answered i with suppressed fury your meaning is clear enough in all conscience but beware what you do my fine fellow you were seen by several of my friends at the hotel who will have no difficulty in identifying you and i warn you that you will be made to pay dearly for this outrage to a british naval officer what is the meaning of it all have you any idea of the enormity of your offence oh yes sah answered my guide cheerfully we hab a very clear idea ob dat habent we peter addressing another big powerful negro of somewhat similar cut to himself but attired in much less respectable garments peter grinned affirmatively but said nothing whereupon his companion continued now peter where am dat gag just bring it along and let us fix it up so as to make all safe it would be a most drefful misfortune if massa courtenay was to sing out and force me to split him heart wid dis knife ob mine so we will just make it onpossible for him to do any such foolis ting all this time the knifea formidable daggershaped blade fully a foot longwas kept pressed so firmly to my breast that it had drawn blood the stain of which was now dyeing the front of my white shirt so the moment was manifestly inopportune for any attempt at escape or resistance even i therefore submitted with the best grace i could muster to the insertion of the gag between my teeth reserving to myself the right to make both ruffians smart for their outrage upon me at the first available opportunity but before the gag was placed between my teeth i contrived to repeat my inquiry for an explanation nebber you mind massa courtenay you will find out all about dat in good time sah answered the leading spirit of the twain and with that reply i was perforce obliged to be content for the moment having made me perfectly secure the two negroes squatted down upon their haunches and with much deliberation produced from their pockets a short clay pipe each a plug of tobacco and a knife and after carefully shredding their tobacco and charging their pipes proceeded to smoke with much gravity and in perfect silence it struck me that possibly they might be waiting for someone whose appearance upon the scene would i hoped throw some light upon the cause of this extraordinary outrage and give me an inkling as to what sort of an end i might expect to the adventure meanwhile having nothing else to do i proceeded to take stock of the place or at least as much of it as i could command in my cramped and constrained position there was little or nothing however in what i saw about me of a character calculated to suggest an explanation of the motive for my seizure the building was simply one of those low onestorey adobe structures thatched with palm leaves such as then abounded in the lower quarters of kingston and which were usually inhabited by the negro or halfbreed population of the place the interior appeared to be divided into two apartments by an unpainted partition of timber framing decorated with cheap and gaudy coloured prints tacked to the wood at the four corners and as a good many of these pictures were of a religious character in most of which the blessed virgin figured more or less prominently i took it that the legitimate occupant of the place was a roman catholic the furniture was of the simplest kind consisting of a table in the centreupon which burned the cheap tawdry brass lamp that illumined the apartmenta large upturned packingcase covered with a gaudy tablecloth and serving as a table against the rear wall of the building and three or four old straight backed chairs that had evidently come down in the world for they were elaborately carved and upholstered in frayed and faded tapestry a few more cheap and gaudy coloured prints adorned the walls a heavy curtain so dirty and smokegrimed that its original colour and pattern was utterly unrecognisable shielded the unglazed window two or three hanging shelvesone of which supported a dozen or so of dark green bottlesdepended from the walls and that was all the floor upon which i lay was simply the bare earth rammed hard thick with dust and swarming with fleasas i quickly discoveredand the whole place reeked of that hot stale smell that seems to pervade the abodes of people of uncleanly habits the two negroes smoked silently and gravely for a full halfhour about the end of which time my captor slowly and with due deliberation knocked the ashes from his pipe and rising to his feet yawned and stretched himself in so doing his eye fell upon the shelf upon which stood the bottles and sauntering lazily across the room he laid his hand upon one of the bottles and placed it on the centre table then lifting up the cloth which covered the packingcase he revealed a shelf within the interior from which he withdrew a water monkey two earthenware mugs and a dish containing a most uninvitinglooking mixture which i presently guessed from its odour to be composed of salt fish and boiled yams mashed together cold these he placed upon the table and still without speaking the pair drew chairs up to the table and seating themselves opposite each other proceeded to make a hearty meal helping themselves alternately with their fingers from the central dish and washing down the mixture with a mug of rum and water each they were still thus agreeably engaged when the distant sound of rumbling wheels and clattering hoofs became audible rapidly drawing nearer and accompanied by the persuasive shouts and ejaculations of a negro driver dat am de boy moses wid de cart i spects remarked the negro whose name i had not yet learned what a drefful row de young rascal makes dat nigger wont nebber learn discreshun he continued wiping his fingers carefully on a flaming red handkerchief which he drew from his breeches pocket peter grunted an unintelligible reply and the next moment the vehicle pulled up sharply at the door the cessation of its clatter being immediately followed by the entrance of a negro lad some eighteen years of age ise brought de cart as you tole me caesar he remarked am it all right it am sar remarked caesarthe hitherto unnamed negroloftily when did you ebber know me to fail in what i undertooken eh sar nebber sah nebber answered moses appreciatively an so dat am de gebberlum am it pointing at me with his chin as i lay huddled up on the floor yes sar it am answered caesar curtly in a tone of voice which was evidently intended to cut short all further conversation an now peter he continued if you has finished yo supper we better be movin nebber mind about puttin de tings away de ole oman will see to dat when she comes home in de mornin now den peter you take hold ob de gentermans legs and help me to carry him out does you hear peter the silent grunted an affirmative stooping as he did so and seizing my legs while caesar raised me by the shoulders in his powerful arms remarking as he did so massa courtenay jus listen to me if you please sah we am goin to take you for a nice pleasant lilly dribe in a cart and i am goin to sit on you so dat you may not fall out now i still has my knife wid me and if i feels you begin to struggle i shall be under de mos painful necessity ob drivin it into you to keep you quiet so i hope dat you will lie most particular still durin yo little journey you sabbe i nodded my head dats all right den resumed caesar now peter up wid him and away we goes and therewith the two black rascals raised me carefully and carrying me into the open placed me in a mule cart covered me with a thick layer of green forage andcaesar coolly carrying out his threat to sit upon medrove away chapter thirteen in the power of the enemy our drive was a most unpleasant one for me for the cart had no springs and the boy moses like jehu drove furiously it fortunately lasted only some fiveandtwenty minutes or so however and at the end of that period we pulled up on what i guessed from the running of the vehicle and the sound of rippling water to be a sandy beach my conjecture proved to be correct for when presently i was hauled out from underneath the forage and stood upon my feet more dead than alive i found that we were on the margin of a tiny creek or cove about three quarters of a mile to the westward of the outskirts of kingston a small canoe lay hauled up on the sand and in the bottom of this craft i was carefully deposited after which she was run down into the water when caesar and peter sprang lightly into her giving her a final shove to seaward as they did so and paddled away leaving moses and his cart to make the best of their way back to the town lying upon my back in the bottom of the canoe with my face turned upward to the stars i was able to see that we were heading eastward toward kingston harbour and about half an hour later the canoe glided up alongside a small felucca of some thirty tons burden and was made fast by her painter the canoe secured to his satisfaction the negro caesar climbed over the feluccas low bulwarks and i heard his bare feet pattering along the deck until as i supposed he reached the companion when the sounds became muffled and were presently lost then i caught the sound of voicescaesars and othersbut so indistinctly that i was unable to distinguish what was being said the conversation however was brief for in three or four minutes the tread of caesars bare feet again became audible accompanied by that of others and i then discovered that a conversation of which i was the subject was being conducted in spanish this seemed to suggest that i had fallen into the hands of the enemy though why the spaniards should wish to kidnap so very unimportant a personage as myself i could not for the life of me imagine unless they had adopted some new system of warfare one element of which consisted in kidnapping as many of the enemys officers as possible without much reference to their importance or otherwise but of course i should soon see for as i lay there in the bottom of the canoe cogitating to this effect i became aware from the remarks interchanged by those on deck that i was about to be transferred to the felucca and if the spaniards had adopted the novel system of kidnapping british officers i should doubtless find some of my fellowofficers on board in the same plight as myself presently caesar swung himself over the feluccas bulwarks and down into the canoe when he at once seized me by the shoulders and calling upon his friend peter to lend him a hand proceeded to pass me up over the feluccas rail to the three spanishspeaking individuals who stood on deck stretching out their arms to receive me they were very careful not to hurt me unnecessarily during the process of transfer from which circumstance i derived a certain amount of comfort the inference being that whatever might be their motive in thus seizing me no bodily harm to me was intended having safely transferred me from the canoe to the deck of the felucca my abductors next conveyed me below to the hot stuffy little cabin of the craft where outstretched upon a locker that was barely long enough to accommodate my length they left me without a word and returned to the deck carefully closing the doors and drawing over the slide at the head of the companion ladder and then as carefully closing both flaps of the hitherto open skylight this done their conversation with caesar and his satellite was continued in a leisurely desultory fashion for about half an hourthe burden of it being unintelligible to me through the closed skylightwhen i heard the two negroes descend into their canoe and shove off wishing the others a quick and pleasant passage then followed some leisurely movements on deck accompanied by the throwing down of a rope or two the creaking of blocks and parralls a few quiet ejaculations as of men pulling and hauling the clink of windlass pawls the loud slatting of loose canvas in the strong landbreeze that was blowing and finallyas the latter sounds ceasedi felt the felucca heel strongly over to port and heard the increasing gurgle and wash of water along the bends and under the counter of the little craft accompanied by an occasional call from forard to the helmsman by which i knew that we were under way and standing down the harbour toward port royal by and by i felt the felucca come upright there was a warning cry on deck a sudden violent flap of canvas overhead and the felucca heeled slightly over to starboard by which i knew that she had squared away jibed over and was running out of the harbour a few minutes later i felt her beginning to rise and fall over the gathering seas as she skimmed away off the land the motion steadily grew stronger merging into a swift floating forward rush as the seas came up astern of her followed by a long dragging pause as the crest swept past and presently the companion slide was pushed back the doors at the head of the ladder were flung open and a manone of those who had helped to convey me belowdescended into the cabin phew senor you are warm down here he exclaimed in perfect english as he stood gazing thoughtfully down upon me i could of course make no reply as i was still gagged but he probably observed the dreadful condition that the gag and the lashings round my wrists and ankles had reduced me to for he continued as he stooped over me we are now at sea and as it is therefore impossible for you to raise an alarm or effect your escape i think i may safely make you a little more comfortable you look terribly distressed amigo and my orders are imperative that you are to be delivered safe and sound there as he removed the gag and cast off the lashings that ought to be more to your liking for pitys sake i ejaculated give me something to drink that horrible gag has all but suffocated me something to drink with pleasure senor what shall it beplain water or grog as you english call it i think it had better be grog for i cannot recommend the water we carry in our scuttlebutt so saying he went to a little cupboard alongside the companion ladder and produced therefrom a water monkey two tin pannikins and a bottle of rum all of which he placed on the cabin table there senor help yourself freely the little josefa and all that she contains is yours thanks senor i replied as i poured out with a shaking hand and benumbed fingers a generous modicum of rum filling up the pannikin with evilsmelling water i drink to our better acquaintance so saying i emptied the pannikin at a gulp and set it down upon the table and now senor i continued as my companion in turn proceeded to help himself and to pledge me perhaps you will kindly inform me first whom i have the honour to address secondly why i have been brought aboard this felucca and thirdly to what place you propose to convey me assuredly senor answered the spaniard it will afford me much happiness to gratify so very natural and reasonable a request in the first place senor i am your excellencys most humble servant juan dominguez captain of this felucca in the next place you are here by order of my excellent friend and patron don pedro morillo captain of the brigantine guerrilla and in the third place i am conveying youalso by don pedros ordersto cariacou an island which i understand you have already visited under certain memorable circumstances so that was it was it i was kidnapped not in accordance with some wild scheme of the spaniards to cripple our too active navy by robbing it of every officer that they could lay hands upon but in order that a cowardly bloodthirsty pirate might at leisure and in safety wreak his revenge upon me for the injury that i in the exercise of my duty had done him speaking in all frankness i do not believe i am a coward but i confess that the information thus calmly communicated to me by this spaniardwho was most probably a naturalised british subject caused my blood to run cold for i had heard quite enough of morillo to feel tolerably well assured that if his motive in causing me to be kidnapped was revenge he would not be satisfied with merely shooting me or stabbing me to the heart he would undoubtedly exercise his utmost ingenuity to render my passage out of this world as lingering and painful as possible and from all accounts he was quite an adept in the art of torture you seem disturbed at my intelligence amigo remarked my companion gazing upon me with a smile of amusement well he continued perhaps you have cause to be who knows i have heard that it was you who taking advantage of my friends absence at sea visited cariacou and destroyed poor morillos batteries and buildings there carrying off his brig and everything else that you and your crew could lay hands upon i hope for your sake that morillo was misinformed and that you will be able to demonstrate to his complete satisfaction your entire freedom from all complicity in that very illadvised and malicious transaction he may then be content to simply hang you at his yardarm but if you fail to convince himphew i sincerely pity you i do indeed senor thanks very much retorted i with the best attempt at sarcasm that i could musterfor i began to perceive that this fellow was amusing himself by endeavouring to frighten me and i did not intend to afford him very much gratification in that wayyour pity is infinitely comforting to me especially as it is evident to me that the feeling is genuine may i ask whether your share in this present transaction is undertaken purely out of friendship for morillo or is it being carried out upon a business basis well to be strictly truthful there is a little of both answered dominguez why do you inquire if it is not an indiscreet question now thought i i wonder whether this question of his is intended to indicate that he is open to a bribea bribe to put me ashore again safe and sound provided that i make him a sufficiently liberal offer perhaps the attempt may be worth making it will at all events enable me to judge what are my chances so far as he is concerned so i replied to be candid with you friend dominguez it occurred to me that you had undertaken this little adventure as much with the object of turning a more or less honest penny as for any other reason now supposing that i should experience any difficulty in satisfying morillo upon the point that you just now referred to what do you imagine will be the result something exceedingly unpleasant for me i assume since you were good enough to express pity for me something exceedingly unpleasant he repeated with a laugh well yes that is one way of putting it certainly but it is a very mild way so ridiculously mild that it suggests no idea of what was in my mind when i said i pitied you flaying alive is unpleasant so is being roasted alive over a slow fire so is gradual dismembermenta finger or a toe at a time then a hand or a foot and so on until only the trunk remainsall these are unpleasant exceedingly so i should imagine from what i have seen of the behaviour of those who have undergone those operations at my friends hand but in the contingency you just now suggested i fancy that morillo would do his best to devise something considerably betteror worse whichever you please to call itfor you i shuddered and a feeling of horrible sickness swept over me strive as i would i could not help it as this inhuman wretch spoke with evident gusto of the torments to which i mightfailing morillos ability to devise still greater refinements of crueltybe subjected but by the time that he had finished speaking i had succeeded in rallying my courage sufficiently to remark thanks your reply to my question leaves nothing to be desired in the way of lucidity now supposing i should happen to feel some repugnance to those delicate attentions on morillos part that you have just alluded to what inducement would be sufficient to persuade you to bout ship and land me on the wharf at kingston instead of at cariacou ah replied dominguez that is a question that is not to be answered offhand there are several points that occur to me as requiring careful consideration before i could name the sum that would induce me to act as you wish of course you will understand that i have no personal animus against you you have never injured me and therefore i have no feeling of revenge to gratify by delivering you into morillos power but on the other hand morillo is my friend and i am always glad to oblige him when i can particularly when as in the present case i am well paid for it now if i were to act as you suggest i should be thwarting instead of obliging him i should convert him from a friend into an enemy and i think that you are now in a position to understand what that means it means that i should be compelled to disappear as completely as though the ground had opened and swallowed me because it is one of morillos characteristics that while he is a staunch and generous friend he is also a bitter and relentless enemy he never forgives so long as his enemy lives he will never rest until he has been revenged upon him and this reminds me that if you and i should succeed in coming to an arrangement you must not regard the matter between yourself and morillo as settled i warn you that you will have to maintain a ceaseless watch for so long as you and he live he will never relax his efforts to get you into his power afloat and with a greatly superior force you may reckon yourself to be reasonably safe but ashoreno very well now what i have told you will enable you to understand my position in relation to this matter at present i am his friend but i have his enemy in my power and if i aid and abet that enemy to escape i become his enemy which will necessitate my prompt retreat to the other side of the world to begin life afresh with the haunting feeling that go where i will and do what i may i am never safe that alone points to a necessary demand on my part of a considerable suma very considerable sumfrom you as compensation for the many serious inconveniences and dangers that must inevitably follow upon my falling in with your proposal but that is not all there is my mate miguel and the lad luis forard both of them would require some very substantial inducement to lead them to fall in with our views altogether i should say that what you propose would probably cost youwell at least ten thousand pounds ten thousand pounds i ejaculated nonsense man you must be dreaming why i could no more raise ten thousand pounds than i could fly no he queried coolly not even to save yourself from not even to save myself from the utmost refinement of cruelty that your friend morillo is capable of devising i answered decisively pardon me senor but i can scarcely believe you retorted dominguez with that hateful sneering smile of his you have been exceptionally fortunate in the matter of prizes since your arrival in these waters and i feel convinced that in prize money alone you must now have a very handsome sum standing to your credit then if i am correctly informed you have made many friends you are for instance a great favourite with the admiral who would doubtless be willing to advance a very considerable sum to help you out of your present exceedingly disagreeable predicament and i have no doubt there are others who would be equally willing to help you if your position were clearly laid before them but man alive i cannot do it i exclaimed angrily so far as prize money is concerned i suppose three thousand pounds is the very utmost that i possess and as for the admiral i am no more to him than any other officer and i am certain that he would absolutely refuse to advance a single pennypiece for such a purpose as you suggest to do so would simply be offering an inducement to youand others like youto kidnap officers and then hold them to ransom but i tell you what it is i continued you may rest assured of this that if any harm befalls meif in short you deliver me into morillos powerthe admiral will make you suffer as severely for it as morillo himself could possibly do so there you are between two fires and if you care for my opinion it is that the admiral is likely to prove a worse enemy to you than even morillo over this business that possibly might be the case if the admiral happened to discover that i have been implicated in it replied my companion with exasperating composure but then you see he never will i have taken every possible precaution against that how about caesar and peter the two negroes who brought me aboard here i inquired pshaw answered dominguez impatiently do you suppose they would inform against me not they why they are bothwell never mind what they are except that i feel perfectly safe so far as they are concerned very well i retorted time will show whether your confidence in them is well founded or not meanwhile my position is such that three thousand pounds is the outside figure i can offer you as my ransom and you may take it or leave it as you please then i fear amigo that your days are numbered replied dominguez composedly as he rose from his seat preparatory to returning on deck i am sorry for you he continued very sorry but i must think of myself before all else and three thousand is not nearly tempting enough possibly when you have had a little longer to think it over you will be able to see your way to make a very considerable advance upon that sum there is plenty of time the josefa is a grand little ship but she has one fault she is slow and i do not expect that we shall reach cariacou in less than a full week you have therefore six or seven days before you in which to consider the matter and should you see your way to raise the ten thousand at any time before we sight the island i shall be happy to talk with you again meanwhile there is your bunk will you turn in at once or would you prefer to take a turn on deck first thanks answered i with alacrity delighted to discover that i was not to be confined to the cabin i think i will go on deck for half an hour or so to get a breath of fresh air it is rather close down here as you will returned dominguez amicably enough i have no fear of your attempting to escape you are scarcely likely i think to go overboard and offer yourself as a meal to the sharks do you smoke i can recommend these as he drew from a locker a box of cigars i helped myself to one mechanically and lit it dominguez following my example and then politely offering me precedence up the companion ladder i accepted the courtesy and made my way somewhat stiffly up the steep steps for my limbs were still cramped from the compression of the ligatures wherewith i had been bound after what i had passed through it was an inexpressible relief to me to find myself once more breathing the free pure air of heaven with the starspangled sky arching grandly overhead it was a brilliantly fine nightor morning rather for it was by this time past two oclock amthe sky cloudless save for a small shred of thin woollike vapour skimming rapidly athwart the stars the trade wind was blowing a moderate breeze and the felucca was bruising along on an easy bowline with long swinging plunges and soarings over the low jetblack glistening surges at a pace of some five and a half knots perhaps with a perfect thunder of roaring breaking seas under her bluff bows and a belt of winking sparkling seafire a couple of fathoms wide sweeping past her lee rail and swirling into the broad short wake that she trailed behind her the land was still clearly in sight on our port quarter the range of the liguanea mountains towering high into the starlit sky and gradually sloping away to the eastward in the direction of morant point beside dominguez and myself there was but one other figure visible on deck that of the man at the helma long thin weedylooking figure so far as i could make out in the ghostly starlight but one who had evidently used the sea for some time if one might judge by the easy floating poise of his figure on the plunging deck as he stood on the weather side of the tiller with the tiller rope lightly grasped in his right hand swaying rhythmically to the leaps and plunges of the little hooker as dominguez followed me out on deck he stepped aft to the small dimly lighted binnacle glanced into it made some brief remark in a low tone to the silent helmsman walked forward and took a long look ahead and on both bows and then returning aft excused himself to me for turning in upon the plea that it would soon be his watch on deck and so dived below and left me left thus to myself i fell to mechanically pacing the short deck of the felucca for a few minutes smoking thoughtfully the while and turning over in my mind the disquieting conversation that had just passed between dominguez and myself then my gaze happening to wander aft to the solitary figure at the tiller i sauntered aft and endeavoured to strike up a conversation with him the fellow however proved to be so boorish and saturnine in his manner that i quickly abandoned the attempt and pitching my halfsmoked cigar over the rail retired below and tumbled all standing into the bunk that dominguez had indicated as mine where despite the food for serious reflection that the occurrences of the night afforded me i soon fell into a sound sleep the week that succeeded my abduction was so utterly barren of events that it may be passed over with the mere remark that throughout the whole of the time we had perfect weather with a steady moderate trade wind under the impulsion of which the felucca bruised along upon her proper course reeling off her five to six knots per hour with the regularity of a clock and during the whole of that time strange to say we sighted not a single sail i had been by no means idle during this time however as may well be supposed for every day at noon saw the little hooker a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty miles nearer the spot where if nothing happened in the interim to prevent it i was to be delivered into the hands of a fiend in human form whose hatred of me was so intense and vindictive that he had taken a considerable amount of trouble and put himself to considerable expense merely to get me into his power and wreak a bloodcurdling revenge upon me but to tamely submit to be thus handed over to morillos tender mercies was the very last thing that i contemplated i had every reason to believe that the picture drawn by dominguez of the form which morillos revenge would probably take was a tolerably truthful one and while i was prepared to face death in any form at a moments notice in the way of duty i had not the remotest intention of permitting myself to be tortured to death merely to gratify the ferocity of a piratical outlaw if i could possibly help it so for the first three or four days i devoted myself wholly to the task of endeavouring to bribe my custodians to forego their intention of handing me over to morillo and to land me upon the nearest british territory instead but i by and by made the discovery that my efforts in this direction were doomed to failure dominguez was clearly so profoundly impressed with morillos power and with his tenacious memory for injuries that the conviction had borne itself in upon him that if he yielded to my persuasions it would be absolutely necessary to his safety not only to buy over the whole of those engaged upon the business of my abduction but also to place the whole width of the globe between himself and morillo and to execute these little matters satisfactorily would according to his own calculations necessitate the disbursement on my part of the modest amount of ten thousand pounds sterling a sum which as i explained to him over and over again it was utterly beyond my power to raise it was not that dominguez was grasping or avaricious it was simply that he regarded a certain course of action necessary to his own safety and wellbeing in the event of his consenting to yield to my wishes and as he had no intention of suffering any pecuniary or other loss or damage by so yielding it appeared to him that the thing could not be done under the sum he had named and there was the whole matter in a nut shell the attempt at bribery having thus resulted in failure there remained to me but one other alternative that of a resort to force myself against dominguez and the two men who formed his crew for come what would i was firmly resolved never to suffer myself to be delivered alive into morillos hands if it was my doom to die at the end of this adventure i would die fighting so while feigning to yield to the inexorable force of circumstances i began to meditate upon the most promising means whereby to escape from the exceedingly unpleasant dilemma in which i found myself involved and after giving the whole matter my most careful attention i came to the conclusion that my simplest plan would be to takeor attempt to takethe felucca from dominguez and his associates and having done so make for the nearest british harbour chapter fourteen i seize the felucca having come to this conclusion the next thing was to devise a plan of some sort but upon attempting to do this i soon discovered that it was wholly impossible so much depending upon circumstances over which i had no control whatever that i might have formed a dozen plans with never a chance to carry any one of them through the only thing therefore was to await an opportunity and be prepared to seize it the moment that it presented itself perhaps the most difficult part of my task was to preserve all through this trying time such a demeanour as would effectually conceal from dominguez the fact that i was alert and on the watch for something but i managed it somehow by leading him to believe that rather than suffer torture i had determined to provoke morillo into killing me outright a plan of which dominguez highly approved while expressing his doubts as to the possibility of its achievement in suggestingas i find i have in the above paragraphthat i had no plan whatever i have perhaps conveyed a wrong impression what i intended the reader to understand was that i had no finished scheme complete in all its details to depend upon a plan of a sort i certainly had but it was of the vaguest and most nebulous kind consisting in nothing more specific than the mere determination to seize the felucca at the first favourable opportunity and sail her single handed to the nearest british port but of how this was to be accomplished i had not the most remote idea the only point upon which i was at all clear was that it would be inadvisable for two reasons to make my attempt too early my first reason for arriving at this conclusion being that the longer i deferred action the nearer should we be to barbadoes for which island i intended to make while my second reason was that should dominguez perchance suspect me of any sinister design the longer the delay on my part the less suspicious and watchful would he be likely to become fortunately for my purpose we were making rather a long passage of it the little hooker not being by any means a particularly weatherly craft consequently our first landfall on our sixth day outwas the curious shoal and accompanying group of rocky islets called los roques or the roccas off la guayra close to which we hove about and stood to the northward on the starboard tack this occurred during the early morning about an hour after sunrise the trade wind was then blowing steadily but moderately and the weather was as usual fine and clear toward noon however it became noticeable that the wind was very decidedly softening down and when dominguez took his meridian observation of the sun we were not going more than four knots it was the custom aboard the felucca to dine in the middle of the day as soon as dominguez had worked out his calculations the skipper and i dining first and then going on deck while miguel the mate took his meal while miguel was below dominguez usually took the tiller but of late i had occasionally relieved him with a vague idea that possibly it might at some opportune moment be an advantage for me to be at the helm and as it happened i chanced to be first on deck on this particular day and without any premeditation went aft and relieved miguel so that when a few minutes later dominguez came on deck he found me in possession of the tiller and staring intently at some floating object about a quarter of a mile away and slightly on our weather bow that kept rising into view and vanishing again as the long lazy undulations of the swell swept past it what are you staring at so hard senor courtenay do you see anything demanded dominguez as he sauntered aft toward me from the companion cigar in mouth yes answered i replying to his last question first there is something out there but what it is i cannot for the life of me make out therethere it is you can see it now lifting on the back of the swell about a point on the weather bow ay he answered eagerly i see it and unless i am greatly mistaken i know what it is keep her away a little senor if you please let her go off a point i do not want to pass too close to that object if it be what i imagine and pray what do you imagine it to be senor if one may be permitted to ask the question inquired i as i gave a pull upon the tiller rope and kept the felucca away as requested a turtle a sleeping turtle and an unusually fine one too answered dominguez in a low voice as he stood staring out away over the weather bow with one hand shading his eyes while the other held his smouldering cigar as dominguez spoke a little thrill of sudden excitement swept over me for i thought just so i know what he means he intends to make an effort to capture that turtleprobably by means of the boatand if he does my chance will have come but i steadied myself instantly and returned in a perfectly nonchalant tone of voice and supposing that it be as you imagine a sleeping turtle what then senor hush senor i pray you replied dominguez in a low excited whisper keep silence you will soon see presently the object lifted into view again only some ten or a dozen fathoms away and as it went drifting quietly past we got so distinct and prolonged a view of it as to render its identity unquestionable it was as dominguez had imagined a sleeping turtle of enormous size holy virgin what a magnificent fellow ejaculated dominguez as the creature vanished in the trough on our weather quarter we must have him senor if we lower the sail so that the felucca cannot drift far will you have any objection to being left by yourself for a few minutes while miguel and i and the boy go after that turtle with the boat he demanded eagerly so my chance had come if i could but so demean myself for a few minutes as not to arouse the suspicions of this man by any illtimed exhibition of eagerness or too earnest assent to his proposal i took a second or two to steady my nerves and then asked cannot we all go in the boat together i have never yet seen a turtle captured and should greatly like to witness the operation no senor i am sorry but it is out of the question answered dominguez hastily the boat is but small and i am very doubtful whether she will be capable of carrying three of us and that great bruteif we are so fortunate as to catch him i would send miguel and luis only but that i know they would not be able to secure him unaided we shall not be gone long senor and the felucca cannot drift far in this light breeze and with so little swell running no i suppose not i answered with just the slightest imaginable show of reluctance all right senor i continued away with you by all means i should be sorry to spoil your sport for you shall i lower the sail not just for a moment senor answered dominguez we must creep far enough away that the flapping of the canvas may not wake our friend yonder or we shall lose him then poking his head through the open skylight he called softly in spanish miguel miguel come on deck at once friend there is a large turtle out here floating fast asleep and i want to catch him miguel mumbled a reply of some sortwhat it was i could not telland dominguez briskly withdrew his head from the skylight and sprang upon the rail looking away out on the weather quarter for the turtle it was still visible at intervals but fully a quarter of a mile astern now there that will do we are far enough away now i think he muttered stepping lightly off the feluccas low rail to the deck here miguel as that worthy emerged from the companion wiping his lips with the back of his hand help me to lower the sail quick and you senor courtenay will you do me the favour to haul taut the sheet as the sail comes down so that it may not flap about and make more noise than we can help certainly i answered cheerfully letting go the tiller rope and seizing the fall of the sheet lower away whenever you like the single lateen sail stretched upon its long heavy tapering yard came sliding down the mast rustling heavily despite all that i could do to prevent it and presently it lay quiescent stretched along the deck with the after yardarm projecting far over the taffrail i sprang up on the companion slide to see whether the turtle was still visible and was rejoiced to find that he wasfloating an unconspicuous and unrecognisable object by this timenearly half a mile away apparently quite undisturbed by the rustling sounds of the canvas is he still there senor demanded dominguez in an eager half whisper i nodded pointing silently to where i could see the creature appearing at intervals on the ridges and backs of the swell good ejaculated dominguez now where is luis oh here you are as that individual poked his head up through the forescuttle to see what was going on his still working jaws betraying that he too had been disturbed during the process of consuming the midday meal just look into the boat luis my son and see that the oars and baler are in her while miguel and i unship the gangway can you still see him senor courtenay yes i replied he is still there but a long way off now i think i had better keep my eye on him and direct you by an occasional wave of the hand as you pull down or you will have a job to find him thank you answered dominguez if it will not be troubling you too much i shall be greatly obliged oh no trouble at all responded i i should stand here to watch the fun in any case dominguez and miguel soon managed between them to unship the gangway which done they lifted the boata mere dinghyout of her chocks on top of the main hatchway slued her bows round toward the gangway and ran her over the side fisherman fashion the three of them immediately jumping in and shoving off from the feluccas side dominguez who steered the boat looking round at me from time to time for directions as to the way in which he was to head the boat released now from the scrutiny of the spaniards eyes it was no longer necessary for me to maintain that painful selfrestraint which had cost me so severe an effort in order that i might not by look or gesture arouse the ghost of a suspicion as to my intentions so while i continued to mechanically wave the boat to the right or the left as circumstances demanded i now gave my mind to the task of determining the details of my proposed line of action to begin with i was fully resolved that dominguez and his companions having left the felucca they should never again return to her if i could possibly prevent it at the right moment i would make sail upon the little craft and head her for barbadoes leaving them to get ashore as best they could and here my conscience pricked me a little for i had already had experience of a voyage in an open boat and knew what it meant on the other hand however my life was at stake for it had by this time become perfectly apparent to me that unless i could raise the sum of ten thousand pounds demanded by dominguezwhich was a simple impossibilitythat individual would most certainly deliver me over to morillo in which case there was every reason to believe that i should die a cruel and lingering death of tormentwhich i considered myself quite justified in avoiding by every means in my power moreover we were not very far from the land the roccas were only some twentyfive miles away at the utmost and could easily be reached by dominguez before midnight and the weather was fine and the water smooth the voyage of the dinghy was therefore not likely to be of a very adventurous or dangerous character so that by taking possession of the felucca and turning the spaniard and his companions adrift i should only be inflicting upon them a very mild punishment for their unlawful seizure of my person especially when the cruel object of that seizure came to be taken into consideration i would not leave them however wholly without provisions and water if i could help it my first thought therefore was how i might be able to convey to them a small supply of each without affording them an opportunity to regain possession of the felucca and after a few minutes deliberation i thought i could see a way by which this might be accomplished meanwhile the dinghy went drifting rapidly away astern propelled by miguel and luis who stood up at their oars looking ahead while dominguez stood up in the sternsheets looking over their shoulders and occasionally glancing back at me for guidance at length however he caught sight for himself of the turtle and thenceforward kept his attention wholly fixed upon it as soon as i became fully satisfied of this i jumped down off the companion for the moment for action on my part had now arrived the first thing was to get sail upon the felucca again and to masthead the long heavy lateen yard with its big sail was no easy task for one man there was however a little winch affixed to the fore part of the mast chiefly used for this very purpose so upon jumping down off the companion my first act was to assure myself that the mainsheet was securely belayed after which i rushed forward and setting handtaut the main halliard threw two or three turns of the fall round the barrel of the winch i then ran aft again and sprang once more upon the companion to see what was happening aboard the dinghy she was by this time drawing pretty close up to the sleeping turtle and the whole attention of the trio aboard her appeared to be absorbed in the effort to get alongside the creature without waking him now therefore was my time for action i accordingly dashed forward to the mast and shipping the crank handle of the winch hove away upon the halliard for dear life the yard and sail crept slowlyoh how very slowlyup the mast the canvas rustling in the wind noisily enough to wake the dead still more to reach the ears and give the alarm to those in the dinghy but having once begun there was nothing now for it but to go on with the work and get the yard mastheaded and good way upon the felucca before those in the dinghy could pull back and get alongside at length after what seemed to be an interminable timealthough the rapid click click of the pawls told me that in reality i was accomplishing my task very smartlyi managed to get the yard some two thirds of the way up the mast when i took a turn with the halliards and once more rushed aft to get a look at the boat as i had expected the slatting of the canvas had reached and given them the alarm and the boat was now round and heading back after the felucca miguel and dominguez straining frantically at the oars while luis had taken the place of the latter at the tiller the little craft was being pushed furiously alongas i could tell by the manner in which her nose dipped and the white foam boiled round it at every stroke of the oars but the felucca was gathering way and with the wind square abeam and her imperfectly hoisted sail ramping full seemed to be quite holding her own i seized the tiller and kept her away another point carefully watching both her progress and that of the boat and ten minutes later i experienced the satisfying conviction that she was steadily leaving her pursuers once fully assured of this i lashed the tiller and once more running forward completed the setting of the sail when i let the little hooker come up to full and by the next matter demanding my attention was that of conveying a supply of food and water to the luckless occupants of the dinghy without permitting them to come alongside there were several small breakers of fresh water on deck constituting the supply of the felucca and one of these would be ample for the occupants of the dinghy until they could get ashore or were picked upindeed the boat had not capacity for more than one they were all carefully bunged with cork and canvas so i could safely launch one of them overboard for the dinghy to pick up i therefore proceeded to unlash one and roll it toward the still open gangway and then came the question of provisions there was a large washdeck tub on the forecastle which i knew to be watertight and it struck me that this might be utilised to float the dry provisions until the dinghy could pick them up sofirst making sure of the position of the boati dived below and routed out of dominguez bunk a large canvas dittybag that i had often seen there and emptying out the clothing which it contained proceeded to fill it with bread and such other provisions as i could most readily lay hands on this when full i tied securely at the neck and took on deck placing it in the washdeck tub after i had dragged the latter conveniently close to the gangway then going below again i brought up three plates some knives and forks three tin pannikins and a few other oddments that i knew would be useful and placed them in the washdeck tub with the provisions then when i thought that all was ready the boats mast and sail caught my eye as it lay upon the hatchwayhaving been flung there by luis when he cleared out the boatand this i determined they should also have as while quite resolved to abandon them i was most anxious that they should be afforded every opportunity to reach the shore alive and well then everything being ready i once more ran aft to see whereabout the boat now was she was a long way asternquite two milesand as i looked it appeared as though dominguez had already given up the pursuit for the boat did not seem to be moving her occupants were however all on their feet staring hard in my direction and waving their arms frantically i therefore put the helm up and jibing round proceeded to run down toward them this was rather a risky thing to do but i thought that with care i could accomplish what i wanted and still evade recapture when they saw me returning for themas they doubtless thoughtthey started pulling again for a minute or two then once more lay upon their oars watching on my part i also was careful to keep a keen watch upon their movements my intention being to pass within hailing distance of them if possible without giving them a chance to dash alongside that this was their intention i soon became aware for as the felucca swept down toward them i could see that their oars were in the water and that they were quietly manoeuvring to get the dinghy headon and as close as possible to the spot over which they expected me to pass but i was not to be quite so easily caught napping so carefully measuring the distance with my eye i again put the helm up just at the right moment and sweeping past the dinghy within half a dozen fathoms hailed her discomfited occupants somewhat to this effect dinghy ahoy i am not going to allow you to come alongside again so i would recommend you to make the best of your way to the roccas which as you know bear southsouthwest some twentyfive miles distant i have no doubt that if you can reach them you are certain to be taken off sooner or later meanwhile i do not wish you to starve so i am going to launch overboard some provisions and water for you to pick up also the boats mast and sail the weather promises to hold fine so you ought to make a fairly good and quick passage of it meanwhile the moment that dominguez became aware of what i was doing he swept the boat round with a couple of powerful strokes of his oar and once again they gave chase with might and main dominguez at the same time shouting to me that if i would allow them to return on board they would land me wherever i pleased and never ask so much as a pennypiece by way of ransom could i have trusted the fellow i would willingly have acceded to his proposal but i could not he had already shown himself to be so coldly callous so absolutely indifferent to the fearful fate to which he had undertaken to consign me that i felt it would be the sheerest most insane folly to place myself in his power again i therefore kept the felucca away until i found that she was rather more than holding her own in the race when i once more lashed the tiller and calling to dominguez to look out for the things that i was about to launch overboard ran to the gangway and first successfully set the washdeck tub afloat then rolled the breaker of water out through the open gangway and finally sent the mast and sail adrift after which i returned to the tiller and watched the process of picking up the several articles as i gradually brought the felucca to her former course closehauled upon the starboard tack chapter fifteen heavy weather the provisions water and the mast and sail were all successfully secured by the occupants of the boat after which dominguez to my great satisfaction made sail to the southward and in another hour his tiny speck of canvas had vanished beyond the horizon this left me free to attend to my own necessities without further anxiety on the score of being boarded i therefore once more lashed the tiller in such a position that the felucca would practically steer herself and then having first taken a good look round to see if anything was in sight proceeded below found the chart which dominguez had been using and ascertained the bearing and distance of the island of barbadoes a careful study of this chart revealed the rather disconcerting fact that taking into consideration the circumstance that barbadoes was to windward while jamaica lay well to leeward of me it would be almost as quick to return to the latter as it would be to beat out to the former on the other hand however there was this to be taken into consideration that on a wind the felucca might be made to practically steer herself as i had already ascertained by experiment while it was quite certain that she could not be persuaded to do any such thing while running off the wind moreover by ratching far enough to the northward to enable the felucca to fetch barbadoes on the next tack i should be stretching away in a fairly promising direction for being picked up by one of the many british cruisers that were watching the principal outlets from the caribbean to the atlantic after mature deliberation therefore i arrived at the conclusion that i could not do better than adhere to my original determination of trying for barbadoes the next question was how i was to dispose of my time or rather what portion of my time it would be best to devote to sleep one fact stared me in the face at the outset namely that until i was once more safe ashore i should have to make shift with the smallest possible amount of sleep the care of the felucca calling for my almost constant attention consequently i should have to so arrange my periods of rest that they would coincide with the times when the felucca could best be left to take care of herself these periods would obviously occur during the hours of daylight when it would be possible to take a good look round and if nothing was in sight or likely to approach within dangerous proximity for an hour or two lie down on deck in the shadow of the sail snatch a short nap and then take another look round repeating the process as often as possible throughout the day in order that i might be fresh and lively for an unbroken watch through the hours of darkness having arrived at this conclusion i forthwith proceeded to carry out my plan and found it to act fairly well the only drawback being that for want of watching the felucca evinced a tendency to run a little off the wind while when i attempted to remedy this by lashing the helm an inch or two less aweather she erred to about the same extent in the other direction by gradually comingto until her sail was all shaking and i had to jump hurriedly to my feet and jam the helm hard up to prevent her from coming round upon the other tack little by little however i remedied both these defects so that by sunset i had her going along just full and by almost as steadily as though i had been standing at the tiller and steering her meanwhile the wind which had been very moderate all day with a distinctly perceptible disposition to become still lighter had gradually softened down until the little hooker was barely doing her three knots per hour while the sea had dwindled away until only the long regular undulations of the swell were left these being overrun by a wrinkling of those small uncrested wavelets that frequently precede the settingin of a calm yet there was no reason why a calm should be anticipated for i was in a region where the trade wind blows all the year round except when for a few hours it gives place to one of the hurricanes that occasionally sweep over the caribbean with devastating effect could it be possible that such a phenomenon was about to happen there was no especial reason why it might not be so for it was the hurricane season but there was no sign in the heavens of any approaching atmospheric disturbanceunless indeed that faint scarcely perceptible hazy appearance up aloft had a sinister meaning when the sun had declined to within a few minutes of his setting i shinned up the mast and took a good look round but there was nothing in sight waiting therefore until the sun had sunk below the horizon which he did in the midst of a thin smoky haze through which the rayless luminary glowed like a ball of redhot ironi descended to the deck and forthwith set to work to prepare myself such a supper as the meagre resources of the felucca permitted after discussing which as the stars were shining brilliantly overhead and the little craft was steering herself i again stretched myself out on deck to snatch another nap i this time slept for several hours for when i was at length awakened by the rustling of the sail it was close upon midnight starting to my feet i first glanced aloft and then around me but there was nothing to be seen the darkness being so profound that it needed but a very small stretch of the imagination to persuade me that it might absolutely be felt it was the thick opaque darkness that i remembered having once experienced when as a boy i went exploring some devonshire caverns and clumsily allowed my candle to fall and become extinguished in a pool of water it seemed to press upon me to become palpable to the touch to so closely wrap me about that my very breathing became impeded and oh how frightfully hot and close it was the air was absolutely stagnant and the slight draught created by the uneasy motion of the felucca seemed to positively scorch the skin moreover there was no dew the deckplanks the rail everything that my hand came into contact with was dry and warm i groped my way to the rail and looked abroad over the surface of the ocean and it will perhaps conveyat all events to those who have used the seasome idea of the intensity of the darkness when i say that not the faintest glimmer of reflected light came to me from the polished undulations of the slowcreeping swell the water however was highly phosphorescent for alongside the felucca and all round her as she rolled and pitched with a quick jerky uneasy motion there extended a narrow band or cloud of faint greenishblue seafire in the midst of which flashed and glittered millions of tiny stars interspersed here and there with less luminous patches in the forms of rings and discs that vanished and grew into view again at quick intervals in the most weird and uncanny manner i groped my way to the companion and from thence below into the little cabin where i lighted the lamp and seated myself at the table well under its cheerful if somewhat smoky beams for the gravelike darkness of the deck had oppressed me with a feeling very nearly akin to horror and even the dull yellow light of the lamp seemed inexpressibly cheerful in comparison with it there was no barometer aboard the felucca so i had nothing to guide me to the meaning of the weather portents but i was convinced that something out of the commonsomething more than a mere thundersquallwas brewing and if so i should probably have my hands full in taking care of the felucca with nobody to help me still so awkward a condition of affairs was preferable to that of being delivered over to morillo for him to work his fiendish will upon me the cabin was much too hot to be comfortable so having quickly conquered the feeling of depression produced by the darkness that had preceded the lighting of the cabin lamp i helped myself to one of dominguez excellent cigars and lighting it went on deck where the dull gleam of the lamp issuing from the small glazed skylight now made quite a pleasant little patch of yellow radiance on the deck and bulwarks immediately adjacent i was by this time broad awake having secured all the rest and sleep i just then needed so i fell to pacing to and fro over the small patch of illuminated deck determined to watch the matter out i might have been thus engaged for about an hour when i became aware that the darkness was no longer so densely and oppressively profound as it had been there was just the faintest imaginable gleam of light in the sky whereby it was possible to barely distinguish that the firmament was packed with vast piling masses of heavy menacing cloud very gradually the light strengthened assuming as it did so a lowering ruddy tint until in the course of half an hour the whole sky had the appearance that is seen when it reflects a great but distant conflagration and now i knew of a surety that a hurricane was brewing for that fearful ruddy light in the sky was the selfsame appearance that i had once before beheld when in the altheas gig i had been attempting to make my way to bermuda there was no mistaking the sign for it was one that once seen could never be forgotten and now the stormfiend having unfurled his fiery banner and thus given warning of impending war my time of inaction was over for there was plenty to do before the felucca could be considered as prepared to engage in the coming struggle and at the best the preparation could only be a partial one for the craft was not only small she was old crazy and miserably weak for the ordeal that lay before her and it was not in my power to remedy so serious a defect as tint all that i could do was to take in the great lateen sail and secure it and substitute for it if i could some very much smaller piece of canvas that while sufficient to save her from being overrun by the furious sea would not be too big for the felucca to carry fortunately there was such a sail on boarda small lugsail made of stout canvas and nearly newwhich was intended to be substituted for the lateen on those rare occasions when the little craft might be caught in heavy weather and this sail i now proceeded to drag up from below and bend to its yard after which i lowered away the lateen laid it fore and aft the deck and made it up securing it as well as i could by passing innumerable turns of a light warp round it after which i firmly lashed it to the bulwarks with as many lashings as i could find pins or cleats for my next job was to closereef and set the lug which i did with the aid of the winch and this done i went forward and beginning with the forescuttle proceeded to carefully batten down every opening in the deck bringing the cabin lamp on deck in order that i might have a sufficiency of light to work by the skylight i secured as well as i could by passing lashings over the cover to a couple of ringbolts conveniently placed in the deck and i finished up by backing the companion doors with a couple of stout pieces of timber which i sawed to the proper length and wedged in between the uprights rendering it practically impossible for the doors to be forced open by a sea while by drawing over the slide i could at the last moment effectually close all access to the cabin this completed my labours with which i was fairly well satisfied the only portion of my defences about which i had any serious doubt being the skylight the glazed panels of which might easily be smashed by a sea but i was obliged to take my chance of that being unable to find anything with which to protect them and now all that remained was to watch and wait nor had i to wait very long for when having completed my preparations i found time to again glance aloft at the frowning sky i observed that the heavy masses of fiery cloud that had hitherto seemed to be practically motionless so stealthy were their movements were now working with a restless writhing motion while ever and anon some small detached fragment of vapour would come sweeping rapidly out from the westward athwart the twisting masses as though caught and torn off from the main body by some sudden momentary partial but violent movement in the atmosphere these small scurrying fragments of cloud the vanguard of the approaching tempest rapidly increased in size and in number while the twisting and writhing of the great cloud masses momentarily grew more rapid and convulsive until it appeared as though the entire firmament were in the throes of mortal agony the suggestion soon becoming intensified by the arising in the atmosphere of low weird moaning sounds that at intervals rose and strengthened into a wail as of the spirits of drowned sailors lamenting the coming havoc and as the wailing sounds arose and grew in volume sudden stirrings in the stagnant air became apparent first in the form of exaggerated cats paws that smote savagely upon the glassy surface of the water scourging it into a sudden flurry of foam and then dying away again and then in sudden gusts that swept screaming past the felucca hither and thither sometimes high enough aloft to leave the water undisturbed at other times striking it and as it were rebounding from the surface leaving in its path streaks and patches of ruffled water that had scarcely time to subside ere another gust went howling past to leave them more disturbed than before these sudden scurryings of wind were the forerunners of the hurricane itself and only sprang up a short five minutes before the low hoarse murmur of the gale itself became audible as this sound arose i looked away to the westwardthe quarter from which it cameand saw by the faint sombre ruddy light of the unnaturally glowing sky a thin white line appear upon the horizon lengthening and thickening as i watched until it became a rushing wall of foam bearing down upon the felucca at terrific speed while behind it the heavens grew pitchy black and the murmur became a low deep roar and the roar grew in volume to a bellow and the bellow rose to an unearthly howl and the howl to a yelling shriek as the hurricane leapt at the feluccawhich happily was lying sternon to itand seized her in its grip causing the stout closereefed lugsail to fill with a report like that of a cannon and burying her bows deep in the creamy hissing smother ere she gathered way while the scudwater flew over her in blinding drenching sheets for a moment as i gripped the tiller convulsively i thought the little hooker was about to founder bows first but after a shuddering pause of a few breathless seconds of horrible suspense she gathered way and in another instant was flying before the gale like a frightened thing at a speed which i dare venture to say she had never before attained it was a wild scene in the midst of which i now found myself with the outburst of the gale the supernatural ruddy glow of the sky had suddenly faded to be succeeded by a frightful gloom which yet was not actual darkness for the whole surface of the sea had in a few brief seconds become a level sheet of boiling foam so strongly phosphorescent that it emitted light enough for me to see with tolerable distinctness the hull mast and sail of the felucca and to make out the position and character of the principal objects about her deck and this same weird ghostly light it probably was that reflected from the clouds enabled me also to discern their forms and to distinguish that they were no longer the rounded swelling masses that they had hitherto been but were now rent and tattered and ragged with the mad fury of the wind that had seized upon them and was dragging them at headlong speed athwart the arch of heaven the air too was full of spindrift to perhaps double the height of the feluccas mast and that too was luminous with a faint green misty light that imparted a weird unreal aspect to everything it shone upon an effect which was further heightened by the unearthly screaming and howling of the gale there was nothing for it but to keep the felucca running dead before the gale and fortunately for me this was by no means a difficult feat as the craft steered as is easily as a boatindeed she almost steered herself for the first halfhour or so nothing special occurred the hurricane continuing to blow as furiously as at its first mad outfly while the felucca sped before it as smoothly and steadily as though mounted on wheels and running upon a perfectly smooth and level road my only fear just then being that the mast would go over the bows or the sail be blown out of its boltropes the spar however was a good one and well stayed while the sail was practically new and the gear was good everything therefore held although i could feel that the little craft was straining to an alarming extent but about half an hour or thereabout after the gale first struck us a movement of the hull gentle and easy at first but rapidly increasingtold me that the sea was beginning to rise and soon after that my troubles commenced in earnest for the sea got up with astounding rapidity and as it did so the steering became increasingly difficult especially when the stern of the little hooker was thrown up on the crest of a sea at which periods for a few breathless seconds the rudder seemed to lose its grip on the water and the felucca was hurled irresistibly forward with her bows buried deep in the boiling foam while she seemed hesitating whether to broachto to starboard or to port either alternative of which would have been equally disastrous since in either case she must have assuredly capsized and gone down but by what seemed nothing short of a series of interpositions on the part of a merciful providence in every case just at the moment when a broachto seemed imminent and inevitable i felt the rudder take a fresh grip on the water and we were again safe until the next sea overtook us and so it continued throughout the remaining hours of that dreadful night with grim death threatening me at every upward heave of the little craft until at lengthafter what seemed to have been a very eternity of anxietythe day broke slowly and sullenly ahead by which time i had grown absolutely callous and indifferent my nerves had been kept in a state of acute tension so long that they seemed to have become incapable of any further feeling of any kind and i had ceased to care whether i survived or not or rather i had become so thoroughly convinced of the absolute impossibility of ultimate escape that there seemed to be nothing left worth worrying about moreover i was by this time utterly exhausted with the tremendous exertion of keeping the little craft running straight for so long a time for at the critical moments of which i have spoken the helm seemed to so nearly lose its power that it became necessary to jam the tiller hard over first to this side and then to that as the felucca seemed actually starting on a wild sheer that must have flung her broadsideon to the sea and so have abruptly finished her career and mine at the same moment thus was it with me when the dull and sullen dawn at length came oozing through the mirky blackness ahead gradually spreading along the horizon grey dismal and lowering bringing the tattered shapes and sooty hues of the wildly flying clouds into stronger relief and revealing a horizon serrated with the frenzied leapings of the angry waters that hissed and roared around the straining felucca chasing her like angry wolves about to leap upon their prey at first i thought i was alone in this scene of mad turmoil but presently when the light grew stronger as the felucca hung poised for an instant upon the crest of a foaming comber that boiled in over both rails amidships and flooded the deck kneedeep i caught a momentary glimpse of a large craft some nine miles away on the larboard bow running like myself before the gale she was hull down of course and very probably in the hollow of a sea when first i caught sight of her for i saw only the heads of her lower masts with the three topmasts rising above them the topgallant masts either struck or carried away she was running under a closereefed maintopsail and goosewinged foresail and i took her to be a frigate though whether one of our own or an enemy she was too far off for me to be enabled to judge but of whatever nationality she may have been she was undoubtedly a fast vessel for she soon ran out of sight although i estimated the speed of the felucca to be quite nine knots about an hour later i became sensible of a distinct abatement in the fury of the hurricane which in the course of another hour had still further moderated until it had become no more than an ordinary heavy gale yet so callous had i now become that the change afforded me scarcely any satisfaction i had grown so utterly indifferent that i had long ceased to care what happened but i was worn out with fatigue my limbs ached as though i had been severely beaten my hands were blistered and raw with the chafe of the tiller and my eyes were smarting for want of sleep rest i felt that i must have and that soon come what might of it so as the gale had moderated somewhat i determined to heaveto i believed the felucca would now bear the weight of her small closereefed lug even when brought to the wind and if she did notwell it did not matter nothing mattered just then except that i must have rest so the sail being set on the starboard side of the mast i watched my opportunity and availing myself of a smooth brought the felucca to on the starboard tack with no worse mishap than the shipping of a sea over the weather bowas she came up with her head pointing to windwardthat swept away the whole of the port bulwarks from abreast the windlass to the wake of the companion as she came to the little craft laid over until the water was up to the lee coamings of her main hatchway and for a second or two i thought she was going to turn turtle with me but once fairly round and headon to the sea she rode wonderfully well especially after i had lashed the helm alee and got the mainsheet aft the latter was a heavy job but i managed it in about half an hour with the assistance of the watch tackle and that done the craft could take care of herself i therefore slid back the top of the companion swung myself heavily in through the opening stumbled down the ladder staggered across the little cabin and flung myself wet to the skin as i was into my bunk where i instantly lost consciousness whether in a swoon or only in a profound sleep i never knew chapter sixteen the last of the felucca i was awakened some five hours later by the sound water washing heavily to and fro and upon looking over the edge of the bunk i discovered that the cabin was all afloat the floor being covered to a depth of nearly a foot so that i looked down upon a miniature sea violently agitated by the furious leaping and plunging and rolling of the felucca i could tell by the roar of the wind and the hissing of the sea with the frequent heavy fall of water on deck that it was still blowing heavily and my first impression was that the water had come down through the companionthe slide of which i had left open but a few minutes of patient observation convinced me that although a slight sprinkling of spray rained down occasionally it was not nearly sufficient to account for the quantity that surged and splashed about the cabin the only other explanation i could think of was that the felucca had sprung a leak and leaping out of the bunk i made my way on deck to ascertain the truth of this conjecture it was a dismal and dreary scene that presented itself when i swung myself out on deck through the companion top it was still blowing with the force of a whole gale the sky to windward was as black and threatening as ever and the sea was running so high and breaking so heavily that as every succeeding comber came sweeping down upon the felucca with its foaming hissing crest towering above her to nearly the height of her masthead it appeared to menew to the scene as i wasthat the next sea must inevitably overwhelm her yet deep in the water as i instantly noticed her to be the little craft still retained buoyancy enough to climb somehow up the steep slope of each advancing wave though not to carry her fairly over its crest every one of which broke aboard herusually well forward as luck would have it with the result that while i had been sleeping below the whole of the lee bulwarks and the forward half of them on the weather side had been swept away leaving her deck open to the sea which had swept away every movable thing leaving nothing but the mast and the splintered ends of the stanchions standing this constant sweeping of the deck by green seas rendered the task of moving about extremely dangerous for the rush of water over the fore part of the deck was quite heavy enough to lift a man off his feet and carry him overboard but i wanted to sound the well so securing the pumprod which for convenience was hung in beckets in the companion i watched my opportunity and rushing forward succeeded in dropping the rod down the well and getting a firm grip upon the fall of the main halliard before the next sea broke aboard then as the water poured off the deck i quickly drew the rod out of the well and dashed aft with it to the shelter of the companion in time to escape the next sea an inspection of the rod then sufficed to realise my worst fears the little craft had upwards of three feet of water in her hold evidently she was leaking badly and the sooner i could devise some means of relieving her of the weight of water in her the better it would be for me had i made this discovery half a dozen hours earlier i should probably have regarded it with perfect indifference but those five hours of deathlike sleep had so greatly refreshed me that i now felt a new man my state of indifference had passed away with the intensity of my fatigue and the instinct of selfpreservation was once more asserting itself my first idea was to rig the pump but this was instantly discarded for i had but to stand in the companionway for a couple of minutes and watch the heavy rush of water athwart the deck to be convinced of the absolute impossibility of maintaining my position at the pump for even if lashed there my utmost efforts would barely suffice to prevent myself from being swept overboard while to work the pump would be quite out of the question then i remembered that the lazarette hatch was situated immediately at the foot of the companion ladder and i thought that by raising the cover i might get a sort of well from which to bale and in this way at least keep the leak from gaining upon me even if i found it impossible to reduce it for time was what i now wanted i had a conviction that the feluccas seams were opening through the violent straining of her in the heavy sea and through the tremendous pressure of the wind upon her sail and i felt tolerably confident that if i could succeed in keeping her afloat until the gale had blown itself out all would be well but at this point of my meditations it suddenly occurred to me that i was hungry and thirsty so i descended the companion ladder and made my way to the small pantry in search of something to eat and drink it was a small place scarcely larger than a cupboard and very imperfectly lighted by a single bullseye let into the deck but it had one merit it was well provided with good wide shelves upon which everything that could possibly spoil was stowed and here i was lucky enough to find an abundance of foodsuch as it wasand several bottles of the thin sour wine which dominguez and his crew drank instead of coffee i ate and drank there in the pantry standing up to my knees in water and when i had finished went to work with a bucket and rope to bail the water out of the lazarette standing out on deck on the lee side of the companion and drawing the water out of the lazarette as out of a well i stuck doggedly to this work throughout the whole afternoon and well on into the night until i could bail no longer for very weariness and thenhaving convinced myself that i had succeeded in checking the rise of the wateri took a final look round to ascertain whether anything happened to be in sight but could see nothing the night being again dark as pitch came to the conclusion that it was blowing a trifle less hard than it had been and that the felucca would live through the night even though i should cease to bale and so descended to the cabin and again flung myself into my bunk where i dropped sound asleep as my head touched the pillow when i next returned to consciousness my awakening was brought about through the agency of water splashing in over the side of my bunk the felucca having steadily filled during the period of my sleep until the cabin was fully three feet deep in water it was broad day and oh blessed change the sun was shining brilliantly down through the skylight while the wind had evidently dropped to a pleasant breeze a heavy sea however was still runningas i could tell by the movements of the feluccaand i could hear the water well and gurgle up the side of the little craft and go pouring across her deck from time to time although not so frequently as before i turned in i rolled reluctantly out of my bunkfor i seemed to be aching in every joint of my body and my head was burning and throbbing with a dull pain like what would be occasioned by the strokes of a small hammerand waded waist deep in water to the companion ladder up which i crawled and so out on deck the gale had blown itself out the wind having subsided to a very gentle breeze that i soon discovered was fast dying away to a calmalthough what little wind there was still came breathing out from the westward the sky was perfectly clear of a rich deep pure blue colour without a shred of cloud to be seen in the whole of the vast vault and in the midst of it about two hours high hung the morning sun a dazzling globe of brilliance and heat the sea i now found had subsided almost entirely but a very heavy swell was still running over which the felucca rode laboriously the water in her interior occasionally pinning her down to such an extent that the quickrunning swell would brim up over her bows and pour in a perfect cataract athwart her deck this however i was not surprised at foras nearly as i could judgethe felucca showed barely nine inches of freeboard still the little hooker seemed surprisingly buoyant considering her waterlogged condition and now that the seas no longer broke over her there seemed to be no reason why given enough time i should not be able to pump her dry and resume my voyage to barbadoes so i rigged the pump and went to work hoping that as the gale had now abated and the sea had gone down the straining of the hull and the opening of the seams had ceased and that consequently the felucca was no longer in a leaky condition i toiled on throughout the whole of that roasting morning with the sun beating mercilessly down upon me while the water swirled athwart the deck and about my legs until noon and then utterly exhausted with my labour my skin burning with fever and my hands raw and bleeding i was fain to cry spell ho and give up for a time while i sought somewhat to eat and drink i had worked with a good will sanguinely hoping that when i felt myself compelled to knock off i should discover that i had sensibly diminished the amount of water in the feluccas interior but this hope was cruelly disappointed for when i reached the companion on my way below i found that there was no perceptible difference in the height of the water in the cabin from what it had been before i turned to indeed the water seemed to have risen rather than diminished a sure indication that the hull was still leaking and that by no effort of mine could i hope to keep the craft much longer afloat and now as i descended to the cabin and noted the violence with which the water surged hither and thither with the rolling and pitching of the little vessel a wild fear seized upon me that i might find all the provisions in the pantry spoiled a moment later and my surmise was changed to certainty for as i opened the door of the small cupboard like apartment a recoiling wave surged out through the doorway its surface bestrewed with the hard coarse biscuits that sailors speak of as bread the water had risen high enough to flood the shelf upon which the eatables had been stowed and everything was washed off and utterly spoiled worse still there was no possibility of obtaining a further supply for the lazarette or storehouse was beneath the cabin floor and had been flooded for hours moreover it was unapproachable fortunately i did not feel very hungry i was however consumed with a burning thirst whichall the watercasks having been washed overboard i quenched by draining a whole bottle of the thin sour wine of which i have before spoken then i went to work to collect all the biscuit i could secure and carried it up on deck to dry in the sun spreading it out on a cloth on the top of the companion and while engaged upon this task and also in removing my small stock of wine to the deckfor the cabin was by this time uninhabitablei began to consider what i could do to save my life when the felucca should founder as founder she must now that i had demonstrated my inability to keep the leaks under the question was not a very knotty one or one demanding very profound consideration obviously there was but one thing to do and that was to build a raft with such materials as offered themselves to my hand and just at this point the first difficulty presented itself in the shape of the question what available materials were there for as i have already mentioned the deck had been swept of every movable thing including the big lateen yard which had doubtless gone overboard when the bulwarks were carried away there seemed to be absolutely nothing unless i set to work to break up the felucca herself yet stay there was the mast the yard that spread and supported the lug sail the tillera good stout serviceable stick of timberandyes certainly the hatcheswhich could now be safely taken off as the sea no longer swept over the deck heavily enough to pour over the coamings surely with those materials i ought to be able to construct a raft buoyant enough to support me even although it would be obviously necessary for me to construct it on the deck and then patiently wait until the felucca sank and floated it offfor it would be quite impossible for me to launch it so to work i went my first task being to descend into the flooded forecastle and grope about for an axe that i knew was kept there somewhere and i was fortunate enough to find it almost at once then returning to the deck i lowered away the lugsail and cut the canvas adrift from the yard carefully lashing the latter that it might not roll or be washed overboard then i began to cut away the mast chopping a deep notch in it close to the deck and when i heard it beginning to complain i cut the lanyards of the weather rigging when away it went over the side with a crash this gave me a good deal of trouble for i wanted the spar on deck not overboard so i had to go to work to parbuckle it up the side which i managed pretty well by watching the lift of the seas then i cut the mast in halves laid the two halves parallel athwart the deck and secured the yard and the tiller to them as crosspieces with good stout lashings and finally to these last i firmly lashed four of the main hatch covers when i had a platform of some twelve feet long and eight feet wide to support me all that now remained to be done was to secure my provisions and wine which i did by stowing the whole in a double thickness of tarpaulin the edges of which i gathered together and tightly lashed with spunyarn finally securing the bundle to the raft by a short end of rope so that it might not be washed away when the felucca should take her final plunge and i had then done everything that it was possible for me to do by the time that my task was finished the sun had sunk to within a hands breadth of the western horizon while the wind had dwindled away until it had become the faintest zephyr scarcely to be distinguished save by the slight ruffling of the water here and there where it touched it being so nearly a flat calm that already great oilylooking patches of gleaming smoothness had appeared and were spreading momentarily through the faint blue ripplings that still betrayed a movement in the air as for me i was utterly exhausted with my long days toil under the roasting sun every bone in my body was aching i was in a burning fever and was sick with the smart of my raw and bleeding hands the old feeling of callousness and indifference to my fate was once more upon me and as i gazed at the crazylooking raft which i had constructed with such a lavish expenditure of painful toil i smiled in grim irony of myself that i should have done so much to preserve that life which now seemed of such little worth and which promised soon to become an unendurable burden to me a reaction from the excitement that had sustained me during my labours had set in and i am persuaded that had any further exertion been necessary for the preservation of my life i should not have undertaken it meanwhile the felucca had sunk nearly to her coveringboard and might be expected to founder at any moment i climbed laboriously upon the top of the closed skylight and took a last long look round to ascertain whether anything had drifted into my range of view while i had been engaged upon the raft but there was nothing the horizon was bare throughout its entire circumference so i climbed down again and staggering to the raft flung myself down upon it with my bundle of provision as a pillow and patiently awaited the evanishment of the felucca poor little craft what a forlorn weatherbeaten seawashed wreck she looked as she lay there wallowing wearily andas it seemed to me painfully upon the long creeping glassy undulations of the swell how different from the trim sturdy little hooker that had sailed seaward so confidently and saucily out of kingston harbour a few yearsno not years it must be months orwas it only daysa few days ago it seemed more like years than days to me and yetwhy of course it could only be days heaven how my head ached how my brain seemed to throb and boil within my skull and surely it was not bloodit must be fire that was coursing through my veins and causing my body to glow like whitehot steel a big glassy mound of swell came creeping along toward the felucca and as she rolled toward it curled in over her coveringboard and poured in a heavy torrent across her deck swirling round my raft and shifting it a foot or two nearer the side and as it swept past i dabbled one of my hands in it and was dully surprised that the contact did not cause the water to hiss and boil another mountain of water came brimming over the deck of the shuddering craft and shifted the raft so far that it fairly overhung the coveringboard so that when the felucca rolled in the opposite direction the end of the raft not only dipped in the water but actually lifted and floated the heave of the water sucking it perhaps another foot off the deck the next two or three undulations passed harmlessly bythe swing and roll of the felucca was such that she just happened to meet them at the right moment though lagging a little at the lastand then came another great liquid hill towering high above the horizon until the sinking sun was utterly obscured on it swept toward the felucca which had now slewed so that she faced the coming swell nearly stemon the water in her meanwhile rushing forward as she sank down into the trough until her stemhead was completely buried now she was meeting the breast of the oncoming swell her bows still pinned down by the rush of water in her interior and now the glistening green wave was upon her sweeping aft along and athwart her deck mounting over the coamings of the main hatchway and pouring down the opening in a smooth hissing foursided cataract snatching up the raft in its embrace and shooting it half a dozen fathoms clear of the doomed craft and rushing along the deck until even the companion and the skylight were submerged by that time the hull was full the curious rectangular hollow in the surface of the water that marked the position of the main hatchway was filled the hull was completely hidden save for a splintered stanchion that projected above water here and there then as the wave passed the bows of the felucca emerged gleaming and dripping with snowy foaming cascades that poured off the uncovered portion of the deck higher and higher rose the bows out of the water until some ten feet in length of the felucca was revealed the deck gradually sloping until it assumed an almost perpendicular inclination when slowly silently and glidingly without a sob or gurgle of escaping air the wreck slid backward and downward until it vanished beneath the waters now gleaming in gold and crimson with the last rays of the setting sun a few seconds later the great luminary also vanished a sudden grey pallor overspread the ocean and i found myself alone indeed swaying upon that vast heaving expanse with nothing between me and death save the clumsy structure that i had so laboriously put together and which now looked so insignificantly small that i caught myself wondering why my weight did not sink it but it did not on the contrary the raft proved to be surprisingly buoyant riding over the great glassy roundbacked hills of swell as dry as a bone with a gentle swaying movement that somehow seemed to soothe my feverracked frame so that the condition of semidelirium that had possessed me just before the felucca foundered passed away and left me sufficiently selfpossessed to recognise the necessity for eating and drinking if i was to survive and get the better of my misfortunes so i carefully opened my bundle and extracted from it a small quantity of sundried biscuitwhich thanks to the curiously gentle manner in which the raft had been launched had received no further wettingand proceeded to make such a meal as i could washing it down with a sparing draught of wine but although the biscuit had dried superficially it was still wet and pasty in the middle and horribly nauseous to the palate so that i made but a poor meal after which i stretched myself at full length upon the raft and endeavoured to find relief in sleep but exhausted though i was sleep would not come to me on the contrary my memory and imagination rapidly became painfully excited i thought of dominguez and wondered whether he and his companions had escaped the hurricane then i thought of morillo and his fiendish hatred of me and so my thoughts and fancies chased one another until they became all mingled together in an inextricable jumble and through it all i heard myself singing shouting laughing arguing upon impossible subjects with wholly imaginary persons and performing i know not what other mad vagaries until finally i suppose i must have become so utterly exhausted as to have subsided into a restless feverish sleep chapter seventeen captain lemaitre consciousness returned to me with the sensation of soft delicate light impinging upon my closed eyelids and i opened my eyes upon the picture of a sky of deepest richest purest blue studded with woollike tufts of fleecy cloud opalescent with daintiest tints of primrose and pink as they sailed overhead with a slow and gentle movement out from the north east the eastern horizon was all aglow with ruddy orange light up through which soared broad fanlike rays of white radiancethe spokes of phoebus chariot wheelsthat through a scale of countless subtle changes of tincture gradually merged into the marvellously soft richness of the prismatic sky a gentle breeze warm and sweet as a womans breath lightly ruffled the surface of the sea that heaved in long low hills of deep and brilliant liquid sapphire around me and here and there a seabird wheeled and swept with plaintive cries and slanting motionless pinions in long easy graceful curves over the slowly undulating swell i sat up and looked about me vaguely and wonderingly for the moment forgetful of the circumstances that had placed me in so novel a situation and at the instant a glowing point of golden fire flashed into view upon the eastern horizon as the upper rim of the sun hove above the undulating rim of the sea and in a moment the rippling blue of the laughing water was laced with a long broadening wake of gleaming dancing liquid gold as the great palpitating disc of the god of day left his ocean couch and entered upon his journey through the heavens my forgetfulness was but momentary as the radiance and warmth of the returning sun swept over the glittering scintillating golden path that stretched from the horizon to the raft the memory of all that had gone before and the apprehension of what still haply awaited me returned and as quickly as my cramped and aching limbs would allow i staggered to my feet flinging anxious eager glances all around me in search of a sail the horizon however was bare save where the long narrow pinion of a wheeling seabird swiftly cut it for a moment here and there and i sighed wearily as i resumed my recumbent position upon the raft wondering whether rescue would ever come or whether it was my doom to float there tossing hour after hour and day after day like the veriest waif until thirst and starvation had wrought their will upon me or until another storm should arise and the now laughing ocean should overwhelm me in its fury and indeed i cared very little just then what fate awaited me for i was so ill my frame was so racked with fever and my head so distracted with the fierce throbbing and beating of the wildly coursing blood in it that the only thing i craved for was relief from my sufferings it was a matter of the utmost indifference to me at that moment whether the relief came from death or from any other source so long as it came quickly my strength was leaving me with astounding rapidity and i was quite aware that if i wished to husband the little that still remained to me i ought to eat but the mere idea of eating excited so violent a repugnance that it was with the utmost difficulty i resisted the almost overwhelming temptation to pitch my slender stock of seasodden biscuit overboard on the other hand i was consumed with a torturing thirst that i vainly strove to assuage by so reckless a consumption of my equally slender stock of wine that at the end of the day only two bottles remained such recklessness was of course due to the fact that i was unaccountable for my actions i was possessed of a kind of madness and i knew it but i had lost all control over myself and cared not what happened more than once i found myself seriously considering the advisability of throwing myself off the raft and so ending everything without more ado and i have often wondered why i did not do so it was certainly not the fear of death that prevented me as the day wore on my sufferings steadily increased in intensity my brain throbbed and pulsated with pain so acute that it seemed as though a million wedges were being driven into my skull a host of weird outrageous and horrible fancies chased each other through my imagination i became possessed of the idea that the raft was surrounded and hemmed in by an everincreasing multitude of frightful sea monsters who fought with each other in their furious efforts to get within reach of me day and night seemed to come and go with bewildering rapidity and finally everything became involved in a condition of hopelessly inextricable confusion that eventually merged into oblivion my next consciousness was that of a sound of gurgling running water and of a buoyant heaving plunging motion of flashing sunshine coming and going upon my closed eyelids of the vibrant hum of wind through taut rigging and in the hollows of straining canvas of a murmur of voices and of the regular tramp of footsteps to and fro on the planking overhead and for the moment i thought that i was aboard the tern and just awaking from a sleep during which i had been haunted with an unusually long series of peculiarly unpleasant dreams but as i opened my eyes and looked with somewhat languid interest upon my surroundings i became aware that i was in a small plain but fairly snug cabin of which i seemed to possess no previous knowledge and at the same moment a confused but rapidly clearing memory of what had happened came to me together with the knowledge that i had been rescued from the raft and was feeling very much better but an attempt to move preliminary to turning out revealed the disconcerting fact that i was as weak and helpless as a newborn infant so i was perforce obliged to remain where i was and in a short time i dozed off into a light sleep again soothed thereto by the hum of the wind the gurgling wash of water along the side of the ship close to my ear and the gentle heave and plunge of the fabric that bore me from this nap i was awakened by the somewhat noisy opening of my cabin door and upon opening my eyes i beheld a swarthy and somewhat dirty looking individual bending over me from his appearance i at once set him down as a frenchman and as i gazed up into his face with mild curiosity this impression became confirmed by his exclaiming in french ah monsieur so you have come to your senses at last eh good i knew i could save you although francois declared you to be as good as dead when he brought you aboard and now mon ami what do you say can you eat something thank you replied i in the same language now that you come to mention it i think i can good ejaculated the unknown rest tranquil for but a short time and i will see what that rascal cook of ours can do for you stay another dose of quinine will do you no harm just by way of precaution you know although i think i have driven the fever out of you at last permit me and so saying he laid a rather grimy hand upon my forehead for a moment and then transferred it to my wrist remarking good the skin is cool and moist the pulse normal again ha ha my friend you will do you will do henceforth the cook must be your doctor all you need now is plenty of good nourishing food to restore your strength now drink this and as soon as you have swallowed it i will away to the galley while speaking this individual had been busying himself with a bottle from which he extracted a small quantity of white powder which he mixed with water and then handed me the mixture to drink thank you said i handing him back the glass and now monsieur do me the favour to tell me your name in order that i may know to whom i am indebted for my preservation my name he repeated with a laugh oh that will keep monsieur that will keep at present your most urgent necessity is food which i am now going to get for you when i return i will tell you all you may wish to know while you are eating for the present adieu monsieur if you feel disposed to sleep again do so sleep is nearly as valuable as food to you just now when i have some of the latter ready for you i will wake you never fear so saying and before i could utter another word he vanished slamming the cabin door after him his retirement caused me a sensation of distinct relief at which i was very greatly annoyed with myself for had not this man doubly saved my life first by rescuing me from the raft and afterwards by nursing me through what i believed had been a serious illness yet ingrate that i was even in the brief interview that i have just described i had taken an unmistakable dislike to the man it was not so much that he was unclean in person and attireit was possible that there might be a good and sufficient excuse for thatbut what had excited my antipathy when i came to analyse the feeling was a certain false ring in his voice a subtle something in his manner suggestive of the idea that his friendliness and heartiness were not natural to himwere assumed for a purpose yet why it should be so why he should have rescued me from the raft and afterwards troubled himself to fight and drive out the fever that threatened to destroy me unless from a feeling of humanity and compassion for my pitiable condition i could not imagine yet there had beenor so i fancieda fierce shifty gleam in his coalblack eyes during the few brief minutes that he had bent over me as i lay there in my bunk that seemed to reveal cruelty and treachery rather than pity and goodwill let me describe the man standing there beside my bunk he had conveyed to me the impression of an individual nearly six feet in heighti afterwards found his stature to be five feet ten inches in his stockingsbroad across the shoulders in proportion and big boned but lean almost to the point of emaciation his skin was dry of an unwholesome yellow tint and shrivelled as though he had once been stout and burly of form but had now become thin while his skin had failed to shrink in the same proportion as his flesh his eyes were as i have said black small and deeply sunken in his head his hair was a dull dead black and was worn cropped close to his head his black beard was trimmed to a point and he wore a moustache the long ends of which projected athwart his upper lip like a spritsail yard his hands were thin showing the tendons of the fingers working under the loose skin at every movement of them while the fingers themselves were long attenuated ingrained with dirt and furnished with long talonlike yellow nails that looked as though they never received the slightest attention finally his clothing consisted of a cotton shirt that looked as though it had been in use for at least a month since its last visit to the laundress a pair of grimy blue dungaree trousers and a pair of red morocco slippers as i lay there in the bunk recalling the appearance of my rescuer and trying to evolve therefrom some definite impression of the mans character i became aware that the duty of the ship seemed to be carried on with a very unnecessary amount of vociferation and contumelious language an englishman will sometimes in critical or urgent moments garnish his orders with an expletive or two by way of stimulus to the crew but upon the occasion to which i am now referring there was not the slightest excuse for anything of the kind the weather was fine the wind moderate and we were evidently not engaged upon the performance of some feat of complicated or difficult navigation for the course remained constant and there was neither making nor shortening of sail it simply appeared that the officer of the watch happened to be one of those distressing and troublemaking individuals who regard it as incumbent upon themselves to continually haze the men for he was constantly bawling some trifling order and accompanying it with a running fire of abuse that must have been furiously exasperating to the person addressed after an absence of about half an hour the man who had already visited me returned this time bearing a large bowl of smoking broth and a plate containing three large ship biscuits of the coarsest kind the broth however exhaled a distinctly appetising odour which had the effect of again reminding me that i was hungry so with my visitors assistance i contrived to raise myself into a sitting posture and forthwith attacked the contents of the bowl previously breaking into it a small quantity of biscuit the broth proved to be turtle soup deliciously made and taking my time over the task i consumed the whole of it my companion meanwhile giving an account of himself his ship and the circumstances attending my rescue my name monsieur he said in reply to a question of mine is lemaitrejean lemaitre a native of fort royal in the island of martinique and owner as well as captain of la belle jeannettethe schooner which you are now honouring with your presence i am in the slavetrade monsieurdoing business chiefly with the spaniardsand exactly a month ago today i sailed from havana for the guinea coast we came west and south about round cape san antonio stretching well over toward the spanish main in order to avoid if possible those pestilent cruisers of yours which seem to be everywhere and are always ready to snap up everything that they can lay their hands upon by great good fortune we managed to dodge them and got through without being interfered with but it threw us into the track of the hurricane and necessitated our remaining hoveto for twentysix hours four days later as we were sailing merrily along we saw something floating ahead of us and ten minutes later we all but ran down your raft on which we saw you lying face downwards while the sharks were righting each other in their efforts to get at you and drag you off francois my mate was for leaving you where you wereasserting that you must surely be dead and that to pick up a dead man would make the voyage unluckybut i am a humane man monsieur and i insisted upon heavingto and sending away a boat to bring you aboard the boats crew had a hard job of it to drive off the sharks and to get you safely into the boat monsieur and even so the creatures followed the boat alongsideto the number of seventeen for i counted them myself francois suggested that we should throw you to them declaring that you were as good as dead already and that it was a shame to disappoint the sharks after they had waited so patiently for you but i am a humane man monsieuras i believe i have already mentionedand i would not listen to his proposal so i had you brought down below and placed in this spare cabin where i have attended to you ever sincethat was ten days agoand now behold the fever has left you your appetite has returned and in another week please the good god we shall have you on deck again as well as ever you were thank you monsieur said i i am infinitely obliged to you for the humanity that prompted you to pick me updespite the dissuasions of your mate francoisand also for the trouble you have taken in nursing me through my illness fortunately i am in a position to make substantial recognition of my gratitude and upon my return to jamaica as to which i presume there will be no difficultyit shall be my first business to take such steps as shall insure you against all pecuniary loss on my account ah monsieur exclaimed lemaitre i beg that you will say no more on that score it hurts me that you should think it necessary to mention so mercenary a word as that of reward we are both sailors and although we have the misfortune to be enemies that is no reason why one brave man should not aid another in distress without looking for a reward as to your return to jamaica no doubt that can be managed upon our return voyage your return voyage i interrupted can you not manage it forthwith captain i can make it quite worth your while to up helm and run me back at once it is of the utmost importance to me to return to port royal with the least possible delay and alas monsieur it cannot be done interrupted lemaitre in his turn a cargo of slaves is even now awaiting me in the cameroon river and my patrons in havana are impatiently looking forward to their delivery if i were to disappoint them i should be ruined for i have many competitors in the trade to contend with especially since all this talk has arisen about making slavetrading illegal no i regret to be obliged to refuse you monsieur but there is no help for it at least said i you will transfer me to a british manowar should we chance to fall in with one and be myself captured and lose my ship for my pains exclaimed lemaitre oh no monsieur we will give your ships a wide berth if we fall in with them and trust to our heels nonsense monsieur i returned surely you cannot suppose i would be so ungrateful as to permit any such thing i am a british officer and should of course make a point of seeing that in such a case you were held exempt from capture my representations would be quite sufficient to secure that for you well monsieur we will see we will see answered lemaitre and therewith he took the empty soup bowl from my hand and retired from the cabin slamming the door as usual behind him for the next three days i continued to occupy my bunk my strength returning slowly but on the fourth i made shift with lemaitres assistance to get into my clothes and crawl on deck and from that moment my progress toward recovery was rapid meanwhile the hazing of which i have spoken continued at regular intervals day and night and i soon ascertained that the individual responsible for it was none other than the francois who so kindly suggested that i should be hove overboard to the sharks this fellow was evidently a born bully he never opened his mouth to deliver an order without abusing and insulting the men and as often as not the abuse was accentuated with blows the sounds of which and the accompanying cries of the men i could distinctly hear in my cabin that however was hardly the worst of it for i soon discovered that lemaitre the skipper of this precious craft in which such doings were permitted was a drunkard for every night at about nine oclock i used to hear him come below and order out the rum and water after which he and francois or the second mateaccording to whose watch below it happened to bewould sit for about an hour drinking one against the other until the language of both became incoherent when the pair of them would stagger and stumble off to their respective staterooms this was my first experience of a slaver and a most unpleasant experience it was the vessel herselfa schooner of one hundred and twenty tons registeralthough superbly modelled a magnificent sea boat and sailing like a witch was rendered uncomfortable in the extreme as an abode by her filthy condition cleanliness seemed to be regarded by lemaitre as a wholly unnecessary luxury with the result that no effort was made to keep in check the steady accumulation of dirt from day to day much less to remove that which already existed even the daily washing down of the deckswhich with the british sailor has assumed the importance and imperative character of a religious functionwas deemed superfluous nor were the crew any more careful as to their own condition or that of their clothing it is a fact that during the whole period of my sojourn on board la belle jeannette i never saw one of her people attempt to wash himself or any article of clothing and as a natural result of this steadfast disregard of the most elementary principles of cleanliness the little hooker simply swarmed with vermin but bad as it was this was not the worst the crew from lemaitre downward were a low brutal quarrelsome gang always wrangling together and frequently fighting while as i have already mentioned the one predominating idea of francois the chief mate was that they could only be kept in order by constantly and impartially ropesending them all round possibly he may have been right at all events i found it far easier to excuse his behaviour after i had seen the crew than i had before all this time lemaitre had been behaving toward me with a rough clumsy offhand kindness that his personal appearance would have led no one to expect and which try as i would i could not bring myself to regard as genuine because through it all there seemed now and then to rise to the surface an underflow of repressed malignity not pronounced enough to be certain about yet sufficiently distinct to provoke in me a vague sensation of uneasiness and distrust to put the matter concisely although lemaitre was by no means effusive in his expressions of good will toward me and although there was a certain perfunctory quality in such attentions as he showed me there was with it all a curious subtle something so intangible that i found it utterly impossible to define or describe it which yet impressed me with the feeling that it was all unreal assumed a mockery and a pretence though why it should be so i could not for the life of me divine chapter eighteen a double tragedy i had been up and about for a full week and had during that period observed in lemaitres manner toward me not only a steadily decreasing solicitude for my welfarewhich was perhaps only natural now that my health was rapidly improvingbut also a growing disposition to sneer and gibe at me covert at first but more pronounced and unmistakable with every recurring day that strongly tended to confirm the singular suspicion i have endeavoured to bring home to the mind of the reader in the preceding chapter then one night an incident occurred that in a moment explained everything and revealed to me the unpleasant fact that so far as my enemy morillo was concerned i was still in as great danger as when on board the felucca although in the present case the danger was perhaps a trifle more remote i have already mentioned lemaitres habit of drinking himself into a state of intoxication every night this habit and the obscene language that the man seemed to revel in when in such a condition was so disgusting to me that not the leastprized advantage afforded by my convalescence was the ability to remain on deck until the nightly saturnalia was at an end and lemaitre and his companion had retired to their cabins on the particular night however of which i am about to speak a slight recurrent touch of fever caused me to slip quietly below and turn in before the orgy began not that i expected to get to sleep but simply because i believed the warmth and dryness of my bunk would be better for me than the damp night air on deck punctually at nine oclock lemaitre and his chief mate came noisily clattering down the companion ladder glasses and a bottle of rum were produced and the carouse began it had not progressed very far before it became apparent to me as i lay there in my hot bunk tossing restlessly that lemaitre was in an unusually excited and quarrelsome condition and that francois the chief mate was rapidly approaching a similar condition as he gulped down tumbler after tumbler of liquor they were always argumentative and contradictory when drinking together but tonight they were unusually so at length francois made some remark as to the extraordinary good fortune they had met with on this particular voyage in having come so far without falling in with a british cruiser at which lemaitre laughed scornfully declaring that there was not a british cruiser afloat that could catch la belle jeannette and that even if it were otherwise he should have no fear of them this voyage for said he have we not a guarantee of safety in the presence of that simple fool courtenay on board have we not saved his life by rescuing him from the raft and do you suppose they would reward our humanity ha ha by making a prize of the schooner not they if there is one thing those asses of british pride themselves upon more than another it is their chivalrous sense of honoura sentiment my child that they would not outrage for the value of fifty such schooners as this all the same he added with an inflection of deep cunning in his voice i do not want to meet with a british cruiser at close enough quarters to be compelled to hand the dear courtenay over to his countrymen oh no why not demanded francois what advantage is it to you to keep him on board is it because you are so fond of his company pah if you had eyes in your head you would see that despite his gratitude to you for saving his life he despises you what do you mean to do with him are you going to turn him adrift among the negroes when we arrive upon the coast i never could understand why you insisted upon saving him at all no queried lemaitre with a sneering laugh ah that is because you are a fool francois mon enfant a more arrant fool even than the dear courtenay himself do you suppose i did it out of pity for his condition or because i love the british no i will tell you why idiot it is because he will fetch a good five hundred dollars at least in the slavemarket at havana so that is what you intend to do with him is it retorted francois well lemaitre i always knew you for an ass but unless you had told me so with your own lips i would never have believed you to be such an ass as to sell a man for five hundred dollars when you can just as easily get a thousand for him yet you call me fool and idiot pah you sicken me oh i sicken you do i growled lemaitre by this time well advanced toward intoxication take care what you are saying my friend or i shall be apt to sicken you so thoroughly that you will be fit for nothing but a toss over the lee bulwarks no doubt it is i who am the fool and you who are the clever one but i should like to hear by what means you would propose to get a thousand dollars for the fellow true he is young and stalwart and will be in prime condition by the time that we get back to havanai will see to thatbut i have known better men than he sold for less than five hundred dollars ay white men too not negroes did i not say you are an ass retorted francois who talks of selling him at havana you not i do you not know who this courtenay is then i will tell you most wise and noble captain he is the youth who attacked and destroyed morillos settlement at cariacoui remember the name perfectly welland i was told at havana by one who ought to know that morillo had given it out among his friends that he would pay one thousand dollars to anyone who should bring courtenay to him alive and that is not all either you know what morillo is he has declared a feud against this miserable meddlesome englishman and not only will he gladly pay a thousand dollars for the privilege of wreaking his vengeance upon him but the man who delivers your friend courtenay into his hands will be free to sail the seas without molestation from morillo as long as he lives what think you of that captain lemaitre is this true demanded lemaitre ay answered francois as true as that you and i are sitting here in this cabin why did you not tell me of this before francois my friend asked lemaitre in a wheedling tone why did i not tell you before echoed francois ask rather why i tell you now and i will answer that it is because i am such a fool that i cannot keep a good thing to myself when i have it sacrrre what need was there for me to make you as wise as myself eh however i am not going to let you have this choice little bit of information for nothing i have told you how to make a clear five hundred dollars over and above what you could have earned without the information i have been idiot enough to give you and you must pay me half the amount do you understand ay i understand answered lemaitre with a sudden return to his former sneering aggressive manner but i should like to knowjust for the satisfaction of my curiosityhow you propose to compel me to pay you that two hundred and fifty dollars that you talk about why easily enough snarled francois with sudden fury as he realised that lemaitre intended to evade the extortion if he could if you do not pay me immediately after receiving the reward from morillo i will denounce you to him i will say that you intended to have yielded up your prisoner to the british in order that you might curry favour with them and secure immunity from capture by them and that you would never have given him up to morillo at all but for my threats and i suppose you know what that will mean for you eh oh so that is what you would do is it my friend returned lemaitre with a harsh laugh well well it will be time enough for you to threaten when i refuse to pay you the two hundred and fifty dollars until then there is no need for us to quarrel so fill up your glass francois and let us drink to the health of the dear courtenay who after all was quite worth picking up off the raft dont you think then followed a gurgling sound as the two topers filled their glasses a gulping and smacking of lips succeeded by a banging of the empty tumblers upon the table came clearly to me through the latticed upper panel of my door and then certain staggering sounds as the two struggled to their feet were followed by lemaitre thickly bidding his companion goodnight as the pair reeled and stumbled away to their respective berths i slept badly that night the fever with the intelligence i had just acquired combining to make me restless and wakeful but after tossing from side to side until about two bells in the morning watch i gradually sank into a troubled sleep from which i was startled by a sudden outbreak of loud excited shouts succeeded by a sound of fierce scuffling accompanied by a volley of oaths and exclamations the stamp of feet a heavy fall a rush of footsteps up the companion ladder and a sudden heavy splash alongside then followed a terrific outcry on deck with the hurrying rush of feet on the planking overhead the furious slatting of canvas as the schooner shot into the wind more excited shouts ending in a sort of groaning mingled with ejaculations of dismay a sudden silence and then a terrific jabbering suggestive of the idea that all hands had incontinently taken leave of their senses i sprang out of my bunk and hurriedly proceeded to dress rushing on deck barefooted to see what was the matter and as i emerged from the companionway i saw all hands gathered aft most of them staring hard over the taffrail while one man was busily engaged in binding up the left arm of the second mate hillo monsieur charpentier i exclaimed what is the matter has anything happened happened monsieur i should think so exclaimed the second mate turning to me a white and ghastly face a most awful thing has happened when i went below just now to call francois i was unable to make him hear although i called several times and knocked ever so hard at his door so i ventured to turn the door handle and enter his cabin and what do you think i saw monsieur why poor francois lying dead in his bunk his clothes soaked with blood and a great gaping wound in his breast right over his heart i was so horrified monsieur that i scarcely knew what to do but collecting myself with a mighty effort i went to call the captain and when i reached his cabin i found the door wide open and monsieur lemaitre crouched in a corner of it with a great bloodstained knife in his hand his eyes glaring and his lips mumbling and muttering i know not what i saw that there was something wrong with him monsieuri believed he had gone madand i was about to turn away and call for help but he saw me and before i was aware sprang upon me seizing me with one hand by the throat while with the other he aimed blow after blow at me with his terrible knife i defended myself as well as i could monsieur fighting bravely for my life but what can one do against a madman the captain seemed to possess the strength of twenty men he forced me irresistibly back against the bulkhead and then drove his knife through my arm believing that he had killed me i relaxed my hold upon him whereupon he hurled me to the deck sprang over my fallen body and bounded up on deck and from thence overboard and now they tell me monsieur that he had scarcely struck the water when a shark rose seized him and dragged him under see monsieur look astern he is gone there is nothing to be seen of him what shall we do oh mon dieu what shall we do are you quite sure that the captain was seized by a shark i demanded looking round from one to another of the men who had now turned their faces inboard and stood staring alternately at charpentier and myself oh yes monsieur excitedly replied half a dozen of them all together we all saw it it was a monster and continued one of them the captain had scarcely risen to the surface after his plunge overboard when the shark seized him by the middle and dragged him under we all saw the blood dyeing the waterdid we not shipmatesbut the captain never uttered a cry just threw up his arms and vanished is not that it my friends yes yes they all exclaimed again that is it jules describes it exactly as it occurred then said i it seems to me monsieur charpentier that captain lemaitre and the mate being dead nothing remains but for you to take command and navigate the schooner to her destination but monsieur i cannot do that for unhappily i am not a navigator replied charpentier wringing his hands do you mean to say that you know nothing whatever about navigation demanded i alas no monsieur nothing whatever was the reply and is there no one else among you who can navigate the schooner asked i the men looked at each other shaking their heads and muttering not i and finally charpentier exclaimed you see monsieur there is not one of us who can navigate what is to be done you monsieur are an officerat least so i understood francois to say perhaps you could well demanded i seeing that the fellow hesitated perhaps i could what pardon monsieur exclaimed he i was in hopes that considering the difficulty we are placed in by this most lamentable tragedy you would kindly take command and navigate the schooner i see remarked i well i continued if such is the wish of you all i have no objection to do as you wish butunderstand mei will only consent to navigate the schooner back to the west indies i will not undertake the trouble and responsibility of carrying the ship to her destination and shipping a cargo i disapprove on principle of slave trading which i consider an iniquitous traffic and i will have nothing to do with it but if you are willing i will navigate the ship back to port royalguaranteeing you immunity from capture upon our arrival in consideration of the rescue and succour that you have afforded meand when there you will have no difficulty in procuring someone who will navigate the schooner from thence to havana or any other port that you may choose to go to just talk it over among yourselves and let me know what you decide on doing i could see that my proposal was not at all to charpentiers liking or indeed to the liking of any of the crew but i cared not for that i was quite determined to have nothing whatever to do with the kidnapping of any unfortunate blacks and in the end they were obliged to give way although charpentier tried hard to dissuade me from my resolution the result being that immediately after i had ascertained our position at noon we wore round and shaped a course for martinique that island being in a direct line with jamaica at first i was rather apprehensive that the disappointment of the men at so unprofitable a result of the voyage would cause them to be troublesome but it did not the question of turning back having once been settled they all seemed to take the matter very philosophically the fact that they were now relieved of the mates tyranny perhaps reconciling them to such disappointment as they might otherwise have felt i need not dwell upon the return voyage which was singularly uneventful suffice it to say that favoured with fine weather and a fair wind all the way we made an exceptionally smart run across the atlantic entering port royal harbour on the morning of the twenty second day after bearing up and eleven weeks to a day from the date of my abduction by dominguez my sudden reappearance created quite a sensation among the dockyard people my disappearance having been involved in so much mystery that all sorts of surmises had been indulged in to account for it some were of opinion that i had fallen overboard into the harbour and had found a secure hidingplace in the maw of a shark but there were others who happening to have been present when i was summoned from mammy wilkinsons hotel upon my supposititious errand of help and rescue to young lindsay at once mentioned the circumstance with the result that a very strong suspicion of foul play was aroused my friend and patron the admiral was especially concerned upon my account even going to the length of offering a reward of fifty pounds for such intelligence as should lead to my discovery but it resulted in nothing those worthies caesar and peter perhaps being too much afraid to utter a word of what they knew then there occurred more frigate actions resulting in so heavy a pressure of work that nobody seemed to have any time to think about the mysterious disappearance of a somewhat obscure young lieutenant but now that i had unexpectedly turned up again safe and sound i was overwhelmed with congratulations while the admiral sent a party of police to the house to which i had been conveyed with instructions that the two negroes were to be at once found and arrested the house however proved to be empty when the police made their domiciliary visit and as for the negroes their whereabouts was never discovered possibly the excitement of my reappearance and the talk to which it gave rise alarmed them and caused them to beat a hasty retreat to some other island to my great joy i discovered that the diane was not yet recommissioned the repairs and alterations to her having been greatly delayed by the more pressing work of repairing the frigates while the admiralin the hope that i might still turn up and with that extreme kindness that had marked all his treatment of mehad determined not to give the command of her to anyone else until she should be absolutely ready for sea i therefore at once stepped into my former position and lost no time in getting as many men to work upon her as could be spared and there was the less difficulty in accomplishing this that morillo was believed to be more busy than ever several outwardbound ships being overdue without the occurrence of any bad weather to account for their disappearance meanwhile during the progress of the work aboard the brigantine i gave myself up to the task of getting together a crew of which my old friend black peter constituted himself the nucleus while several former terns volunteered these again inducing other men of their acquaintance to come forward and join so that by the time that the finishing touches were being put to the diane i had fiftytwo firstrate men waiting to go aboard as soon as the ship should be ready to receive them but i wanted five more to complete my complement and these i picked up by making a raid one night upon the low boarding houses in kingston where the crimps were in the habit of taking in sailors and keeping them in hiding until they had extracted from them every penny of their hardearned wages at length some five weeks from the date of my reappearance the time arrived when the diane being ready for sea with her guns mounted provisions water and stores of every kind on board and sails bent hauled off alongside the powder hulk to ship her ammunition and that delicate job having been successfully accomplished under my personal supervision i went up to kingston to dine with the admiral prior to sailing calling at the hotel on my way in order to change my clothes as i entered the building the head waitera negrostepped forward and handed me a letter addressed in an unknown and foreignlooking handwriting to myself i opened it at once and found that it bore a date a full fortnight old and read as follows the language being english senor courtenayyou have constituted yourself my especial enemy and have apparently declared war to the knife against me in return i now declare my determination to destroy you by whatever means may present themselves thrice have you injured me either personally or through my agents but rest assured that a day of reckoning will come when you shall curse the hour that gave you birth i will fight you wherever we may happen to meet and let the strongest conquer if you fear not to meet me hoist a red swallowtailed burgee to your fore royal masthead that i may recognise your ship from others morillo when did this letter arrive and who brought it demanded i of the waiter who stood by as i read the document a black boy brought it about half an hour ago sah an said i was to be suah an gib it you sah an dat dar was no ansah sah replied the fellow did you know the boy demanded i no sah nebber saw him befoah to my knowledge sah was the reply did you take enough notice of him to be able to recognise him should you happen to see him again asked i is afraid not sah those black boys are all exactly alike you know sah replied the fellow who was himself as black as the ace of spades well said i if you should happen to see him again and can manage to detain him until you can give him into custody it will be worth five guineas to you i should very much like to see that boy and ask him a question or two all right sah if i see him ill stop him nebbah feah sah replied the waiter with a grin and therewith i hurried away to my room to dress chapter nineteen the end of the guerrilla i arrived at the pen just in time for dinner and found myself one of an unusually large party of guests several menowar being in port at the time while a large contingent of civilians might always be met at the admirals table the old gentleman received me with all his wonted kindness and cordiality introducing me to such of his guests as i had not met before and relating over the dinnertable with much gusto the story of my abduction and escape then i produced morillos letter of defiance which i took with me to show him and which added a fillip to the conversation that lasted us until the cloth was drawn we sat rather late over our wine and when we rose to go the admiral invited me into his library for a moment and said well my lad dye intend to accept that piratical rascals challenge most assuredly i do sir if i can but fall in with him answered i very well said the admiral you shall have every opportunity to give him the thrashing that he so richly deserves there handing me a packet are your orders which you will find are that while cruising against the enemy and doing as much harm as you can to their commerce you are to keep a bright lookout for morillo and either capture or destroy him at all costs when do you sail the moment that i can get aboard sir answered i thats right thats right you will then be able to make a good offing before the landbreeze drops returned the admiral well he continued goodbye my boy and a successful cruise to you and if when you return you bring morillo with you or can assure me of his destruction you shall have tother swab for i shall consider that you have wellearned it and therewith i left him and drove into kingston where i routed out a boatman and made the best of my way aboard the diane an hour later the brigantine was under way and threading her passage through the shoals to seaward under the influence of a roaring landbreeze the question that now exercised my mind was where was i to look for morillo in what direction should i be most likely to find him it was a most difficult question to answer but after considering the matter in all its bearings i came to the conclusion that his most likely haunt would probably be near one of the great entrances from the atlantic to the caribbean sea where he would be conveniently posted to intercept and plunder both outward and homewardbound ships although he would probably take care not to establish himself too near lest he should run foul of any of our cruisers stationed in the same locality for the protection of british bottoms trading to and from west indian ports he would in all likelihood select a spot some two or three hundred miles away out in the atlantic from which he could command both the outward and the homeward routes of ships bound from and to europe i opened a chart of the north atlantic and studied it carefully trying to imagine myself in his place and thinking what i should do under such circumstances and reasoning in this way i at length fixed upon a belt of ocean suitable for piratical purposes and thither i determined to make my way thoroughly searching every mile of intervening water as i did so then came the question whether i should select the windward or the mona passage by which to make my way into the atlantic and after much anxious consideration i decided upon the windward passage that being the channel most frequently used by our merchantmen i accordingly set the course for morant point and then went below and turned in when i went on deck next morning shortly after daybreak i found that the diane had weathered the point and was now on the starboard tack heading well up for cape mayzi with the blue mountains already assuming the hue from which they are named as the brigantine rapidly left them astern it was a brilliant morning with the trade wind piping up to the tune of half a gale yet the little ship was showing her topgallantsail to it and sheering through the rather short choppy sea like a mad thing with her yards braced hard in against the lee rigging and the lower half of her foresail dark with spray while the white foam hissed and seethed and raced past her to leeward at a pace that made one giddy to look at that the diane was a perfect marvel in the matter of speedand a good seaboat withalwas undeniable and as i stood aft to windward of the helmsman and watched the little hooker thrashing along i felt sanguine that should we be fortunate enough to encounter senor morillo he would have but small chance of escaping us by showing a clean pair of heels the following midnight found us handsomely weathering cape mayzi the most easterly extremity of the island of cuba after which we held on until we had brought the southern extremity of great inagua broad abeam when we again tacked and so worked our way out to sea between the handkerchief shoal and grand caicos passing an inwardbound indiaman on the way i spoke this vessel asking if they had sighted any suspicious craft of late to which the skipper replied that four days previously he had been chased by a french brig which he had contrived to elude in the darkness and that he had on the following day sighted and spoken the british frigate euterpe which had forthwith proceeded in quest of the brig thenceforth we sighted nothing until our fifth day out when we fell in with the euterpe which had just returned to her station after an unsuccessful search two days later we sighted a british privateer which made sail and tried to run away from us as soon as she made out our pennant fearingso the skipper said when we overhauled and compelled him to heavetothat we should impress some of his men but as i had as many hands as i required i let him go without compelling him to pay toll his report was that the atlantic was absolutely empty of shipping he having sighted nothing but a british lineofbattle ship and three frigates during his passage across finally we reached the cruisingground that i had selected as being the most likely spot in which to meet morillo and there we cruised for a full fortnight just reaching to and fro athwart the wind under mainsail topsail and jib and still there was no sign of the guerrilla or of any other craft at length i became so thoroughly discouraged that one night soon after sundown i went below got out my chart and proceeded to study it afresh with a view to the selection of some other cruisingground and at length after long and anxious consideration i fixed upon a new spot for which i determined to bear up next day if by noon nothing had hove in sight it chanced however that at dawn next morning a craft was made out some ten miles to windward of us and the officer of the watch at once came down below and called me i went on deck immediately to find that the day was just breaking and the stranger even then only barely visible against the faint light that was spreading along the eastern horizon as we stood looking we made her out to be a squarerigged vessel apparently of no great size running down toward us under easy canvas and the thought came to me that here was the guerrilla at last and that my patience was about to meet its reward but a few minutes laterby which time as i supposed it had grown light enough to reveal our canvas to the approaching strangerthe craft suddenly hauled her wind and i then saw that she was a brig that she was not a merchantman was obvious from the fact that she was under such short canvas all she showed being her two topsails spanker and jibjust such canvas as a privateer or gunbrig would show in fact on her cruisingground and i at once set her down for one or the other of her nationality however it was impossible to correctly judge at that distance and in the still imperfect light but there was a certain subtle something in her appearance that suggested france as the land of her birth meanwhile as she had roundedto on the same tack as ourselves evidently with the intention of taking a good look at us before approaching too near we held on as we were going taking no notice whatever of her in about a quarter of an hour however it became apparent that we were headreaching upon her whereupon she dropped her foresail to keep pace with us while we on our part took a small pull upon the lee braces which enabled us to head up a point higher and so gradually edge up toward her such excessive caution as the stranger was now exhibiting convinced me that she could not be british she must consequently be an enemy and having once made up my mind upon this point i very gradually braced our yards as flat in against the rigging as they would come flattened in the main and jibsheets and thus brought the diane on a taut bowline without as i hoped arousing the suspicion of the stranger meanwhile keeping the telescope constantly levelled upon her in order that should i see any hands in her rigging going aloft to make sail we might follow suit without loss of time but i did not wish to take the initiative because by so doing i might possibly alarm them while so long as we both kept on as we were we were gradually and almost imperceptibly closing her this state of affairs prevailed for about an hour when suddenlywith the view perhaps of compelling us to disclose our intentionsthe stranger tacked obliged thus to throw off the mask we at once did the same the handswho had been standing by waiting for ordersat the same time springing into the rigging to loose our additional canvas and by the time that the little hooker was fairly round on the starboard tack and the yards swung our topgallant sail and gafftopsail were sheeted home and in the act of being hoisted together with the flying jib foretopmast staysail and main and maintopmast staysails while the fore tack was being boarded and the sheet hauled aft this caused an immediate stir aboard the stranger who in her turn at once set all plain sail to her topgallant sails the wind being altogether too fresh for either of us to show a royal to it the manoeuvres just described brought the brig about three points before our starboard beam and some eight miles to windward of us both craft being now closehauled on the starboard tack there was a strong breeze blowing from the northeast with a fair amount of sea on and the day was brilliantly fine with a rich clear crystalline blue sky dappled here and there with puffs of white tradecloud sailing solemnly athwart our mastheads a splendid day for sailing and we had the whole of it before us it soon became apparent that we were gaining upon the brigweathering and forereaching upon her at the same time and as it was now broad daylight i sent the men to quarters hoisted our colours and fired a shotted gun to windward as an invitation to her to heaveto but of this she took no notice whatever by nine oclockat which hour i took an observation of the sun for my longitudewe had forereached upon the brig sufficiently to bring her a couple of points abaft our weather beam and then in accordance with the rule for chasing we tacked again whereupon she did the same thus bringing us right astern and slightly to windward of her it was now a sternchase she being as nearly as possible seven miles ahead of us the wind held steady and hour after hour the two craft went plunging along at racing speed the brigantine gaining steadily all the time until by one oclock the chase was within range and we opened fire upon her with our long eighteen pounder our shot flew close to her on either sideas we could see by the jets of water thrown upbut it was fully half an hour before we hit her which we then did fair in the centre of her stern she immediately shot into the wind all aback and it took them fully five minutes to box her off again whenseeing i suppose that they could not now possibly escape usher people clewed up her courses hauled down topgallant sails and staysails until they had reduced their canvas to what it had been when we first sighted her hoisted french colours and bore up for us it was at this time that we first made out the upper canvas of another vessel just appearing above the horizon in the northern board and evidently steering in our direction and upon sending aloft one of the midshipmen who were acting as my lieutenants he reported her as a craft of apparently about our own size the fact that she was heading toward us led me to the conclusion that she must be either a privateer or a small cruiser like ourselvesevidently attracted by the sound of our gunsand as i did not wish for her assistance if a friend or the additional anxiety of having to fight her at the same time as the brig if an enemy i called the hands aft and made them a brief speech impressing upon them the importance of settling the brigs business as promptly as possible in order that we might be free to give the other stranger our undivided attention if necessary they answered with a hearty cheer and went back to their guns and a quarter of an hour later the brig roundedto within biscuittoss to windward of us giving us her larboard broadside as she did so this was the beginning of a regular setto hammer and tongs between us the french fighting with the utmost courage and determination and playing havoc with our rigging which they cut up so severely that half a dozen of our people were kept busy aloft knotting and splicing at length however when the fight had thus been raging for a full hour with heavy loss on both sides tacking suddenly under cover of the smoke of our starboard broadside we shot across the brigs stern raking her with a doubleshotted broadside from our larboard guns which had the effect of bringing both her masts down by the run rendering her a wreck and unmanageable and we now felt that she was ours but we were reckoning without our hostor rather without the second stranger whom we had been altogether too busy to give a thought to as the smoke of our guns blew away to leeward and we prepared to tack again preparatory to passing once more athwart the brigs stern i got a full and clear view of the stranger whoapproaching us from to windwardhad hitherto been hidden from us by the brig and by the smoke of our combined cannonade she was less than half a mile distant from us and was at the moment in the very act of taking in her studding sails she was a brigantine and a single glance at her sufficed to assure me that she was the guerrilla and that at last the feud between morillo and myself was to be fought out to the bitter end i had long ago prepared a red swallowtailed burgee such as the pirate had dared me to exhibit and i immediately gave orders to hoist it at our fore royal masthead the flag had scarcely reached the truck when i saw a black flag flutter out over the other brigantines rail and go soaring aloft to her gaffend morillo had evidently recognised my challenge and was prompt to answer it sweeping under the brigs stern again at a distance of only a few fathoms i hailed asking whether they surrendered but a pistolshot which flew close past my ear was their only reply so we gave them our starboard broadside and then wore round to meet our new antagonist leaving the brig meanwhile to her own devices i am of opinion that morillo must have had a very shrewd suspicion as to our identity long before the exhibition of our burgee because of the eager haste with which he bore down upon us so eager indeed was he that he carried his studdingsails just a minute or two too long a mistake on his part which enabled us to make a couple of short stretches to windward and secure the weathergage before he was ready to roundto although as soon as his people detected our purpose they worked with frantic haste to shorten sail the pirates opened the ball by giving us their whole larboard broadside while we were in stays tacking toward them but the guns were fired hurriedly and did us no harm the shot flying high over us and between our masts without touching so much as a ropeyarn five minutes later we passed close across the guerrillas stern making a halfboard to clear her and delivered our larboard broadside with the eighteen pounder thrown in every shot taking effect and raking her from end to end morillo was standing aft by the taffrail and as we passed near enough to hear the wash of the water about the pirate vessels rudder he suddenly snatched up a blunderbuss and singling me out fired pointblank at me one bullet knocking my cap off while another lodged in my left shoulder a third killing the man at our wheel close behind me the guerrilla immediately ported her helm while i springing to our wheel put it hard astarboard thus passing a second time athwart our antagonists stern and again we raked her mercilessly this time with our starboard broadside keeping our wheel hard over we swept round until we were once more in stays the guerrilla having tacked toward us a minute earlier with the evident intention of raking us in her turn we were just a little too quick for her however gathering way so smartly that as we neared each other it became evident that unless one or the other of us tacked again we must inevitably run foul of each other i had no mind for this sort of thing however as we should probably hurt ourselves quite as much as our antagonist so holding on until we had only just room to clear the guerrilla and singing out for a second shot to be rammed home in the larboard guns i eased our helm down just at the right moment ranging up so close to the other brigantine that we almost grazed her side when we exchanged broadsides at precisely the same instant with terrible effect on both sides at the same moment our topsail was thrown aback to deaden our way and as the guerrilla passed ahead our helm was put hard up and we paid square off across her stern firing our starboard broadside into her as we did so the result this time was absolutely disastrous to the pirates for the guns were fired at the precise moment when the guerrillas stern was lifted up on the crest of a sea while we were in the trough beyond in consequence of which our shot all struck her a trifle below her normal waterline producing a very serious leak which even under the most favourable circumstances it would have been exceedingly difficult to stop but this was not the worst of it the shot by a lucky accident so far as we were concerned had somehow become concentrated all of them taking effect upon the pirates rudder and sternpost with the result that the former was shot away and the latter as well as two or three hoodends so badly started that ere ten minutes had elapsed it became apparent that the guerrilla was rapidly filling meanwhile however we held on across her stern filling our topsail again and tacking as soon as we had room while the pirate brigantine deprived of her rudder shot into the wind and got in irons obstinately refusing to pay off on either tack this enabled us to sweep across her bows pouring in our port broadside as we passed raking her fore and aft and bringing down her foremast by the run holding on for a few minutes we next wore roundgetting her starboard broadside as we passedand then cut close across her stern again raking her as before by this time however it had become apparent that she was sinking so having once more tacked we ranged up close athwart her stern with our topsail aback when instead of firing i hailed to ask if they surrendered no senor replied morillo himself who was standing aft close to the now useless wheel we will never surrender i wrote you a letter which i hope you receivedin which i said that i would fight you until my ship sinks under me and i mean to do so i also told you that my feud with you is to the death so take that and therewith the scoundrel quickly levelled a pistol and for the second time that day fired pointblank at me and there is no doubt whatever that this time he would have slain mefor the pistol was pointed so truly that i actually looked for a moment right into the barrel of ithad it not been for the dianes helmsman who unceremoniously seized me by the arm in the very nick of time and quickly pulled me aside as it was the bullet whistled close past my ear this dastardly act so exasperated our people that forthwith without waiting for orders they poured the whole of our port broadside into the devoted craft completely demolishing her stern so that for a few seconds as we drew slowly athwart her wake we got a full view of her decks which were cumbered with killed and wounded and literally streaming with blood still by a miracle morillo himself survived this last destructive broadside of ours for when the smoke blew away i saw him still standing erect and shaking his fist defiantly at us it was by this time evident to us all that the guerrilla was a doomed ship she was settling fast in the water and to continue firing upon her would only be a waste of ammunition we therefore filled our topsail and a few minutes later tacked again getting a broadside from the sinking ship when we stationed ourselves square athwart her bows where we were pretty well out of the way of her fireand with topsail aback and mainsheet eased off waited patiently for the final moment which we saw was rapidly approaching yet even now morillo persisted in firing at us with his two bow guns compelling us to fire upon him in return and so the useless fight went on until the guerrilla had settled so low in the water that the sea welled in over her bows at every plunge of her rendering it impossible to any longer maintain their fire then with folded hands we all stood by watching for the end and a very melancholy picture it was upon which we looked there was the illimitable expanse of ocean all round us blue as sapphire heaving in long regular ridges of swell and whipped into foam here and there by the scourging of the strong trade wind with a rich blue sky above dappled with wisps of tradecloud and the sun shining brilliantly down from the midst of them causing the heaving waters to flash and glitter under his fiery beams so that the sea that way was too dazzling to look at and there right in the centre of the glowing picture lay the two brigantineswe with our bulwarks torn and splintered to pieces our sails riddled with shotholes our rigging badly cut up and our decks scored with shotmarks and littered with dead and wounded men while the guerrilla was an even more melancholy wreck than ourselves as she lay heaving and rolling sluggishly with her coveringboards awash and the sea sweeping her decks from stem to taffrail at every plunge and the wreck of her foremast towing under her bows there was not a soul visible on board her when she first engaged us her decks had appeared to be crowded with men but now most of them were either killed or wounded and the few who had escaped seemed to have flung themselves down exhausted for they had all disappeared as for the craft herself it was now only when she rose heavily upon the ridges of the swell that we could see her hull at all and every plunge that she took into a hollow threatened to be her last yet she lingered as though reluctant to leave the brilliant sunshine and the warm strong breeze lingered until i began to wonder whether she would not after all remain afloat a waterlogged wreck and then all in a moment her stern rose high in the air revealing her shattered rudder and sternpost and with a long slow diving movement she plunged forward like a sounding whale and silently vanished in a little swirl of water we at once bore up for the spot where she had disappearedfinding it easily by the torn and splintered fragments of wreckage that came floating up to the surface but her crew went down with her to a man for although we cruised about the spot for fully half an hour we never saw even so much as a dead body come to the surface and so ended that terror of the seas the guerrilla with her bloodthirsty pirate crew and with her destruction ended the feud that had been thrust upon me by one of the most fiendish monsters in human form that ever sailed the ocean it may perhaps seem to the reader a coldblooded deed on our part to remain passively by and calmly watch the passing of those wretches to their account but in reality it was an act of mercy for their end was at least swift whereas had we saved any of them it would only have been that they might terminate their career upon the gallows meanwhile the brig had dropped some six miles to leeward during the fight and her crew had made the best of the opportunity by endeavouring to get some juryspars aloft the time however was too short for that and when we ran down to them they were still in the thick of their work but they had now had enough of fighting for when i again hailed to ask if they surrendered they at once replied in the affirmative and in due course we took possession of the nereide of bordeaux armed with twelve long ninepounders and with a crew originally of eightysix men of whom twentythree were killed and fiftyseven wounded in her fight with us we spent the remainder of that day in completing the rigging of the jurymasts that her people had begun and made sail upon both craft just after sunset that same evening arriving safely in port royal harbour some three weeks later and now what remains to be said the tale of my association with the fate of morillo the pirate is told and all i need add is that when the account of my exploit was told i received a great deal more credit and praise than i felt i really deserved while as for my friend the admiralwell he was as good as his word for within twentyfour hours of my arrival with my prize in port royal harbour he handed me with hearty congratulations and many kind words the commission that entitled me to mount tother swab the end
