the castaways by harry collingwood a very nice book by this prolific writer of adventures at sea not too long and fully recommended as usual with this author this book makes a nice audiobook i just wonder what made him use this title as there are so many books with the same title and i would not have said that there were any castaway situations in this book but perhaps this is because the book didnt go in quite the direction that the author intended when he started to write it the castaways by harry collingwood chapter one miss onslow it was on a wet dreary dismal afternoon toward the end of october that i found myself en route for gravesend to join the clipper ship city of cawnpore in the capacity of cuddy passenger bound for calcutta the wind was blowing strong from the southeast and came sweeping along charged with frequent heavy rain squalls that dashed fiercely against the carriage windows while the atmosphere was a mere dingy brownish grey expanse of shapeless vapour so allpervading that it shut out not only the entire firmament but also a very considerable portion of the landscape there had been a time not so very long agowhile i was hunting slavers on the west coast grilling under a scorching african sun day after day and month after month with pitiless monotonywhen the mere recollection of such weather as this had made me long for a taste of it as a priceless luxury but now after some five months experience of the execrable british climate i folded my cloak more closely about me as i gazed through the carriage windows at the rainblurred landscape and blessed the physician who was sending me southward in search of warmth and sunshine and the strong salt breeze once more for it was in pursuit of renewed health and strength that i was about to undertake the voyage a spell of over two years of hard uninterrupted service upon the coastduring which a more than average allowance of wounds and fever had fallen to my sharehad compelled me to invalid home and now with my wounds healed the fever banished from my system and in possession of a snug little recentlyacquired competence that rendered it unnecessary for me to follow the sea as a profession i charles conyers rn aged twentysevenwas by the fiat of my medical adviser about to seek on the broad ocean that lifegiving tonic which is unobtainable elsewhere and which was all that i now needed to entirely reinvigorate my constitution and complete my restoration to perfect health upon my arrival at gravesend i was glad to find that the rain had ceased for the moment although the sky still looked full of it i therefore lost no time in making my way down to the river where i forthwith engaged a waterman to convey me and the few light articles i had brought with me off to the ship the city of cawnpore was a brandnew iron ship of some twelve hundred tons register modelled like a frigate fullrigged and as handsome a craft in every respect as i had ever seen i had seen her before of course in the docks when i had gone down to inspect her and choose my cabin but she was then less than half loaded her decks were dirty and lumbered up with bales and cases of cargo her jibbooms were rigged in and her topgallantmasts down on deck and altogether she was looking her worst while now lying well out toward the middle of the stream as she was she looked a perfect picture as she lay with her bows pointing downstream straining lightly at her cable upon the last of the floodtide loaded down just sufficiently as it seemed to put her into perfect sailing trim her black hull with its painted ports showing up in strong contrast to the peasoupcoloured flood upon which she rode her lofty masts stayed to a hair and all accurately parallel gleaming like ruddy gold against the dingy murk of the wildlooking sky her yards were all squared with the nicest precision and the new creamwhite canvas snugly furled upon them and the booms the red ensign streamed from the gaffend and the burgee or house flaga red star in a white diamond upon a blue fieldcut with a swallow tail in the present instance to indicate that her skipper was the commodore of the fleetfluttered at the mainroyalmasthead shes a pretty ship sir a very pretty ship as handsome a vessel as ive ever seed a lyin off this here town remarked the waterman who was pulling me off to her noting perhaps the admiration in my gaze and shes a good staunch ship too well built well found and well mannedthe owners of them red star liners wont have nothin less than the very best of everything in their ships and aboard of emand i hopes your honourll have a very pleasant voyage im sure you ought to for theres some uncommon nice people goin out in her i took three of em off myself in this here very same boat bout a hour ago and one of emah she is a beauty she is and no mistake handsome as a hangel and such eyeswhy sir theyre that bright and they sparkles to that extent that you wont want no stars not so long as shes on deck indeed answered i with languid interest yet glad nevertheless to learn that there was to be at least one individual of agreeable personality on board then as we drew up toward the accommodation ladder i continued back your starboard oar pull port way enough lay in your oars and look out for the line that they are about to heave to you ay ay sir answered the fellow as he proceeded with slow deliberation but a great show of alacrity to obey my injunctions dash my buttons he continued if i didnt think as youd seen a ship afore today and knowed the stem from the starn of her says i to myself when i seen the way that you took hold of them yokelines and the knowin cock of your heye as you runned it over this here vessels hull and spars and her rigginthis here gent as ive a got hold of is a sailor he is and as sich hell know what a hard life of it we pore watermen has and i shouldnt wonder but whatknowin the hardness of the lifehellthankee sir i wishes you a wery pleasant voyage with all my eart sir take hold steward these is all the things the gent has brought along of im i was received at the gangway by a fine sailorlylooking man some thirtyfive years of age and of about middle height sturdily built and with a frank alert pleasant expression of face who introduced himself to me as the chief matemurgatroyd by namefollowing up his selfintroduction with the information that captain dacre had not yet come down from town but might be expected on board in time for dinner it was just beginning to rain rather sharply again or i should have been disposed to remain on deck for a while and improve my acquaintance with this geniallooking sailor as it was i merely paused beside him long enough to note that the deck between the foremast and the mainmast seemed to be crowded with rough roundbacked awkwardlooking men having the appearance of navvies or something of that kind also that the main hatch was partially closed by a grating through an aperture in which at the after port angle of the hatchway other men of a like sort were passing up and down by means of a ladder the mate caught my inquiring glance as it wandered over the roughlooking crowd and replied to it by remarking miners and suchlikea hundred and twenty of emgoing out to develop a new mine somewhere up among the himalayas so im told rather a tough lot by the look of em mr conyers but ill take care that they dont annoy the cuddy passengers and theyll soon shake down when once were at sea no doubt i replied poor fellows they appear to be indifferent enough to the idea of leaving their native land but how many of them i wonder will live to return to it steward i continued as i turned away to follow the man who was carrying my hand baggage below for me is there anyone in the same cabin with me no sir youve got it all to yourself sir was the reply there was a young gent he continuedone of a family of six as was goin out with uswho was to have been put in along with you sir but the father have been took suddenly ill so theyre none of em going consequence is that weve only got thirty cuddy passengers aboard instead of thirtysix which is our full complement your trunks is under the bottom berth sir and ive unstrapped em anything more i can do for you sir i replied in the negative thanking the man for his attention and then as he closed the cabindoor behind him i seated myself upon a sofa and looked round at the snug and roomy apartment which if all went well i was to occupy during the voyage of the ship to india and back the room was some ten feet long by eight feet wide and seven feet high to the underside of the beams it was set athwartships instead of fore and aft as was at that period more frequently the fashion and it was furnished with two bunks or beds one over the other built against the bulkhead that divided the cabin from that next it the lower bunk was made up with bed bedding and pillows complete ready for occupation but the upper bunk not being required had been denuded of its bedding leaving only the open framework of the bottom which was folded back and secured against the bulkhead out of the way thus leaving plenty of air space above me when i should be turned in at the foot of the bunks there was a nice deep double chest of drawers surmounted by an ornamental rackwork arrangement containing a brace of waterbottles with tumblers to match together with vacant spaces for the reception of such matters as brushes and combs razorcases and other odds and ends then there was a washstand with a toiletglass above it and a cupboard beneath the basin containing two large metal ewers of fresh water and alongside the washstand hung a couple of large soft towels there was a fine big bulls eye in the deck overhead and a circular port in the ships side big enough for me to have crept through with some effort had i so wished the copper frame of which was glazed with plate glass a full inch thick beneath this port was the short sofa upholstered in black horsehair upon which i sat and screwed to the ships side in such a position as to be well out of the way yet capable of pretty completely illuminating the cabin was a handsome little silverplated lamp already lighted hung in gimbals and surmounted by a frosted glass globe very prettily chased with a pattern of flowers and leaves and birds the bulkheads were painted a dainty cream colour with gilt mouldings a heavy curtain of rich material screened the door and the deck of the cabin was covered with a thick handsome carpet what a contrast thought i to my miserable stuffy little doghole of a cabin aboard the old hebe and i sat there so long meditating upon the times that were gone and the scenes of the past that i lost all consciousness of my surroundings and was only awakened from my brown studyor was it a quiet little napby the loud clanging of the first dinner bell thus admonished i went to work with a will to get into my dress clothesfor those were the days when such garments were de rigueur aboard all liners of any pretensionsand was quite ready to make my way to the saloon when the second and final summons to dinner pealed forth the cuddy or main saloon of the ship was on deck under the full poop while the sleeping accommodation was below consequently by the time that i had reached the vestibule upon which the cuddy doors opened i found myself in the midst of quite a little crowd of more or less welldressed people who were jostling each other in a gentle wellbred sort of way in their eagerness to get into the saloon they were mostly silent as is the way of the english among strangers but a few here and there who seemed to have already made each others acquaintance passed the usual inane remarks about the absurdly inconvenient arrangements generally of the ship some half a dozen stewards were showing the passengers to their places at table as they passed in through the doorways and upon my entrance i was at once pounced upon by one of the aforesaid stewards who in semiconfidential tones remarked this way if you please sir its capn dacres orders that you was to be seated close alongside of him as i followed the man down the length of the roomy handsome apartment i could scarcely realise that it was the same that i had seen when the ship lay loading in the dock then the deck or floor as a landsman would call it was carpetless the tables chairs sofas lamps and walls of the cabin were draped in brown holland to protect them from the allpenetrating dust and dirt that is always flying about more or less during the handling of cargo and the room was lighted only by the skylights now i found myself in a scene as brilliant after its own fashion as that afforded by the diningroom of a firstclass hotel the saloon was of the full width of the ship and some forty feet long by about eight feet high the sides and the ceiling were panelled and painted in cream light blue and gold and it was furnished with three tablesone on either side of the cabin running foreandaft with a good wide gangway between and one athwartships and abaft the other two with seats on the after side of it only so that no one was called upon to turn his or her back upon those sitting at the other two tables the tables were gleaming with snowwhite napery crystal and silver and were further adorned with handsome flowering plants in painted china bowls placed at frequent intervals the deck was covered with a carpet in which ones feet sank ankle deep the sofas were upholstered in stamped purple velvet and the whole scene was illuminated by the soft yet brilliant light of three clusters of three lamps each suspended over the centres of the several tables abaft the aftermost table i caught a glimpse of a piano open with some sheets of music upon it as though someone had already been trying the tone of the instrument conducted by the steward i presently found myself installed in a chair between two ladies one of whom was seated alongside the skipper on his right this lady was youngapparently about twentyone or twentytwo years of age above medium heightif one could form a correct judgment of her stature as she sat at the tablea rich and brilliant brunette crowned with a wealth of most beautiful and luxuriant goldenchestnut hair and altogether the most perfectly lovely creature that i had ever beheld i felt certain the moment my eyes rested upon her that she must certainly be the subject of my friend the watermans enthusiastic eulogies the other ladyshe who occupied the seat on my rightwas stout elderly greyhaired and very richly attired in brocade and lace with a profusion of jewellery about her she was also loudvoiced for as i passed behind her toward my seat she shouted to the elderly militarylooking man on her right now pat dont ye attempt to argue wid me i shall be ill tomorrow no matther what i ait or dont ait so i shall take a good dinner and injoy mesilf while i can captain dacrea very finelooking handsome whitehaired man attired in a fairly close imitation of a naval captains uniform and looking a thorough sailor all overwas already seated but upon seeing me he rose stretched out his hand and remarked lieutenant conyers i presume welcome sir aboard the city of cawnpore and i hope that when next you see gravesend you will have fully recovered the health and strength you are going to sea to look for it is not often mr conyers that i have a brother sailor upon my passenger list so when i am so fortunate i make the most of him by providing himas in your casewith a berth at the table as nearly alongside me as possible allow me to make you known to your neighbours miss onslow permit me to introduce lieutenant conyers of our royal navy lady obriengeneral sir patrick obrienlieutenant conyers miss onslowthe beauty on my leftacknowledged the introduction with a very queenly and distant bow lady obrien looked me keenly in the eyes for an instant and then shook hands with me very heartily and the general murmured something about being glad to make my acquaintance and forthwith addressed himself with avidity to the plate of soup which one of the stewards placed before him presently having finished his soup the general leaned forward and stared hard at me for a moment then he remarked excuse me conyersit is no use being formal when we are about to be cooped up together on board ship for the next two months is itare you the man that got so shockingly hacked about at the capture of that piratical slaver thethehang it all ive forgotten her name now if you refer to the preciosa i must plead guilty to the soft impeachment answered i ah he exclaimed hang me if i didnt think so when i heard your name and saw that scar across your forehead wonderfully plucky thing to do sir as plucky a thing i think as i ever heard of i must get you to tell me all about it some time or anotherhere steward hang it all man this sherry is corked bring me another bottle i am rather a shy man and this sudden identification of me in connection with an affair that i had already grown heartily tired of hearing referred to and that i fondly hoped would now be speedily forgotten by my friends was distinctly disconcerting i therefore seized upon the opportunity afforded me by the mishap to the generals sherry to divert the conversation into another channel by turning to my lovely lefthand neighbour with the inquiry is this your first experience of shipboard miss onslow this will be my third voyage to india mr conyers she answered with an air of surprise at my temerity in addressing her and such proud stately dignity and lofty condescension that i caught myself thinking hillo charley my lad what sort of craft is this you are exchanging salutes with you will have to take care what you are about with her my fine fellow or you will be finding that some of her guns are shotted but i was not to be deterred from making an effort to render myself agreeable simply because the manner of the young lady was almost chillingly distant so i returned indeed then you are quite a seasoned traveller and how does the sea use you does it treat you kindly if you mean am i ill at sea i am glad to say that i am not she replied i love the sea but i hate voyaging upon it that sounds somewhat paradoxical does it not i ventured to insinuate possibly it does she admitted what i mean is that while i never enjoy such perfect health anywhere as i do when at sea and while i passionately admire the everchanging beauty and poetry of the ocean and sky in their varying moods i find it distinctly irksome and unpleasant to be pent up for months within the narrow confines of a ship with no possibility of escape from my surroundings however unpleasant they may be there is no privacy and no change on board a ship one is compelled to meet the same people day after day and to be brought into more or less intimate contact with them whether one wishes it or not that is undoubtedly true i acknowledged so far at least as meeting the same people day after day is concerned but surely one need not necessarily be brought into intimate contact with them unless so minded it is not difficult to make the average person understand that anything approaching to intimacy is unwelcome is it not she retorted drily then i am afraid that my experience has been more unfortunate than yours i have more than once been obliged to be actually rude to people before i could succeed in convincing them that i would prefer not to be on intimate terms with them and therewith miss onslow ever so slightly turned herself away from me and addressed herself to the contents of her plate with a manner that seemed indicative of a desire to terminate the conversation i thought that i already began to understand this very charming and interesting young lady i had not the remotest idea who or what she was beyond the bare fact that her name was onslow but her style and her mannersdespite her singular hauteurstamped her unmistakably as one accustomed to move in a high plane of society that she was inordinately proud and intensely exclusive was clear but i had an idea that this faultif such it could be consideredwas due rather to training than to any innate imperfection of character and i could conceive thatthe barrier of her exclusiveness once passedshe might prove to be winsome and fascinating beyond the power of words to express but i had a suspicion that the man who should be bold enough to attempt the passage of that barrier would have to face many a rebuff as well as the very strong probability of ultimate ignominious irretrievable defeat and as i was thenand still am for that matter a rather sensitive individual i quickly determined that i at least would not dare such a fate moreover i seemed to find in the drift of what she had saidand more particularly in her manner of saying ita hint that possibly i might be one of those with whom she would prefer not to be on terms of intimacy well thought i if that is her wish it shall certainly be gratified she is a surpassingly beautiful creature but i can admire and enjoy the contemplation of her beauty as i would that of some rare and exquisite picture without obtruding myself offensively upon her attention and although she has all the appearance of being clever refined and possessed of a brilliant intellect those qualities will have no irresistible attraction for me if she intends to hide them behind a cold haughty repellant manner and therewith i dismissed her from my mind and addressed myself to the skipper this new ship of yours is a magnificent craft captain said i i fell incontinently in love with her as the waterman was pulling me off alongside she is far and away the most handsome ship i have ever set eyes on ay answered dacre heartily his whole face kindling with enthusiasm she is a beauty and no mistake you have some fine handsome frigates in the service mr conyers but i doubt whether the best of them will compare with the city of cawnpore for beauty speed or seagoing qualities my word sir but it would have done you good to have seen her before she was put into the water shapely shapely is not the word for it she is absolutely beautiful she is to other craft whathere his eye rested upon miss onslows unconscious face for an instanta perfectly lovely woman is to a fat old dowdy there is only one fault i have to find with her and that is only a fault in my eyes there are many who regard it as a positive and important merit and pray what may that be i inquired and as i asked the question several of the passengers who had overheard the skippers remark craned forward over the table in eager anticipation of his reply why sir answered dacre she is built of iron instead of good sound wholesome heart of oak thats the fault i find with her i have never been shipmates with iron before and i confess i dont like it of course he continuedjudging perhaps from some of the passengers looks that he had said something a trifle indiscreetit is only prejudice on my part i cant explain my objection to iron everybody who ought to know anything about the matter declares that iron is immensely strong compared with wood and i sincerely believe them still there the feeling is and i expect it will take me a month or two to get over it you see i have been brought up and have spent upwards of forty years of my life in wooden ships and i suppose i am growing a trifle too old to readily take up newfangled notions ah captain i have met with men of your sort before remarked the general you are by no means the first person with a prejudice but youll get over it my dear fellow youll get over it and when you have done so youll acknowledge that theres nothing like iron for shipbuilding apropos of seafaring matters what sort of a voyage do you think we shall have the skipper shrugged his shoulders who can tell he answered everything depends upon the weather and what is more fickle than thatoutside the limits of the tradewinds and the monsoons i mean of course if we are unlucky enough to meet with a long spell of calms on the linewell that means a long passage but give me as much wind as i can show all plain sail to and no farther forard than abeam and ill undertake to land you all at calcutta within sixty days from today we were still discussing the probability of the skipper being able to fulfil his promise when a howling squall swept through the taut rigging and between the masts of the ship causing the whole fabric to vibrate with a barely perceptible tremor while the swish and patter of heavy rain resounded upon the glass of the skylights whew ejaculated the general what a lively prospect for tonight what are we to do after dinner to amuse ourselves and where are we men to go for our smoke i think said i we shall find a very comfortable place for a smoke under the overhang of the poop the tide is ebbing strong by this time so the ship will be riding more or less sternon to the wind and we shall find a very satisfactory lee and shelter at the spot that i have named ay assented the skipper and when you have finished smoking what can you wish for better than this fine saloon in which to play cards or read or even to organise an impromptu concert there is a capital piano abaft there and i am sure that among so distinguished a company there must be plenty of good musicians and so indeed it proved for when having finished our smoke the general and some half a dozen more of us returned to the cuddy we found that several of the younger ladies of the party had already produced their music and were doing their best to make the evening pass pleasantly for themselves and others miss onslow was one of the exceptions she had not produced any music nor apparently did she intend to take anything more than a passive part in the entertainment indeed it is going almost too far to say even so much as that for it appeared doubtful whether she even condescended so far as to regard herself as one of the audience she had provided herself with a book and had curled herself up comfortably in the corner most distant from the piano and was reading with an air of absorption and interest so pronounced as really to be almost offensive to the performers in almost anyone else the manifestation of so profound an indifference to the efforts of others to please would have been regarded as an indication of illbreeding but in her casewell she was so regally and entrancingly lovely that somehow one felt as though her beauty justified everything and that it was an act of condescension and a favour that she graced the cuddy with her presence at all and indeed i was very much disposed to think that this was her own view of the matter be that as it may we all spent an exceedingly pleasant evening and when i turned into my bunk that night i felt very well satisfied with the prospects of the voyage before me chapter two at seaa wreck in sight i was awakened at six oclock the next morning by the men chorussing at the windlass and the quick clank of the pawls that showed how thoroughly jack was putting his heart into his work and how quickly he was walking the ship up to her anchor i scrambled out of my bunk and took a peep through the port in the ships side to see what the weather was like it was scarcely daylight yet the glass of the port was blurred with the quick splashing of rain and the sky was simply a blot of scurrying dirty grey vapour i made a quick mental reference to the condition of the tide deducting therefrom the direction of the ships head and thus arrived at the fact that the wind still hung in the same quarter as yesterday or about southeast after which i turned in again the weather being altogether too dismal to tempt me out on deck at so early an hour as i did so there was a loud cry or command the chorussing at the windlass abruptly ceased and in the silence that temporarily ensued i caught the muffled sound of the steam blowingoff from the tugs wastepipe mingled with the faint sound of hailing from somewhere ahead answered in the stentorian tones of mr murgatroyds voice then the windlass was manned once more and the pawls clanked slowly sullenly irregularly for a time growing slower and slower still until there ensued a long pause during which i heard the mate encouraging the crew to a special effort by shouting heave boys heave and raise the dead break him out another pawl heave and so on then there occurred a sudden wrenching jerk followed by a shout of triumph from the crew the windlass pawls resumed their clanking at a rapid rate for a few minutes longer when they finally ceased and i knew that our anchor was atrip and that we had started on our long journey everybody appeared at breakfast that morning naturally there was nothing to prevent them for we were still in the river in smooth water and the ship glided along so steadily that some of us were actually ignorant of the fact of our being under way until made aware of it by certain remarks passed at the breakfasttable after breakfast the weather being as dirty as ever i donned my mackintosh and a pair of sea boots with which i had provided myself in anticipation of such occasions as this and went on deck to look round and smoke a pipe a few other men followed my example among others the general who presently joined me in my perambulation of the poop and i soon found that despite a certain peremptoriness and dictatorial assertiveness of manner which i attributed to his profession and his position in it he was a very fine fellow and a most agreeable companion with an apparently inexhaustible fund of anecdote and reminiscence incidentally i learned from him that miss onslow was the daughter of sir philip onslow an indian judge and a friend of sir patrick obrien and that she was proceeding to calcutta under the chaperonage of lady kathleen the generals wife while we were still chatting together the young lady herself came on deck well wrapped up in a long tweed cloak that reached to her ankles and the general with an apology to me for his desertion stepped forward and gallantly offered his arm which she accepted and she remained on deck the whole of the morning with the wind blustering about her and the rain dashing in her face every time that she faced it in her passage from the wheel grating to the break of the poop to the great benefit of her complexion she was the only lady who ventured on deck that dayfor the weather was so thick that there was nothing to see beyond an occasional buoy marking out the position of a sandbank a grimy geordie loaded down to her coveringboard driving along up the river under a brace of patched and sooty topsails or an inwardbound southspainer in tow of a tug but this fact of her being the only representative of her sex on deck appeared to disconcert miss onslow not at all she was as absolutely selfpossessed as though she and the general had been in sole possession of the deck as indeed they were so far as she was concerned for she calmly and utterly ignored the presence of the rest of us excepting the skipper with whom and with the general she conversed with much vivacity by the arrival of tiffintime we had drawn far enough down the river to be just meeting the first of the sea knocked up by the strong breeze and i noticed that already a few of the seats at table that had been occupied at breakfasttime were vacantamong them that of lady obrienbut my lefthand neighbour exhibited a thoroughly healthy appetitedue in part probably to her long promenade on deck in the wind and the rain she was still as stately and distant in manner as ever however when i attempted to enter into conversation with her and i met with such scant encouragement that ere the meal was half over i desisted leaving to the skipper the task of further entertaining her by six oclock that night we were abreast of the buoy which marks longnose ledge when the pilot shifted his helm for the elbow and we began to feel in earnest the influence of the short choppy sea into which the city of cawnpore was soon plunging her sharp stem to the height of the hawse pipes to the rapidlyincreasing discomfort of many of the passengers by seven oclockwhich was the dinnerhourwe were well round the elbow and heading to pass inside the goodwin and through the downs with most of our foreandaft canvas set and now we had not only a pitching but also a rolling motion to contend with and although the latter was as yet comparatively slight it was still sufficient to induce a further number of our cuddy party to seek the seclusion of their cabins with the result that when we sat down to dinner we did not muster quite a dozen all told but among those present was my lefthand neighbour miss onslow faultlessly attired and to all appearance as completely at her ease as though she were dining ashore the general made a gallant effort to occupy his accustomed seat but the soup proved too much for him and he was compelled to retreat muttering something apologetic and not very intelligible about his liver we remained in tow until the tug had dragged us down abreast the south foreland where she left us taking the pilot with her and half an hour later we were heading down channel under all plain sail to our topgallantsails when i went on deck to get my afterdinner smoke the prospect was as dreary and dismal as it could well be it was dark as a wolfs mouth for the moon was well advanced in her last quarterwhich is as good as saying that there was no moon at alland the thickness overhead not only obliterated the stars but also rendered it impossible for any of their light to reach us one consequence of which was that when standing at the break of the poop it taxed ones eyesight to the utmost to see as far as the bows of the ship the wind was freshening with frequent rain squalls that combined with the intense darkness circumscribed the visible horizon to a radius of about half a cables length on either hand and through this all but opaque blackness the ship was thrashing along at a speed of fully ten knots with a continuous crying and storming of wind aloft through the rigging and in the hollows of the straining canvas and a deep hissing and sobbing sound of water along the bends to which was added the rhythmical thunderous roaring of the bow wave and a frequent grapeshot pattering of spray on the fore deck as the fabric plunged with irresistible momentum into the hollows of the short snappy channel seas it was black and blusterous and everything was dripping wet i was heartily thankful therefore that it was my privilege to go below and turn in just when i pleased instead of having to stand a watch and strain my eyeballs to bursting point in the endeavour to avoid running foul of some of the numerous craft that were knocking about in the channel on that blind and dismal night when my berth steward brought me my coffee next morning he informed me in reply to my inquiries that the weather had improved somewhat during the night and that in his opinion the temperature on deck was mild enough for me to take a saltwater bath in the ships head if i pleased i accordingly jumped out of my bunk and hastily donning my bathing togs made my way on deck i was no sooner on my feet however than i became aware that the ship was particularly lively she was on the port tack and was heeling over considerably so much so indeed that when she rolled to leeward to keep my footing without holding on to something was pretty nearly as much as i could well manage then there was a continuous vibrant thrill pervading the entire fabric suggestive of the idea that her blood was roused and that she was quivering with eager excitement which to the initiated is an unfailing sign that the ship is travelling fast through the water upon reaching the deck i found the watch engaged in the task of washing decks and polishing the brasswork while mr murgatroyd as officer of the watch paced to and fro athwart the fore end of the poop pausing every time he reached the weather side of the deck to fling a quick keen glance to windward and another aloft at the bending topmasts and straining rigging for mr murgatroyd was carrying on and driving the ship quite as much as was consistent with prudence the wind it is true had moderated slightly from its boisterous character of the previous day and was now steady but it was still blowing strong and had hauled round a point or two until it was square abeam yet although the lower yards were braced well forward the ship was under all three royals and fore and maintopgallant and topmast studdingsails with a lower studdingsail upon the foremast she was lying down to it like a racing yacht with the foam seething and hissing and brimming to her rail at every lee roll and the lee scuppers all afloat while she swept along with the eager headlong impetuous speed of a sentient creature flying for its life the wailing and crying of the wind aloftespecially when the ship rolled to windwardwas loud enough and weird enough to fill the heart of a novice with dismay but to the ear of the seaman it sang a song of wild hilarious sea music fittingly accompanied by the deep intermittent thunder of the bow wave as it leapt and roared glassy smooth in a curling snowcrowned breaker from the sharp shearing stem at every wild plunge of it into the heart of an onrushing wave i ran up the poop ladder and stood to windward a fathom back from the break of the poop where i could obtain the best possible view of the ship and i thought i had never before beheld so magnificent and perfect a picture as she presented of triumphant domineering strength and power and of reckless breathless yet untiring speed morning mr conyers shouted murgatroyd halting alongside me as i stood gazing at the pallid blue sky across which great masses of cloud were rapidly sweepingto be outpaced by the lowflying shreds and tatters of steamy scudthe opaque muddy green waste of foaming leaping waters and the flying ship swaying her broad spaces of dampdarkened canvas her tapering and buckling spars and her tautlystrained rigging in long arcs athwart the scurrying clouds as she leapt and plunged and sheared her irresistible way onward in the midst of a wild chaos and dizzying swirl and hurry of foaming spume what think you of this for a grand morning eh sir is this breeze good enough for you and whats your opinion of the city of cawnpore now sir it is a magnificent morning for sailing mr murgatroyd i replied a magnificent morningthat would be none the worse for an occasional glint of sunshine which however may come by and by and as for the ship she is a wonder a perfect flyerwhy she must be reeling off her thirteen knots at the least youve hit it sir pretty closely she was going thirteen and a half when we hove the log at four bells and she hasnt eased up anything since was the reply ah said i that is grand sailingwith the wind where it is but you are driving her rather hard arent you stretching the kinks out of your new rigging eh well perhaps we are admitted the mate with a short laugh as he glanced at the slender upper spars that were whipping about like fishingrods but you know mr conyers were obliged to do it there is so much opposition nowadays and people are in such a deuce of a hurry always to get to the place that they are bound to that the line owning the fastest ships gets the most patronage and theres the whole thing in a nutshell just so and it is all well enough in its wayif you dont happen to get dismasted but i find the morning air rather nipping so i will get my bath and go below again will you kindly allow one of your men to play upon me with the headpump mr murgatroyd certainly mr conyers with pleasure sir answered the mate bosun just tell off a man to pump for mr conyers will ye the ship was by this time so lively that i was not at all surprised to meet but a meagre muster at the breakfasttable yet of the few present miss onslow was one and the soaring and plunging and the wild lee rolls of the ship appeared to affect her no more than if she were sitting at home in her own breakfastroom she was silent as usual but her rich colour and the evident relish with which she partook of the food placed before her bore witness to the fact that her silence was due to inclination alone about an hour after breakfast the young lady made her appearance upon the poop well wrapped up and began to pace to and fro with an assured footing and an easy graceful poise of her body to the movements of the deck beneath her that was to my mind at least the very poetry of motion the skipper and i happened to be walking together at the moment of her appearance and of course we both with one accord sprang forward and cap in hand proffered the support of our arms she accepted that of the skipper with a graciousness of manner that was to be paralleled only by the frigid dignity with which she declined mine the breeze held strong all that day and for the five days following gradually hauling round however and heading us until with our yards braced hard in against the lee rigging and the three royals and mizzen topgallantsail stowed we went thrashing away to the westward against a heavy headsea that kept our decks streaming as far aft as the mainmast instead of bowling away across the bay under studdingsails as we had hoped then we fell in with light weather for nearly a week that enabled all hands in the cuddy to find their sea legs and a good hearty appetite once more the ship slowly traversing her way to the southward meanwhile and finally we got a westerly wind that beginning gently enough to permit of our showing skysails to it ended in a regular north atlantic gale that compelled us to heaveto for fortytwo hours before it blew itself out the gale was at its height blowing with almost hurricane fury with a terrific sea running about twenty hours after its development and we in the cuddy were with about half a dozen exceptions seated at breakfast when above the howling of the wind i faintly caught the notes of a hail that seemed to proceed from somewhere aloft where away sharply responded the voice of the chief mate from the poop overhead i heard the reply given but the noises of the ship the shriek of the gale through the rigging and the resounding shock of a sea that smote us upon the weather bow at the moment prevented my catching the words i had no difficulty however in gathering from mr murgatroyds inquiry that something had drifted within our sphere of vision probably another vessel hoveto like ourselves a minute or two later however mr fletcher the third mate presented himself at the cuddy door and said addressing himself to the skipper mr murgatroyds respects sir and theres a partially dismasted barque that appears to be in a sinking condition and with a signal of distress flying about eight miles away broad on the lee bow and mr murgatroyd would be glad to know sir if its your wish that we should edge down towards her yes certainly answered captain dacre request mr murgatroyd to do what is necessary and say that i will be on deck myself shortly the intelligence that a real genuine wreck was in sight with the probability that her crew were in a situation of extreme peril sent quite a thrill of excitement pulsating through the cuddy with the result that breakfast was more or less hurriedly despatched and within a few minutes the skipper miss onslow and myself were all that remained seated at the table the rest having hurried on deck to catch the earliest possible glimpse of so novel a sight as mr murgatroyds message promised them as for dacre and myself we were far too thoroughly seasoned hands to hurrythe ship was hastening to the assistance of the stranger and nothing more could be done for the present and it was perfectly evident that miss onslow had no intention of descending to so undignified an act as that of joining in the general rush on deck but that she was not unsympathetic was evidenced by the earnestness with which she turned to the skipper and inquired do you think captain that there are any people on that wreck any people reiterated the skipper why yes my dear young lady im very much afraid that there are you are afraid returned miss onslow why do you use that word if there are any people there you will rescue them will you not of courseif we can answered the skipper but that is just the point can we rescue them mr murgatroyds message stated that the wreck appears to be in a sinking condition now if that surmise of the mates turns out to be correct the question is will she remain afloat until the gale moderates and the sea goes down sufficiently to admit of boats being lowered if not it may turn out to be a very bad job for the poor souls eh mr conyers it may indeed i answered for it is certain that no boat of ours could live for five minutes in the sea that is now running and if that barometerpointing to a very fine instrument that hung facing us in the skylightis to be believed the gale is not going to break just yet oh dear but that is dreadful the girl exclaimed clasping her hands tightly together in her agitationand one could see by the whitening of her lips and the horror expressed in her widelyopened eyes that her emotion was not simulated it was thoroughly real and genuine i never thought of that do i understand you to mean then captain that even when we reach the wreck it may be impossible to help those on board yes answered dacre you may understand that miss onslow of course we shall stand by them until the gale breaks and if when we get alongside we find that their condition is very critical some special effort to rescue them will have to be made but while doing all that may be possible i must take care not to unduly risk my own ship and the lives which have been intrusted to my charge and keeping that point in view it may prove impossible to do anything to help them and you think there is no hope that the gale will soon abate she demanded i see no prospect of it as yet answered the skipper the barometer is the surest guide a sailor has in respect of the weather and as mr conyers just now remarked ours affords not a particle of hope oh how cruelhow relentlessly cruelthe wind and the sea are exclaimed this girl whose pride i had hitherto deemed superior to any other emotion i hopeoh captain i most fervently hope that you will be able to save those poor creatures who must now be suffering all the protracted horrors of a lingering death you may trust me my dear young lady answered the skipper heartily whatever it may prove possible to do i will do for them if they are to be drowned it shall be through no lack of effort on my part to save them and now if you will excuse me i will leave mr conyers to entertain you while i go on deck and see how things look the girl instantly froze again i will not inflict myself upon mr conyerswho is doubtless dying for his afterbreakfast smoke she answered with a complete return of all her former hauteur of manner i have finished breakfast and shall join lady obrien on deck and therewith she rose from her seat and despite the wild movements of the ship made her way with perfect steadiness and an assured footing toward the ladder or stairs that led downward to the sleepingrooms on her way to her cabin a queer girl by george exclaimed dacre as she disappeared she seems quite determined to keep everybody at a properly respectful distanceespecially you have you offended her certainly notso far as i am aware i answered it is pride skipper nothing but pride she simply deems herself of far too fine a clay to associate with ordinary human pots and pans well she may be as distant as she pleases so far as i am concerned for thank god i am not in love with her despite her surpassing beauty and forthwith i seized my cap and followed the captain up the companion ladder to the poop upon my arrival on deck i found that we were under way once more mr murgatroyd having set the foretopmast staysail and swung the head yards and now with the mate in the weather mizen rigging to con the ship through the terrific sea that was running we were jilling along down toward the wreck which from the height of the poop now showed on the horizon line whenever we both happened to top a surge at the same moment the entire cuddy party were by this time assembled on the poop and every eye was intently fixed upon the small misty image that at irregular intervals reared itself sharply upon the jagged and undulating line of the horizon and i believe that every telescope and operaglass in the ship was brought to bear upon it after studying her carefully through my own powerful instrument for about ten minutes i made her out to be a small barque of about five hundred tons register with her foremast gone at a height of about twenty feet from the deck her maintopmast gone just above the level of the lowermasthead and her mizenmast intact i noticed that she appeared to be floating very deep in the water and that most of the seas that met her seemed to be sweeping her fore and aft and i believed i could detect the presence of a small group of people huddled up together abaft the skylight upon her short poop an ensign of some sort was stopped halfway up the mizen rigging as a signal of distress and after a while i made it out to be the tricolour johnny crapauda frenchman i exclaimed to the skipper who was standing near me working away at her with the ships telescope a frenchman eh responded the skipper can you make out the colours of that ensign from here if so that must be an uncommonly good glass of yours mr conyers take it and test it for yourself i answered handing him the instrument he took it and applied it to his eye the other end of the tube swaying wildly to the rolling and plunging of the ship ay he said presently handing the glass back to me french she is and no mistake now that is rather a nuisance for i am ashamed to say that i dont know french nearly well enough to communicate with her how the dickens are we to understand one another when it comes to making arrangements well if you can find no better way i shall be very pleased to act as interpreter for you i said my knowledge of the french language is quite sufficient for that thank you mr conyers i am infinitely obliged to you i will thankfully avail myself of all the assistance you can give me answered the skipper the sea being rather in our favour than otherwise we drove down toward the wreck at a fairly rapid pace despite the extremely short sail that we were under and as we approached her the first thing we made out with any distinctness was that the barque was lying head to wind evidently held in that position by the wreck of the foremast which with all attached was under the bows still connected with the hull by the standing and running rigging this was so far satisfactory in that it acted as a sort of floating anchor to which the unfortunate craft rode and which prevented her falling off into the trough of the sea it would also probably to some extent facilitate any efforts that we might be able to make to get alongside her to take her people off to get alongside ay but how was it to be done in that wild sea the aspect of the ocean had been aweinspiring enough before this forlorn and dying barque had drifted within our ken but now that she was there to serve as a scale by which to measure the height of the surges and to bring home to us a realising sense of their tremendous and irresistible power by showing how fearfully and savagely they flung and battered about the poor maimed fabric it became absolutely terrifying as was to be seen by the blanched faces and quailing cowering figures of the crowd on the poop who stood watching the craft in her death throes hitherto the violence of the sea had been productive in them of nothing worse than a condition of more or less discomfort but now that they had before their eyes an exemplification of what old ocean could do with man and mans handiwork if it once succeeded in getting the upper hand they were badly frightened frightened for themselves and still more frightened for the poor wretches yonder who had been conquered in their battle with the elements and were now being done to death by their triumphant foe and it was no reproach to them that they were so for the sight upon which they were gazing and which was now momentarily growing plainer to the view was well calculated to excite a feeling of awe and terror in the heart of the bravest there having in mind the fact that we were looking upon a drama that might at any moment become a tragedy involving the destruction of nearly or quite a dozen fellow beings even i seasoned hand as i was found myself moved to a feeling of horrible anxiety as i watched the wreck through my telescope for the feeling was growing upon me that we were going to be too late and that we were doomed to see that little crouching huddling knot of humanity perish miserably without the power to help them we were by this time about a mile distant from the wreck and another seven or eight minutes would carry us alongside but what might not happen in those few minutes why the barque might founder at any moment and carry all hands down with her for we could by this time see that the hull was submerged to the channels and so deadly languid and sluggish were her movements that almost every sea made a clean sweep over her fore and aft rendering her main deck untenable and her poop but a meagre and precarious place of refuge and even if she continued to float until we reached her and for some time afterward how were her unfortunate people to be transferred from her deck to our own one had only to note the wild rush of the surges their height and the fierceness with which they broke as they swept down upon our own ship and the headlong reeling and plunging of her as she met their assault to realise the absolute impossibility of lowering a boat from her without involving the frail craft and her crew in instant destruction and how otherwise were those poor halfdrowned wretches to be got at and saved something might perhaps be done by means of a hawser if its end could by any means be put on board the sinking craft but here again the difficulties were such as to render the plan to all appearance impracticable yet it seemed to offer the only imaginable solution of the problem for presently as we continued to roll and stagger down toward the doomed barque captain dacre turned to me and said there is only one way to do this job mr conyers and that is for the frenchmen to float the end of a heavingline down to us by which we may be able to send them a hawser with a bosuns chair and hauling lines attached if it is not troubling you too much perhaps you will kindly hail them and explain my intentions presently i shall shave athwart her stern as closely as i dare with my maintopsail aback so that you may have plenty of time to tell them what our plans are and what we want them to do very well said i i will undertake the hailing part of the business with pleasure have you a speakingtrumpet of course answered the skipper here boyto one of the apprentices who happened to be standing nearjump below and fetch the speakingtrumpet for mr conyers you will find it slung from one of the deck beams in my cabin dacre then took charge of the ship in person conning her from the weather mizen rigging and sending murgatroyd forard with instructions to clear away the towinghawser and to fit it with a traveller bosuns chair and haulinglines blocks etcetera all ready for sending the end aboard the barque when communication should have been established with her and at the same time the boy having brought the speakingtrumpet on deck and handed it to me i stationed myself in the mizen rigging alongside the skipper for convenience of communication between him and myself chapter three we rescue the crew of a french barque we were now drawing close down upon the barque steering a course that if persisted in would have resulted in our striking her fair amidships on her starboard broadside but which by attention to the helm at the proper moment with a due allowance for our own heavy lee drift was intended to take us close enough to the sinking craft to enable us to speak her presently at a word from the skipper the third matewho was acting as the captains aidesang out for some men to lay aft and back the maintopsail and at the same moment the helm was eased gently up with the result that our bows fell off just sufficiently to clear the barques starboard quarter i shall never forget the sight that the unfortunate craft presented at that moment her foremast and jibboom were under the bows with all attached and were hanging a tangled mass of raffle by the shrouds and stays leaving about twenty feet of naked jagged and splintered stump of the lowermast standing above the deck and her maintopmast was also gone but the wreckage of this had been cut away and had gone adrift leaving only the heel in the cap and the ragged ends of the topmast shrouds streaming from the rim of the top she had been a very smartlooking little vessel in her time painted black with false ports and under her bowsprit she sported a handsomelycarved halflength figure of a crowned woman elaborately painted and gilded she carried a short topgallant forecastle forward and a full poop aft reaching to within about twentyfive feet from the mainmast and between these two structures the bulwarks had been completely swept away leaving only a jagged stump of a stanchion here and there protruding above the coveringboard she was sunk so low in the water that her channels were buried and the water that was in her making its way slowly and with difficulty through the interstices of her cargo had at this time collected forward and was pinning her head down to such an extent that her bows were unable to lift to the scend of the sea with the result that every sea broke hissing white over her topgallant forecastle and swept right aft to the poop against the front of which it dashed itself as against the vertical face of a rock throwing blinding and drenching clouds of spray over the little group of cowering people who crouched as closely as they could huddle behind the meagre and inadequate shelter of the skylight i counted fourteen of these poor souls and in the midst of them occupying the most sheltered spot on the whole deck i noticed what at first looked like a bundle of tarpaulin but as we swept up on the barques starboard quarter i saw one of the men gently pull a corner of the tarpaulin aside with one hand while he pointed at the city of cawnpore with the other and to my amazement the head and face of a womana young womanlooked out at us with an expression of mingled hope and despair that was dreadful to see good god theres a woman among them exclaimed dacre we must save herwe must save them all if we can but it looks as if we shall not be given much time to do it in i suppose they want to be taken off theyll never be mad enough to wish to stick to that wreck eh hail them mr conyers you know what to say barque ahoy i hailed in french as with maintopsail aback we surged and wallowed slowly athwart the stern of the stranger do you wish to be taken off at the first sound of my voice the man who had pointed us out to the woman rose stiffly to his feet and staggered aft to the taffrail with his hand to his ear but yes he shouted back in the same language our ship is sinking and all right i interruptedfor time was preciouswe will endeavour to get the end of a hawser aboard you have you any light heavingline that you can veer down to us by means of a float if so get it ready and we will try to pick it up on our return we are now about to stand on and take room to wear when we will come back and endeavour to establish a connection between the two craft have the line ready and veered well away to leeward at once but monsieur replied the man wringing his hands we have no lineno anythingyou see all that we haveindicating the bare poop with a frantic gesture you have a lot of small stuff among the gear upon your mizenmast i retorted but although i pointed to the mast in question and the man glanced aloft as i did so i very much doubted whether he comprehended my meaning for our lee drift was so rapid that we were by this time almost beyond hailing distance fill the maintopsail shouted the skipper what have you arranged he demanded turning to me i told him he stamped on the rail with impatience it is clear that it will not do to trust overmuch to them for help we shall have to do everything ourselves mr murgatroyd he shouted the mate came aft is that hawser nearly ready demanded the skipper all but sir answered the mate another five minutes will do it then said the skipper your next job sir will be to muster all the light line you can lay your hands upon and range it along the larboard railwhich will be our weather rail presently when we have got the ship roundand station half a dozen men or more all along the weather rail each with a coil and let them stand by to heave as we cross the barques stern my object is to get a line aboard her as quickly as possible by means of which we may send the hawser to them for they appear to be a pretty helpless lot aboard there and if they are to be saved there is very little time to lose ay ay sir responded murgatroyd and away he went to perform this additional duty captain dacre now showed the stuff of which he was made handling his ship with the most consummate skill and judgment wearing her round upon the port tack the moment that he could do so with the certainty of again fetching the barque and ranging up under her stern as closely as he dared approach eight of the strongest and most skilful seamen in the ship were ranged along the weather rail and as we drew up on the barques starboard quarterwith our maintopsail once more thrown abackman after man hurled his coil of light pliant line with all his strength in the endeavour to get the end of it aboard the barque but such was the strength of the gale that line after line fell short checked as effectually in its career as though it had been dashed against a solid walland although after his first failure each man hauled in his line and recoiling it with the utmost rapidity attempted another cast all were unsuccessful and we had the mortification of feeling that at least twenty minutes of priceless time had been expended to no purpose and what made it all the worse was that during that twenty minutes absolutely nothing had been done by the frenchmen toward the preparation of a line to veer down to us within three minutes of the moment when the first line had been hove we were once more out of hailing distance and the main yards were again being swung we will have another try said the skipper but if we fail again it will be all up with themif indeed it is not already too late that barque cannot possibly live another halfhour there seemed to be no room to regard this otherwise than as a plain literal statement of an incontrovertible fact we were all agreed that the unfortunate craft had settled perceptibly in the water since we had first sighted her and at the same rate another halfhour would suffice to annihilate the very small margin of buoyancy that appeared to be still remaining to her even if she escaped being earlier sunk out of hand by some more than usually heavy sea but this seemed to have been temporarily lost sight of by the little crowd of onlookers that clustered closely round us on the poop in the absorbing interest attendant upon our endeavours to get a line on board the barque and was only recalled to themand that too in a very abrupt and startling mannerby the significance of the skippers last remark the imminence and deadly nature of the frenchmens peril was brought home to them anew and now they seemed to realise for the first time the possibility that they might be called upon to witness at close quarters the appalling spectacle not only of a foundering ship but also of the drowning of all her people instantly quite a little hubbub arose among the excited passengers general obrien and some half a dozen other men among them pressing about poor dacre with suggestions and proposals of the most impossible character and in the midst of it all i heard miss onslows clear rich voice exclaiming bitterly cruel cruel to think that we are so near and yet it seems impossible to bridge the few remaining yards of space that intervene between those poor creatures and the safety that we enjoy surely it can be done if only anyone were clever enough to think of the way now ladies and gentlemen remonstrated the skipper please dont consider me rude if i say that none of you know what you are talking about there are only two ways of getting a line aboard that wreck one way is to carry it and the other to heave it the former is impossible with the sea that is now running and the latter we have already tried once unsuccessfully and are now about to try again if any of you can think of any other practicable way i shall be glad to listen to you but if not please leave me alone and let me give my whole mind to the job meanwhile i had been watching the run of the sea at first idly and with no other feeling than that of wonder that any vessel in the waterlogged condition of the barque could continue to live in it for it was as high and as steep a sea as i had ever beheld and it broke incessantly over the barque with a fury that rendered her continued existence above water a constantlyrecurring marvel heavy as it was however it was not so bad as the surf that everlastingly beat upon the sandy shores of the west coast and as i realised this fact i also remembered that upon more than one occasion it had been necessary for me to swim through that surf to save my life surely thought i the man who has fought his way through the triple line of a west african surf ought to be able to swim twenty or thirty fathoms in this sea the idea seemed to come to me as an inspiration and undeterred by the thought that the individual who should essay the feat of swimming from the one ship to the other would be seriously hampered by being compelled to drag a lengthening trail of light rope behind him i turned to the skipper and said captain dacre there appears to be but one sure way of getting a line aboard that wreck and that is for someone to swim with itstop a momenti know that you are about to pronounce the feat impossible but i believe i can do it and at all events i am perfectly willing to make the attempt give me something lightsuch as a pair of signal halliardsto drag after me and let a good hand have the paying of it out so that i may neither be checked by having it paid out too slowly nor hampered on the other hand by having to drag a heavy bight after me and i think i shall be able to manage it and if i succeed bend the end of a heavingline on to the other directly you see that i have got hold and we will soon get the hawser aboard and the end made fast somewhere the skipper looked at me fixedly for several seconds as though mentally measuring my ability to execute the task i had offered to undertake then he answered upon my word mr conyers i scarcely know what to say to your extraordinarily plucky proposal if you had been a landsman i should not have entertained the idea for a moment and even as it is i am by no means sure that i should be justified in permitting you to make the attempt but you are a sailor of considerable experience you fully understand all the difficulty and the danger of the service you have offered to undertake and i suppose you have some hope of being successful or you would not have volunteered and upon my word i am beginning to think with you that the course you suggest is the only one likely to be of any service to those poor souls yonderso i supposei must sayyes and god be with you the little crowd round about us who had been listening with breathless interest cheered and clapped their hands at this pronouncement of the skippersthe cheer being taken up by the crowd of miners gathered in the waistand general obrien who was standing at my elbow seized my hand and shook it enthusiastically as he exclaimed god bless you conyers god bless you my boy every man and woman among us will pray for your safety and success thanks general answered i the knowledge that i have the sympathy and good wishes of you all will add strength to my arm and courage to my heart but the issue is in gods hands and if it be his will i shall succeed then turning to the skipper i said i propose that you shall take the ship up as close as possible to the wreck precisely as you did at first and i will dive from the flyingjibboomendwhich will approach the wreck more closely than our hull and it will be for you to watch and so manoeuvre the shipeither by easing up the foretopmast staysail sheet or in any other way that you may think bestthat she shall be kept fair abreast of and dead to leeward of the wreck until we can get the end of the hawser aboard and made fast after that i think we may trust to the difference in the rate of the drift of the two craft to keep the hawser taut yes yes answered the skipper you may trust to me to do my part mr conyers if you can only manage to get the end of the hawser aboard and fast to the wreck i will attend to the other part of the job and now you had better go and get ready for your swim for i am about to wear ship i hurried away to my cabin and shifted into ordinary bathing attire and while thus engaged i became aware that dacre was wearing ship and getting her round upon the starboard tack once more by the time that my preparations were completed and i had made my way out on the main deck the ship was round and heading up for the wreck again as i appeared threading my way forward among the great burly miners who were clustering thick in the waist they raised a cheer and the cuddy party again clapped their hands some of them shouting an encouraging word or two after me on the forecastle i encountered murgatroyd the chief mate who held a coil of small thin line in his hand here you are mr conyers he exclaimed as i joined him this coil is the main signal halliards which i have unrove for the purposethey are better than new for they have been stretched and have had the kinks taken out of them and if they are not enough here are the fore halliards all ready for bending on at a seconds notice i shall pay out for you so you may depend upon having the line properly tended now how will you have the end will you have it round your waist or no said i give it me as a standing bowline which i can pass over my shoulder and under my arm so that will do is the hawser fitted and all ready for paying out yes answered the mate everything is quite ready ive left about five fathoms of bare end for bending on and i think you cant do much better than take a turn with it round the mizenmast under the spiderband that is exactly what i thought of doing said i in fact it is about the only suitable place i stood talking with murgatroyd until we were once more almost within hail of the barque when with the bowline at the end of the line over my left shoulder and under my right arm i laid out to the flyingjibboomend upon which i took my stand steadying myself by grasping the royal stay in my left hand the motion away out there at the far extremity of that long spar was tremendous so much so indeed that seasoned as i was to the wild and erratic movements of a ship in heavy weather the sinkings and soarings and flourishings of that boomend as the vessel plunged and staggered down toward the wreck made me feel distinctly giddy the wait was not a very long one however and in less than five minutes i found myself abreast the barques starboard quarter and within a hundred feet of it i was now as close to the wreck as captain dacre dared put me so as the ship met a heavy sea and flung me high aloft above the white water that seethed and swirled about the stern of the sinking craft i let go my hold upon the stay and poising myself for an instant upon the uphove extremity of the boom raised my hands above my head as i bent my body toward the water and took off for a deep dive my conviction being that i should do far better by swimming under water than on the surface as i rushed downward i heard dacre shout there he goes god be with him and then i struck the water head downward almost perpendicularly and the only sound i heard was the hissing of the water in my ears as the bluegreen light about me grew gradually more and more dim with my body slightly curved and my back a trifle hollowed i knew that even while plunging downward i was also rushing toward the barque and presently i struck out strongly arms and legs as i caught sight through the water of a huge dark body at no great distance that i knew to be the swaying hull for which i was making at length gasping for breath i rose to the surface and found that i was within twenty feet of the barques stern with the whole of her crew upon their feet anxiously watching me while a man stood at her taffrail holding a coil of rope in his hand the instant he saw me he shouted look out monsieur i am about to heave all right heave i shouted in return gasping in the midst of the wild popple that leaped about the labouring craft and the next instant a flake of the uncoiling end of the line hit me sharply across the face i seized it tightly and sang out haul me to the starboard mizen chains the man flung up his hand in reply and holding on to the rope started at a run along the deck dragging me after him it was a good job that i had thought of taking a turn round one arm or in his eagerness he would have dragged the rope out of my grasp as it was the strain he brought to bear added to that of the long length of line trailing behind me almost tore my arms out of their sockets moreover i was half suffocated by the deluge of water that came crashing down upon me like a cataract off the deck of the wreck every time that she rolled toward me luckily this condition of affairs was of but brief duration and presently i found myself in the wake of the mizen chains and in imminent danger of being struck and driven under by the overhanging channel piece i watched my opportunity however and as the barque rolled toward me i seized the lanyards of one of the shrouds got a footing somehow and dragged myself in over the rail i felt terribly exhausted by the brief but fierce buffeting i had received alongside but time was preciousthe city of cawnpore was still square athwart the stern of the wreck but driving away to leeward at a terrible rate and i knew that unless we were very smart we should still fail to get the hawser from herso i flung up one arm as a signal to murgatroyd to pay out and crying out to the frenchmen to come and help me began to haul upon the line i had brought aboard with me by dint of exhortation so earnest that it almost amounted to bullying i succeeded in awaking the frenchmen to a sense of the urgency of the case and persuaded them to put some liveliness into their movements by which means we quickly hauled in the whole of the signal halliards to the other end of which a light heavingline was bent this also we dragged away upon for dear life and presently i had the satisfaction of seeing the end of the city of cawnpores towinghawser being lighted out over her bows this was a heavy piece of cordage for us to handle but we dragged away at it breathlessly and at length when i had almost begun to despair of getting it aboard in time we hauled the end in over the taffrail and all hands of us seizing it led it to the mizenmast round the foot of which i had the satisfaction of passing a couple of turns and securing it so far so good the most difficult part of my task was now accomplished for i knew that murgatroyd would attend to the work at his end of the hawser and do everything that was necessary so i turned to the frenchman who had assisted me aboard and said are you the master of this barque monsieur at your service monsieur he answered bowing with all the grace of a dancingmaster very good said i you have a lady on board i think but yes monsieur my wife and he flourished his arm toward the bundle of tarpaulin that still remained huddled up under the shelter of the skylight she will of course have to go first i said are there any preparations she would wish to make before being transferred to the other vessel without replying to my question the man hurried away to the heap and unwrapping the tarpaulin extricated a young and rather pretty but terribly frightened woman from its folds as he did so i saw that she held a baby in her arms what exclaimed i as i joined the little group a baby also yes monsieur answered the man you see we wrapped them both up in a tarpaulin to protect them as much as possible from the cruel sea a very wise precaution i commented but this increases our difficulties somewhat i greatly doubt whether mother and child will be able to make the passage together madame will scarcely have the strength to hold herself and the baby safely at the same time the little one might be washed out of her arms and lost oh monsieur what shall i do wailed the poor terrified creature have we to cross by that rope i fear there is no other way i replied gently i can never do it i can never do it she ejaculated despairingly the sea will drag me and my little mimi off and we shall be drowned under the circumstances monsieur there seems to be only one thing for it said i you must go first carrying the child and as soon as you are safe i will follow with madame is that arrangement to your liking the man intimated that it was and forthwith we commenced the preparations necessary to secure for the poor little wailing mite of humanity a chance of surviving the fearful journey and a fearful journey it certainly was even for a strong man how much more so then for a weak terrified woman or a helpless child less than a year old the arrangement was this the city of cawnpores to winghawser was now stretched between the two vessels one end being made fast to the barques mizenmast while the other end led in over the city of cawnpores bows through a warping chock and was secured somewhere inboard probably to the windlass bittsit would have been much more convenient had the hawser been made fast to the foremast about fifteen or twenty feet from the deck but a very heavy intermittent strain was being thrown upon it and i imagined that dacre did not care to run the risk of springing so important a spar the effect of this was that the city of cawnpore with both topsails thrown flat aback was now actually riding by her hawser to the barque as to a sea anchor the deeplysubmerged hull of the french craft offering sufficient resistance to the drift of the city of cawnpore to keep the hawser taut except at the rather frequent intervals when the heave of the sea flung the barque far enough to leeward to temporarily slacken it and it was by means of this hawserat one moment taut as a bar and at the next sagging slack enough to dip into the waterthat the frenchmen were to be hauled from their ship to ours meanwhile the work of securing the hawser aboard the city of cawnpore and the clearing away of the travellinggear had been going briskly forward and at the moment when the frenchman and i came to an understanding i saw the slung bosuns chair hove over the citys bows and come sliding along the hawser toward us the french skipper saw it too and tenderly taking the child from the arms of his almost swooning wife he carefully wrapped it in his jacket which he removed for the purpose and then with my assistance securely lashed the bundle to his body the bosuns chair had by this time arrived at the barques taffrail and was awaiting its first freight so as there was no time to lose i hustled the poor fellow away from his wife assisted him into the chair saw that he had a good grip with both hands and waved for murgatroyd to haul away which he instantly did i next turned to the lady and begged her to once more shelter herself temporarily in the tarpaulin my object being to spare her the sight of the terrible passage of her husband and child over and through that narrow stretch of ravening sea but as it happened there was no need for my solicitude she cast one glance at the swaying dangling figure of her husband and then with a wild wailing shriek flung herself upon her knees with her hands clasped over her eyes and truly a terrible sight it was for a woman to contemplate especially with the knowledge that she would presently be obliged to herself undertake the dreadful journey the sea was running so high that close to each other as we were when the crest of a wave interposed between us and the city of cawnpore the latter was hidden halfway to the height of her tops and the headlong fury with which each wave came sweeping down upon us foamcapped and with arching crest was alone enough to strike terror to the stoutest heart that however was not the worst of it for although murgatroyd might safely be trusted to exercise the utmost judgment in the manipulation of the haulingline there were moments whenthe two craft being upon the opposite slopes of a huge surge with the hawser strained taut from one to the otherany luckless individual who might be so unfortunate as to be caught halfway between the two vessels would be momentarily buried some thirty feet deep in the heart of the rushing hill of water and about equally exposed to the two dangers of suffocation or of being swept off beyond the reach of rescue and drowned out of hand this double danger overtook the unfortunate french skipper and his baby but they got through all right the child escaping suffocation mainly in consequence of the careful and secure manner in which she had been enveloped in her fathers coat then came madames turn it was impossible to so effectually enwrap her as had been the case with the child but i did the best i could with a strip of the tarpaulin over her head and shoulders well secured round her body with a length of the maintopgallant brace and then lashing her firmly to my own body i took my place in the bosuns chair wrapping my arms tightly round my quaking companion and then taking a firm grip upon the lanyards of the chair the next instant i was whirled off the barques taffrail and found myself dangling close over the seething white water between the two vessels then while i was in the very act of shouting a few encouraging words through the tarpaulin to my companion i heard the roaring crash of a heavy sea as it struck and swept over the unfortunate barque from stem to stern and the next instant i felt the water envelop me and whirl and drag me hither and thither with a strength that it seemed impossible to resist then as suddenly i found myself in the air again with the great wavecrest rushing and roaring away from me toward the ship the topmastheads only of which were visible above the foaming ridge of water that had just swept past me in another second or two however the end of her flyingjibboom reared itself high above the seething wavecrest her sharp bows smothered in spray quickly followed and then the entire hull of the ship hung balanced for an instant upon the top of the wave ere her bows dipped revealing the full length of her deck crowded with people every one of them with their faces turned in my direction a few more jerks and swings every one of which seemed imbued with a devilish desire to unseat and hurl myself and my companion to destruction and we were hauled safely up on to the rail of the city of cawnporeto an accompaniment of triumphant cheers from the spectatorsand quickly released before i could recover breath to say a word the bosuns chair was swiftly sliding along the hawser on its way back to the barque and presently after some apparent delay and hesitation on the part of those aboard the doomed vessel it swung off her taffrail on its return journey with a man seated in it swiftly the chair traversed about a third of the distance between the two vessels and then it was overtaken by and deeply buried in the heart of an oncoming sea even as i had been for a few breathless seconds the chair and its occupant were lost to view then as the ship surmounted the wave the chair again appeared but it was empty its late occupant had vanished there was a cry of dismay as this became manifest and with one consent everybody craned over the rail and peered down into the leaping water in the hope of discovering the missing man while a few of the smarter hands on the forecastle sprang for ropesends which they quickly coiled and stood by to heave to him should he reappear but he never did and after watching for a full two minutes he was given up and the chair was again hauled aboard the barque a further delay now took place no one seeming to have the courage to undertake the short but terrible passage at length however a man stepped forward and placed himself in the chair and the journey began half the passage was accomplished ere he was overtaken when like the rest of us he was submerged for a few awful seconds and when next we saw him he was just in the very act of falling from the chair having apparently been dragged out of it by the fierce sweeping rush of the sea shouts of horror at this fresh disaster and of encouragement to the man at once arose in the midst of which i seized the end of a good long coil of line which a man was holding ready to throw and quickly tying a bowline therein threw the bight over my shoulder poised myself for a dive waiting with one foot on the topgallant rail to see just exactly what was happening before taking the leap the unfortunate man sank upon striking the water but presently the man beside me sang out there he is pointing at the same time down at the water about thirty feet from our bows and peering down i at length caught sight indistinctly of what looked like a human form twisting and writhing a few feet below the surface i instantly dived and the next moment found myself within arms reach of the man whom i seized by the hair and dragged to the surface when all that i had to do was to fling my arms about his body and hold on like grim death murgatroyd and his people at once undertaking the rather delicate task of getting us both safely inboard this was soon accomplished but meanwhile the bosuns chair hung stationary midway between the two vessels our people seeming doubtful of the utility of proceeding further but there was no time to lose if the remaining frenchmen were to be rescuedfor it was perfectly evident to everybody that the barque could not possibly float much longerso shrewdly guessing at the source of the inaction i requested murgatroyd to haul the chair aboard and this being done i seated myself in it and requested them to haul me across to the barque twice was i caught by the sea during this journey and each time it seemed that i emerged at the precise moment when it would have been impossible to resist the drag for even another second but i reached the barque safely and at once scrambling out of the chair proceeded to despatch the frenchmen in rotation the task proving less difficult than i had expected my voluntary journey to them seeming to have inspired them with fresh courage at length by dint of lashing the weaker men into the chair and earnestly cautioning the strong ones to hold on with all their might i succeeded in securing the passage of the entire remainder of the frenchmen to the city of cawnpore and then came the task of effecting my own retreat of course this could have been accomplished by means of the hawser and the bosuns chair but this would have involved the loss of the hawser and all the haulinggear attachedwhich it would have been necessary to cut away i thought it a pity to inflict this loss upon the ship merely to save myself the discomfort of being hauled through the water from one ship to the other so as soon as the last frenchman was safely aboard the city of cawnpore i proceeded to cut and cast adrift the hawser from the barques mizenmast and a few minutes later the massive ropesend flew overboard quickly followed by the heavingline in the end of which i had knotted a bowline for my own accommodation i had just thrown this bowline over my shoulder and was watching the coils of the line go leaping overboard one after the other as the rescuing ship went drifting rapidly to leeward when a perfect mountain of a sea came roaring down upon the wreck sweeping unbroken in over her bows and right aft until it reached the front of the poop against which it broke with terrific violence smashing in the entire front of the structure as i judged by the tremendous crashing of timber that instantly followed checked for the fraction of an instant by its impact with the poop the sea piled itself up in a sort of wall and then came surging and foaming along the deck toward me i saw that it would inevitably sweep me off my feet so to avoid being dashed against the poop rail i unhesitatingly leapt overboard and while still under water felt the weight of the sea falling upon me that i had jumped overboard to avoid the pressure was as that of a mountain and it drove me downward until the light dwindled to a sombre green twilight while the whirling water seemed to clasp me about as with a thousand arms flinging and dragging me hither and thither but ever downward until i could hold my breath no longer when with a great irresistible gasp my lungs filled with water darkness and silence profound and impenetrable shut me in a thousand quaint fantastic fancies thronged my brain andi knew no more chapter four the catastrophe my next sensation was that of painburning stabbing racking pain of so excruciating a character that i incontinently groaned aloud then as though in response to my groan i heardvaguely and without any immediate comprehension of the meaning of the wordsa voice say there i think that will do general he is in pain now thank god which means that he is coming roundand there is every reason to hope that he will pull through thanks for your valuable assistance i can manage singlehanded now you might make it known that mr conyers shows signs of returning consciousness and that i have every hope of saving him i fancy the intelligence will be not altogether unwelcome to at least one of the cuddy party by gad yes i think i know who you mean ill make a point of telling the news in her hearing was the reply are you sure there is nothing else that i can do doctor nothing more thank youexcept perhaps that you might suggest the value of quietness of movement on the part of anyone coming below no slamming of cabindoors or anything of that sort you know answered the first voice which i now recognised as that of the ships doctor on board the city of cawnpore all right ill see to it replied the other voice now quite familiar to me as that of general obrien a gentle click of the cabindoor latch succeeded and i opened my eyes languidly to see scudamores sharpcut features bending close to mine with an earnest intent look in his kindly eyes well he exclaimed heartily as our eyes met how do you feel now in horrible pain i answered with another involuntary groan what is the matter with me doctor what has happened only that you have been drowned and that you have kept the general and myself busy for two mortal hours and more practising artificial respiration before you would consent to come back to life that is all then i remembered everything and began to wonder by what means i had been recovered from those profound depths wherein my last conscious moments had been spent i put the question to scudamore and he answered oh as to that we had no difficulty there was a light heavingline attached by one end to the hawser and in the other end you had knotted a bowline which you passed over your shoulders and under your armpits we simply hauled you aboard by means of that and how long did the barque live after i left her i asked how long repeated the doctor in surprise why not ten seconds she was in the very act of foundering stern first when you jumped and it was undoubtedly her suction that did the mischief you must have been dragged fathoms deep by her and but for the line round you you would probably never have come to the surface again and what of the french people are they all right i demanded yes thanks to you they are answered scudamore the man you jumped overboard after was the worst case but luckily i had succeeded in resuscitating him before you were hauled aboard you have saved fifteen human lives today that is something to be proud of is it not and now no more talking at present what you require is sleep and if you do not mind being left alone a minute or two i will go to my cabin and mix you a draught that will give you a good long nap from which i have no doubt you will awake feeling as well as ever so saying the medico softly withdrew quietly closing the cabindoor behind him only to return a few minutes later with a draught of decidedly pungent taste which at his command i tossed off instanter whether it was due to the potency of the draught or to exhaustion or to both combined i know not but certain it is that as i sank back upon the pillow my eyes closed and almost instantly i went drifting off into the land of dreams when i next awoke it was well on toward evening for the light had grown so dim that i could only indistinctly discern the various objects about the cabin but there seemed to have been no abatement of the gale for the ship was rolling and plunging as wildly as ever the scuttle was frequently being dimmed by the dash of seas against the ships side and the screaming of the gale through the rigging still rose high above every other sound my body seemed to be bruised and aching all over but with this exception i felt little or none the worse for my mornings adventure i was very comfortable but distinctly hungry and i was lazily endeavouring to make up my mind whether i would go to the trouble of dressing and hunting up a steward to find me something to eat or whether i would remain where i was until somebody came to me when the problem was solved by the opening of my cabindoor and the entrance of the doctor he advanced on tiptoe to the side of my bunk and bent close over me peering into my face to see whether i happened to be awake what is the time doctor i asked oh so you are awake eh he responded well how do you feel sore and aching from head to foot but otherwise all rightexcepting that i am uncommonly hungry i answered hungry eh said scudamore let me feel your pulse he laid his fingers upon my wrist for a few seconds and then said well there doesnt seem to be very much the matter with you now you have had a good long sound sleepi have been in and out from time to time just to see that you were going on all rightand a good dinner will not hurt you will you have it brought to you here or would you rather turn out and dress oh i will turn out of course i exclaimed very well then said the doctor i will send a steward to help you to dressyou will need a little assistance with the ship cutting these wild capersand if you do not dawdle too long over your toilet you will be just in good time for dinner there goes the first bell he added as the strident clamour suddenly pealed out from somewhere on the deck above he left me and presently my berthroom steward appeared with my shavingwater and i scrambledrather more feebly than i had expected out of my bunk the operation of dressing proved to be a considerably more lengthy one than i had anticipated for i found that i was decidedly shaky on my legs and i had to sit on the sofa and take a short rest at frequent intervals with the result that the second dinner bell rang before i was ready to leave my cabin i was not very late however arriving in the cuddy last it is true but in time to see my immediate predecessors just taking their seats as i crossed the threshold of the brilliantlylighted apartment leaning upon the arm of the steward the entire company rose to their feet every eye was turned upon me and suddenly general obrien shouted in great excitement three cheers for our gallant friend conyers hip hip hip hurrah the three cheers thus unexpectedly called for were enthusiastically giveneven the ladies joining into my great confusion and as i passed aft between the two tables everybody within reach must needs shake hands with me and say something complimentary until i felt so uncomfortable that i began to wish i had remained below i noticed that miss onslow was on her feet like the rest but she appeared to have risen rather to avoid any appearance of singularity than with the intention of paying me a compliment while the rest were almost boisterously enthusiastic she remained absolutely calm and devoid of the slightest sign of emotion except that her cheeks and lips were colourless a slight curl in her beautiful upper lip seemed to indicate a feeling of contempt for such an outburst of enthusiasm and she steadfastly kept her gaze turned away from me except for one brief fraction of a second as i drew near to take my place beside her then for the space of a lightningflash our glances met and if anything so inconceivable as a display of emotion on her part could be credited as within the range of possibility i would almost have sworn that i caught in her eyes the flash of tears but the little ovation over we all sat down and as she at once began talking to the skipper about the gun mounted as a trophy in front of government house calcutta i had not an opportunity to verify my suspicion as we seated ourselves i gave vent to a sigh of relief believing that my fellowtravellers having expressed their approval of my behaviour of the morningthe affair was now at an end but scarcely were we settled in our places when the french skippers wifea very charming little woman who with her husband had been received into the cuddy by dacre as his guests and who had apparently failed to recognise me upon my entrancelearning from her neighbour what all the hubbub was about must needs add to my confusion by rushing to me and throwing herself upon her knees as she poured forth her expressions of gratitude with a mingled fervour and grace that i found particularly discomposing then her husband followed suit thanking me with manly earnestness and heartiness for what i had done this further act of homage so publicly performed disconcerted me to such an extent that i hastened to dismiss the embarrassingly grateful pair by assuring them that they were making altogether too much of what i had done which was no more than any other man confident of his swimming powers would have unhesitatingly undertaken had i not happened to have seized the initiative that i was of course very glad it had fallen to me to be the means of saving their lives but that i most earnestly begged them to say no more about it when dinner was over general obrien joined me on deck as i was smoking my pipe and i seized the opportunity to thank him for the assistance he had rendered in the operation of securing my resuscitation and i added as i was recovering consciousness i heard the doctor make a remark to you to the effect that someonei gathered that a lady was being referred toseemed to be more than ordinarily concerned in the question of my recovery and i understood from your reply that you perfectly understood to whom scudamore alluded have you any objection to favouring me with the name of the individual oh so you heard that did you remarked the general well my dear boy it was not intended for you to hear i am quite certain scudamore would not have made the remark had he been aware that you were sufficiently recovered to hear and understand it as to my giving you the ladys namewell i do not think i should be justified in doing so the matter stands thus you see when scudamore spoke he and i were of opinion that we had accidentally discovered the entirely unsuspected existence of a more than ordinary interest in you on the part of a certain lady but since then i have come to the conclusion that we mistook overpowering excitement for a more tender feeling hence i do not consider that i ought to enlighten you at all if any tender feeling exists why it is the girls own secret for her to retain or not as she pleases and if she has such a feeling and is willing that you should know it depend upon it she will discover a method of enlightening you while if she has no such feeling it would be the height of bad taste on my part to suggest that possibly she has so please ask me no more about it theres a good fellow of course i at once and finally let the subject drop but somehow i could not help thinking about it and wondering which of my fellowpassengers was referred to and for the next day or two i watched to see whether any one of them exhibited more than ordinary cordiality to me but it was quite unavailing all were alike exceedingly cordial and friendlyexcept miss onslow who still maintained her former attitude of frigid reserveso as it was after all a matter that only very slightly interested me i soon forgot all about it from this time forward for a full month and more life was absolutely uneventful on board the city of cawnpore the gale blew itself out that same night and we got a breeze that carried us right into the northeast trades then we lost five days on the line parallels ere we caught the southeast trades and when they left us we were baffled for two days more before getting a wind that would permit us to make any easting we caught this fair wind early one morning in the second week of december and by noon it was blowing over the larboard quarter quite as strong as we wanted it with studdingsails abroad on both sides from the royals down and every other inch of canvas that would draw as the afternoon waned the breeze freshened but murgatroyd had by this time got preventer backstays rigged fore and aft with the avowed determination of carrying on and making the very utmost of so splendid a breeze and making the most of it he was with a vengeance for the ship was sweeping along like a mist wreath reeling off her seventeen knots by the log when the latter was hove at the end of the first dogwatch when i went on deck after dinner that night the sky had banked up to windward and astern of us and heavy masses of cloud were sweeping rapidly athwart the firmament permitting an occasional brief and hasty glimpse of the young moon and a few misty stars it was then blowing strong with every promise of a windy night before us and it seemed to me that with so dim and uncertain a light it was scarcely prudent to drive the ship at such headlong speed through the night indeed i ventured to suggest as much to dacre but he only laughed at me it is all very well for you navy men when you are cruising to shorten sail at sunset so that your people may be reasonably sure of an undisturbed night he said but with us of the red ensign it is different our owners expect us to pile up the profits for them and the only way in which we can do that is by making quick passages but of course while doing our best to accomplish this we exercise every possible precaution for instance you seem to think that i am rather reckless in driving my ship at this speed through the night but what have i to fear we have all the searoom we want there are no rocks or shoals in our road for us to fetch up on and if we should happen to fall in with any other vessels they will be going the same way as ourselves so we shall see them in ample time to avoid running over them and in addition to all this we maintain a firstrate lookout one on each bow two in the waist and the officer of the watch up here on the poop so we need have no fear of collision take my word for it mr conyers you are every bit as safe aboard here sir as if you were under the pennant after this of course there was nothing more to be said especially as i was well aware that in mentioning such a matter at all to the skipper i had committed an almost unpardonable breach of nautical etiquette notwithstanding the strong breeze the night was quite warm for we were not very far south of the tropic of capricorn and moreover it was close upon the midsummer of the southern hemisphere consequently when two bells of the first watch struck a good many of the passengers were on deck most of them listening to the miners who were congregated on the main deck singing as for me i was right aft on the wheel grating smoking and staring skyward at the racing cloud masses as they swept scurrying athwart the face of the moon suddenly a loud yell of dismay and warning arose from the topgallant forecastle the only words i caught being under our bows the next instant with a shock that shot me off the grating on to the poop the ship was brought up all standingnot stopped dead as though she had run into a cliff but rather as a horse stops when pulled up and thrown on his haunchesand then as i lay on my back half stunned by the shock of my fall and still gazing skyward i saw the three masts bow forward bending like fishingrods when with a dreadful rending crash the entire complicated mechanism of sails spars and rigging went by the board and lay fore and aft along the deck there was a moments pause of utter silence broken only by the hissing splash and rush of water alongside and the moaning of the wind over the sea and then arose the most terrific hubbub to which i had ever been doomed to listenshrieks groans and curses from those injured by the fall of or buried under the wreckage from aloft cries of were sinking were sinking god help us people calling each others names and the voices of captain dacre and mr murgatroyd shouting orders then all in a moment there arose among the miners a cry of the boats the boats lets launch the boats instantly followed by a rush of the whole crowd of them on to the poop where as many as could swarmed into the two quarter boats hanging at the davits these two boats would not hold much more than a quarter of their number and the moment that this was discovered there arose a sanguinary fight for the possession of the two frail craft those who were crowded out drawing their knives and attacking the other party then murgatroyd suddenly appeared on the poop with a brace of revolvers in his hands which he levelled at the fighting surging mob come out of those boats you cowardly blackguards come out i say and stand by to obey orders dye hear there what i say you there with the red head im talking to you come out of that boat or by god ill shoot you wont then take thathis pistol flashed as he spoke ill soon see who is master here the next instant the brave fellow was down on the deck stabbed in a dozen places from behind and the life kicked and trampled out of him by the fighting panicstricken crowd of miners who were now simply beside themselves with terror and practically as irresponsible as so many wild beasts at this juncture the skipper with some half a dozen seamen to support him arrived upon the scene from forwardwhere he had apparently rushed at the first alarm to investigate the condition of the ship and pressing his way into the heart of the howling struggling mob endeavoured to bring them to their senses by assuring them that there were boats enough for all but that their only chance of being saved lay in allowing the sailors access to the tackles so that the boats might be properly launched but before the poor fellow could get any further he too went down and disappeared amid shouts of our lives is as good as yours weve got the boats and we mean to keep em and so on and in the height of the confusion someone cut the bow tackle of the larboard quarter boat with the result that her bow suddenly dropped into the water while her stern still hung suspended from the davit and every man of the crowd who had scrambled into her was instantly precipitated into the water while this was going on upon the poop the entire crowd of cuddy passengers appeared to be huddled together about the companion utterly helpless and bewildered while a party of seamen were working desperately down on the main deck to get the four boats off the gallows i could not see that anyone was doing anything to clear away the long boat but that was probably because she had been destroyed by the fall of the mainmast which appeared to have crashed right down on the top of her as for me i did nothing for the simple reason that there was nothing to be done the ship was sinking fastso fast indeed that she would probably plunge head first to the bottom in less than five minutes whichtaking into consideration the state of absolute panic that prevailed and the inextricable raffle of wreckage that cumbered and filled the deckswould leave no time in which to construct even the rudest kind of raft no there seemed to be nothing for it but for all hands to go down with the ship thanks to the terrorstricken selfishness of the tweendecks passengers who were too ignorant to do anything useful themselves and too obstinate and distrustful to allow anyone else to do anything for myself i had made up my mind not to give in and die so long as i could do anything to help myself i was a good swimmer and when the ship went down i should look out for a piece of wreckage and cling to it until i was picked up by some passing ship or perished of hunger and thirst suddenly as i was standing close to the binnacle watching the frantic mob of fighting miners a woman emerged from the after companion close beside me she glanced round for a moment in terror at the conflict that was raging about the boats and then stepping quickly to my side laid her hand upon my armi could see the gleam and glitter of gems upon it in the dim starlightand said in a voice which i at once recognised as that of miss onslow oh mr conyers what does all this mean what has happened is the ship sinking for pitys sake tell me miss onslow said i summon all your courage to your aid i beg you for you will need it i have the worst possible news to tell you the ship is sinking fastshe will probably go down in another two or three minutes and i think it doubtful in the extreme whether any one of us will survive to tell the tale o god she gasped my fatheri am his only childand this will kill him well if it must be so gods will be done not a word about herself no outcry of natural fear at the near approach of the king of terrors it was of her father and the heartbreaking sorrow that he would feel at her loss that she thought at this dread moment as this idea presented itself to me a world of admiration for such marvellous courage and unselfishness leapt into being within me and turning to her i grasped the hand that still unconsciously rested upon my arm and said miss onslow i have no hope to offer you but if you are willing to trust yourself to me i will do my utmost to save you at the worst we shall be no worse off than we are now i will trust you she said simply i will do whatever you tell me there was no time to lose for i could tell by the feel of the ship that her course was all but run so taking my companion by the hand i led her right aft to the wheel grating which we both mounted and then i peered over the stern at the black water merciful heaven how near it was it looked as though one could lean over the rail and dabble ones hand in it but it was clear there was no wreckage or anything elseso far as i could seeto hurt us should we leap a lifebuoy was hanging over the taffrail suspended by a stout lanyard and this buoy i hurriedly cut adrift passing it over miss onslows shoulders and up under her armpits then having thus equipped her i assisted her to mount the rail and at once sprang up beside her taking her hand in mine as i did so now are you ready i asked quite she answered as steadily as though i had been about to assist her to step ashore instead of urging her to leap overboard in the middle of the south atlantic on a dark and windy night with scarcely a hope that she would survive to see the next morning then jump i said and at the word we both leapt together chapter five the city of cawnpores quarter boat the height of the poop rail from the surface of the water had by this time grown so insignificant by reason of the depth to which the hull of the ship had become immersed that upon striking the water i only descended about a foot below the surface ere rising again while my companion was so effectually supported by the lifebuoy that she remained quite dry above the shoulders the water was not at all cold indeed it was of quite a pleasant temperature so i anticipated no discomfort on that account either for my companion or myself nowthat we were actually overboard my first anxiety was to place as great a distance as possible between ourselves and the sinking ship so that we might perchance escape being dragged down by her when she should founder i therefore at once thrust my left arm through one of the beckets of the lifebuoy and struck out with all my strength away from the ship swimming athwart the sea so that it might not break in our faces and towing my companion after me i contrived to place a distance of about a hundred fathoms between us and the ship before she disappearedwhich was very considerably more than i had dared to hope for when we jumped overboardand although this did not carry us quite clear of the vortex created by the sinking ship it carried us so far away that we were only dragged back somewhat toward the centre without being taken under i swam for another ten minutes and then deeming that we were so far distant as to be free from all danger of injury by the rising of floating wreckage under us it seemed advisable to heaveto and husband my strength a little since i could not tell to what extent it might be taxed in the immediate future as to my companion she was put to no exertion whatever the lifebuoy supporting her perfectly and when i inquired as to her welfare she informed me that she felt quite as comfortable and as much at ease as could be reasonably expected under the circumstances i allowed a quarter of an houras nearly as i could guess itto elapse after the disappearance of the ship and then believing that whatever wreckage was likely to float up from her to the surface would already have done so i thought we might safely return to the scene of the catastrophe since it was upon the existence of a certain amount of floating wreckage that i built such slight hope as i entertained of our ultimate preservation i knew pretty exactly the bearings of the spot where the ship had gone downhaving taken them by the moonand thus guided i struck out over the way that we had recently travelled towing miss onslow after me and as i swam i could not help a feeling of surprise at the height of the sea which seemed mountainous now that we were down upon its surface although from the deck of the ship it had appeared nothing at all extraordinary i had been swimming some five minutes or so when as we floated up on the breast of a wave i saw in the dim moonlight what looked like a quantity of loose floating wreckage at no very great distance away but slightly to windward and toward this we made the best of our way ultimately arriving in the midst of a quantity of loose jagged and splintered planking tangled up with a raffle of spars sails and rigging it was rather dangerous stuff to venture among as some of the loose planks were lancing about in the wash of the sea with considerable violence and a blow from a jagged end would have inflicted a more or less serious injury even had it not killed us outright but at length i found a little clear space among the wreckage into which i towed my companion and presently we found ourselves close alongside one of the masts with the afterrim of the top riding dry and on to this i at once climbed hauling miss onslow after me and lashing her securely to the top by means of an end of rope cut from among the raffle here we were reasonably safe and comfortable for we were upon a raft of buoyant material that would probably float for months while there was so much of it that it effectually broke the sea and prevented it from washing over us it was a terrible situation for such a delicatelynurtured girl as she who had so unexpectedly been thrown under my protecting care but throughout the night she never uttered a single word that could be construed into complaint nor did she evince the slightest fear on the contrary she exhibited a calm and steadfast courage that filled me with admiration although the questions that she put to me from time to time rendered it perfectly clear that she very fully realised the desperate nature of our predicament some time during the nightit would probably be about midnightthe wind dropped to a light breeze and the sea began to go down until by daylight there was only a very gentle air blowing with very little sea but a long heavy swell the clouds all went drifting away out of sight leaving the sky clear and there was generally a very promising prospect that the coming day would be fine the moment that it was light enough to see i scrambled up on the wreckage and took a long look round in the hope of descrying a sail but the horizon was bare then as the light grew stronger i proceeded to minutely inspect the mass of wreckage that had afforded us shelter throughout the night with the view of ascertaining its capabilities as a refuge for a more or less lengthy perioduntil in fact we were either taken off by a passing ship or perished of starvation there seemed to be a great deal of itmuch more than i could satisfactorily account forbut as the dawn spread and brightened and objects grew increasingly distinct everything became intelligible even to the cause of the catastrophe that had so suddenly and terribly hurled us from a situation of safety and comfort into one of the direst peril and uncertainty for i found that while my companion and i were clinging to the wreckage of the illfated city of cawnpores mainmastthe whole of which had somehow come adrift from the hullwe were surrounded by and tangled up with a large quantity of planking and woodwork some of which we recognised as having belonged to our own ship while the remainder resolved itself into the shattered hull of a large timberladen wooden ship which had been cut nearly half through by the tremendous impact of our own vessel upon it when she struck it and so destroyed herself in the darkness of the preceding night a minute inspection of this wreck enabled me to clearly understand exactly what had happened the stranger had been dismastedfor her spars were still attached to her hulland had at the same time or subsequently become waterlogged to such an extent as to submerge her hull nearly to the level of the deck her crew had abandoned her and she had been left washing about a scarcely visible yet truly formidable deathtrap for our own good ship to blunder upon to her destruction the force of the blow had turned the stranger nearly bottom up so i could not even make a guess at her nationality and worse still it had robbed us of a possible chance of slightly bettering our condition by taking up our quarters aboard her in addition to the mass that my hapless companion and i had taken refuge upon there were a few small quantities of detached wreckage floating here and there within a radius of about a quarter of a mile and among these i by and by noticed something that looked so much like a capsized boat thatas there seemed to be no sharks abouti determined to swim out and examine it i mentioned my resolution to miss onslow who made no demur whatever to being left alone for a time merely remarking with a somewhat wan smile if it should by good fortune prove to be a boat please do not in your elation sail away forgetting that you have left me behind i assured her that she might absolutely depend upon my never forgetting that i had undertaken to save her and therewith plunged into the warm sea swimming a long steady stroke it did not take me very long to reach the object for which i was aiming and which proved as i had conjectured to be a ships boat swamped and floating keel up and not only so but when i got alongside her i was delighted to find that she was one of the city of cawnpores quarter boatsno doubt the one that the miners had cut partially adrift ere the ship went downthe especial significance and importance of this discovery arising from the fact that poor dacre had made a point of having every item of each boats equipment stowed within her and properly secured so that unless something very untoward had happened it was reasonable to hope that i should find this craft thus furnished and sure enough she appeared to be so when i at length managed to right her for as she rolled over i caught sight of the oars masts and sailsthe latter neatly encased in canvas coatsall securely lashed to the thwarts without waiting to further investigate i got hold of her by the stern and hanging on by one hand proceeded to scoop the water out of her with the other this was a long job considerably more than an hour being spent in removing the comparatively small quantity of water necessary to enable me to get into her but once in her i made much better progress using my two hands to throw the water out until having got rid of sufficient to enable me to move about without again filling the boati managed to find a baler when i made short work of baling her dry this done i took stock of my prize and found that i had come into possession of a twentyeightfoot gig in a perfectly sound and undamaged condition equipped with four sixteenfoot ash oars a mast and sails rowlocks bottomboards stretchers rudder and yoke baler boathook andpriceless treasure under the circumstancestwo breakers of fresh water securely lashed to the bottomboards to serve as ballast with such a prize as this what might not be possible with a thankful heart i cast adrift the oars shipped a pair andstanding up fisherman fashion with my face toward the bowpaddled the boat to the pile of wreckage whereon i had left miss onslow the sea had by this time gone down to such an extent that i had no difficulty in putting the boat alongside the wreckage taking the young lady on board and shoving clear again without damaging the boat in the least my clothes were by this time quite dry and those of my companion nearly so we were therefore comparatively speaking comfortable excepting that we were both sensible of the possession of a most healthy and hearty appetite which we had no means of satisfying a casual remark by miss onslow upon this unpleasant feature of our adventure set me thinking with the result that before leaving our mass of wreckage for good i secured the signal halliardsto serve as a fishinglinetogether with a fair supply of other small cordage the mainroyalwhich i cut away from the wreckage to serve as a sort of tent to shelter my companion from the dew at nighttimeand a small spike nail or two which with considerable labour i cut out of the planking of the derelict that had brought disaster upon us these last i secured with the rather hazy idea that it might be possible for me to file them down and convert them into fishhooks with the aid of a small file that formed one of the implements in my pocketknife thus provided i shipped the boats rudder and yoke stepped the mast set the sails and shoved off my intention being to shape a courseas nearly as i could hit it offfor cape town in the hope that ere long we might be fallen in with and picked up by some craft bound thither the boat however had scarcely begun to gather way when i espied at no very great distance what i took to be a floating hencoop and realising that if my conjecture happened to be correct the coop would probably be found to contain drowned poultry that in our desperate situation would serve for food i headed the boat for it my surmise again proved to be well founded the object turned out to be a coop and it contained seventeen dead fowls the whole of which i secured and in gaining possession of the poultry i found it necessary to break away two or three of the slats or bars that formed the front of the coop thus discovering that they were secured to the body of the coop by long thin wire nails out of which i soon satisfied myself that i could make very promising fishhooks by merely bending them into the requisite shape i secured about a dozen of these nails and then made sail with a fair wind upon an approximately due east course although the wind was light the boat slipped through the water at a very satisfactory pace and in half an hours time we had run the wreckage completely out of sight during the progress of the foregoing operations my companion had been very quiet looking on with an air of interest at everything i did and occasionally volunteering her assistance where she seemed to think she might possibly be able to make herself useful but otherwise saying little now however that we had once more settled down into a condition of comparative inactivity she began to question me as to our whereabouts what were my intentions and so on all of which questions i replied to as accurately as i could then after meditating for several minutes she said and what do you think are our chances of escape mr conyers do you consider that they are favourable enough to justify you in taking so very much trouble ah answered i if you had asked me that question last night when we jumped overboard together from the sinking ship i should probably have found some difficulty in answering you at once hopefully and truthfully for as a matter of fact i may now tell you that i really had no hope and that in acting as i did i was merely obeying that instinct that urges us all to fight for life so long as we have any fight left in us but now that we have come into possession of this fine and wellequipped boat i can honestly say that i consider our chance of ultimate escape is excellent of course everything depends upon the weather if a gale were to spring up the boat would probably be swamped or capsized by the heavy sea that would quickly risealthough even under such adverse conditions as those of a gale i should bring all my sailorly training and knowledge to bear on the task of preserving the boat as long as possible but if providence will only favour us with fine weather for say a week i have scarcely a shadow of doubt that within that time we shall be fallen in with and picked up by a craft of some sort for you must understand that we are right in the track of ships bound round the cape and those vessels are now so many in number that making a rough guess i should be inclined to say that an average of at least one vessel per day must pass within a few miles of this spot of course it may happen that several days will pass without a single craft of any kind coming along but to maintain the average it is equally likely that three or four may pass in the course of a dozen hours so you see our chance of being rescued is fairly good yes but she objected suppose it were unfortunately to happen that several dayssay seven or eightwere to elapse without our seeing a sail and that afterwards such ships as we might see were to pass us at such a long distance that although they would be perfectly visible to us we should be quite invisible to them what then in that case said i there would be but one course open to us we should simply be obliged to keep sailing on until a ship approached us near enough to see us taking every care of ourselves meanwhile and omitting no opportunity to procure such means of supporting life as the ocean has to offer us and that reminds me that neither food nor drink has passed our lips since dinner last night i know you are hungry because you said so some time ago and as for me i am famishing the food at our disposal is not particularly invitingsimply raw chicken and cold waterbut it is at least fresh and i think we ought to make the most of it while it is in that condition miss onslows appetite was not however as yet quite keen enough to admit of her partaking of raw fowl but she drank a little water out of the balerthe only utensil we possessed as she returned the baler to me she remarked you must not allow my squeamishness to be a bar to the satisfaction of your own appetite if you feel hungry enough to eat raw flesh i have been told that sailors are so often reduced to desperate straits that they eventually become reconciled to the idea of eating almost anything and are consequently as a rule much less fastidious than such pampered mortals as myself moreover you must not forget that it is of the last importance that your strength should be maintainedfor your own sake and for mine as wellif it is not too presumptuous of me to say such a thingtherefore please make a meal if you can and although i fully realise how absolutely dependent upon you i am i should like you to understand that i do not mean to be a mere helpless burden to you if it can be avoided i am perhaps not physically strong enough to be of much assistance to you but in all cases where skill rather than great bodily strength is required i hope you will unhesitatingly make use of me for instance you are hungry but you cannot make even such slight preparation of your food as is possible because you are steering the boat again you will soon need rest but you will be unable to take it unless i am able to steer the boat in your stead therefore please teach me forthwith how to manage the boat so that i may be able to relieve youas i think you sailors call itfrom time to time as may prove necessary and this was the girl who while on board ship had hedged herself in and kept us all at armslength by a barrier of such chill and haughty reserve as had at times approached very nearly to insolence of course i eagerly accepted her offerfor i foresaw that a time would very soon arrive when her assistance would be indispensableand at once proceeded to initiate her into the art of steering unfortunately we were running dead before the wind at the timewhich is the most difficult point of sailing for a novice to masteryet my new pupil seemed to grasp the idea at once and without an effort and a quarter of an hour later she was watching the run of the sea and checking the tendency of the boat to roundto almost as knowingly and cleverly as though she had been sailing a boat all her lifetime the moment that i found she could be trusted alone i took up a position on the midship thwart and selecting the bestlooking fowl from our stock proceeded to pluck and draw it afterwards giving it a good wash in the salt water alongside this done i cut off a leg and having skinned it sliced off a small piece of flesh which with many misgivings i placed in my mouth and began dubiously to masticate the idea of devouring raw flesh seemed to me to be exceedingly repulsive and disgusting but it was either that or nothing and realising the full truth of miss onslows remark upon the importance of maintaining my strength i persevered and presently when i had conquered in some measure the natural repugnance excited by the idea of such food i found that really after all it was very much a matter of sentiment and that so far as the flavour was concerned there was nothing at all objectionable the taste was of course novel and peculiar but i thought it possible that one might accustom oneself to it without much difficulty yet just at first a little sufficed and when i had despatched one leg i considered that i had made a particularly hearty meal and i felt so much the better for it that i strove to induce miss onslow to try a morsel she gently reiterated her refusal however while expressing her satisfaction that i had been able to eat then noticing that her eyes looked heavy and that her movements were languid i arranged the royal as a sort of couch in the sternsheets for her and suggested that she should lie down and endeavour to secure some rest to which suggestion she acceded and in a few minutes completely worn out with the unaccustomed excitement fatigue and exposure through which she had so recently passed she was sleeping by my side as placidly as an infant the sun was sinking into a bank of smokylooking cloud that stretched along the horizon on our starboard quarter when my companion awoke greatly refreshed by her slumbers butas she confessedravenously hungry i also was beginning to feel anew the pangs of hunger so surrendering the yokelines to miss onslow i took advantage of what remained of the fastwaning daylight to prepare a further portion of raw fowl to serve us both taking care to render the appearance of the flesh as little repulsive as possible by the time that my preparations which i had purposely somewhat protractedwere complete darkness had so far closed down upon us that it was scarcely possible to see what we were eating and thus aided and by dint of much persuasion accentuated by a reminder that we habitually ate oysters rawi succeeded in inducing the poor girl to so far lay aside her prejudices as just to taste the food i offered her that accomplished i had no further trouble with her for her hunger was by this time so sharp that food of any sort became palatable and we both succeeded in making a fairly good meal meanwhile the bank of cloud that at sunset had been hovering on the verge of the western horizon had been stealthily creeping zenithward and at the same time spreading out north and south with a look in it that seemed to portend more wind so as a measure of precaution i went to work upon the conclusion of our meal and shortened sail by taking down a couple of reefs in the mainsail and a single reef in the little stay foresail which the boat carried and this done i rearranged the royal in the sternsheets as a bed for my companion urging her to turn in at once and get as much rest as she could it was exceedingly fortunate that i had taken the precaution to reef the canvas of our small hooker for about an hour or so after sunsetvery shortly indeed after the completion of my preparationsthe wind freshened up with quite a touch of spite in it driving us along at a speed of fully eight knots and tugging at the mast as though intent on dragging it out of the boat altogether the sea moreover began to rise and break and by midnight i was in a bath of perspiration induced by anxiety and the effort to keep the boat ahead of and square endon to the combers this condition of excessive and painful anxiety by the way was quite a new as well as decidedly unpleasant experience for me and i was deeply mortified and annoyed at the discovery of its influence upon me i first took myself severely to task about it and then proceeded to seek for the cause of the trouble i was at first disposed to attribute it to nerveshock induced by the occurrences of the preceding twentyfour hours but a further analysis of my feelings convinced me that my nerves were still to be depended upon as implicitly as ever and that the real source of my distress lay at my feet asleep wrapped up in a sail yes there could be no doubt about it it was on my companions account that i was nervous and anxious i feared being capsized or swamped simply because of the greatlyincreased danger and discomfort that would in that case accrue to her at lengthprobably about two oclock in the morningit breezed up so fiercely and knocked up such a sea that i dared not run the boat any longer so watching my chance i put the helm down and hoveto on the larboard tack with the boats head to the northward and anxiously awaited the coming of daylight soon after this miss onslow awoke and seemed considerably alarmed at the change in the weather and the wild movements of the boat but i managed to reassure her and then observing that i had lashed the port yokeline and was no longer doing anything she suggested that we should change places and that i should get a little sleep after my assurances as to the utter absence of any danger i found it somewhat difficult to make her understandwithout alarming herthat it was still as urgently necessary as ever for me to watch the boat at length the dawn came filtering slowly through a murky and rather angrylooking sky and as the darkness gradually melted away from off the face of the weltering waters i made out the canvas of a large ship some eight miles off to leeward she had passed us about an hour earlier probably not more than three miles away and had there only been daylight i should doubtless have succeeded in attracting her attention as it was there was no hope of any such thing now she was sailing away from instead of toward us and sailors seldom look astern their attention is mostly directed to what lies ahead and even had it been otherwise it was too late now to think of making ourselves seen she was too far off and chasing her was quite out of the question for she was bowling along under topgallant studdingsails making the utmost of a fair wind while we dared show no more than doublereefed canvas fortunately miss onslow was sleeping again and did not see the stranger which had run out of sight beyond the horizon by the time that my companion next awoke so i did not mention the circumstance the appearance of this vessel however was cheering and encouraging inasmuch as it tended to show that i was still in the track of shipping as the day wore slowly on the wind steadily freshened until it was blowing a singlereefed topsail breeze that brought with it a corresponding increase in the height and run of the seas which at length became so dangerous that i dared no longer keep the boat under sail but was constrained to douse the canvas and use it with the mast and oars as a floating anchor for the boat riding to these at the full scope of our rather long painter we were much more easy and comfortable but this advantage was discounted to a great extent by the fact that during the day two other vessels passed usat too great a distance to allow of our attracting their attention low down in the water as we were and with no means of signalling to them yet not so far off but that we might have been seen had there been a pair of sharp eyes aboard while if it had been possible for us to carry sail we might have easily intercepted either of them it was a cruelly bitter disappointment to us to see these two craft go sliding along the horizon while i wore myself out with unavailing efforts to attract their attention my companion bore her disappointment bravely she even chid me gently when i sank down exhausted into the bottom of the boat with a bitter curse upon the blindness of the crew as the second of the two ships vanished beyond the rim of the horizon and she reminded me more than once of words i had spoken to her earlier in the day to the effect that although we might miss half a dozen ships through their passing us at too great a distance to allow of our being seen the seventh would be sure to come booming right down upon us and our only difficulty would be to avoid being run down by her but later on when the darkness had once more closed down upon us shutting out everything but the towering swooping phosphorescent crests of the threatening seas i caught her softly silently and secretly crying and the sight of her distress aroused a sudden furious anger in me that caused me to again and still more savagely execrate the blind lookout kept aboard the vessels that had that day passed us and then i began to wonder bitterly how many poor soulsweak helpless delicate women and children and faminestricken menhad perished miserably after drifting about the ocean for days that were veritable eternities of suffering yet might have been rescued had the officer of the watch aboard a passing ship but bestowed a trifle more interest and attention upon the small distant indistinctlyseen object that for an instant caught his gaze and which he all too hastily assumed to be the slanting pinion of some wandering sea bird or the leaping crest of a distant wave we rode thus all through the night and well on toward noon the next day when the weather moderated sufficiently to permit me to make sail once more but as the day wore on the wind gradually hauled round until it was dead on end for us and nightfall found us heading to the southward with the wind out at about eastsoutheast this state of things prevailed for the next four days during which no further vessels were sighted although it is possible that some may have passed us during the night at such a distance as to be invisible in the darkness during this time we were put to great straits for want of food and suffered all the tortures of slow starvation for the drowned poultry soon putrefied and became so offensive that we had to heave them overboard i tried to supply the deficiency by fishing but only succeeded in capturing one small shark about eighteen inches long which was fortunately hooked in the mouth in such a way that he could not cut through the line with his teeth during this time i watched and steered the boat all through the night miss onslow relieving me during the hours of daylight in order that i might secure a few hours of muchneeded rest but i was far too anxious as well as in too much suffering to sleep the utmost that i could achieve was to doze fitfully and for a few minutes at a time during which my imagination conjured up the most tormenting dreams from which i usually awoke with a violent start and a terrified cry then i would spring upon a thwart and search the horizon eagerly and feverishly for the sight of a sail following this up with a renewed attempt to catch a fish or two i shall never forget the courage and fortitude exhibited by miss onslow during this trying period she never uttered a single word of complaint or impatience although it was impossible for her to conceal the fact that she suffered acutely and whenever she found me unusually silent and as she thought giving way to dejection she always had ready a word or two of encouragement thus matters wearily and painfully progressed with us until six days and seven nights had dragged their slow length away and a full week had elapsed since the sinking of the city of cawnpore we were still working our way to the southward against an amount of wind and sea that were quite as much as the boat could look at and miss onslow was at my feet wrapped up in the sail and moaning in her troubled sleep the hour being about one oclock in the morning i was of course always on the lookout for a ship night and day but the time had now arrived when i began to see craft that had no existence save in my disordered imagination i was therefore neither surprised nor elated when i suddenly became aware of a vague indefinite shadow of deeper darkness faintly and doubtfully showing against the horizon broad on my weather bow i simply regarded it as another phantom and thought no more about it yet i kept my gaze fixed upon it neverthelesssince i had nothing better to occupy my attention and presently a peculiarity of this visionnot shared by the others i had seenforced itself upon my notice inasmuch as that while the other phantom ships that i had seen had exhibited a propensity to rush over the surface of the ocean at lightning speed and to appear in half a dozen quarters or more in as many seconds this one obstinately persisted in maintaining the precise position in which i had at first discovered her and it presently dawned upon me that she had another peculiarity namely that of an opacity sufficiently dense to temporarily blot out any lowlying star that the movement of the boat happened to bring into line with her the full significance of these peculiarities at length became suggestive and it began to dawn upon me that possibly the craft out yonder might not after all be a phantom she might be the vessel destined to afford us rescue and salvation the vessel for which i had all along been looking and the eventual appearance of which i had so frequently and so confidently predicted to miss onslow chapter six the derelict the mere possibility that rescue might actually be at hand acted as a tonic upon me imparting renewed life and hope and clearing away the more than halfdelirious fancies that had clouded and bemuddled my brain thus enabling me once more to think and act rationally i pulled myself resolutely together collected my wandering wits and peered long and anxiously at the shadowy shape that had as it were crystallised out of the surrounding darkness then i looked away from it toward other points of the horizon to see whether it repeated itself elsewhere no it was peculiar to one definite spot and i no longer had any doubt but that there was a certain tangible something which could only be a ship and that i must quickly determine upon the steps necessary to intercept her the first thing was to ascertain in what direction she was steering when i first discovered her she was dead to windward and since then she had drawn aft a trifle being now about two points before my weather beam she could not have overtaken me because in that case she would have passed so close as to have all but run over the boat and i could not have failed to see her and the fact that she had slowly and imperceptibly grown up out of the darkness argued that she was not sailing away from me nor could she be sailing toward me because in that case she would have grown in size and distinctness much more rapidly than she had done nor strangely enough did she seem to be crossing my course in either direction the slight change in her bearings being accounted for by the progress of the boat possibly she might be hoveto although it was difficult to imagine why she should be so unless she had lost a man overboard but if that were the case she would be showing lights as a guide to her boat which ought not to be very far away and why so deadly silent i could not understand it but as these ideas flitted through my mind i came to the conclusion that the correct thing to do was to close with her as quickly as possible by making short tacks toward her so i put down my helm and hove the boat round upon the starboard tack bringing the vague black shadow about two points on the weather bow the flapping of the sails while the boat was in stays awoke my companion who sat up and in a weak and husky voice asked me what was the matter nothing i answered at least nothing of an alarming nature the fact is that i fancy i can see something away out there on the weather bow and i have tacked the boat for the purpose of investigating the object more closely whereabout is this object of which you speak she asked i pointed it out to her and she almost immediately saw it do you imagine it to be a ship mr conyers she inquired i know not what else it can be said i but i added we must not be too sanguine of help or rescue just yet there are one or two points in connection with that object that make me doubtful as to its being a ship what are they she quickly demanded i told her that one was the apparent immobility of the object the other being the fact that no lights were being displayed and i explained that the two together seemed incompatible with the supposition that the object ahead was a ship repeating to her indeed the arguments that had flitted through my own mind only a few minutes before yet with every fathom that the boat advanced the shadow grew more palpable expanded and approximated more closely to the appearance of a vessel hoveto under bare poles and at length after several anxious minutes of alternating hope and doubt there arrived a moment when doubt became no longer possible for the shadow had finally resolved itself into the silhouette of a brig under bare poles even the thin lines of the mastswhich by the way looked stumpy as though her topgallantmasts were gonewere perceptible to my practised eye without pausing to puzzle out a possible reason for the singular condition of the vessel i hastily resigned the yokelines to miss onslow and springing upon the mast thwart proceeded to hail the brig at the full power of my lungs my delight at once more seeing a vessel so close at hand being coupled with a deadly anxiety lest she should suddenly make sail and get away from me but to all my hailing there came no reply nor was a light shown or any other indication vouchsafed that my cries had been heard even though i continued them until the boat was actually crossing the stern of the stranger at a distance of barely fifty fathoms there was only one inference to be drawn from this strange silence namely that the brig was derelict a surmise that was borne out by the fact that her boats appeared to be gone yet i could not detect any sign that anything was wrong with her she was not sitting particularly deep in the waterso far as i could judge in the darknessnor did her spars appear to be damaged except that as i have already mentioned her topgallantmasts seemed to have been carried away there appeared therefore to be no reason why we should not venture alongside and accordingly as soon as we had stood on far enough to fetch her on the next tack i hove the boat round andthe brig happening to lie broadsideon to the searan her alongside to leeward dousing my sails as we came up abreast the strangers lee quarter as we shot up alongside i found that the vessel was certainly deeper in the water than i had at first imagined her to be yet not deeper than might be accounted for by her carrying a heavy cargo her coveringboard seemed to be about eighteen inches above the water and i therefore had no difficulty in clambering in over her bulwarks from the gunwale of the boat of course taking care to carry the end of the boats painter on board with me making this securely fast to a cleat in the bulwarks i glanced fore and aft to see whether i could discover any indication of the presence of human beings on board but the deck appeared to be deserted no gleam of light showed either forward or aft and no sound broke the silence save the wash of the water along the bends the choking gurgle of the scuppers and the monotonous jerkjerk of the spankerboom at its sheet with the roll of the ship under these circumstances i considered that my companion might safely venture aboard and i accordingly assisted her up the side and in on deck afterwards dropping the boat astern and carefully securing her by her painter this done i conducted miss onslow aft to the cabin companionwhich was fitted with seatlockers on each sidebegged her to be seated for a short time while i investigated further and forthwith plunged below arrived at the foot of the companion ladder i found myself confronted by a bulkhead running athwart the ship and in this i presently found the handle of a door turning this i found myselfas i had expected in the cabin which was of course pitch dark the panes of the skylight just dimly showing overhead with the merest suggestion of a certain faintlygleaming something hanging from the beams and swinging with the roll of the ship which i presently identified as the extinguished cabin lamp groping cautiously with my hands i presently encountered a table uncovered working round which i next came to some lockers upholstered in horsehairas i gathered from the touch and while i was groping about on these lockers my hands suddenly encountered what seemed to be a tablecloth with a few knives and forks some broken crockery and a few other matters entangled in its folds the whole suggesting the idea that the cabin had been the scene of a furious struggle during which the table laid for a meal had been swept of everything upon it leaving all this quite undisturbedin the belief that when i could see just how it all lay i might obtain a clue to the mystery at present connected with the shipi continued my researches with the result that i made out the cabin to occupy the extreme afterend of the vessel with possibly a small sailroom or something of that kind abaft it and that it took up the whole width of that part of the hull that is to say there were no staterooms between it and the ships side as is sometimes the case continuing to grope my way round the cabin i presently arrived once more at the bulkhead wherein on the starboard side i found another door giving access to a stateroom as i soon discovered by finding the bunk with the bedding still in it and apparently quite ready for an occupant it did not take me long to arrive at the conclusion that i was in the skippers stateroom for i found that underneath the bunk was a chest of drawers while in one corner was a washbasin etcetera and in the other what seemed to be a small bookcase having progressed thus far i had hopes of soon finding that of which i was in search namely a box of matches being a sailor and well acquainted with sailors ways i knew exactly where would be the most likely place to find what i wanted and clambering up on the bunk i felt for the shelf that i knew ought to be at the head of it yes there it was but as i felt along it i was disappointed to find that there was nothing on it but was there not i had not examined the entire length of it when i too hastily jumped to the conclusion that it was empty as my hand travelled over into the far corner it suddenly encountered quite a little store of things all heaped togethera clasp knife a pipe a piece of stick tobacco and a few other odd articles among which was a box about half full of matches they proved to be rather damp and i had to strike a full halfdozen or more before i succeeded in persuading one to ignite and while thus employed i was struck for the first time by the coincidence between the condition of affairs on the skippers shelf and that in the cabinevery loose article had in each case found its way right over to starboard as far as it could go what did that point to why obviously that at some time or another the brig had heeled so heavily to starboard that every movable thing had fetched away by the run and gone over to that side and had never been replaced i gathered from this that the brig had been suddenly hove over upon her beamends and that her crew seized with panic and no doubt under the impression that she was capsizing had made a rush for the boats and abandoned her being as likely as not blown so far to leeward by the squall that hove the brig over that they lost sight of her altogether and imagined that she had foundered and by and by when the squall had blown itself out the brig with perhaps her canvas blown away had simply righted again and had been drifting about ever since how long ago that might have happened i could not at the moment guess but i thought that possibly with the return of daylight i might be able to discover indications enough to furnish me with a clue while thinking thus i had succeeded in finding and lighting a small lamp hung in gimbals from the fore bulkhead and by its illumination i saw that the stateroom was a nice clean cosy little apartment such as miss onslow might occupy without discomfort and waiting only to light the cabin lampthe globe of which was smashed in on its starboard side as though it had been dashed violently against the deck abovei hurried up the ladder and invited the young lady to descend i led her straight to the skippers stateroom and urged her to lie down while i proceeded to search for some food but she declined to take any rest until we had both partaken of a good meal so i established her comfortably on the sofalockers and proceeded forthwith in search of the pantry i found this as i had expected in a corresponding position on the opposite side of the ship to the cabin which i already designated in my own mind as miss onslows and in it were several tins of preserved meats and soups a bottle of pickles some vinegar a jar of salt a bottle of pepper a cask about threequarters full of potatoes part of a string of onions a barrel nearly full of fine cabin biscuit or bread as it is called at sea a small canister of tea another of coffee a jar of brown sugar and in fact a very fair assortment of such commodities as are usually to be found in an ordinary ships pantry i observed by the way that such articles as were labelled bore the names of american manufacturers and i deduced from that fact the impression that the brig was yankee an impression that was subsequently confirmed i took a biscuit out of the barrel broke it in two and handed one piece to miss onslow nibbling at the other myself while i further prosecuted my researches i did this because the biscuit was hard and dry and starving as we were there was not much likelihood of our eating so much of it as to prove injurious moreover it would have the effect of taking the sharp edge off our hunger and enabling us to eat cautiously and in moderation of the more appetising food that i intended to place upon the table as quickly as possible my next task was to explore the galley which i found to be very nicely fitted up with what appeared to be an excellent cookingstove and a generous supply of implements the whole of which had like the articles in the cabin found their way right over to the starboard side moreover the top of the stove was rusted in such a way as to suggest that the water from the coppers had been capsized over iteverything in short tending to confirm my original impression that the brig had been on her beamends i looked into the coppers and found them empty then i went to the scuttlebutt but it also was so nearly empty that i did not care to use the small remainder of water in it there were no more casks on deck so i concluded that the ships stock of water was kept below most probably in tanks and the thought of the latter reminded me that i had seen a small copper pump in the stewards pantry so i returned there to get it then with it in one hand and a lantern in the other i searched about on deck until i had found the small screw plug that fitted into the tank pipe and presently i had at my disposal a bucket of sweet fresh water which i poured into the coppers i then lighted the galley firefinding plenty of coal for my immediate wants in the lockerand proceeded to prepare a couple of tins of the preserved soup that i had found in the pantry then while this was cooking i returned to the cabin to lay the table but found that miss onslow had forestalled me having cleared away the wreck off the starboard locker restored the tablecloth to its proper position and rearranged such portions of the table equipage as had not been smashed in the capsizal the poor girl looked dreadfully white and thin and weary but i noticed that during my absence she had found time to take off her hat and to roughly rearrange her hair her eyes looked red as though she had been crying so with the view of toning her up a little i went to work rummaging in the sofalockers and presently found a few bottles of port wine the neck of one of which i promptly knocked off and insisted upon her taking a glass there and then she obeyed me with a sweet submissiveness that was in extraordinary contrast with her demeanour aboard the city of cawnpore but a flash of her old spirit returned when she had swallowed the wine as handing me the glass she said there i have done as you bade me and now i insist upon your taking some also for you look positively ghastly and so ill that unless you take great care of yourself you will break down altogether i took the wine and then hurried away back to the galley where i remained until the soup was ready of this we made a moderate meal and then without attempting to clear the table i gently conducted my companion to the skippers stateroom closed the door upon her and flung myself just as i was upon the sofalockers of the main cabin where i instantly fell into a sleep that was absolute oblivion i was awakened next morning by a beam of brilliant sunshine flashing intermittently athwart my closed eyelids to the lazy roll of the ship and springing to my feet and peering out through the nearest port i saw that the wind had died away to a flat calm and that the water was oilsmooth with very little swell running i felt greatly refreshed by my sleepbrief though it had beenfor it was the first spell of really sound slumber that our precarious situation and the anxiety attendant upon it had permitted me to take since the loss of the city of cawnpore and prompted thereto by the hilarity resulting from rest and the cessation of anxiety i started whistling softly as i gazed out through the port a moment later miss onslows cabindoor opened for the space of half an inch and the young lady thus addressed me through the chink goodmorning mr conyers i am glad to hear you whistling it shows that your rest has done you good thank you yes i answered i am feeling quite my old self again this morning were you able to get any rest yes indeed was the reply i was so tired that i scarcely remember lying down and i have not been awake more than five minutes what a lovely morning it is i wonder whether i might venture to trouble you to get me a little water to wash in there is none in here certainly i said i will fetch you a bucketful at once and place it at your door after which i intend to have a bath myself on deck a bath she exclaimed in a tone of unmistakable anxiety you surely do not mean that you are going to bathe in the sea oh please do not mr conyers i beg you it is far too dangerous for i am sure there must be sharks here i think it exceedingly probable and therefore i shall not risk going overboard i answered no my bath will be taken on the fore deck in a washdeck tub if i can find one thank you she returned and while you are so engaged i will lay the table for breakfast i still feel most atrociously hungry i answered that i was glad to hear it now that we were once more in possession of provisions and then hurried off up on deck to procure the water asked for after which i went forward found a washdeck tub filled it from over the side and treated myself to a saltwater bath the refreshment of which was like a renewal of life to me then having dressed i lighted the galley fire filled and put on a kettle had a wash in fresh water and made my way aft to the cabin where i found miss onslow looking wonderfully fresh and bright after her nights rest busily engaged in arranging the cabin table for breakfast then came the question what were we to have i had a strong fancy for a rasher of bacon which delicacy seemed also to commend itself to my companion i therefore looked about for the lazarette hatch which i discovered underneath a mat at the foot of the companion ladder and was soon overhauling the contents of the storehouse the craft proved to be abundantly stocked with excellent provisions among which i discovered an open cask nearly full of smoked hams one of which i at once appropriated and half an hour later found the indian judges daughter and myself seated before a most appetising breakfast and as we ate we talkedtalked of what we were now to do my companion seemed to be under the impression that the discovery of this derelict brig would in some way alter all our arrangements but i had no difficulty in demonstrating to her that our objectthe making of our way to some civilised port from which we could make a fresh start for calcuttastill remained the same the only difference being that whereas on the previous day we had possessed only an open boat and were starving we now had a vessel under our feet that if staunch would prove far safer and more comfortable than the boat while we also possessed food in abundance but as i pointed out to her there was a certain price to pay for these advantages namely the greatlyincreased labour of handling the brig as compared with the boat and i thought it advisable to make the young lady understand at once that i should from time to time require her assistance but i presently discovered that there was no need for me to dwell upon this point she quickly informed me that she had already planned for herself the performance of what might be called the domestic part of the work such as the preparation of meals and so on while she also expressed her perfect readiness to steer when required or in any other way assist me so far as she could and here i could not avoid being impressed afresh with the extraordinary change that misfortune had wrought in this girl for whereas while on board the city of cawnpore she had maintained a demeanour of haughty and repellent reserve that was almost insolent she now exhibited a gentle submissiveness and amiability of manner with a quiet steadfast courage under circumstances of peculiar and terrible hardship and privation for a gentlynurtured woman that conjoined with her exceptional beauty of face and form exercised a fascination upon me so potent that i frequently found it exceedingly difficult to maintain that equable coolness and strict friendliness of behaviour demanded by the exigencies of our peculiar situation all of which however is merely parenthetical breakfast over a busy day awaited me i had used my eyes to good purpose even while taking my morning tub and had observed among other things that the brigs canvas was not furled it had simply been blown clear and clean out of the boltropes when the accident befell her she had been under courses and singlereefed topsails spanker foretopmast staysail and jib for there the boltropes still were with small fluttering rags of canvas still adhering to them here and there there was no difficulty whatever in arriving at a correct conclusion as to what had happenedthe aspect of the ship told the story as plainly as her own crew could have related it the thing had happened after nightfallthat part of the story was made clear by the litter that had been shot off the cabin table and which showed that the skipper and one of the mates had been at supper at the time the singlereefed topsails indicated that it had previously been blowing strong and i took it that the night had settled down so dark and cloudy that the officer of the watch had failed to note the approach of the squall until too late the topsail halliards had been let go fore and aft when the squall swooped down upon them but before it was possible to do anything further the brig had been hove down upon her beamends a panic had seized the crew they had made a mad rush for the boats under the conviction that the vessel was capsizing and they had either been swamped or had been driven out of sight to leeward before the brig had righted again there was no doubt that the squall had been of exceptional violence for not only were all the sails blown away but both topgallantmasts were gone at the capsnot only broken off but actually torn away the rigging that held them having parted it would be strange indeed if a vessel having passed through such an ordeal as this should not show signs of having been more or less strained and i was quite prepared to find that she had a considerable amount of water in her and this anticipation was so far confirmed that upon sounding the well i found close upon three and a half feet of water in the hold this was bad enough still it was hardly as bad as i had expected and now the next thing to find out was whether she was still leaking or whether what she contained had all drained into her during the time when she lay hove down on her beamends this could be done by patiently waiting some few hours and then sounding the well again or it could be done equally effectively by pumping the hooker dry and then seeing whether any more water drained into her it was vitally necessary to restore her to her normal condition of buoyancy as speedily as might be in view of a possible recurrence of bad weather but the same contingency rendered it almost if not quite as necessary to bend and set a sufficient amount of canvas to put the ship under control and the first question to be settled was which should i first undertake i considered the matter for a minute or two and came to the conclusion that the pumping out of that three and a half feet of water would leave my hands in such a blistered and raw condition that they would be practically useless for such work as bending sails so i determined to undertake the latter job first especially as there was of course the chance that the weather might continue fine after the springing up of a breeze in which event if the brig were under canvas she would be making headway during the operation of pumping her out i was under the impression that on the preceding night i had detected the presence of what might prove to be a saillocker abaft the after bulkhead of the cabin so i now descended with the object of further investigating my surmise proved well founded for when i opened the door in the bulkhead there lay a whole pile of sails before me each sail neatly stopped and many of them apparently quite new i had come to the conclusion that i would bend the foretopmast staysail first and after a great deal of laborious work in turning over the various bundles of canvas i came to what i was searching for but not until i had previously encountered new fore and maintopsails which i managed with considerable difficulty to drag on deck the bending of the staysail was no very serious matter it simply meant letting go the halliards dragging upon the downhaul cutting the boltrope away from the hanks passing the new seizings hoisting the sail foot by foot until i had got all the seizings finished bending the sheets afresh and there we were but to bend a topsail singlehanded was a much more difficult job i decided to bend the maintopsail first and by the time that i had completed my task the day was done and it was growing so dark that i could scarcely see to finish off properly nevertheless i was very well content with my days work for i now had canvas enough on the brig to place her under command whenever the breeze might choose to come meanwhile miss onslow had been no less busy than myself in another way she had started by making herself complete mistress of the brigs resources looked at from a housekeepers point of view and in course of the process had discoveredwhat i had already suspected but had not found time to verifythat outside the cabin and alongside the companion ladder was another stateroom that judging from its appearance and contents had belonged to the mate this cabin she had overhauled making an inventory of its contentswhich she handed to meand had then tidied it up and made it ready for my occupation moreover she had taken possession of the galley and had prepared a good substantial and appetising dinner in a style that if not quite equal to that of a professional cook betrayed at least an aptitude that was as creditable as it was opportune she had also found time to do somethingi had not the remotest idea whatto her dress that had gone a considerable way toward renovating its appearance and obliterating the disfigurement caused by the action of the sea water upon it while in other ways she had sprucedup her appearance to an extent that excited my fervent but carefullyconcealed admiration at sunset that night it was still stark calm and the sky had a fine clear settled aspect that combined with a slight disposition to rise on the part of the brigs barometer led me to anticipate that the calm was destined to endure for a few hours longer for this i was devoutly thankful for i had been toiling like a slave all day fully exposed to the scorching rays of a cloudless sun and i was fatigued to the verge of exhaustion it was a great comfort therefore to feel that i should not be called upon to look after the ship all night but might safely indulge in a few hours sleep that i might do so with the greater confidence i routed out a tarpaulin from below and with it rigged up a tent on the wheel grating as a shelter from the heavy dew bringing up the bed from the mates bunk and turning in on deck this arrangement ensured that in the event of a breeze springing up during the night i should instantly become aware of it and be ready to promptly take such measures as might appear necessary chapter seven we pick up a shipwrecked crew the night passed without incident of any sort and when i awoke at dawn there was still no sign of wind for which i was thankful for while i was naturally anxious to be making some progress it was vitally necessary to get more sail upon the brig and this little spell of calm weather happened most opportunely for my purpose a bath an early breakfast and i went to work once more the bending and setting of the foretopsail being my first job i finished this about noon and considered that i had done very well when at dusk i had added to my spread of canvas the standing jib and spanker it was a whim of miss onslows that our midday meal should be tiffin dinner being reserved until the work of the day was over whenas the young lady sagely remarkedwe could both spare time to do due justice to the meal thus it happened upon the day in question that it was quite dark when at length having washed and polished myself up after the labours of the day i took my place at the table in the brigs little cabin it was then still flat calm but we had scarcely finished the meal when a little draught of air came down through the open skylight cool and refreshing and at the same moment the sound of a faint rustling of the canvas reached our ears i at once sprang up on deck and found that a light air from about eastsoutheast had sprung up taking us aback and giving the brig sternway the pressure of water upon the rudder had forced the helm hard down however causing the brig to box off i had nothing to do therefore but to trim sail and steady the helm at the proper moment when the vessel gathered headway and began to move quietly through the water on a southerly course closehauled on the larboard tack i was now obliged to take the wheel but it was not long before i made the discovery that under the sail now set the brig was practically steering herself and by the time that i had been at the wheel half an hour i had contrived to hit off so accurately the exact amount of weatherhelm required to keep the craft going fullandby that i was able to lash the wheel and attend to other matters and there was still plenty awaiting my attention among other immediate demands upon my energies there was the boat to be secured thus far she had been hanging on astern by her painter but she was far too valuable a possession to be any longer neglected and now that a breeze had sprung up i determined to secure her forthwith and while it was still possible to do so the brig carried a pair of davits on each quarter so i hauled the boat up on the starboard side made her fast slipped down into her and hooked on the tackles and then climbing inboard once more hauled them both handtaut then going forward i brought aft a snatchblock that i had previously been using led the falls one after the other through this to the winch and with miss onslow hanging on to the rope to prevent it slipping on the barrel of the winch managed to hoist the boat and secure her the weather continued fine and the wind light all through the night the ships speed being barely three knots and once more i turned in on the wheel grating and slept soundly the ship steering herself so perfectly that i found it quite unnecessary to interfere with the wheel and when i awoke at sunrise she was still stealing along as steadily as ever the sky looked so beautifully fine and clear when i went below to breakfast in response to miss onslows summons that it came upon me quite as a shock to discoveras i did by a casual glancethat the mercury was falling not much but just enough to indicate that the breeze was going to freshen now i had no objection whatever to the wind fresheningwithin certain limits up to the point say where the brig could just comfortably carry the canvas that was now seti was in a hurry to arrive somewhere and within the limits above named i should have heartily welcomed an increase of wind but the mischief was that when once the strength of the wind began to increase there was no knowing how far it might go it might go on increasing to the strength of a whole gale in which case it would become necessary for me to shorten sail unless i chose to accept the alternative of letting my canvas blow away and even in so small a vessel as the brig to shorten sail was a serious matter when there happened to be only one person to undertake the work yet if it came on to blow it would have to be done since it would never do to let the sails blow away so long that is to say as they could be saved by hard work there was however time enough to think about that there was a still more serious matter demanding my attention namely the getting rid of the water in the hold to this task accordingly i addressed myself immediately after breakfast first taking the precaution to most carefully sound the well the result of this preliminary operation was so far reassuring that i found a depth of just three feet six inches of water the merest trifle more than the rod had showed fortyeight hours before thus demonstrating that the hull was once more practically as tight as a bottle thus encouraged i got to work at the pump working steadily and systematically exerting my strength to the best advantage and sparing my hands as far as possible by enwrapping the handle first in canvas and then in a strip of a blanket taken from one of the forecastle bunks it was terribly backbreaking workthis steady toil at the pumps and when midday arrived and i knocked off to get a meridian altitude of the sun wherefrom to compute our latitude i was pretty well exhausted but i had my reward in the discovery that i had reduced the depth of water in the hold by nearly eight inchesthus showing that after all the quantity of water was not nearly so formidable as it had at first seemed existing indeed only in the more or less inconsiderable spaces not occupied by the cargo after tiffin i again went to work and toiled steadily on until sunset by which time i had reduced the depth by a further six inches at the same time fatiguing myself to the point of exhaustion and all through this day of toil i had been maintaining a most anxious watch upon the weather without detecting any disquieting sign whatever it is true that the wind strengthened somewhatsufficiently in fact to bring the brigs speed up to close upon five knots but this was the reverse of alarming especially as the sky remained clear but when at length we sat down to dinner that evening i found that the mercury still manifested a disposition to sink apart however from this behaviour on the part of the barometer every omen was so reassuring that when miss onslow bade me goodnight and retired to her cabin i unhesitatingly settled myself again upon the wheel grating for the night and soon fell into the deep sleep of healthy fatigue i was awakened some time during the nighti had no idea whatever of the hourby the loud rustling of canvas and upon starting to my feet i found that the wind had strengthened so considerably that the slight amount of weatherhelm afforded by the lashed wheel had at length proved insufficient with the result that the brig had shot into the wind throwing both topsails aback and her fore and aft canvas ashiver instinctively i sprang to the wheel and put it well over just in time to pay the vessel off again but it was fully half an hour before i had again hit off the exact position of the wheel with sufficient nicety to allow of its being again lashed and the brig once more left to take care of herself during this operation i had been anxiously scanning the sky but beyond a few small and scattered fleeces of cloud here and there it remained as clear as it had been at sunset and having at length adjusted the wheel to my satisfaction i came to the conclusion that i might safely leave matters as they were until the morning and secure a little more rest while the opportunity remained to me i therefore resumed my recumbent position upon the wheel grating and was soon once more asleep this time however i slept less soundly than before the curious instinct of watchfulness even in slumber that is so quickly developed in sailors and others who are constantly exposed to danger was now fully aroused and although i slept my senses and faculties were so far on the alert that when somewhat later the wind suddenly breezed up in a spiteful squall i heard the moan of it before it reached the brig and was broad awake and on my feet in time to put the helm up and keep broad away before it the wind came away strong enough to make me anxious for the topmasts for a few minutes but as the yards were braced sharp up while the brig was running away dead before it the wind struck the sails very obliquely and the spars were thus relieved of a great deal of the strain that would otherwise have come upon them of course there was no more sleep for me that night for when at length the squall had blown itself out it left behind it a strong northerly breeze that very soon knocked up a sea heavy enough to make me ardently wish for daylight and the opportunity to shorten sail and when the dawn at length appeared i grew more anxious than ever for the new day showed as a long ragged gash of fierce copperyellow light glaring through a gap in an otherwise unbroken expanse of dirty grey cloud struck here and there with dashes of dull crimson colour the air was unnaturally clear the heads of the surges showing up against the wild yellow of the eastern horizon jet black and as sharp and cleancut as those that brimmed to the brigs rail the aspect of the sky meant wind in plenty and before long and i realised that unless i could contrive to shorten sail in doublequick time the task would pass beyond my power and the canvas would have to remain set until it should blow away at length miss onslow made her appearance on deck bright fresh and rosy from her nights sleep and a cry of dismay broke from her lips as she took in the state of affairs at a single comprehensive glance oh mr conyers she exclaimed how long has it been like this are we in any danger only in so far that we stand to lose some of our sails unless i can contrive to get them clewed up before it comes on to blow any harder answered i i have been waiting for you to come on deck and relieve me at the wheel i continued in order that i may get about the job at once but why did you not call me she demanded as she stepped up on the wheel grating beside me and took the spokes from my hands oh said i it has not been bad enough to justify me in disturbing you thus far nevertheless i am very glad to have your help now as i believe there is no time to lose kindly keep her as she now is dead before the wind and i will get about the work of shortening sail without further delay so saying i hurried away forward letting go the trysail outhaul and the maintopsail halliards on my way passing next to the foretopsail halliards which i also let run i then squared the yards hauled in brailed up and furled the trysail and next took the reeftackles one after the other to the winch heaving them as taut as i could get them after which i jumped aloft passed the reef earrings and tied the knittles we were now tolerably safethe brig being under closereefed topsailsso i hoveto while we took breakfast after which i hauled down and stowed the jib got the brig away before the wind again with miss onslow at the wheel and resumed pumping operations i toiled all through the day reducing the amount of water in the hold to a depth of eighteen inches only and then hoveto the brig on the port tack for the night both of us being by this time so completely exhausted that rest was even more important to us than food although i took care that we should not be obliged to go without the latter about two hours after sunset the wind freshened up still more and by midnight it was blowing so heavily and so mountainous a sea was running that i dared not any longer leave the brig to herself it became necessary to constantly tend the helm although the craft was hoveto and in consequence i had no alternative but to pass the latter half of this night also at the wheel exposed to a pelting rain that quickly drenched me to the skin it was now blowing a whole gale from the northward and so it continued for the next thirty hours during nearly the whole of which time i remained at the wheel wet cold and nearly crazy at the last for want of rest indeed but for the attentionalmost amounting to devotionof my companion i believe i should never have weathered that terrible time of fatigue and exposure an end to it came at last however the gale broke the wind softened down somewhat and at length the sea went down sufficiently to permit of the wheel being once more lashed when leaving the brig in miss onslows charge with strict injunctions that i was at once to be called in the event of a change for the worse in the weather i went below rolled into the mates bunk and instantly lost all consciousness for the ensuing ten hours it was somewhere about midnight when i awoke yet when i turned out i found miss onslow still up and not only so but with a hot and thoroughly appetising meal ready for me we sat down and partook of it together and when we had finished i went on deck had a look round found that the weather had greatly improved during my long sleep and so turned in again until morning when i next went on deck the weather had cleared the wind had dwindled to a fiveknot breezehauling out from the eastward again at the same timeand the sea had gone down to such an extent as to be scarcely perceptible i therefore shook out my reefs and once more made sail upon the shipa task that kept me busy right up to noon the weather being fine i was able to secure a meridian altitude of the sun and thus ascertain the latitude of the brig with the resulting discovery that we were already to the southward of the cape parallels this was disconcerting in the extreme the more so from the fact that the easterly wind was forcing us still farther to the southward but there was no help for it we could do nothing but keep all on as we were and hope for a shift of wind the fact of our being so far to the southward accounted too for the circumstance that we were not falling in with any other vessels hitherto i had been so fully employed that i had found no time to search for the ships papers or do more than ascertain the bare fact that she was of american nationality that she was named the governor smeaton and that she hailed from portland maine but now that the weather had come fine once more i determined to devote a few hours to the work of overhauling the vessel and discovering what i could about her so i went to work and instituted a thoroughly systematic search beginning in the skippers cabinhaving of course first obtained miss onslows permissionand there stowed carefully away in a lockup deskwhich after some hesitation i decided to break openi found the ships papers intact enclosed in a small tin case and from these i learned first that her late master was named josiah hobson and second that she was bound on a trading voyage to the pacific with a cargo of notions then in another drawer also in the skippers cabin carefully stowed away under some clothes i found the logbook and a chart of the atlantic ocean with the brigs course up to a certain point pricked off upon it and from these two documents i learned that the brig had sailed on such and such a date from new york with what in the way of weather progress and so on had befallen her up to a date some five weeks later whereon entries had been made in the logbook up to noon the remarks respecting the weather at that hour gave no indication of any warning of the catastrophe that must have occurred only a few hours later this last entry in the logbook enabled me to determine that the brig had been drifting about derelict for nearly three weeks when we two ocean waifs fell in with and took possession of her the notions of which her cargo consisted seemed according to the manifest to comprise more or less of nearly everything that could possibly captivate a savages fancy but in addition to these multitudinous articles there weresomewhere in the shipa few bales of goodsmostly linen fine muslins silks and readymade clothing consigned to a firm in valparaiso which i believed would be of the utmost value to miss onslow and myself if i could but find them and which under the circumstances i felt i could unhesitatingly appropriate to our use i therefore determined that my next task should be to search for these bales which being composed of rather valuable goods and destined moreover to be discharged at the brigs first port of call i thought would probably be found on top of the rest of the cargo and near to one of the hatches the next day proved even finer than its predecessor the wind holding in the same direction but of perhaps a shade less strength than on the day before while the sea had gone down until the water was smooth as the surface of a pond excepting for the low swell that scarcely ever quite disappears in midocean it was an ideal day for taking off the hatches and i therefore determined to commence my examination of the cargo at once beginning with the main hatch to knock out the wedges remove the battens and roll back the tarpaulin was not a difficult job and when i had got thus far the removal of a couple of the hatches was soon effected luck was with me that day for no sooner had i got the hatches off than my eyes fell upon a bale bearing marks which according to the testimony of the vessels manifest showed it to be one of those of which i was in search it was too large and was too tightly wedged in among others to admit of my moving it unaided but with the assistance of a strop on the mainstay and the watch tackle i soon broke it out and triumphantly landed it on deck the manifest gave the contents as readymade clothingmens and womens which was exactly what miss onslow at least needed more than anything else so i opened it forthwith and then called the young lady to overhaul the contents and select what she would while i gave her a spell at the wheel in ten minutes she came aft with her arms full of neatlyfolded white material and disappeared below then she came on deck again had a further search and this time carried off a load of coloured fabric after which she remained invisible for nearly threequarters of an hour finally she reappeared clad in an entirely new rigout from top to toe and very sweet and charming she looked although i regret being unable to inform my female readers of the details of her costume then i had my innings and after a considerable amount of rummaging succeeded in finding a couple of suits of light tweed that i thought would fit me together with a generous supply of underclothing this done and our more pressing needs in the matter of clothing met i returned the despoiled bale to its place in the hatchway replaced the hatches and battened everything securely down once more the remainder of the day i devoted to the task of pumping the ship dry the two succeeding days were quite devoid of incident the weather held fine and the wind so light that the brig made barely three knots in the hour on a taut bowline there was nothing particular to do for the small air of wind that continued to blow hung obstinately at east and we were still driving slowly south the vessel steering herself under these circumstances as i was daily growing increasingly anxious to fall in with a sail of some sort that would take us off and convey us to a civilised port or even lend me a few hands to help in carrying the brig to cape town i spent pretty nearly the whole of the day in the maintopmast crosstrees from whence i could obtain the most extended view possible and perhaps be thus able to intercept some craft that would otherwise slip past us unseen on the third day after my raid upon the cargo i was aloft as usualthe hour being about ten amwhile miss onslow was busy in and out of the galley the ship was creeping along at a speed of about two and a half knots when slowly and carefully sweeping the horizon afresh with the telescope after a rather long spell of meditation upon how this adventure was likely to end a small hazylooking illdefined object swam into the field of the instrument the object was about one point before the weather beam and was so far away that the rarefaction of the air imparted to it a wavering indistinctness of aspect that rendered it quite unrecognisable the fact however that it was visible at all in the slightly hazy atmosphere led me to estimate its distance from the brig as about ten miles while from its apparent size it might be either a boat a raft or a piece of floating wreckage but whatever it might be i determined to examine it since it would be nothing out of my way and would merely involve the labour of getting the ship round upon the other tack so i continued to watch it until it had drifted to a couple of points abaft the beamwhich occurred just two and a half hours after i had first sighted it thus confirming my estimate as to its distancewhen i put the helm hard down lashed it and then tended the braces as the brig sluggishly came up into the wind and as sluggishly paid off on the starboard tack when the brig was fairly round and the helm steadied i found that the object bore a full point on the lee bow and that we should probably fetch it with ease it was now distant about ten and a half miles so there was plenty of time for us to go below and get tiffin ere closing it it was within about two hours of sunset when we at length came up with the object but long ere then i had with the assistance of the telescope made it out to be a large boat apparently a ships longboat unrigged and drifting idly before the wind yet her trim sitting low as she was on the water showed that she was not empty and at length when we were within some two miles of her i suddenly observed a movement of some sort aboard her and a couple of oars were laid out with some difficulty i thought i was at the wheel when this occurredfor i had discovered some time earlier in the afternoon that although with the wheel lashed the brig could be made to steer herself fairly well upon a wind she was just a trifle too erratic in her course to hit off and fetch such a comparatively small object as we were now aiming for and consequently i had been steering all through the afternoonbut i at once called miss onslow to relieve me while i ran the ensignthe stars and stripesup to the peak as an encouragement to the occupants of the boat and an intimation that they had been seen it was tedious work our snaillike closing with the boat and it was rendered all the more so by the fact that those in her after vainly attempting for some five minutes to use the oars had given up the effort and were once more invisible in the bottom of the boat while the oars left to take care of themselves had gradually slid through the rowlocks and gone adrift this simple circumstance apparently so trivial was to me very significant pointing as i considered it did to a condition of such absolute exhaustion on the part of the strangers that even the loss of their oars had become a matter of indifference to them who could tell what eternities of suffering these men had endured ere being brought into this condition it was quite likely that that lonely drifting boat had been the scene of some ghastly tragedy who could tell what sight of horror might be passively awaiting us between the gunwales of the craft i once more resigned the wheel to miss onslows hand with strict injunctions to her not to leave it or attempt to get a peep at the interior of the boat on any account and then went forward to prepare a ropesend to drop into her as we drew up alongside i conned the brig in such a manner as to bring the boat alongside under the lee fore chains and then when the proper moment had arrived let go the weather main braces and swung the topsail aback my intention was to have jumped into the boat with a ropesend as she came alongside taking a turn anywhere for the moment but as with maintopsail aback we crept slowly down upon the poor forlornlooking waif a gaunt unkempt scarecrow suddenly upreared itself in the sternsheets and uttering queer gibbering sounds the while scrambled forward into the eyes of the boat with movements that somehow were equally suggestive of the very opposite qualities of agility and exhaustion and held out its lean talonlike hands for the rope which i was waiting to heave as we drifted alongside the boat i hove the ropesend the man caught it and collapsing rather than stooping with it he made it fast to the ringbolt in the stem then uprearing himself once more stiffly and as though fighting against a deadly lethargy he made a staggering spring for the brigs rail missed it and would have fallen headlong backward into the boat had i not caught him by the collar heavens what a skeleton the man was he was fully as tall as myself and had all the appearance of having once been a big brawny hercules of a fellow but so wasted was he now that with scarcely an effort i with one hand lifted him in over the bulwarks and deposited him on deck where he again limply doubled up and sank in a heap groaning but he kept his eyes fixed upon my face and stiffly opening his jaws pointed to his black and shrivelled tongue and i at once recognising his condition ran aft and taking a tumbler from the pantry quickly mixed about a wineglassful of weak brandy and water with which i sped back to him i shall never forget the horrible expression of mad wolfish craving that leapt into the unfortunate creatures bloodshot eyes as i approached and bent over him he glared at the tumbler and howled like a wild beast then suddenly snatched at my hand as i held the liquid to his lips and clung so tightly to me that before i could withdraw the tumbler he had drained it of every drop of its contents even then he would not release me but continued to pull and suck at the empty tumbler for several seconds at length however he let go groaning more more this time i mixed a considerable quantity of weak grog in a jug and took it on deck with me remembering that there were others in the boat alongside who were also probably perishing of thirst i administered a further small quantity of the mixture to my patient and it was marvellous to see the effect of it upon him his strength seemed to return to him as though by magic and as he sat up on the deck he muttered thickly more drink more drink for the love of god id sell my soul for a tumbler of the stuff powerful though the fellows adjuration was i refused his request considering that after his evidently long abstention it would do him more harm than goodperhaps kill him evento let him drink too freely at first so putting the jug and tumbler out of his sight and reach i turned my attention to the longboat alongside she was a fine big powerful boat and evidently from her appearance had belonged to a large ship now that i had time to look at her attentively i saw that her masts and sails were in her laid fore and aft the thwarts together with six long oars or sweeps she bore deeply cut in her transom the words black prince liverpool there were six water breakers in her bottom and huddled up in all sorts of attitudes eloquent of extremest suffering there lay stretched upon and doubled over the thwarts and in the bottom of the boat no less than fifteen menwhether living or dead it was difficult for the moment to say at all events it was evident that there was no time to be lost for if the men were not actually dead their lives were hanging by a thread so recovering possession of the jug of weak grog and the tumbler i slid down into the boat and taking them as they came wetted the lips of each with a little of the liquid some of them were able to swallow it at once while others had their teeth so tightly clenched that it was impossible to get their jaws apart but eventuallynot to dwell at unnecessary length upon a scene so fraught with lingering longdrawnout sufferingi contrived to restore every one of them to consciousness and to get them aboard the brig where i spent several hours in attending to them and with miss onslows assistance administering food and drink in small quantities until their strength had so far returned to them that there was no longer any danger of their perishing when i got them below into the forecastle and left them to rest undisturbed the next day they were all so far recovered as to be able to move about and even to climb on deck out of the forecastle unaided and on the second day seven of them reported themselves fit for such light duty as taking a trick at the wheel and so on among the first to recover were the cook and steward who at once assumed their proper duties much to my satisfaction for necessary as it had hitherto been for me to avail myself of miss onslows assistance it went sorely against the grain for me to see her day after day performing such mean duties as that of cooking and it was a great relief to me when i was able to inform her that henceforward she would be relieved of such work the unexpected acquisition of these sixteen men constituting as they did a really strong crew for such a small craft as the brig relieved me of a very heavy load of anxiety for now i felt that with a tight and seaworthy vessel under my feet and a crew that would enable me to handle and take care of her in any weather there was no reason whatever why my companion and i should not speedily reach cape town and the end of our troubles there was but one thing remaining to occasion me any uneasiness and that was the fact that the chronometer had run down and stopped during the time that the brig had been drifting about derelict and consequently i had no means of ascertaining my longitudea most awkward predicament to be in especially when approaching a coast but as though fate were satisfied with what she had already inflicted upon us and had now relented so completely as to be eager to hasten our deliverance it happened that on the very day when my new crew reported themselvesas fit for duty we fell in with a homewardbound china clipper from the skipper of whom i obtained our longitude and was thus enabled to start the chronometer again the information thus afforded me showed that we were within two hundred and forty miles of the south african capital or little more than twentyfour hours run if the wind would but chop round and come fair for us chapter eight the crew take possession of the brig the process of nursing the rescued men back to health and strength had afforded me an opportunity to learn their story which briefly was to the effect that their ship the black prince of liverpool had sailed from melbourne for home on such a date and that all had gone well with them until such another date when the ship was discovered to be on fire in the fore hold every effort had then been made to subdue the flames but ineffectually the fire continuing to spread until some three hours after the discovery of the outbreak the flames burst through the deck when it became apparent that the ship was doomed and the boats were ordered out according to the narrative of the men the ship had been abandoned in a perfectly orderly manner the passengers going away in the cutters and gigs in charge of the captain and the three mates while the remaining portion of the crew for whom room could not be found in these boats were told off to the longboat they had remained by the ship until she burned to the waters edge and sank and then made sail in company steering a northwest course then on the fourth day a westerly gale had sprung up and the boats had become separated this was supposed to have occurred about a fortnight before we had fallen in with them but they admitted that they were by no means sure as to this period for on the twelfth day after abandoning the ship their provisions had become exhausted and they had been subjected to all the horrors of starvation during the latter portion of which they had lost all account of time having heard their story it became necessary to tell them my own which i did in considerable detail winding up by informing them that the brig having been found derelict the salvage money upon her would amount to something very considerable and that while by right the whole of it might be claimed by miss onslow and myself we would willingly divide it equally among all hands instead of offering them ordinary wages for their assistance in taking the vessel into port i was rather disappointed to observe that this generous offeras i considered itevoked no show of enthusiasm or gratitude on the part of my crew they accepted it quite as a matter of course and as no more than their due although they were fully aware that between us miss onslow and i had already taken care of and sailed the brig for several days andbarring such an untoward circumstance as a heavy gale of windcould no doubt have eventually taken her into table bay i said nothing however knowing from past experience that forecastle jack is not overmuch given to a feeling of gratitudeperhaps in too many cases the poor fellow has little or nothing to be grateful forbut proceeded with the business of the vessel by appointing peter ogorman late boatswain and john price late carpenter of the black prince to the positions of chief and second mate respectively this done the two men named at once picked the watches the port watch assumed duty the starboard watch went below and everybody apparently settled forthwith into his proper place while the ceremony of picking the watches was proceeding i availed myself of the opportunity thus afforded to take stock of our new associates as a whole and after making every allowance for the effects of the hardship and suffering that they had so recently passed through i was compelled to confess to myself that they were by no means a prepossessing lot they one and all ogorman and price not excepted wore that sullen hangdog ruffianly expression of countenance that marks the very lowest class of british seamen the scum and refuse of the vocation still we had not far to go and i consoled myself with the reflection that they would probably prove good enough to serve my purpose on the following morning immediately after breakfast i secured a set of observations of the sun for my longitude miss onslow noting the chronometer time for me and immediately afterwards i descended to the cabin to work them out while on deck engaged with the sextant i had noticed that my movements were being watched with extraordinary interest by the hands on deck and when upon my return to the cabin i proceeded to make my calculations and afterwards prick off the brigs position on the chart i could not help observing that the stewardwho was busying himself in and out of the pantry at the timebetrayed as keen an interest in my doings as any of the people on deck miss onslow was also watching me and when i had finished and was about to roll up the chart she asked me if i had found out the ships position whereupon i pointed it out to her at the same time casually mentioning the fact that we were still one hundred and eighty miles from table bay as i said this i saw the steward leave his pantry and go on deck i thought nothing of it at the time believing that he had done so in the ordinary course of his duty but a little later on i had reason to believe that his errand was to inform his shipmates as to the position of the brig having put away the chart and waited a few minutes for miss onslowwho had announced her intention of going on deckwe both made our way up the companion ladder and took a few turns fore and aft the weather side of the deck together from the wheel grating to the wake of the main rigging my companion was in high spirits at the favourable turn that seemed to have occurred in our affairs and was chatting with me in animated tones as to what would be best to do upon our arrival in cape town when ogorman who had been forward among the crew came slouching aft along the deck in true shellback fashion and with the rather abrupt salutation of morning misther mornin miss unceremoniously joined us well ogorman what is it said i for i had met and spoken to him several times already on that same morning and imagined that he now had some matter of ships business to discuss with me i see you takin a hobseirwashin just now he remarked yes i answered finding that he paused as though expecting me to reply dye mane to say thin that yere a navigator he demanded certainly i am i answered rather testily my temper rising slightly at what i considered the boorish familiarity of his tone and manner which i determined to at once checkwhat of it pray well ye see we didnt knowyou didnt tell us yesterdaythat you was a navigator he returned leering curiously at me out of his eye corners was there any particular reason why i should inform you that i happen to be a sailor i demanded fast getting really angry at this impertinent inquisition into my qualifications oh he retorted av coorse we all knew you was a sailorman we could see that widout anny tellin but a navigator toobedad that makes a mighty differ in what way pray demanded i have you been drinking this morning ogorman the divil a dhrop he returned and then before i could say another word he abruptly turned and walked forward again saying something to the men on deck as he went who instantly dropped such work as they were engaged upon and followed him below into the forecastle i was astoundedfairly taken abackat this extraordinary behaviour an explanation of which i was determined to demand at once with this view i turned to miss onslow whose arm was linked in mine and requested her to kindly excuse me for a moment no said she i will not i know perfectly well what that glitter in your eye means you are angry at that sailors impertinence and mean to give him a welldeserved reprimand but i would rather that you did nothing of the kind please the man knows no better and i do not suppose he really meant to be rude at all but i confess i do not like the expression of his face there is a mixture of low cunning obstinacy and cruel brutality in it that renders his appearance dreadfully repulsive so please oblige me by taking no notice whatever of his behaviour there was a certain subtle flattery in the apparent inconsequence of my companions last few words that made them peculiarly acceptable to me but discipline is discipline and must be maintained at all hazards even when a crew has been picked up in such irregular fashion as mine had been and i was determined to at once impress upon this irish ruffian the fact that i was skipper of the brig and that i intended to exact from him the respect and deference of manner due to the position so i said to my companion i have no doubt you are perfectly right in your estimate of the mans intentions but he was altogether too insolent of manner to please me and he must be taught better moreover i wish to ascertain precisely what he meant by the remark that my being a navigator made a mighty differ so please allow me to go forward and put these little matters right i shall not be gone longer than five minutes at the utmost i will not consent to your going just now even for five seconds answered miss onslow with quiet determination you are just angry enough to use the first words that may rise to your lips without pausing to consider whether they happen or not to be offensive and i am sure that is not a safe temper in which to engage in an altercation with that man he is insolent insubordinate and altogether a most dangerous man to deal withone can tell that by merely glancing at his eyesand i have a firm conviction that if you were perchance to offend him he would without compunction stab you or do you some other dreadful injuryperhaps kill you outright thereforewith a most ravishing smile and a tightening of her grip upon my armyou will be pleased to consider yourself as my prisoner for the present and a most willing prisoner tooat any other time answered i with an attempt to fall in with the playful mood in which she had spoken the last words while yet my anger was rising and my anxiety increasing as i noted the continued absence of the men from the deck but at this moment i continued i have no option that fellow ogorman must be brought to book at once or my authority will be gone for ever and that would never do the others would only too probably take their cue from him and become insolent and insubordinate in their turn and there is no knowing what excesses they might in that case commit my companion turned pale as she at length realised that it was something more that mere anger springing from my wounded dignity that was moving me she gazed anxiously into my eyes for a moment and then said have you any weapons of any kind none but these i answered indicating by a glance my doubled fists and in case of need a belayingpin snatched from the rail but i added cheerfully there is no need for weapons in this case i shall but have to firmly assert my authority and the fellow will be brought to his bearings forthwith i wish i could think so exclaimed miss onslow earnestly but somehow i cannot i utterly distrust the man it is not only his appearance but his behaviour also that is against him he is a sailor and as such must know perfectly well what respect is due to a captain and i cannot think he was ever allowed to behave to his former captain as he just now behaved to you i have a presentiment that he means mischief of some kind and see too what influence he appears to possess over the rest of the men precisely i agreed you see you are coming rapidly round to my view of his conduct and therefore i think you will agree with me as to the immediate necessity for me to assert myself yes she assentedif you can do so effectively but you must not go among those men unarmed they have their knives but you have nothing let us go downstairs and see if we cannot find a pistol or something in one or the other of our cabins i have never yet thoroughly searched my cabin to see what it contains i have searched mine said i and have found no weapon of any kind butah there is ogorman now coming out of the forecastleand the rest of the men following him and by jove they are coming aft you are right there is something in the wind kindly go below for a few minutes until the discussion which i foresee has come to an end no indeed i will not whispered my companion as she strengthened her hold upon my arm i will remain here with you whatever happens they will never be such despicable cowards as to use violence in the presence of a woman there was no time to say more for ogorman with all hands excepting the man at the wheel behind him was now within hearing distance of us i looked him squarely in the eye and at once braced myself for conflict for there was a sullen furtive dogged expression in his gaze as he vainly attempted to unflinchingly meet mine that boded mischief although of what precise nature i could not for the life of me guess he so obviously had something to say and was moreover so obviously the spokesman for all hands that i waited for him to begin determined to take my cue from him rather than by speaking first afford him the opportunity of taking his cue from me he shifted his weight uneasily from leg to leg two or three times glanced uncomfortably from miss onslows face to mine removed a large quid of tobacco from his cheek and carefully deposited it in his cap and betrayed many other symptoms of extreme awkwardness and perturbation of mind for a full minute or more without discovering a way of saying what he had to say and so uncouthly ridiculous an exhibition did he make of himself that presently i detected a tremor of repressed laughter in the pressure of my companions hand upon my arm and a second or two later the young ladys risibility so far mastered her that she felt constrained to bury her face in her pockethandkerchief under pretence of being troubled with a sudden fit of coughing ogorman however was not to be so easily deceived he at once observed the convulsion and recognised it for what it was and the circumstance that he had excited the mirth of a girl seemed to sting him into action for he suddenly straightened himself up and with a vindictive glare at miss onslow exclaimed ah so yere laughin at me eh all right my beauty laugh away yell laugh the other side ov yr purty face afore long ogorman i exclaimed fiercely advancing a step or two toward him and dragging miss onslow after me as she tenaciously clung to my arm what do you mean sir how dare you address yourself to this lady in such an insolent fashion take care what you are about sir or i may find it very necessary to teach you a lesson in good manners what do you want why do you stand there staring at me like an idiot if you have anything to say please say it at once and get about your duty oho bedad just listen to him exclaimed the fellow now thoroughly aroused get about me juty is it by the powers but theres others asll soon find that theyll have to get about their juty as well as me i was by this time brought to the end of my patience i was in a boiling passion and would have sprung upon the man there and then had not miss onslow so strenuously resisted my efforts to release myself from her hold that i found it impossible to do so without the exercise of actual violence at this moment one of the men behind ogorman interposed by mutteringloud enough however for me to hear dont be a fool pete man keep a civil tongue in your head cant you youll make a mess of the whole business if you dont mind your weather eye whats the good of bein oncivil to the gent eh that aint the way to work the traverse tell him what we wants and lets get the job over thus adjured ogorman pulled himself together and remarked halfas it seemedin response to the seaman and half to me we wants a manny things and the first ov thim is how fur are we from table bay well answered i if it will afford you any satisfaction to know it i have no objection to inform you that we are just one hundred and eighty miles from it and how fur may we be from the horn now demanded ogorman the horn i exclaimed what has the horn to do with us or we with the horn why a precious sight more than you seem to think mister retorted the man with a swift recurrence to his former insolent bullying manner the fact is he continued without allowing me time to speak were bound round the horn we mean you to take us there and we want to know how long itll be afore we get there my good fellow said i you dont know what you are talking about we are bound to table bay and to table bay we go or i will know the reason why you may go round the horn or to the devil afterwards and welcome so far as i am concerned shtop a bit and go aisy retorted ogorman its yoursilf that doesnt know what youre talkin about i said were goin round the horn didnt i very well i repait it were goin round the hornin this brigand id like to know wheres the man thatll purvent us ah i think i now understand you said i with an involuntary shudder of horror as the scoundrels meaning at last burst upon me and i thought of the dainty delicatelynurtured girl by my side we picked you up and saved your lives and now you are about to repay our kindness by turning pirates and taking the ship from us is that it by the piper ye couldnt have guessed it thruer if yed been guessin all day answered ogorman coolly my lads exclaimed i appealing to the group of seamen standing behind the irishman is this true is it possible that you really contemplate repaying this lady and myself for what we have done for you with such barbarous ingratitude the men shuffled uneasily looked at one another as though each hoped that his fellow would accept the invidious task of replying to my question and presently price the carpenter spoke ay sir it is true we are sorry if it is not to your liking but we have very particular business in the pacific and there we must go this is just our chance we shall never have a better and we should be fools if we did not take it now that it has come in our way very well said i bitterly you are sixteen men while i am one only if you are absolutely resolved to perpetrate this act of monstrous ingratitude i cannot prevent you but i positively refuse to help you in any way whateveryou have no power or means to compel me to do thatso the best plan will be for us to part this lady and i will take the boat with sufficient provisions and water to enable us to reach table bay and you may find your way round the horn as best you can ogorman simply laughed in my face take the boat is it he exclaimed with a loud guffaw oh no misther that wont do at all at all we shall want the boat for ourselves and we shall want your help too to navigate the brig for us and we mane to have it begorra i fail to see how you are going to compel me to do anything that i may resolve not to do retorted i putting a bold face upon the matter yet momentarily realising more clearly how completely we were in their hands and at their mercy you do exclaimed ogorman then wait till i tell ye if ye dont consint to do as we want ye to well just rig up a bit of a raft and send ye adrift upon heralone dye understand me mistheralone no interposed miss onslow you shall do nothing of the kind you cowardly wretches where mr conyers goes i go also even if it should be overboard with no raft to float us oh no my purty answered ogorman with the leer of a satyr wed take moighty good care you didnt do that if misther conyers wont be obligin why well have to spare him i spose but we couldnt do widout you my dear whatd we do i could bear no more silence you blackguard i shouted while vainly striving to shake off miss onslows tenacious hold upon my arm that i might get within striking reach of himsilence how dare you address a helpless defenceless woman in that insulting manner what do you expect to gain by it address yourself exclusively to me if you please wid all me heart answered ogorman in nowise offended by my abuse of him i simply spoke to the lady because she spoke first and bedad its glad i am she did because its give me the opporchunity to show ye how we mane to convart ye to our views navigate the brig for us and yell nayther of ye have any cause to complain of bad tratement from anny of us refuse and away ye goes adhrift on a raft while the lady ll stay and kape us company to say that i was mad with indignation at this ruffians gross behaviour but feebly expresses my mental condition to such a state of fury was i stirred that but for the restraining hold of the fair girl upon my arm from which she by no means suffered me to breakawayi should most assuredly have run amok among the mutineers and in all probability have been killed by them in selfdefence as it was my anger and the bitterly humiliating conviction of my utter helplessness so nearly overcame me that i was seized with an attack of giddiness that caused everything upon which my eyes rested to become blurred and indistinct and to whirl hither and thither in a most distracting fashion while i seemed to lose the control of my tongue so that when i essayed to speak i found it impossible to utter a single intelligible word moreover i must have been on the very verge of becoming unconscious from the violence of my agitation for i had precisely the same feeling that one experiences when dreaminga sensation of vagueness and unreality as to what was transpiring so that when miss onslow spoke her voice sounded faint and far away and her words although i heard them distinctly conveyed no special significance to my comprehension mr conyers will acquaint you with his decision in due time when he has had leisure for reflection said she in those haughtily scornful tones of hers that i remembered so well then i felt and yielded to the pressure of her guiding hand and presently found myself groping my way with her assistance down the companion ladder and into the cabin she guided me to one of the sofalockers upon which i mechanically seated myself and then i saw her go to the swinging rack and pour out a good stiff modicum of brandy which she brought and held to my lips i swallowed the draught and after a few seconds my senses returned to me almost as though i were recovering from a swoon miss onslow assisting my recovery by seating herself beside me and fanning me with her pockethandkerchief gazing anxiously in my face the while there you are better now she exclaimed encouragingly as she continued to regard me oh mr conyers she continued i am so very sorry to see you thus but i am not surprised after all the hardship and anxiety and hard work that you have been called upon to endure since the wreck of the unfortunate city of cawnpore what you have so bravely borne has been more than sufficient to undermine the health of the strongest man and now when we hoped that a few hours more would bring us to the end of our troubles comes the cruel shock and disappointment of these wretches base ingratitude to complete what hardship anxiety and suffering have begun but cheer up all is not yet lost by any means our deliverance is merely deferred until you shall have carried out the wishes of these men therefore since we have no alternative let us accept the inevitable with a good gracedo what they require as speedily as may be and so bring this unfortunate adventure to an end and she continued after a barely perceptible pause have no anxiety on my account ogorman and his accomplices will not molest me if you will but conform to their wishes and if they should i shall be prepared for them forewarned is forearmed you may imagine how deeply ashamed of myself and of my late weakness i felt as i listened to the heroic words of this delicatelynurtured girl who had known nothing either of danger privation or hardship until this frightful experience of all three had come to her with the wreck of the ship which was to have conveyed her to her fathers arms yet terrible as her situation was she uttered no word of repining her courage was immeasurably superior to mine her sympathy was all for me there was no apprehension on her own behalf and now at the moment when a new and dreadful trouble had come upon the top of all that we had previously undergone when our brightest hopes were dashed to the ground it was she who found it needful to encourage me instead of i having to comfort and encourage her nor would she permit me to suffer the humiliation of having proved less strong than herself at the first word of apology and selfcondemnation that i uttered she silenced me by laying the whole blame upon the anxiety and fatigue to which i had been of late exposed and when at length she had salved the wound inflicted upon my selfesteem by my recent loss of selfcontrol she set about the task of coaxing me to yield with at least an apparent good grace to the demands of the men seeing that we were completely in their power and could do no otherwisein order that we might secure such full measure of good treatment from them as they might be disposed to accord to us and so convincingly did she argue that despite my reluctance to acknowledge myself conquered i at length gave in being influenced chiefly thereto not by miss onslows arguments but by the galling conviction that in this way only could i hope to save her from the violence with which the scoundrels had almost openly threatened her in the event of my noncompliance this matter settled i went on deck where i found the entire crew congregated about the binnacle awaiting me they watched my approach in silenceand as i thought with illconcealed anxietyuntil i was within two paces of the group when i halted regarding them steadfastly by this time i had completely recovered the command of my temper and my selfpossession and as i noted their anxious looks i began to realise that after all these fellows were by no means so independent of me that they would be likely to wantonly provoke me and i resolved to bring that point well home to them with the view of driving the most advantageous bargain possible well men said i i have considered your proposaland have come to the conclusion that i will accede to itupon certain conditions which i will set forth in due course but first of all i should like to know what you would have done supposing i had not happened to have been a navigator the rest of the men looked at ogorman and he replied oh youd just have had to join us or have gone overboard yes said i and what then how would you have managed without anyone to have navigated the ship for you we should ha had to ha done the best we could replied price nonchalantly to what part of the pacific are you bound asked i to an oiland in latichood began ogorman to an island i interrupted and do you think you would ever have succeeded in finding that island without the assistance of a navigator do you think you would ever have reached the pacific at all by what means would you ascertain your whereabouts and avoid dangers i demanded there was a long silence which price at length broke by replying oh wed ha managed somehow yes said i you would have managed somehowfor a few days or weeks as the case might be at the end of which time you would either have run your ship ashore and lost her or you would have found yourselves hopelessly out of your reckoning with no knowledge of where you were or how to steer in order to reach your destination nobody attempted to reply to this all hands evidently realising the truth of what i had said and pondering upon it at length however when the silence had grown embarrassing ogorman broke it by asking in a much more civil tone than he had yet chosen to adopt with me well misther allowin all this to be thrue what of it nothing except that before propounding the conditions upon which i am willing to agree to your proposal i wished to make it perfectly clear to you all that you can do absolutely nothing without my help said i you have chosen to adopt a very domineering and offensive tone with me under the evident impression that the young lady and myself are completely at your mercy and so we are i willingly admit but not to the extent that you seem to suppose because if you will reflect for a moment you will see that you dare not murder or even illtreat me or the young lady here we are in the south atlantic and not a man among you all possesses knowledge enough to take this brig from where she now floats to a port hence you are as much at my mercy as i am at yours you can do absolutely nothing without me therefore if you require my assistance you must agree to my terms very well sorr answered ogorman lets hear what thim terms are in the first place said i you will all treat the lady with the utmost respect no one presuming to speak to her except in reply to any remark which she may be pleased to make i shant agree to that shouted price aggressively were all goin to be equal here now and if i feel like speakin to the gal i shall speak to her and id like to know wholl stop me oh shut up chips cawnt ye exclaimed one of the other mena cockney if his tongue did not belie him shut up and stow that equality yarn of yours weve all heard that before and i for one dont believe in it its all very well among a lot o sailormen like ourselves but youll never be the equal of the lidyno nor of the gent neithernot if you was to live to be as old as mathusalem so what good would it do you to talk to her why she wouldnt look at an old tarrybreeches like you or me much less talk to us garn you go ahead sir well look awfter chips and keep him in order never fear i hope you will for your own sakes i retorted significantly leaving them to interpret my meaning as they chose my next condition i continued is that the cabin and the staterooms are to be left to the exclusive use of the lady and myself the steward only being allowed access to them my next condition is that no man shall have more than two gills of rum per dayhalf to be served out at midday and the remainder at four bells of the first dogwatch in the event of bad weather or other especial circumstances the allowance may be increased at my discretion and by so much as i may consider necessary and my last condition is that when this business is concluded the lady and i are to be allowed to take the boat with a sufficient stock of provisions and water and to quit the ship within sight of some suitable harbour to be chosen by myself a dead silence followed this bold announcement on my part which was at length broken by ogorman who looking round upon his motley crowd of followers demanded well bhoys youve heard what the gintleman says have anny of ye annything to say agin it yes i have answered the irrepressible price i dont care a ropeyarn whether im allowed to speak to the gal or not but i thinks that ogorman and me seein that were to be the mates of this here hooker ought to berth aft and to take our meals in the cabin and im for havin our rights you will do neither the one nor the other with my consent price i assure you said i and unless my conditions are absolutely complied with i shall decline to help you in any way oh you will eh sneered price youd better not though because i dessay we could soon find a way to bring ye round to our way of thinkin we could stop your grub for instance and starve ye until you was willin to do what was wanted and if that didnt do why theres the stop i exclaimed fiercely i have had enough and more than enough of threats my man and will listen to them no further now understand me all of you i have stated the conditions upon which i will meet your wishes and i will not abate one jot of them agree to them or not as you please you have taken the ship from me and now you may do as you will with her but make no mistake i will only help you of my own free will i would rather kill the young lady and myself with my own hand than submit to compulsion from a crowd of mutineers take your own time to decide i am in no hurry why he defies us exclaimed price turning to his companions what dye say boys shall we give him a lesson shall us show him that were his masters no mate we shant interposed the fellow who had spoken before and if you dont stop your gab about lessons and masters ill see if i cawnt stop it for you what we want mates is to get to that island that ogorman has told us so much about and here is a gent who can take us to it what do we want more do we want to grub in the cabin aint the foksle good enough for us whove lived in foksles all our lives very well then lets agree to the gents terms and have done with it what dye sy it soon appeared that the entire party were willingprice however consenting under protestso i retired to the cabin and drew up the terms in writing together with an acknowledgment on the part of the crew that they had taken the ship from me by force and that i was acting as navigator under compulsion and this the entire party more or less reluctantly signedor affixed their mark tomiss onslow acting as witness to the signatures of the men this done with bitter chagrin and profound misgiving as to the issue of the adventure i gave the order to wear ship and we bore up on a course that pointed the brigs jibboom straight for the fardistant cape of storms chapter nine we sight a strange sail having secured possession of the brig and succeeded in coercing me to become their navigator to some island in the pacific the locality of which they had as yet kept secret upon an errand the nature of which they had not seen fit to divulge to me the crew at once went industriously to work under ogorman to put the vessel all ataunto once more by routing out and sending aloft spare topgallantmasts and yards bending new sails overhauling and making good the rigging and in short repairing all damage of every description and with such goodwill did they work that in ten days from the date of their seizure of the brig everything had been done that it was possible to do and so far as the outward appearance of the craft was concerned there was nothing to show that anything had ever been wrong with her meanwhile during the progress of this renovating process the steward had made it his business to give the lazarette a thorough stocktaking overhaul of the result of which i was kept ignorant but i gathered that the examination was not altogether satisfactory for when it was over and the steward had made his report to ogorman the latter came to me and anxiously demanded to know what our distance then was from the horn this was on the afternoon of the third day after the seizure of the brig and upon carefully measuring off the distance from our position at noon on that day i found that it amounted to three thousand seven hundred and some odd miles the distance seemed to be a staggerer to the fellow and when in reply to a further question i informed him that he might reckon upon the brig taking nearly or quite a month to cover it he made no attempt to conceal his dismay that something was radically wrong at once became apparent for there were long conclaves in the forecastle the object of which presumably was to determine how to meet the emergency i shrewdly suspected that this emergency arose out of the unexpected discovery that the brigs stock of provisions or water or both was insufficient to carry us to our destination and i fervently hoped that my conjecture might prove correct as in that case we should be compelled to touch somewhere to renew our stock and i felt that if in such a case i failed to secure the arrest of the whole party for piracy i should richly deserve to remain their tool exposed to the countless vacillating and dangerous humours of a gang of ruffians who had deliberately thrown off every restraint of law and order but in speculating thus i was reckoning without my hosts i was crediting ogorman and his satellites with scruples that they did not possess i had not yet fully gauged the villainy of which they were capable thus far ever since we had borne up for the horn we had been favoured with a fair wind and plenty of it but on the second day after the occurrence of the above events the wind began to fail us and by sunset that night it had dwindled away until the brig had barely steerageway while the surface of the ocean presented that streaky oily appearance that is usually the precursor of a flat calm meanwhile during the afternoon a sail had hove in sight in the northwestern board steering southeast and when the sun went down in a clear haze of ruddy gold the sails of the stranger reddened by the last beams of the luminary glowed against the clear opal tints of the northwestern sky at a distance of some eight miles broad on our starboard bow the stranger was a barquerigged vessel of some three hundred and fifty tons or so quite an ordinary everydaylooking craft with nothing whatever of an alarming character in her aspect yet she had not long been in sight when it became quite apparent that ogorman and his crew were greatly exercised at her appearance and i was at first disposed to imagine that their emotion arose from the circumstance of their being fully aware that in seizing the brig as they had done they had committed an act of piracy and that they now feared detection and its attendant unpleasant consequences but by sunset i had found occasion to alter my opinion for it had by then become evident that ogorman was manoeuvring not to avoid but to close with the stranger in such a manner as to avoid arousing any suspicion as to his design no sooner did this intention of ogormans become apparent than i began to ask myself what could be his motive for such a course and the only satisfactory reply that i could find to such a question was that he wished to ascertain whether her skipper had any provisions to spare and if so to endeavour to treat with him for their purchasei had by this time seen enough of ogorman to recognise that he was quite acute enough to discern the advantage and safety which such a transaction would afford him over the alternative of being compelled to touch at some port and i had little doubt that my surmise as to his intentions would prove correct at all events his determination to speak the barque was evident and i began to cast about for some means whereby the encounter might be utilised to the advantage of miss onslow and myself there were two or three ways in which we might possibly be benefited by the incident if only i could contrive to establish private communication with the skipper of the stranger in the first place if the barque happened to be britishof which however i had my doubtsi might make her skipper acquainted with all the circumstances relating to the brigs seizure and appeal to him to compel the irishman and his gangby force if necessaryto surrender miss onslow and myself or if that should prove impossible i might perhaps be able to secure miss onslows transfer to the stranger whenher safety having been assuredit would matter comparatively little what happened to myself orin the event of both these schemes failingi might possibly succeed in privately arranging with the skipper to acquaint the authorities with our predicament and request them to take the necessary steps to effect our rescue one or another of these plans i might perhaps succeed in putting into effect provided that the irishman should prove careless and neglectful enough to permit of my communicating with the skipper of the barque but would he be so i very much doubted it yet i could but try and if as i anticipated i should find it impossible to obtain private speech with the skipper of the barque i might still be able to surreptitiously convey to him a letter which would serve my purpose quite as well meditating thus i made my way below to the brigs snug little cabin with the intention of forthwith inditing my epistle and there i found miss onslow seated upon one of the lockers ostensibly engaged in reading but with her beautiful eyes fixed upon the gentlyswaying lamp that hung in the skylight with a dreamy absent look in them that showed her thoughts to be far away do you happen to know whether the steward is in his pantry miss onslow i asked with a glance in the direction of the apartment named as i entered the cabin no he is not there he went on deck nearly an hour ago she replied do you want anything mr conyers nothing more at present than a few minutes privacy and freedom from espionage i answered listen miss onslow i continued i have been engaged for the last two hours in quietly observing the manoeuvres of ogorman and i have come to the conclusion that he intends to close with and speak the barque that has been in sight all the afternoon now such a proceeding may or may not be to our advantage if i can succeed in effecting communication with her skipper it may be possible for us to accomplish one of three things first we may with the assistance of the barques crew be enabled to effect our escape from these people altogether or if that should prove impracticable we may possibly be enabled to secure your transfer to the barque or if that attempt also should fail we surely ought to be able with the help of the barques people to communicate with the authorities ashore and claim from them rescue from our present precarious and exceedingly unpleasant situation yees my companion assented meditatively then after a slight pause she asked have you ever thought of what the end of this adventure is likely to be so far as we two are concerned supposing that we should fail to effect our escape from ogorman and his companions certainly the matter is never absent from my thoughts i answered we are boundupon what i cannot help thinking a fools errandto some island in the pacific upon which ogorman and his party expect to find a certain treasure this treasure they either will or will not find but in either case i anticipate that so far as we are concerned the adventure will end in our being landed somewhere at a sufficient distance from a town to permit of ogorman getting clear away with the brig before we should have time to give the alarm and secure his capture that of course is assuming that you carry out these mens wishes without giving them any trouble commented miss onslow but she continued what do you imagine is likely to be the resultthe effect upon us bothif you cause them trouble and anxiety by endeavouring to escape they have made it perfectly evident to you that they cannot dispense with your services do you really think it worth our while to irritate and provoke them by attempting to escape true they are exceedingly unpleasant people to be brought into such close and constant contact with but there seems to be no great harm in them provided that they are allowed to have their own way ah i exclaimed you evidently do not know of what a ships crew may become capable when once they have committed so serious a crime as piracyfor that is what they have done in taking this brig from me it is not what these men are now but what they may become in the future of which i am thinking especially so far as you are concerned i recognise possibilities in the future that may make this brig the scene of hourly peril to you of a nature that i shudder to think of and it is your safety that i am concerned about that assured i could face the rest with equanimity thank you it is exceedingly good and kind of you to think so much for me and so little for yourself answered my companion she spoke with her face turned away from me so that i was unable to read its expression and her voice had an intonation that i would have given much to have been able to translate was it merely my imaginationi asked myselfor was there really a recurrent shade of her former hauteur of manner mingled with just the faintest suggestion of irony and impatience the fact is that i was at that moment as far from being able to comprehend this lovely but inscrutable woman as when i met her for the first time in the saloon of the city of cawnpore her moods were as changeable as the weather there were occasions when her manner toward me was almost as warm and genial and sympathetic as even a lover could require while there were others when she appeared animated by a set purpose to impress upon me the conviction that our remarkable adventure together invested me with no claim whatever upon her beyond that of the merest ordinary gratitude as for me if i have not already allowed the fact to leak out i may as well here make a clean breast of it and confess that i loved her with all the ardent passion of which a mans heart is capable and i was resolutely determined to win her love in return but up to the moment of which i am now speaking i seemed to have made so little headway that i often doubted whether i had made any at all i had however come at length to recognise that the rebuffs i occasionally met with followed some speech or action of mine of which the young lady did not wholly approve and so i soon found it to be in the present instance she remained silent for perhaps half a minute after speaking the words the recounting of which has extorted from me the above explanation and then continued with much greater cordiality believe me mr conyers i am sincerely grateful to you for your perfectly evident anxiety on my account but i am obliged to confess that i do not regard our situation as nearly so desperate as you seem to do i do not think that either of us will have anything to fear from ogorman and his companions if you will but reconcile yourself to the performance of the task that they have imposed upon you what i do really fear is what may happen if you wilfully exasperate them by making any attempt to thwart their plans by depriving them of your assistance without which i would remind you again they can do nothing help them to carry through their undertakingnever mind whether or not it be a fools errandand i have every confidence that they will treat us with the utmost consideration after their own rough fashion but seriously provoke them and i ask you what are likely to be the consequences to us both of course if you can so contrive it that we can both be rescued by the ship in sight i shall be more delighted than i can say but as to your attempting to get me transferred to her aloneyou will think it strange unaccountable perhaps but i feel so very much more safe here with you to protect me than i should on board the strange ship alone that if you are to remain here i would very much rather remain with you words calculated to send the blood of an ardent lover throbbing through his veins like quicksilver are they not yet they excited not one atom of jubilation in me for they were uttered in a tone of such coldness and indifference that i felt as certain as i could be of anything that it was wholly of herself and not at all of me that the speaker was thinking very well i answered steeling myself to the adoption of an equally cold manner of speech i think i understand your wishes in this matter and will endeavour to carry them out if the strangers yonder can be induced to take us both out of the hands of these ruffians well and good if not i am to take no other steps she bowed acquiescence and turned to her book once more with a manner indicating that the discussion was at an end and i accepting the hint retired at once to my cabin to prepare a letter addressed to the skipper of the stranger to be conveyed to him if opportunity should permit but although i had yielded a seeming acquiescence to miss onslows misguided wish to share my captivityshould it be continuedaboard the brig it must not be supposed that i had any intention of lending myself to so terribly dangerous and mistaken a proceeding it was perfectly clear to me that the highspirited girl had in some unaccountable way completely missed the point of my remarks and utterly failed to comprehend the frightfully precarious and perilous character of her position aboard the brig moreover her mere presence there served ogorman as a lever and a menace powerful enough to constrain me irresistibly to the most abject submission to his will so long as she remained where she was in the power of these ruffians i could do absolutely nothing for fear of what they might inflict upon her by way of revenge but with her removed from their power and placed in safety i might possibly be able to bring every one of the wretches into the grip of the law that they had so audaciously defied and so when i began to pen my letter to the unknown skipper i was carefulafter briefly describing our peculiar situationto appeal to him as powerfully as i could to effect the rescue of the girl by any means at his command regardless of what might become of me having at length finished my letter i folded it up into a suitably small and compact form placed it by itself in one of my pockets in readiness to transfer it at the first favourable opportunity to the individual for whom it was intended and then filling my pipe made my way leisurely up on deck to take a look round and see in what direction matters were trending it was a magnificently fine and brilliant moonlit night with only a few small scattered shreds of light fleecy cloud floating overhead and a soft warm air breathing out from the northeast so gently that it scarcely stirred the oilsmooth surface of the ocean which indeed it only touched here and there in faint evanescent catspaws that barely sufficed to give the brig steerageway with squared yards and every possible inch of canvas spread as for the barque she was now about a point on the starboard bow not more than a mile distant and was evidently not under command as she had swung round head to wind and lay there in the bright moonlight swaying with an almost imperceptible swing over the long low hummocks of glassy swell with her canvas gleaming softly and spectrally under the showering moonbeams all handsogorman includedexcept the man at the wheel were on the forecastlehead intently watching her and talking eagerly together so i had a good opportunity to take a leisurely survey of her and draw my conclusions as to her nationality i went to the companion secured the nightglass and took a good look at her with the result that i concluded her to be of french or italian nationalityrather an awkward and unexpected development for me i having foolishly taken it for granted that she would prove to be british and written my letter in english accordingly and yet perhaps if my surmise should prove to be correct i might be afforded a better opportunity to make an effective appeal for assistance than if the craft were british for i gravely doubted whether ogorman or any of his people spoke french or italian and if that were the case they would probably require me to act as interpreter for them and thus afford me just such an opportunity as i desired on the other hand i could not but feel that an appeal for help made to a french or an italian crew was much less likely to meet with a favourable response than if made to a crew of britons these reflections passed through my mind as i stood peering through the tube at the becalmed barque it did not need a very prolonged scrutiny to enable me to learn all that was possible of her at that distance and presently i replaced the glass in its beckets and proceeded to saunter fore and aft the deck from the wake of the main rigging to the wheel grating smoking meditatively the while by the time that i had smoked my pipe out we had neared the barque to within less than half a mile and i was momentarily expecting to hear ogorman give the order to roundto and lower away the boatwondering meanwhile how on earth i could possibly contrive to get my letter conveyed to the skipperwhen the irishman came shambling aft and placing himself at my side inquired well misther have you finished your shmoke yes i answered curtly why do you ask the question pray because he replied ill have to ask ye to just step down below and stay there for the rest of the night to step down belowand stay there i repeated indignantly what do you mean man surely i am not to be sent to my bunk like a child whether i wish to go or not bedad but ye are thin so make no more bones about it he retorted with quicklyrising anger but my good fellow this is preposterousi began thoroughly exasperated at such treatment and keenly anxious not to lose even the most slender chance of communicating with the strangers but the fellow would permit no argument his quick temper caught fire instantly at the merest suggestion of remonstrance on my part and he cut me short by exclaiming furiously howly sailor phwhats the use av talkin about it yeve got to go below and thats all there is about it will ye go paceably or will i have to call some of the hands aft to make ye go again did i feel that terrible overpowering sensation of murderous anger grip at my heart as it had already done once before in an altercation with this brutal ruffian the blood again mounted to my head like fire and reckless of all consequences i was in the very act of pulling myself together for a spring at his throat when i felt a small handthe touch of which thrilled me even at that momentlaid upon my arm and miss onslows voicepitched in its most seductive tonessaid will you please come with me at onceat oncemr conyers i have something of the utmost importance to say to you with an effort that caused me to turn sick and giddy i mastered the impulse that urged me to strike my enemy dead there and then and mute with the intensity of my feelings permitted my companion to lead me away we descended the companion ladder in silence and upon reaching the cabin miss onslowas upon a former occasionled me to one of the sofalockers upon which she seated herself gently drawing me down beside her then looking anxiously into my face she said mr conyers i could almost find it in my heart to be angry with you whyoh why will you persist in laying yourself open to such insults from that great coarse brute by condescending to argue with him what is the use of doing so surely you must realise by this time that you are quite powerless in the hands of these men and that you cannot control or influence them in any way then why attempt to do it the only result is that you are insulted and at once become positively mad with anger under the influence of which you will some dayunless you are very carefuldo something that you will be exceedingly sorry for for instance what would have happened had i not fortunately chanced to have gone on deck the moment that i heard you and that irish ruffian in conversation you are rightperfectly right i answered and you make me feel very heartily ashamed of myself for my lamentable want of selfcontrolof which i will take especial care that henceforward there shall be no repetition of course i can see clearly enough now how positively suicidal it would have been for me to have yielded to the impulse that animated me at the moment when you so fortunately came upon the scene suicidal for myself and ruinously disastrous for youwhich circumstance will i assure you amply suffice as an effectual check upon me for the future we are but two against sixteen and common sense tells me that with such odds against us violence is out of the question we must depend upon craft and diplomacy to secure our ends oh i am so glad to find you taking a reasonable view of our most unfortunate situation exclaimed my companion her eyes sparkling with pleasure of course she continued i can easily understand how terribly exasperating it must be to youa naval officer who has always hitherto been accustomed to the most implicit obedience on the part of your crewto find yourself defied and insulted by these wretches and i am not at all surprised that under such circumstances you find the provocation all but unendurable but i am sure you are right in believing as you say that we must fight by diplomatic means rather than by a resort to brute force i feel sure that the latter would be a terrible mistake on our part and i will not attempt to deny that on the two occasions when you seemed about to resort to such means i have been most horribly frightened yes i exclaimed with profound contrition i can quite understand that you would be so and i very humbly beg your pardon for having so terrified you i have been contemptibly weak at the very moment when i most needed to be strong but have no further fear you have effectually cured me of my weakness and now you may as well tell me what was the important matter upon which you so urgently desired to speak to me for a moment my companion gazed at me with a most bewitching expression of perplexity in her glorious eyes then her face lighted up with a smile of amusement and she broke into a musical laugh what she exclaimed do you not yet understand i only wanted to say to you what i have just saidor rather i wanted to get you away from that irishman before your impetuous temper had time to precipitate a disaster i see said i well i was interrupted by a sound of hailing that seemed to proceed not from our own forecastle but from some spot a little way ahead of us and i at once concluded that its source must be the strange barque the existence of which i had entirely forgotten in the interest of the discussion between myself and miss onslow i listened for a reply from ogorman but there was none and presently the hailing was repeatedthis time from a much nearer pointand immediately followed by an excited shouting and jabbering in which i believed i could distinguish a word or two of french i sprang to my feet and was about to rush up on deck when miss onslow checked the movement by laying her hand upon my arm and saying please oblige me by staying here if you were to go on deck that wretch would only insult you again so why lay yourself open to such treatment since you can do absolutely nothing you must school yourself to allow those men to have their own way since neither persuasion nor force are of any avail with them true answered i but it is instinctive for a sailorand especially an officerto rush on deck when he hears such an outcry as thatas the shouting and jabbering became momentarily nearer and more excited at that instant ogormans voice shouted an order to stand by immediately followed by a command to the helmsman to hard astarboard and presently there occurred a gentle shockshowing that the brig had collided with something apparently on the rounding of her starboard bowaccompanied by a most outrageous clamour in which sacres and other french expletives plentifully abounded now take a turn anywhere you can and as often as you can shouted ogorman and then follow me and if they offer any resistance knock em down or heave em overboard why good heavens they have run the barque aboard and are taking her i exclaimed astonished and shocked beyond expression as it dawned upon me that the wretches were committing a further act of piracy and i made as though to spring to my feet in an instant miss onslow had seized my hand in hers gripping me so firmly that i could not break away from her without exercising a certain measure of violence and if they are said she can you do anything to prevent it no answered i but i will tell you what i can do if you will suffer me to go on deck i can see whether all hands have boarded the barque and if they have and there appears to be the slightest possibility of our being able to effect our escape i will cut the brig adrift and make off with her do you really think such a feat possible demanded my companion with sparkling eyes i scarcely know answered i if the breeze has freshened at all within the last few minutes it might be done not otherwise because in the latter event they could lower the barques boats and overhaul us in a very few minutes at all events it is quite worth while to ascertain whether there is any chance of success let us go on deck and see exclaimed miss onslow her features at once all aglow with excitement as she sprang to her feet agreed cried i overjoyed to find the young lady so unexpectedly yielding approval to my rather desperate plan i will go on deck first and ascertain the precise state of affairs and if i find that there is a sufficiently fair prospect of success to justify us in the attempt i will call to you through the skylight as soon as i need your help my companion regarded me somewhat doubtfully for a moment and then reseated herself saying very well i think i can trust you now but please be very careful and do not attempt anything unless you feel certain of success meanwhile the uproar that had prevailed for a few minutes prior to and following upon the contact between the two craft had suddenly ceased and as i emerged from the companionway i saw that even supposing there had ever been a prospect of my plan proving successfulwhich there had not the wind having died away to the merest breathingi was now too late for the two vesselstheir hulls prevented from grinding together by several cork fenders hung between themwere so securely lashed together that it would have cost me several minutes hard work to cut them adrift moreover ogorman followed by half a dozen of his gang were just in the act of scrambling inboard again from the stranger the irishman saw me upon the instant of my emerging from the companion and immediately shouted here misther conyers yere just the man we want do you spake frinch yes answered i believing that i saw my opportunity why becase he replied the chaps aboard the barque dont seem to be able to undershtand a worrud we say to thim and bedad were in the same fix with regarrd to thim so we want an interpreter and maybe youll be able to act that same for us very well said i what do you want me to do whoy well take it kindly of ye if youll just be so obligin as to shtep aboard the barque and say what we want ye to say answered the fellow but mind he added warningly dont ye attimpt to say annything else or by the piper itll be the worse for yeand for the young woman down below i can undershtand frinch like a nativeso i shall know everything that you saybut begorra the oirish brogue of me makes it difficult for thim froggies to undershtand me when i shpake to thim all right i answered perfectly easy in my mind you can stand alongside me and hear everything that passes so saying without further ado i leapt upon the brigs bulwarks from thence to those of the barque and so down upon her deck closely followed by ogorman chapter ten we plunder the french barque as my feet touched the barques deck i flung a lightning glance about me to gather as much information as possible not knowing but that at any moment such knowledge might be of priceless value to me the craft was somewhat bigger than i had at first set her down to be being of fully four hundred or maybe four hundred and fifty tons measurement looking forard to the swell of her bows i saw that she must evidently be of a motherly build which accorded well with the fact that she had lost steerageway long before such had been the case with the brig her decks were in a very dirty and untidy condition looking as though they had not been washed down or even swept for at least a week and they were lumbered up with quite an unusual number of spars and booms yet she was evidently a passenger ship for the cabin under her full poop was brilliantly lighted up and through its open door i caught a glimpse of several men and women so attired as to at once proclaim their status on board moreover the quarterdeck was also occupied by a group of men and women evidently passengers with two or three sailorlylooking men among them over whom a party of ogormans people were mounting guard the remainder being stationed on guard over the forescuttle down which i presumed the barques crew had been driven my attention was almost instantly attracted toward the little party on the quarterdeck and especially toward a greyhaired man in uniform whom i imagined might be the skipper i advanced toward the party with a bow and said in french i wish to speak to the captain of this vessel may i ask if he happens to be among you the old gentleman in uniform at once advanced a pace and acknowledging my salute by raising his goldlaced cap answered i am he and i demand to know monsieur by what right you and your crew of ruffians have dared to run aboard me in this outrageous fashion driving my crew below stationing a guard athwart my decks and frightening my passengers very nearly out of their senses are you pirates or what monsieur answered i there is nothing to be gained by attempting to deceive you and i will therefore at once say that i fear you will find that you have fallen into the hands of pirates the big man beside me is their captain while i and a young lady aboard the brig have the misfortune to be their prisoners i shall probably not be afforded an opportunity to explain to you the unfortunate situation of the young lady and myself but as soon as i became aware of the intention of these men to board you i prepared a letter which will explain everythingit is unfortunately written in english but that i am sure will prove no obstacle to you this letter i will presently endeavour to pass unobserved to one of you and if you will kindly act in accordance with the request set forth therein you will very greatly oblige two most unhappy people monsieur said the frenchman i will gladly do anything in my power to help you but as to effecting your rescue he glanced expressively at ogorman and his companions and shrugged his shoulders in a way that very clearly indicated his helplessness here ogorman cut in well what has the ould chap got to say for himsilf he demanded why answered i you heard what he said he wants to know what we mean by boarding his ship in this outrageous fashion and driving his crew below ask him what is the name of his ship where he is from and where bound to ordered the irishman i put the questions and the skipper answered this is the marie renaud of and from marseilles for bourbon with a general cargo i translated turning to ogormanand slightly away from the group of frenchmento do so and while i was speaking a hand touched minewhich i held clenched behind my back with the letter folded small within itwhile a voice murmured in my ear your letter monsieur i opened my fingers and felt the missive gently abstracted thank god for that opportunity thought i fervently as ogorman said ask him if he has plenty of provisions and water aboard i at once saw the villains game he was going to replenish the brigs stores by plundering the barque thus rendering it unnecessary to touch at any port so while translating the question to the french skipper i took it upon myself to very tersely mention my suspicions and to recommend the adoption of any precautionary measures that might suggest themselves the bulk of my stores is stowed in the after hold answered the french skipper but there is about enough in the lazarette to carry us to cape town if they can be persuaded to be satisfied with what is there only we shall come to no great harm you hear said i turning to ogorman again quite certain by this time of his inability to understand a single word of french they are very short of provisions having only sufficient in their lazarette to carry them to cape town is that all demanded the irishman thin be jabers im sorry for thim for theres a good manny miles bechuxt here and cape town and im afraid theyll be mortial hungry before they get there for im goin to help mesilf to everything ateable that the barque carries and so ye may tell the skipperbad cess to him for a mismanagin shpalpeen whoy didnt he lay in stores enough to carry him to the ind of his vyage and ye may tell him too to start all hands to get those stores on deck in a hurry our own lads will have enough to do in lookin afther everybody and seein that none of the frenchies thries to play anny tricks wid us i translated the gist of these remarks to the french captain and at the same time gave him a hint to exhibit a proper amount of righteous indignation over the robbery which he did to perfection wringing his hands rumpling his hair and pacing the deck with the air of a madman while he poured out anathemas enough upon ogorman and his gang to sink the entire party to the nethermost depths of perdition meanwhile the french crew under the supervision of the mateswith price watching the operation to see that a clean sweep was made of the lazarettewent to work to pass the stores on deck and in less than an hour everything that the lazarette had contained was safely transferred to the brig and stowed away while this operation was in progress ogorman made a tour of the various cabins compelling the unfortunate passengers to turn out their trunks before him and appropriating the whole of their cash jewellery weapons and ammunition together with as much of their clothing as happened to take his fancy as he executed his selfimposed task with considerable deliberation those passengers whose turn was still to come had plenty of time to meditate upon their coming despoilment and one of themthe individual who had so kindly relieved me of my lettertook it into his head to do me a good turn withdrawing quietly to his cabin he presently reappeared with a mahogany case to which he unostentatiously directed my attention immediately afterwards laying it carelessly down in a dark corner of the cabin then he came and stood close beside me and murmured in my ear a brace of duellingpistols with a full supply of ammunition monsieur since apparently they must go i would rather that they should fall into monsieurs hands if possible he may perhaps find them useful some time in the future a thousand thanks monsieur returned i in a whisper should we ever meet again i will endeavour to repay your kindness with interest then watching my opportunity i possessed myself of the case of pistols made my way on deck with them andthanks to the bustle of transshipping the storesmanaged to slip on board the brig with it and convey it undetected to my own cabin having done which i spoke a reassuring word or two to miss onslowwho had retired to her own cabinlighted a pipe and sauntered up on deck again with the most careless demeanour imaginable it was long past midnight by the time that ogorman had finished rifling the barque by which time he had secured all the provisions out of the unfortunate crafts lazarette had taken four brass ninepounder guns two dozen stand of muskets the same number of cutlasses and boarding pikes together with a considerable quantity of ammunition had emptied one of the barques watertanks and had robbed them in addition of their two best boatsfine twentyseven feet gigswith their whole equipment then the weather still being stark calm he compelled the frenchmen to hoist out their remaining two boats and to tow the brig clear of and about a mile distant from the barque before that moment arrived however the french skipper contrived to get a hurried word with me monsieur he said the contents of your letter have been communicated to me and permit me to say that you and mademoiselle onslow have the heartiest sympathy and commiseration of myself and my passengers in your most unpleasant situation but monsieur i fear i cannot possibly help you in the way that would doubtless be most acceptable to younamely by receiving you on board my ship the scoundrels who hold you in their power would never permit it and even were it possible for you and mademoiselle to slip aboard unperceived and secrete yourselves your absence would be quickly discovered it would be guessed what had become of you and the pirates would assuredly give chase and recapture you for the barque fine ship though she be certainly is a trifle slow and who knows what vengeance the wretches might wreck upon us for having presumed to abet you in your attempt to escape them you will perceive i am sure that my duty to my passengers forbids my exposing them to such a risk but i shall now call at cape town to replace what those villains have taken from me and you may rest assured that i will not only report the act of piracy that has been perpetrated upon me but i will also make known the unfortunate situation of yourself and mademoiselle so that your countrymen may be enabled to take such steps as they may see fit to effect your rescue this was as much as i could reasonably hope and i thanked the skipper heartily for undertaking even so much as that in the early hours of the morning a gentle little air from the northwardthat gradually strengthened to a nice working breezesprang up and when i went on deck at seven bells the marie renaud was out of sight and we were alone once more on the tumbling waste of waters from that time forward nothing of importance occurred until we arrived in the longitude of the horn our passage of this notorious headland being accomplished in gloriously fine weatherfor a wonderwith half a gale of wind from the eastward blowing over our taffrail to which we showed every rag that we could set upon the hooker the actual passage occurred in the early morningabout six oclock according to our dead reckoningand upon working out the sights that i had secured after breakfast for the determination of the longitude i found that we were thirty miles to the westward of it and far enough south to permit of our shifting our helm for the mysterious island to which we were supposed to be bound accordingly having verified my figures and pricked off the brigs position on the chart i made my way up on deck and informed ogorman of the state of affairs so were actually now in the moighty pacific eh he exclaimed in high elation bedad thats good news annyhow and well cilibrate the occasion by takin an exthry tot o grog all round and dhrinkin shuccess to the vyage but sthop a minute ye want to know where yere to shape a coorse for now by the powers misther ill tell ye that same in a brace of shakes let me go and get the paper out o me chist and ill soon make ye as wise as mesilf the fellow hurried away forard and dived below into the forecastle from which he soon emerged again bearing in his hand an oblong envelope from this he carefully withdrew a paper folded lengthwise and opening it read latichood two fortyeight forty south longitood one hundred and fortyfour ten ten west approach island from norwest and stand towards it with summit of hill bearin southeast halfsouth which leads through the passage in the barrier reef then haul up to south a quarter west for the mouth of the bightand thats enough theres no call to read the rest to ye he concluded abruptly as you please answered i i have no desire whatever to know anything more of the matter than what is absolutely necessary to enable me to navigate the brig to the spot and afterwards to make a civilised port in the shortest possible time i will however have a look at the chart and ascertain the particular island to which those figures of yours refer you might as well bring the chart up on deck and let me see it id loike to see just where were bound to and how long itll take us to git there remarked ogorman i accordingly went below secured the chart together with a pencil a pair of dividers and a parallel ruler and took the whole on deck then spreading the chart open i pricked off the latitude and longitude given by ogorman and to my astonishment found that the spot was located in open water i am very much afraid that your information is faulty ogorman said i pointing to the spot do you see that there is no island shown in your latitude and longitude the nearest land to it is the marquesas group and hiauthe nearest of themis three hundred and sixty miles distant from your spot ogorman stared blankly at the chart for a full minute or more glared suspiciously at me for nearly as long looked at his paper again to assure himself that he had made no mistake and finally rapped out a string of oaths in his consternation then he nipped his profanity short off as a comforting reflection occurred to him ah he exclaimed with a sigh of relief but this oiland as oim talkin about is unbeknownst so av coorse it wont be drawed on the chart thats all right misther you navigate the brig to that place and youll find an oiland there safe enough but supposing that we do not i suggested supposing that your information happens to be incorrect what then ay but it wont be he snarled back itll be correct and well find the oiland where oi told ye and if we dont why bedad itll be the worse for you and the gal for well cruise for it until we find it if we has to cruise until the judgment day like the flyin dutchman all right i said if the island is where you say it is i will find it for you never fear if it is notwell then it will not be found and that is all there is about it oi tell ye it will be found it must be found shouted ogorman goaded to fury at the suggestion that perhaps after all a dire disappointment lay in store for him if the oiland isnt there its somewheres thereabouts widin a few miles more or less and weve got to find it afore the hooker turns her nose towards home now i hopes thats plain enough for ye and smiting the chart a mighty blow with his clenched fist he turned on his heel and walked forward it need scarcely be said that after such a dogmatic statement as this i found my anxiety greatly increased for i by this time knew the irishman well enough to be fully aware that no mule could be more obstinate than he and that having once made up his mind that his island existed he would never abandon his search until he had found itor something that might pass for it and i was determined that should our search prove unsuccessful i would at once bear up for the marquesas and let him take his choice from among the whole group indeed for a moment i felt tempted to shape as straight a course as i could for the centre of the group without troubling to hunt for ogormans particular island at all as i gravely doubted whether it really had an existence outside the mans own imagination but on the other hand his information was drawn from a document that while stained and discoloured with age had every appearancefrom my casual inspection of itof being genuine and if so the island might possibly exist although uncharted moreover ogorman had not seized the brig and become a pirate merely to satisfy an idle curiosity as to the accuracy of the document he had produced he was going there for a certain definite purpose to search for something probably and if so nothing short of our arrival at that particular island would satisfy him so having laid off the course upon the chart i gave it to the helmsman and called the hands aft to trim sail of our passage into the solitudes of the pacific i have nothing to relate save that miss onslows demeanour toward me became if possible more perplexing and tantalising than ever to convey a clear and accurate idea of her varying moods it would be necessary to relate in tolerably minute detail the particulars of our daily intercourse throughout the voyagea course of procedure which would not only expand my story far beyond its proper limits but would also entirely alter its characteri must therefore content myself with merely stating that i believe i may without exaggeration assert that i never found her upon any two occasions to behave in a precisely similar manner she appeared to regulate her treatment of me by the behaviour of the men she had long ago abandoned that almost insolent hauteur of manner that distinguished her at the outset of our acquaintance but if the weather was fine the wind fair the men upon their best behaviouras sometimes happenedin short if things were going well with me in other respects she invariably kept me at armslength by a certain indefinable but none the less unmistakable coolness indifference and distance of manner just sufficiently pronounced to suggest a desire to be left to herself but in proportion as difficulties anxieties and vexations arose so did her manner warm to me until there were times when it became almost caressingly tender so that as my passion for her grew i sometimes felt almost tempted to feign an anxiety or a distress that did not exist for the mere delight of finding her manner warming to me but i take credit to myself that i always resisted the temptation fighting against it as a thing to yield to which would be mean and unmanly on my part in this strange and contradictory condition of alternate peace rendered insipid by miss onslows coolness and anxiety converted into happiness unspeakable by the warmth and tenderness of her sympathy i carried the brig toward the spot indicated in ogormans document and at noon on a certain day my observations showed that we had arrived within sixty miles of it the weather was then brilliantly fine with a gentle breeze out from about westnorthwest that wafted the brig along over the low long mounds of the pacific swell at a rate of about five knots consequently if the island happened to be in the position assigned to it we ought to reach it about midnight ogormans desire to be made acquainted with our exact position daily had been growing ever since we had shifted our helm after rounding the horn beginning as a condition of languid curiosity which had strengthened into a state of feverish restlessness and anxiety that on the day in question as soon as i had conveyed to him the customary information found vent in an order that a man should go aloft and maintain a lookout from the topgallant yard until the island should be sighted the remainder of the crew being set to work during the afternoon to rouse out and bend the cables and to attend to the various other matters incidental to the approach of a vessel to a port he also had the spare spars overhauled and suitable ones selected for the purpose of erecting tents in conjunction with the brigs old sails from all of which i inferred that our stay at the islandshould we happen to find itwould be a somewhat protracted one as to the probability of our finding the place i was exceedingly doubtful for although i was well aware that hitherto unknown islands were still occasionally being discovered in the pacific i was equally well aware that these new islands were almost invariably low and of insignificant dimensions being in fact merely coral reefs that have been gradually lifted above the surface of the ocean whereas ogormans document contained mention of a hill and the presence of a hill argued a probable existence of ages and a consequently corresponding likelihood of comparatively early discovery but at two bells in the second dogwatch that night all doubt was put an end to by a sudden startling cry from the lookout on the foretopgallant yard of land ho right ahead i was on deck at the time and far from expecting to hear such a cry indeed so incredulous was i still that i quite concluded the man had allowed his imagination to run away with him and was mistaking the shoulder of some lowlying cloud for distant land so i hailed him with topgallant yard there are you quite sure that what you see is land and not a hummock of cloud yes sir he shouted back im quite sure of it ive been watchin it growin for the last quarter of a hour or more and it havent changed its shape the least bit all that time only growed the leastest bit bigger and clearer meanwhile ogorman had sprung into the rigging and was by this time clawing his way over the rim of the top another minute and he was on the topgallant yard alongside the other man peering ahead into the fast gathering dusk under the sharp of his hand he stared at it for a good five minutes then shouting down its all right mates its land and no mistake he swung himself on to the backstay and came down on deck by way of it he no sooner reached the deck than he plunged into the forecastle from which he presently emerged again bearing in his hand a packet that i presently recognised as his precious document he came straight aft to me with it and said now misther i want ye to get a bit of paper and write down the directions that oill read out to ye oim all right in deep wather and wid plenty of sayroom to come and go upon but whin it comes to navigatin narrow channels and kapin clear of the rocks and takin a vessel to her anchorage bedad im nowhere so ill be obliged to ask ye to write down the instructions that oive got here and then yell take command of the brig until shes safe at anchor very well i said are the instructions very long two or three dozen words ll cover the lot answered the irishman all right said i fire away and drawing a pencil and paper from my pocket i prepared to copy down whatever he might read to me approach island from norwest began ogorman and stand towards it wid summit of hill bearin southeast halfsouth which leads through the passage in the barrier reef then haul up to south a quarter west for the mouth of the bight at the bottom of the bay stand boldly in until ye come abreast of the big rock at the mouth of the bight when clew up and furl everything follow the bight until ye reach the lagoon when ye may anchor annywhere not closer than a dozen fadoms of the oiland the gemsoh bedad but thats another matther intoirely he hastily concluded the directions seem explicit enough said i and as no mention is made of any dangers to be avoided i suppose there are none all the same we shall need daylight for the job of taking the brig to the berth mentioned so i shall stand on until four bells in the first watch and then heaveto for the remainder of the night at daylight we will fill away again and work round to the norwest side of the island when if the water happens to be clear we shall perhaps be able to see the bottom from aloft and thus safely pilot the vessel to her anchorage i will con her myself from the foretopmast crosstrees at four bellsten oclockthat night the island showed through the clear darkness upon the horizon as an irregularlyshaped pyramid with a peak nearly in the centre of it rising to a height which i estimated at about six or seven hundred feet the island itself was at that time some ten miles distant and measured from end to end as we then looked at it i took it to be about four miles across we hove the brig to and tried a cast first with the hand lead and then with the deepsea lead but got no bottom at which i was by no means surprised as i had already heard that many of the islands in the pacificespecially those of coral formationrise sheer from the very bottom of the sea at daybreak the next morning i was called by the steward and dressing went on deck to find that the weather was as it had been all through the preceding day namely a light breeze from the westward with a cloudless sky of crystalline clearness overhead and a long low sluggish swell undulating athwart the gentlyruffled surface of the ocean the island now bore about four points on our weather quarter some sixteen miles distant so we filled the maintopsail got way upon the ship and hauled up to fullandby when it was found that we should just handsomely fetch clear of the most leeward point of the land viewed by the early daylight the island presented a most attractive appearance rising against the background of sky as a picture painted in an infinite variety of delicate purple tones of shadow through which with the aid of the glass could be made out the several declivities gorges precipices and ravines that went to make up the contour of the country it was thickly wooded everywhere seemingly from the waters edge to within some eighty feet or so of the summit the latter rising naked into the clear air but attractive as it looked under the soft subdued light of the early dawn in the delicate monochrome of distance and the absence of direct sunlight it looked even more beautiful when after sunrise as we approached it more closely the countless subtle variations of tint in the foliage from this in brightest sunlight to that in deepest richest purple shadow became manifest and so powerful an impression did it make upon the men that i overheard them freely discussing the desirability of making a lengthened sojourn there yes said i when ogorman carried away by his enthusiasm at the beauty of the place hinted at such a possibility that is all very well and sounds very attractive just now but has it yet occurred to you that yonder island may be peopled by a race of savages who if we give them the opportunity will gladly make a barbecue of all hands phew begorra but oi nivver thought of that he ejaculated in sudden dismay oim obliged to ye for the hint misther well load the guns and muskets and make ready generally for the blagguards if they have the impidence to be there and forthwith he shambled away forard unceremoniously cutting into the holiday plans that the men were busily concocting and instructing them to load the guns and arm themselves in readiness for any emergency that might arise as we stood in toward the land i kept a bright lookout for smoke for huts peeping from among the trees for canoes hauled up on the beach or any other indications of the presence of human life on the island but could see nothing at this however i was not very greatly surprised for although we were on the lee side of the island the surf was breaking so heavily all along the shore as to render it impracticable for canoes if the island happened to be inhabited the inhabitants would probably be found located on its weather side which according to ogormans document was protected from the surf by a barrier reef with a passage through it as we stood on it became apparent that the island was nearer five than four miles longas i had estimated it to be on the previous nightthat its general trend was from northeast to southwest and that if surveyed and laid down upon the chart it would present a somewhat flat and irregular crescentlike plan the barrier reef sprang from the northeast extremity of the island sweeping seaward on the arc of a circle on its northwestern side and uniting again with the island at its southwestern extremity forming a lagoon of the same length as the island and about threequarters of a mile wide at its widest point the barrier reef in fact constituted a magnificent natural breakwater upon which the surf eternally broke in a loud sullen roar of everlasting thunder while inside it the water was smooth as a mill pond shoaling very gradually from the reef to the shore of the island which consisted of a narrow beach of dazzling white sand bordered by a fringe of thousands of cocoanut palms the long plumelike branches of which swayed gently in the soft warm morning breeze it was on this side of the island i concluded that if anywhere traces of inhabitants would be found and i scanned the shore carefully and anxiously through the ships glass in search of such but nothing of the kind was to be seen and i at length closed the telescope with a clash relieved to believe that whatever anxieties there might be awaiting me in the immediate future trouble with hostile natives was not to be one of them chapter eleven the island standing on as we were going we ratched past the island until it was left a couple of miles astern of us when we tacked ship and brought the land on our lee beam then steering full and by half an hours sailing sufficed to bring the summit of the hill to the required compassbearing of southeast halfsouth whereupon we bore dead away for it and leaving ogorman in charge of the deck i sprang into the fore rigging and mounted to the crosstrees from which commanding elevation i intended to con the brig to her anchorage miss onslow was on deck by this time drinking in with eager flashing eyes the beauty and brilliant colour of the picture presented by the emerald island in its setting of sapphire sea but as i sprang into the rigging i noticed that her gaze followed me and when i swung myself out to clamber over the rim of the topa performance which to the eye of the landsman appears distinctly hazardousshe suddenly clasped her hands upon her breast as though in terror for my safety the action was trifling enough perhaps yet i was disposed to regard it as not quite insignificant since i had often stood by her side as she had watched with evidently no stronger emotion than amusementothers perform the same feat upon reaching my perch i found that we were still in deep water no sign whatever of the bottom being visible through the depths of the exquisitely beautiful clear crystalline blue but ahead at the very fringe of the breakers that were dashing themselves into diamond and pearlwhite spray upon the stubborn rampart of the barrier reef there was a change of colour that told of shoaling depths and a qualm of anxiety swept over me as i pictured to myself what would probably happen if sweeping in before the wind as we were we should plunge into that belt of seething white water and find that there was not depth enough to float us for a few minutes i was full of anxiety but presently as we slid nearer and nearer still to the reef i detected the openinga narrow passage barely wide enough apparently for a boat to traverse but of unbroken water merely flecked here and there with the froth of the boil on either hand we were running as straight for it as though it had been in sight for an hour and as we were following the directions given in ogormans paper this fact seemed to point to an accurate knowledge of the place on the part of the author of those directions which assumption i fervently hoped would be confirmed in every particular as we bore rapidly down upon the reef the passage through it gradually assumed its true proportion of width and i saw that there was ample room to allow of the passage not only of the brig but of a couple of lineofbattle ships abreast the island had the appearance of being simply the topmost ridge of a mountain rising with a tolerably even continuous slope from the bottom of the sea and the barrier reef was merely an excrescence or wall of coral built on to one side of it and founded at a depth of ten fathoms below the surface of the ocean as our lead presently told us the basin thus formed had during the course of ages become partially filled with sand forming a beautifully smooth and even white floor gradually sloping upward toward the surface from the reef to the shore of the island all this was quite plain to me as we drove in through the break in the long sweeping circle of foam and once in still water i was able from my perch to see the sandy bottom as clearly as though it had been bare of water every tiny fish and every fragment of weed that passed within a hundred feet of us being perfectly visible once fairly through the opening in the reef and into the basin we hauled up to south a quarter west which course brought our jibboom pointing to what then had the appearance of the mouth of an insignificant stream but as we slid athwart the basin the opening assumed an appearance of increasingly greater importance until when within half a mile of it i saw that it was really the comparatively narrow entrance of a fairly spacious little bay or loch penetrating for some distance into the land soon afterwards the big rock mentioned in ogormans document separated itself from the background of bush and trees with which it had hitherto been merged and proclaimed itself as an obelisklike monolith of basalt rearing its apex to a height of some ninety feet above the water level when fairly abreast of this the canvas was clewed up and the brig slid into the loch with the way that she had on her this loch or channel wound gradually round for a length of about a cable and then widened into a nearly circular lagoon about half a mile in diameter in the very centre of which stood a small islet thickly overgrown with trees and dense jungle keeping this islet on our starboard beam at a distance of some twenty fathoms we slowly circled round it until it was immediately between us and the outlet to the larger lagoon when we let go our anchor in four fathoms amid the exultant cheers of the men who thus found themselves triumphantly at their destination that we actually had found the identical island referred to in ogormans paper there could be no shadow of doubt since the landmarks mentioned agreed perfectly and my strongest emotion was one of surprise that an island of such dimensions should thus far have escaped the notice of the hydrographers all hands now went to breakfast and when the men again turned to upon the conclusion of their meal their first act was to swarm aloft and unbend the whole of the canvas from the royals downa proceeding which seemed to confirm my previous surmise that they intended their sojourn upon the island to be of some duration this task occupied them the entire morning but when they knocked off at eight bells for dinner the brigs spars and stays were entirely denuded of their canvas the irishman had some little difficulty in persuading his satellites to go to work again after dinner there being a very evident tendency on the part of all hands to take matters easily now after their long spell at sea but he eventually got them out from the shadow of the bulwarks and upon their feet again when the boats were all lowered the entire stock of the brigs sails new and old struck into them the spare booms launched overboard and towed ashore and the remainder of the day was spent in erecting tents upon a small open patch of grass upon the mainlandif i may so call itthat happened to be immediately abreast the brig miss onslow and myself were thus left alone together on board nobody seeming to take either of us into consideration in the making of their arrangements there were arguments both in favour of and against this arrangement for instance our cabins aboard the brig were unpleasantly hot and stuffy in the parallels that we had now reached and i had no doubt that we should have found sleeping ashore in a nice airy tent very much more comfortable but on the other hand if we were to be allowed to occupy the brig we should at least be by ourselves and the risk of nocturnal intrusion would be very much less i was therefore disposed to consider that on the whole matters were more satisfactory as they were yet it went against the grain with me that we should be so completely ignored and our comfort and convenience so completely neglected by a crowd of graceless unmannerly louts and i was casting about for some means whereby i could compel at least a reasonable measure of consideration from them when fortune unexpectedly intervened to help me it happened in this wise after conveying ashore the sails and spars and erecting the tents the men came off to the brig again and took ashore their chests and belongings generally together with an abundant supply of food and a still more abundant supply of liquor with the natural result that a regular drunken orgy occurred that night of such a character as to compel my gratitude that miss onslow was not an occupant of any portion of that camp as it was i deemed it only prudent to maintain a watch until the riot ashore had ceased and the rioters had safely subsided into a drunken slumber but my companion and i had to prepare our evening meal for ourselves that night or we should have gone supperless to our cabins and in like manner we also had to prepare our own breakfast next morning that simple meal was over some considerable time before there was any stir or sign of movement in the camp on shore but at length the cook appeared still apparently in a semidrunken condition and by and by we saw the men sitting down to breakfast they occupied an unconscionably long time over their meal and when it was over most of the party lit their pipes and staggered away back into the sheltering shade of their tents again there were two or three exceptions one of whom was ogorman who after lighting his pipe strolled down to the waters edge with a paper in his hand that looked very much like the paper from which he had quoted the instructions for making the island and which he appeared to be studying most intently with a dubious air that even as i watched him rapidly changed into one of steadilyincreasing perplexity at length with a gesture of savage impatience he folded up the paper slipped it into his breastpocket and went off to the tent from which he presently emerged again followed by two very sickandsorry unwillinglooking members of his gang the trio tumbled into one of the boats shoved off and headed directly for the brig miss onslow was on deck with me but as soon as i saw that the little party intended boarding the brig i directed her attention to their condition and requested her to retire out of sight to her cabin which she did very submissively somewhat to my surprise the distance from the shore to the brig was but short and in a few minutes the boat was alongside and ogorman on deck his two companions electing to spare themselves the fatigue of dragging themselves up the brigs side and stretching themselves out upon the thwarts instead with their caps drawn over their faces in which position they almost immediately fell asleep it was evident from ogormans embarrassed manner as he approached me that he had something to say or some proposition to make without exactly knowing how best to set about it it seemed to me that he had unexpectedly found himself in some way at a serious disadvantage but was anxious above all things to prevent my discovering his predicament then he was civil which i had learned to accept as an unerring indication that he wished to inveigle me into consciously or unconsciously rendering him a service the top o the mornin to ye misther he began i hopes that you and the lady slept well last night in this quiet snug little harbour havin the brig all to yourselves too ay retorted i and having to prepare our own supper last night and our breakfast this morning as for quiet the place is quiet enough it is the drunken blackguards occupying it that make all the row oh yes we slept well enough thank youafter the crowd ashore had guzzled themselves into a state of drunken insensibility begorra thin he exclaimed in affected surprise did the shpalpeens keep ye awake whoy oid have thought youd have heard the sorra a sound out here but its not goin to happen again it was just a bit of a jollification we threated ourselves to upon the strength of foindin the oiland all right but therell be no more of itbarrin maybe a bit of a spree when our works done here and were ready to sail for home again and as to your breakfast bedad oi forgot it intoirely but oill send the shteward off wid ordhers that hes to do nothin but just wait upon ye and the lady and make things comfortable for ye what the mischief does he want me to do for him wondered i it must be something of especial moment or he would never be so extraordinarily civil and obliging but i merely answered thanks it was part of our agreement you will remember that we were to be properly looked after and waited upon and while we are upon the subject there is another matter i should like to mention it is exceedingly close and stuffy below in this climate and i should therefore like to have an awning or something of the kind rigged up abaft here so that i may be able to arrange sleeping places on deck for miss onslow and myself while we are lying here an awning is it exclaimed ogorman with effusion begorra ye shall have that same and welcome as the flowers of spring ay and oill send ye off a topsail to throw over the spankerboom and so make ye two illigant staterooms one on each side the deck it certainly must be some very extraordinary service that he wishes me to render him thought i but i answered very well as soon as the people are sober enough to behave themselves send them off with the canvas and some lashing and i will tell them what i want done oill do that same answered ogorman and now he continued i suppose you and the lady d loike a run ashore wouldnt ye yes certainly i answered but not today we will wait until everybody has had time to get completely sober again i do not choose that the lady should be subjected to the annoyance of encountering and perhaps being insulted by some halfdrunken lout but you will not require all the boats i suppose so you had better send off the smallest one with a pair of oars that we may have the means of going to and from the ship and the shore at our own pleasure and independently of your people this was too much for the fiery temper of the irishman genial and obliging as he had striven to be it had been clearly apparent to me that he was growing increasingly restive under the lengthening list of my demands and now this cool requisition of a boat was the last straw that broke the camels backor in other words exhausted the irishmans slender stock of patience he looked at me with blazing eyes for a moment and then rapped out boat is it thin the divil a boat will i let ye have if ye want a boat go ashore and build one for yoursilf and go to the divil and get your awning and your canvas and your lashings and your cook too begorra for sorra a one of anny of thim will ye get from me i was a fool to promise ye annything but i wanted your help and i thought oid get it by humourin ye but now be jabers oill make ye help me whither ye like it or not and the divil a thing will i do for ye in return what is it you want me to do for you asked i quietly determined to keep my temper whatever might happen and curious to know what service it could possibly be that had caused the fellow to constrain himself so far in the endeavour to conciliate me i want ye to do thisand understand me yell have to do it whither it plaises ye or not he answered theres a spot somewhere on that bit of an oilandindicating the small islet opposite which the brig was mooredthat i want to find whin i first read the paper that speaks of it it seemed the simplest thing in the worruld to come here and put me fut on it but now that oim here and have seen the place by me sowl i cant see or understand how oim to go about it and no more can anny of the rest of us so the long and the short of it is misther that youll have to find the place for us what do your instructions direct you to do demanded i my instructions is it repeated ogorman oh begorra theyre simple enough they sayhere he paused fumbled in his breastpocket and presently produced the dirty greasy slip of paper with the appearance of which i was now becoming familiar and carefully unfolding it read dhraw a loine from one black rock to the other and on this loine project another to the summit of the peak makin an angle of sixtyfoive degrees to the westard dig there andwell the rest has got nothing to do with it um said i musingly i am not surprised to learn that none of you men can understand such directions as those i am not at all sure that i understand them myself at the same time there is hint enough to put me on the right track and now ogorman continued i throwing all the impressiveness i could muster into my manner i want you to listen to me and mark well what i say for i am in downright earnest and no mistake i gather from the whole drift of this adventure that your object in coming here is to hunt for a certain buried treasure the hidingplace of which is indicated on that paper in your hand now i have brought you to this spot and it is exceedingly probable that i may be able to help you to find the treasureif it is still where it was originally hiddenwhile i am absolutely certain that you will never find it without my helpand when all is done i can help you to convey your booty successfully home now understand me i want no reward whatever either in the shape of a share of the treasure or otherwise for affording you this assistance but i tell you plainly that i will have respectful treatment and perfect freedom both for myself and for the lady together with every one of those little comforts and conveniences for which i have asked stop i have not finished yet i continued as i saw that he was about to bluster you have been labouring under the delusion all along that miss onslows presence among us affords you an effective means of coercing me to do certain things for you now it is time that such an impression should be removed i am perfectly willing to help you in any and every way so long as we are both treated with civility and consideration but if you or any one of your men should dare to molest miss onslow in any way or show her the slightest incivility from that moment i will cease to help or do anything whatever for youwhich means that even should you succeed in obtaining the treasure that you are after you will never be able to take it home and enjoy it now think over what i have said and let me know your decision as soon as you have made up your mind but do not you ever again attempt to coerce me by uttering threats of violence to the lady for it will not do my chief stipulation is that she shall be as absolutely secure from insult or injury among you as though she were under the protection of her fathers roof and i mean that she shall be so or i will send the whole lot of you to the devil even if i have to accompany you to defy the whole gang in so uncompromising a manner was undoubtedly a bold game to play but it proved to be the right thing to do for as i stared the irishman unshrinkingly in the eyes i saw his gaze wavering under mine and presently his scowling expression relaxed into a smile as he exclaimed begorra misther conyers yere a brave man intoirely to brazen the thing out in that stoyle one against sixteen of us but its yourself that knows right well that yeve got the pull of us by raison of your eddicashin so i suppose we may as well let ye have your own way and make no more bones about it all we want is your help to find the threasure and get it safely home and if yell give us that ye may have your own way in ivery thing else itll make no real differ to us very well said i you are now speaking like a reasonable and sensible man and it is a bargain between us that i shall afford you the fullest possible assistance to carry out your schemesso far as they may be lawfulupon the terms and conditions which i have stipulated now if you will let me have your paper in order that i may study it as a whole i shall perhaps be able to gather the writers full meaning and thus enable you to find the exact spot of which you are in search meanwhile you had better go ashore again and give your immediate attention to the few little matters that i mentioned just now before you lost your temper the fellow hesitated a moment gazing doubtfully and still somewhat distrustfully at me and then with a sigh handed over the paper to my keeping then without a word he turned away went down over the side into his boat and was forthwith pulled ashore as the boat shoved off from the brigs side i opened the paper and glanced at its contents the complete document read as follows latitude degrees minutes seconds south longitude degrees minutes seconds west approach island from northwest and stand toward it with summit of hill bearing southeast by a half south which leads through the passage in the barrier reef then haul up to south by a quarter west for the mouth of the bight at the bottom of the bay stand boldly in until abreast of the big rock at the mouth of the bight when clew up and furl everything follow the bight until you reach the lagoon when anchor anywhere not closer than within a dozen fathoms of the island the gems are buried in the earth at a spot which may thus be identified draw a line from one black rock to the other and on this line project another to the summit of the peak making an angle of sixtyfive degrees to the westward dig there and the gems will be found at a depth of three feet below the surface i write this that the treasure may not be lost should i die ere i find opportunity to secure it john withicombe the document was written in the calligraphy of an evidently educated man and now that i had it in its complete form in my hands i began to regard the whole matter in a very different light from what i had hitherto done up to now i had been disposed to regard the adventure as one that was more than likely to prove a wildgoose chase but as i noted the evidences of intelligence and education that the document revealed on the part of the writer it suddenly dawned upon me that after all there might be something in it but who was john withicombe and how did he become acquainted with the existence of the treasure did he hide it himself or did he discover its whereabouts by accident and where did the treasure come from i was still puzzling over these questions when i was startled out of my reverie by a light step beside me and turning i beheld miss onslow regarding me with eyes so brilliant that i could almost fancy they were gemmed with tears so she exclaimed playfully you have been fighting another wordy battle with that irish wretch and this time having kept your temper under control you have emerged victorious from the conflict but oh mr conyers she continued her voice suddenly changing to a tone of deep earnestness i cannot express to you how profoundly sorry i am that you should thus continually be harassed and worried on my account oh yes i heard everything i was in the cabin and the skylight was open so i could not help hearing what passed i know that these men are taking advantage of my presence to coerce and terrorise you by means of threats of violence toward me and i cannot help feeling how dreadfully you are hampered and embarrassed by having me to look after and protect but you have never wavered or faltered for one instant you have forgotten all about yourself and have thought wholly and only of me andandi think it only right you should know how greatly i appreciate your goodness andhowhowgrateful i am for all that you have done and are still doing for me there undoubtedly were tears in her eyes as she concluded but a certain wild delirious hope that had half formed itself as i noted the enthusiasm with which she had begun her speech died out again as she faltered and hesitated and finally concluded in as sober impassive conventional a tone as though she had been thanking me for procuring a cab for her on a rainy night i hastened to assure her that she was quite mistaken in supposing that her presence aboard the brig was an embarrassment to me that on the contrary it was the only pleasant feature of the whole adventure so far as i was concerned and then fearing lest her gracious mood should tempt me to say more than she would be willing to listen to i hastily turned the conversation toward ogormans document which i placed in her hands asking her to read it and tell me what she thought of it she read it carefully through once and then handed it back to me with the remark i think it is perfectly genuineeverything appears to point in that directionand i have no doubt whatever that the gems will be found in the spot indicated i am now inclined to that opinion myself said i but how is the spot indicated to be found the writer you will observe mentions two black rocks but he furnishes no clue whatever as to their whereabouts where are we to look for these rocks and how are we to identify them that particular passage answered she is i admit decidedly obscure yet i think the context furnishes a clue to its elucidation it reads thusanchor anywhere not closer than within a dozen fathoms of the islandwhich i take to mean this small island or islet opposite us the island was evidently the most prominent object in the writers mind when he penned the words immediately following those that i have just quoted and i therefore conclude that it is somewhere in that small islanda most suitable hidingplace i think you will admitthat the treasure lies concealed and it is there also i think that the two black rocks should be searched for as to how the rocks are to be identified the writer speaks of them in such a manner as to suggest that there is no possibility of mistaking them and i therefore infer that there are two rocksand two onlythat can possibly be associated with the instructions given in the paper yes said i i quite see your line of reasoning and i believe you are right at all events the suggestion is so reasonable that it is quite worth following and it is upon those lines that i shall advise ogorman to go to work ah by jove look there i believe the fellow actually means to stick to his bargain at last here come the men with the sails and so on that i have asked for and tonight i hope you will be able to rest in comparative coolness out here on deck with an awning and all other proper shelter from the dew the boat with half a dozen hands in her was soon alongside and by midday we had not only an awning spread over the whole of the afterdeck from the taffrail to the mainmast but also a spacious canvas sleepingtent under it divided into two compartments and so arranged that my companion might enjoy the most absolute privacy the steward also came off and resumed possession of his usual quarters and as he was one of the quietest and most respectable men of the party was as good a cook as the doctor himself and seemed genuinely anxious to do his best for us it soon appeared as though we were about to be favoured with a spell of peace and quietness meanwhile ogorman religiously refrained from obtruding himself upon us until i had dismissed the boats crew upon the completion of their labours when he came aboard ostensibly to ascertain whether everything had been done to my satisfaction but actuallyas i soon discoveredto claim the assistance that i had undertaken to afford him and this of course i was more than ready to give now that i had obtained from him what i wanted being feverishly anxious to bring the entire adventure to a conclusion as speedily as possible in order that i might be free to convey miss onslow in all safety and honour to her fathers arms so i threw myself heartily into the spirit of the search accompanying ogorman and a searchparty to the islet and actively participating in a hunt for the two black rocks but after persevering for more than three hours it became evident that the little spot was so completely overgrown with tangled impenetrable jungle that but one course was open to us that of clearing the ground by cutting down and destroying the network of creepers that choked up the spaces between the treetrunks this proved to be a lengthy and arduous undertaking it being necessary to cut the undergrowth away in blocks as it were and then drag the detached masses to the waters edge and tumble them overboard but after four days of this work at the end of which there was very little result to show for our labour we found evidences of the islet having at some previous period been cleared by means of fire the workers having encountered several charred and blackened treestumps so we determined to adopt a similar course the vegetation being dry and in excellent condition for such an experiment accordingly the undergrowth was attacked with knives and axes on the weather side of the island and the detached masses instead of being hove overboard were allowed to remain and thoroughly dry in the sun then when our accumulation of dry brushwood seemed sufficient for our purpose it was set alight and in half an hour the entire island was a blazing mass there being just wind enough to fan the flames and cause them to spread in two hours the operation was complete the once verdant and beautiful spot having been converted into an ugly patch of flat and fireblackened soil some fifty acres in extent with two conspicuous outcrops of black rock protruding from the ashes and debris of the conflagration there was very little doubt in my mind that the two outcrops of rock rendered visible by the destruction of the vegetation upon the islet were those referred to by john withicombe and i said as much to ogorman whose impatience to test the truth of my conviction was such that he would have had me go to work with my rods and sextant that same afternoon but when we attempted to land upon the islet we found that although the ashes were black on the surface they were still a dull glowing red in the heart of them and so hot that they were not yet to be stood upon leaving out of the question the veil of acrid suffocating blue smoke that still wreathed and curled from out them our enforced detention however was by no means wasted time for now that the surface of the island was bare and i could see what i had to work upon i could also see that several long slender rangingpoles would be necessary and the obtaining and preparation of these kept all hands busy for the remainder of that day and immediately after breakfast next morning i got out my sextant and all hands of us landing upon the islet we went to work with a will first of all i made my way to one of the masses of rock and climbed up on it both masses had welldefined peaks and i came to the conclusion that the instruction to draw a line from one black rock to the other would mean that a straight line must be drawn or ranged from one of these welldefined peaks to the other so i temporarily removed the telescope from my sextant and levelling it upon the extreme peak or highest point of the rock i occupied brought it to bear upon the corresponding peak of the other rock then i sent a man along with instructions to start from the other rock and walk toward me halting whenever i raised my hand and sticking a rod perpendicularly in the ground i met with a great deal more difficulty than i had anticipated in securing the satisfactory execution of this apparently simple operation but by keeping the telescope levelled from the one peak and bearing upon the other and making the man hold the rods truly vertical i at length succeeded in ranging out a perfectly straight line from the one rock to the other then setting the limb of my sextant to an angle of sixtyfive degrees and stationing myself at certain points in the linewhich i was easily able to do by means of the rodsi at length found the exact point required which i marked by driving a stake into the ground there said i to ogorman is your pointif my interpretation of the instructions given in your paper is the correct one and at a depth of a yard or thereabouts below the surface you ought to find your treasure if you do not find it at this precise spot i would recommend you to try a little to right and left in line with the poles that as you see i have left standing chapter twelve finding the treasure ogorman and his entire train of satellites being now upon the islet ready to dig until they had reached the buried treasure i thought the opportunity a good one to afford miss onslow a run ashore so taking possession of the boat that ogorman had graciously intimated i might usethe same craft that had done us such good service ere we fell in with the governor smeatoni paddled alongside the brig and suggested to the young lady that we should devote the remainder of the day to an exploration of the island proper to this my companion acceded with alacrity and evident delight so packing a small basket with everything required for a substantial luncheon i stepped the boats mast set her canvas and we got under way working out through the loch into the big lagoon formed by the barrier reef and then coasting alongshore until we reached a promisinglooking landingplace here we ran the boat up on the beach secured her and stepping ashore decided to lunch before proceeding farther since it was by this time drawing well on toward midday then having made a hearty meal we plunged into the jungle with the idea of reaching the summit of the hill if we could hit upon a practicable path viewed from the sea the island had the appearance of being as completely and thickly overgrown with jungle as had been the islet where ogorman and his gang were hunting for treasure but upon entering the forest we found that it was not so and that by keeping our eyes about us we might manage with very little difficulty to work our way through the comparatively open spaces that occurred at frequent intervals and we had not proceeded very far when we were fortunate enough to fall athwart a tiny stream with just the merest trickle of water in it now but which was evidently in the rainy season a roaring raging torrent the bed of this stream was full of small boulders that served very well as steppingstones and as we knew we could not go astray if we followed the course of the stream and as we knew moreover that by so doing we should be constantly rising and as further we should thus avoid being impeded by the necessity to wind our way through the jungle we decided to adopt this course with the happy result that in about an hours time we found ourselves close to the summit and above the line of vegetation there still remained about a hundred feet of climbing to be done however ere we could attain the summit and this climbing had to be accomplished on a slope of some sixty degrees composed of fine loose scoria that gave way and slid downward as soon as stepped upon i did not like to be beaten however but soon found that without poles to assist us we should never make any progress so we contented ourselves with a walk round the peak which i now felt convinced was the crater of a quiescent if not extinct volcanoand a leisurely survey of the magnificent panorama that lay spread out beneath us by the simple process of walking round the peak we obtained a view of the entire island with its lagoon and barrier reef and so clear and pure was the atmosphere that we could not only see but also identify every member of the workingparty they were still digging vigorously but even as we watched them there arose a sudden commotion and an excited rushing together among them and a second or two later the sound of their voices reached us but although it was perfectly evident that the speakers were powerfully excited we were too far distant from them to distinguish what was said and presently work was resumed for about ten minutes at the expiration of which several men leaped down into the excavation and a minute or two later we saw a not very bulky object lifted out of the hole and laid on the surface of the ground amid the frantic cheers of the entire party the treasure i exclaimed they have found it by jove and they have not been very long about it either well i am sincerely glad and thankful for now we may hope soon to be homewardbound or at least bound to some spot from which it will be possible for us to secure passage to calcutta i spoke with some enthusiasm but my companion did not respond she remained silent gazing dreamily into the far distance and when i looked at her awaiting some answering remark i saw that she was quite pale that she was biting her underlip in a fruitless endeavour to stay its quivering and that there were undoubtedly tears in her eyes she averted her face quickly but i was confident that i was not mistaken as to those indications of emotion presently she spoke i am glad said she that you find cause for rejoicing in the discovery that those wretches appear to have just made and at first sight it would almost seem as though your troubles should now be nearly over but i cannot forget that those men have been guilty of two very serious offencesfirst in seizing the brig from you and compelling you to navigate her to this lonely spot and next in their act of piracy in connection with the marie renaud and i fearoh i fear terribly that by and by when we are nearing the end of our journey they will take some desperate step to effectually prevent your ever bearing witness against them have you ever thought of that as a possible danger to which you may be exposed well yes said i i must confess that such a contingency has suggested itself to me but they will require my help to get their booty home and landed and i will make it my business to discuss this matter with ogorman in such a manner as to convince him that he cannot do without me and meanwhile i must see if i cannot forestall any possible action on their part by devising some plan which will enable us to effect our escape in one of the boats when within easy distance of land do you think such a thing possible she demanded in much more animated tones than those she had shortly before used why yes answered i that is to say we must make it possible we must endeavour to devise some definite scheme to be carried out at the very first favourable opportunity and we must then devote all our energies to so arranging matters that when the moment arrives everything will be in readiness we discussed this topic at some length with no very definite result however and finally as it appeared to be exercising a distinctly depressing effect upon miss onslows spirits i changed the subject and we made our way down to the boat again and so aboard the brig but as we entered the inner lagoon we found that all hands had knocked off work and had crossed to their camp and presently ogorman made his appearance at the entrance of one of the tents beckoning us to approach i waved my hand in assent but made as though to put miss onslow aboard the brig first whereupon ogorman hailed that he wanted us both to land and look at what had been found so i put a bold face upon it and ran the boat in upon the beach from which we walked together up to ogormans tent as we entered the first thing that met my gaze was a rusty and earthgrimed iron chest measuring about two feet square by perhaps sixteen inches deep on either side of which sat a man with a brace of cocked pistols in his belt evidently on guard the chest had been fastened by two heavy padlocks of distinctly antiquated design but these had both been smashed and the lid prised open not without inflicting some damage to the hinges i noticed almost at once that ogorman and his companions wore a decidedly perplexed and slightly chagrined air and the reason therefor soon became apparent so said i in a congratulatory tone you soon found your treasure then i hope it proves to be worth all the trouble you have taken to secure it begorra thin its mesilf thatd be glad to be able to say yis to that answered the irishman but im puzzled i cant make it out he continued this is what weve foundgiving the chest a kick that betrayed a certain amount of temperbut beyant a gallon or so of pearls theres nothin in it but pebbles and id like ye to say whether you think them pebbles is worth annything or not so saying ogorman raised the heavy lid of the chest disclosing an interior subdivided into four compartments by thin hardwood partitions running diagonally from corner to corner one compartment was packed as full as it would hold of pearls nearly all of whichif one might judge by the top layerwere of very fair size while a few scattered here and there were exceptionally fine and their exquisite satiny sheen seemed to indicate that they were all of the first water miss onslow could not suppress a cry of admiration and delight as she gazed upon themwhich tribute to their beautyand consequent valueseemed to afford considerable satisfaction to the finders may i touch them asked i of ogorman oh yes he answered i suppose theres no harm in yr touchin em if ye wants to i plunged my hand down into the heart of the compartment turning over the pearls and bringing others to the surface and it appeared that they were all of pretty much the same quality and value why said i here is a respectable fortune for each of you in these pearls alone even if the pebbles turn out to be valueless which is scarcely likely to be the case or they would not have been so carefully stowed away in this chest now these for example i continued turning to a contiguous compartment more than half full of crystals that looked like splintered fragments of rather dull glass are uncut diamonds yes as i felt two or three of them between my finger and thumb there is no doubt about it they have the true soapy feel they are diamonds and taken in bulk of very great value and here again as i turned to the next compartment about as full as that containing the diamonds these are rubies unless i am very greatly mistaken while as to these turning to the last compartment they are emeraldsand there are some beauties among them too apparently as i fished up one or two remarkably fine ones why ogorman i exclaimed you are rich menevery mothers son of youthere are sixteen handsome fortunes in this chest fortunes big enough to set you all up as gentry or to ruin you in doublequick time according to the use that you make of your wealth begorra sorr thats the plisintest thing i iver heard ye say exclaimed the irishman in high glee at my verdict as to the value of the pebbles while the beaming countenances of the twain on guard betrayed that their delight was fully as great as that of their leader there were further sounds of revelry ashore that night intermingled more than once with other sounds suggestive of altercation and quarrel and just at sunrise while i was taking a matutinal swim round the ship i saw all hands march out in somewhat formal order along the glade upon which their camp was pitched and disappear across the sandspit that formed one side of the loch entrance ten minutes later while i was towelling myself on the fore deck in the seclusion afforded by the position of the galley i was startled by what sounded like a distant volley of pistolshots and about half an hour afterwards i saw the crowd returning to camp by the way that they had gone as i watched them shambling along over the somewhat uneven ground i was struck by something rather unusual in their appearance and presently i discovered what it was there seemed to be not quite so many of them by the time that i had slipped into my clothes the party had arrived pretty nearly abreast of the brig and were close enough to enable me not only to count but to identify them they were now only fourteen in number and the two absent ones were the men whom i had seen guarding the treasure on the previous night somehow the absence of these two men instantly became associated in my mind with the volley of pistolshots that i had heard while overboard and i began to wonder gloomily whether the unearthed treasure had already brought a tragedy in its train i was full of this idea as i sat down to breakfast but as miss onslow did not make any remark or inquiry concerning the pistol volley i concluded that she had not heard it and was careful to say nothing whatever to her about my suspicions ogorman and his companions remained in the seclusion of their tents all the morning not one of them excepting the cook showing themselves until after dinner then the irishman and two hands appeared and presently they jumped into a boat and headed for the brig i went to the gangway to receive themso that we might be out of earshot of miss onslow who was sitting in the afterend of her sleepingtent reading and even before the boat got alongside i could see by the sober faces of those in her that something serious was the matter ogorman boarded the brig alone leaving his two companions in the boat alongside i led him forard and not until we had reached the fore deck did either of us open our mouths then the irishman turning to me with a very serious face said misther conyers we want yr help again son very well said i i shall be pleased to help you in any way possible what is it that you wish me to do we wish ye to divide up the threasure aiqually into fourteen parts and to give to aich man his own share so that he may take care of it for himself as things are now wid all the gims lumped together in the iron chist the timptation and the opporchunity to shteal is too great and weve already lost two of our number through it lost two of your number good heavens ogorman what do you mean i demanded my thoughts instantly reverting to the suspicious proceedings of the morning why explained ogorman its loike this ye see whin we dug up that chist yesterday and got it over here we could none of us be satisfied until wed broke it open and found out what it contained then as we couldnt fasten it up again we decided to mount guard over it two men at a time so that nobody should rob the others by sneakin away and helpin himself unbeknownst but whin the first two guards was relieved last night the cook took it into his head that they ought to be searched and whin this was done by the powers we found that aich of em had helped himself to a handful of the stones and had em stowed away in their pockets we thried em there and thin found em guilty and sintenced em to be shot which was done this morning so i exclaimed in horror this is the first result of your socalled good fortune is it a theft and two of your number slain man do you know that the fourteen of you have committed murder murder is it sorra a bit exclaimed the irishman indignantly we thried the two of em and found em guilty all in regular proper ordher but said i you have no authority or legal right to try men sentence them to death and execute them whatever you may consider it you will find that the law will regard it as wilful murder the law ejaculated ogorman with a contemptuous sniff oh begorra well take our chance of that but we dont want any more executions misther conyers so will ye help us to make a fair division of our prize that aich man may have his own and not be tempted to shteal from another are you making this request on your own account or on behalf of the rest as well demanded i perhaps the others may be unwilling to trust to my fairness oh but they will answered ogorman the proposal was mine but iverybody agreed to it very well then said i i am willing to undertake the job and will do my best to make the division an equitable one so saying i went aft and explained to miss onslow that i was going ashore for an hour or two with ogorman to afford him the benefit of my advice in a certain matter dived below to my cabin for some sheets of writingpaper which i rolled up and put in my pocket and then returning to the deck descended the side and entered the boat on reaching the shore ogorman led me at once to the largest tent where i found the entire remainder of the party seated in a circle on the ground with the chest of treasuretrove in the centre they had evidently so little faith in each other that each had deemed it necessary to individually watch the chest in his own interest the incident would have been amusing but for the terrible element of tragedy that had been imparted to it by the proceedings of the morning my first act on entering the tent was to provide from my little stock of writingpaper fourteen pieces of exactly equal size and shape which i numbered from one to fourteen afterwards folding the pieces identically so that the numbers written upon them were concealed and it became impossible to distinguish one piece from another these papers i put on the ground in one of the mens caps mixing and shuffling them all together and next i called for a square of canvas they brought me a boats lug sail which i caused to be spread flat and smooth upon the ground and then i had the chest lifted on to the middle of the sail seating myself beside it then starting with the pearls i picked out fourteen of practically equal value and laid them singly and well apart on the canvas before me explaining my intentions as i did so then to these i similarly added fourteen more and so on until each heap contained the same number of pearls and was as nearly as i could judge of the same value there were five pearls left over and these i reserved as possible makeweights so to speak in the further division of the gems then i proceeded with the diamonds in the same way following on with the rubies and finishing off with the emeralds until the entire treasure was subdivided into fourteen parts of practically equal value this done i inquired whether they were all of opinion that the division had been evenly made and upon receiving a reply to the effect that they supposed so i gave the tickets in the sailors cap a vigorous final shaking up and then passed the cap round in succession requesting each man to take one paper then when all had been drawn i requested them to open their papers and look at the numbers written thereon and finally the man who held number one was allowed first choice from the fourteen heaps number two the second choice and so on until only one heap was left which fell to the man holding ticket number fourteen it was interesting to note the difference in the behaviour of the men in choosing their heaps some hung fire and seemed quite unable to make up their minds for as much as ten minutes or a quarter of an hourand they would probably have been longer but for the impatient remonstrances of their fellowswhile others simply laid their caps alongside the nearest heap and swept the latter into the former with as little emotion as though they had been purchasing a pennorth of gooseberries at a streetbarrow this process of subdivision of the treasure had run away with a considerable amount of time with the result that when i returned to the brig the usual hour of supperas the evening meal is generally termed at seawas long past and what was of far greater consequence i found that during my prolonged absence miss onslow had worked herself into a perfect fever of apprehension as to my safety which was not at all surprising when one came to reflect upon what her situation would have beenalone among all those ruffianshad anything perchance happened to me but she quickly recovered her spirits when i informed her as to how i had been occupied and it was a great relief to me to discover as i did in the course of the evening by means of sundry subtle questions and remarks that the poor girl entertained no suspicion whatever of the mornings tragedy such being the case i resolved to keep the news from her as long as possible and with a view thereto i strenuously impressed upon the steward that he was not under any circumstances whatever to make the most distant reference to it during the fortnight that now ensued the weather remaining gloriously fine i took miss onslow away in the boat daily and together we explored the island until we had become perfectly acquainted with every inch of it and knew exactly where to find its many beautyspots on the first two or three days of these excursions we frequently encountered members of ogormans gang wandering about the island in a more or less apparently aimless fashionmost of them carrying canvas bundles in their hands which they invariably endeavoured unsuccessfully to conceal from our view at first i was at a loss to understand what all this meant but on the third day it happened that on emerging from a junglepath that we had made for ourselves we came upon a kneeling man busily engaged in digging a hole with a stick at the foot of a tree so intent was he upon his occupation that he did not hear us until we were close upon him and then he sprang to his feet and faced us with an expression of mingled consternation and defiance that changed to one of confusion as he recognised us it was the young cockney whom i have already had occasion to mention once or twice and he had gradually impressed me as being about the most harmless and wellmeaning of the whole gang hillo harry i exclaimed what are you after seeking for more treasure why no sir answered he fingering the peak of his cap as he met miss onslows gaze he hesitated a few seconds considering and then proceeded the fact is mr conyers i was thinkin of hidin my little whack well said i in that case i am exceedingly sorry that we disturbed you for now i fear that you will have to hunt for another hidingplace what for sir demanded he why because this lady and i have discovered your secret dont you see oh that be blowed exclaimed the young fellow that dont make no matter i aint afraid of you or the lidy stealin the stuff i wasnt hidin it from either of you no queried i from whom then were you hiding it why from the rest of em of course were all hidin our stuff from one another we dont tell each other so but were doin it all the same i see said i you are unable to trust each other well that is a pity one would have thought that there was not a man among you who would not have felt abundantly satisfied with what he has secured maybe we are but maybe we aint answered the fellow anyhow when i sees the rest all distrustin one another i thinks its time for me to distrust them so i spent all day yesterday huntin for a good spot and comed along this way and thought i couldnt do better than stow the stuff at the foot of this big tree well said i if i were you i should choose some other place how are you to know that one of the men you distrust is not even now watching youand guessing your occupationfrom some place of concealment among the bushes choose a spot that you can easily find again somewhere in the heart of the bush and bury it there where nobody can see what you are about thankee sir i will i think i know a good place not far off said the fellow and therewith giving a seascrape with his foot he turned away and left us as for us we resumed our walk and were very careful not to turn round or otherwise behave in such a manner as to lead the man to suppose we desired to watch him during the period to which i am now referring ogorman and his men did no work whatever butafter each had succeeded in satisfactorily concealing his own share of treasurespent their time in strolling aimlesslysometimes alone and sometimes in parties of two or three togetherabout the island hunting for fruit or climbing the cocoanut trees to get at the nuts theni think it was about the sixteenth day after the unearthing of the treasurewithout any previous warning or notice whatever to mei saw them striking tents ashore immediately after breakfast and by noon everything had been brought off to the brig again and the men had once more taken up their quarters in her forecastle the remainder of that day was devoted to the task of rebending the canvas but it was not until noon of the next day that the brig was again in a condition to go to sea that afternoon and the greater part of the following day was devoted to the task of replenishing the brigs stock of fresh water collecting an abundant supply of fruit andpresumablyrecovering possession of their hidden treasure and after breakfast next morning the crew went leisurely to work to get under way it took us until noon to work our way out to sea and as soon as we were fairly clear of the barrier reef everybody went to dinner chapter thirteen i learn some disturbing news the weather had been fine with moderate breezes from about westnorthwest during the entire period of our sojourn at the island and we left it under like conditions our course for the horn was a southeasterly one which brought the wind nicely over the starboard quarter and the breeze was of just the right strength to enable us to show the whole of our starboard flight of studdingsails to it and to handsomely reel off our eleven knots per hour by the log under these circumstances we were not long in running the island out of sight and with its disappearance below the horizon i hoped that my troubles except of course such as might arise from bad weatherwere at an end as for the men their sojourn on the island had done them good they were in splendid health andas might be expected of men in their condition who had so easily become wealthyin high spirits they seemed anxious to get home and were one and all upon their best behaviour being apparently desirous of conciliating me to the utmost possible extent now that their own ends had been served but although i deemed it sound diplomacy to allow them to believe that their endeavours in this direction were meeting with perfect success i could not forget that in the prosecution of their own selfish plans they had shown themselves to be callously criminal and utterly indifferent to all the hardship and suffering mental and bodily that they were inflicting upon a young delicatelynurtured sensitive womanto say nothing of what they had caused me to endure and i determined that if it lay in my power to scheme out such a result they should one and all pay the penalty of their crimes the apparently favourable condition of affairs to which i have just referred continued for fully a week after our departure from the island and then i received a rude awakening it happened thus the weather was still gloriously fine but the wind had drawn more out from the southward until it was square upon our starboard beam which with a decided increase in its strength had caused us to take in all our studdingsails except the foretopmast the boom of which was braced well forward it was close upon sunset and harry the cockney was at the wheel the sky away to the westward about the setting sun wore a decidedly smoky windy look with a corresponding wildness and hardness and glare of colour that seemed to threaten a blusterous night so much so indeed that pausing in my solitary perambulation of the deck i halted near the binnacle to study it as i did so the helmsman with his eye on the weather leach of the maintopgallantsail said dont look at me or take any notice of me sir because i dont want them skowbanks forard to see me atalkin to you but ive got somethin very particlar as i should like to sy if i can only find a chaunce well fire away then my lad said i no time like the present i am looking to see whether we are going to have a breeze tonight the fellow remained silent for a full minute chewing vigorously at the plug of tobacco in his cheek and then said still gazing intently aloft the long and the short of its this sir them two swines ogorman and price have been syin that after that business with the french barque and the shootin of karl and fritz it wont never do to let you and the young lidy ever get ashore again so miss onslows foreboding had come true then we knew too much and were no doubt to be sacrificed in cold blood to ensure the safety of this piratical gang but forewarned is forearmed moreover there was this man harry clearly disposed to be friendly to us or why should he take the risk of acquainting me with this terrible news as i realised all the fresh anxiety and watchfulness that this information would entail upon me i faltered for a moment under a feeling of overwhelming despair but it was gone instantly and within the next second or two i had pulled myself together the fighting instinct had leapt up alert and eager and i was once more ready to do battle against the whole ruffianly mob of them for the life and honour of the girl that i now loved beyond any other earthly thing and what do the men say to it i asked stepping up on the grating and hands in pocket balancing myself jauntily to the heave and roll of the plunging hull as i continued to gaze contemplatively at the windy sky away on our starboard quarter why answered harry its no use denyin that theyre all of the same mind as tother two they sys that you knows enough to hang all hands of us and that youd be certain sure to do it too if we was only to give yer half a chaunce and what is your opinion upon the matter my man demanded i well said he i thinks as prhaps theyre right so far as that goes but i dont hold with murder and i said as i thought we might be able to plan out a way of makin ourselves safe without doin no hurt to you and the young lidy but they wouldnt listen to me theyre all for makin theirselves safe as they calls it and what is their scheme asked i why accordin to their present way of thinking they intends to ast you to make the brazilian coast somewheres about twenty mile or so from some big port and theyre goin to tell you as when weve made the land the brig is to be scuttled and all handsyou and the lidy includedis to take to the boats and land givin ourselves out to be a shipwrecked crew but at the last minute when all is ready for leaving you and the lidy is to be seized lashed hand and foot and locked up below to go down with the brig a very pretty diabolical coldblooded scheme commented i and one that would have been very likely to prove successful had you not warned me i am infinitely obliged to you my man and you may rest assured that i will not forget the good turn you have done me in making me acquainted with the plan i shall endeavour to frustrate it of course may i depend upon you to help me why as to that sir answered the fellow everythingll depend upon what you makes up your mind to do i wont have nothin to do wi murderin of you thats certain but on tother hand i dont mean to mix myself up with no job that means havin my throat cut if the thing dont happen to turn out all right just so said i i see your position exactly i will think the matter over and see if i cannot devise some practicable scheme to get to windward of those scoundrels and will then have another talk with you meanwhile kindly keep your ears open appear to fall in with the plans of the others and let me know if any alterations are madeyou will find it greatly to your advantage to do so thankee sir i will answered the man as i wheeled round directed a long scrutinising glance at the canvas stepped off the grating and squinted into the binnacle and finally resumed my perambulation of the deck now here was a nice plot to face and countermine a plot that was only to be defeated by subtlety and strategy for at the most there were but three of us all told against thirteen ruthless treacherous men and it was not to be forgotten that no dependence whatever was to be placed upon the man harry his scruples apparently drew the line at coldblooded murder but on the hither side of that consideration for his own safety might tempt him to any conceivable lengths in short it needed but very little consideration to demonstrate that if i was to secure his active cooperation i must make it perfectly clear to him that it would be distinctly to his interest to give it me then there was miss onslow she was a woman of a delicate and refined nature of a magnificent courage certainly clever and resourceful and thus far capable perhaps of affording valuable suggestions but by no means to be involved so tangibly in any scheme against the men as to expose her to their vengeful fury in the event of failure the question whether i should mention this latest development to her at all was one of long and anxious mental debate with me on the one hand i was intensely desirous to spare this poor girl any further terror and anxiety while on the other i felt doubtful whether in a matter that so vitally interested her i ought not to afford her the opportunity of bringing her keen and clever womans wit to bear upon the problem that had now thrust itself upon us i spent an anxious sleepless night revolving countless schemes in my head and abandoning them one after the other either as impracticable or else too dependent upon chance the whole of the next day and the succeeding night was similarly spent by me and when i sprang feverishly from my bunk haggard and holloweyed with sleeplessness and worry on the second morning after my conversation with the man harry i had come to the resolution that it was my duty to inform miss onslow how matters stood with us and to afford her the opportunity to assist me with any suggestions that might occur to her an opportunity occurred shortly after breakfast i had taken my sights for the brigs longitude worked them out laid down the result upon the chart and was abstractedly gazing at the latter as it lay spread out before me upon the cabin table anxiously seeking inspiration from a study of the coasts islands and harbours delineated in miniature upon the white paper when the young lady stepped out of her cabin andfirst assuring herself that the steward was not within hearingcame to my side and laying her hand upon my shoulder said i want you to tell me what is the matter there is something very seriously wrong i know for i was watching you all day yesterday and it was impossible for me to avoid noticing that while when in presence of the men you did your best to wear an unconcerned manner the moment that you deemed yourself free from their observation you sank into a mood of gloomy abstraction and reverie the meaning of which was not to be mistaken and this morning you look absolutely ill with worry your forehead is seamed with wrinkles of care and anxiety and positively you are turning grey about the temples and as she spoke these last words her fingers lightly andas it seemed to mecaressingly touched me on the temples it was the first time that she had ever done such a thing and her touch thrilled me through as with an electric shock moving me to such an extent that i lost my selfcontrol and forthwith behaved with the recklessness of a madman i seized her hand threw my arm about her waist and drawing her to me kissed her on the lips it is your own fault i exclaimed wildly you should not have touched me so tenderly and caressingly i love you i tell you i love you beyond all power of speech to describe and i have been upon the point of telling you so over and over again but have been deterred by the knowledge that unless you can return my lovewhich you have never given me any reason to suppose is the casesuch a confession on my part must necessarily render your situation infinitely more embarrassing than it is now and hitherto i have contrived to remain master of myself but when you touched my temples just now poor fellow she interrupted astounding me by nestling in my embrace with flaming cheeks but looking up at me with smiling eyes that shone like stars as her arm stole up and twined itself about my neckis it indeed so bad as that with you i knew of course that you loved me the symptoms were quite unmistakablebut i scarcely dreamed of your passion being so violent as it appears to be well never mind charlie dear your very startling unexpected and vehement declaration will not produce the effect you seem to have feared because you see it so happens that i return your lovehow could it possibly be otherwiseher tone changing from tenderness to pridewhat woman whose heart is free could possibly fail to love a man whose devotion is what yours is and has been to me yes dearest i love you with my whole heart and i am proud to think that despite all my waywardness and shortcomings you have contrived to discover in me something worth loving but this is not what has been worrying you so terribly this last few daystell me what it is i have a right to know now yes i assented you certainly have but it is terrible news florence and i scarcely know in what words to communicate it to you yet be assured of this my sweet that with the new courage that you have just imparted to me i will overcome this peril that looms ahead of us deadly though it be and therewith i related to my sweetheart all that had passed between harry and myself at the same time directing her attention to the fact that this grisly peril was still a long way ahead of us that it was a far cry from where we were to the horn and that even after we had rounded that wild headland practically the whole stretch of the eastern coast of south america would have to be traversed before the time would be ripe for the villains to carry out their devilish scheme of murder and destruction and then i strove to comfort her by directing her attention to the chances of escape that might befall us the ships we should be certain to encounterwith the possibility of being able to surreptitiously communicate with one or more of them craving assistanceand of my determinationas a last resourceto cast away the ship and take our chance of being able to escape in one of the boats during the confusion rather than tamely navigate her to the spot that should be selected by those fiends for the deed of destruction as i told her of the fate that had been planned for us i saw her blanch to the lips and her eyes grow wide and glassy with horror but presently her colour returned and her mouth set in firm resolute lines and when at length i ceased to speak she said my poor charlie no wonder that you look worn and worried but take courage dear i cannot believe that god will permit those wretches to murder us in cold blood he will surely inspire you with an idea that will enable you to defeat and prevent an act of such atrocious wickedness and i have a sure conviction that in his own good time we shall be accorded a happy deliverance out of all our troubles and that you will by and by enjoy the satisfaction of happily reuniting me to my dear fatherand receiving the usual reward accorded to the allconquering prince in the fairy tale god grant it my dearest i exclaimed fervently as i kissed her and now said i i must go on deck i suppose and endeavour to appear as though i had not a care in the world for if those fellows notice that i am looking gloomy and preoccupied they will at once guess that i suspect something and may in that case so precipitate their plans as to render our case more desperate than ever we will go together said the brave girl and you shall have an example of the deep duplicity of which i am capable i will defy any one of them to detect the faintest shadow of care on my brow and therewith she retired to her cabin and presently emerged again attired for the deck it was a glorious morning of true pacific weather with the wind blowing a merry breeze from about westnorthwest the sky an exquisitely pure and delicate turquoise blue flecked with patches of fleecy prismatictinted cloud that here and there darkened the sapphire of the sparkling foamflecked ocean with broad spaces of deep rich violet shadow as for the brig she was swarming along at a nineknot pace under all plain sail supplemented by her starboard studdingsail with her mastheads sweeping in wide arcs athwart the blue as she swayed and rose and sank in long floating rushes over the rugged ridges of the pursuing swell while dazzling sunshine and purple shadow chased each other in and out of the hollows of her canvas and athwart her grimy decks there was a thin eddying coil of bluish smoke hurrying from the galley chimney under the higharching foot of the forecourse and out over the port cathead and the watch having no sailtrimming to attend to were squatted upon their hams on the fore deck playing cards the hooker needed no looking after in such weather as this and the only individual beside ourselves abaft the mainmast was the helmsman miss onslows appearance on deck never failed to attract the notice of the men although she had made a point of being up and down every day and all day long and i soon discovered that we were the objects of the stealthy regard not only of the group on the forecastle but also of the man at the wheel but no child could have appeared more completely free from care than she was she chatted with me about calcutta and simla described the characteristics of the several castes and classes of natives illustrating her description with amusing anecdotes that even coaxed a smile upon the sullen wooden visage of the fellow at the wheel and spoke of being reunited to her father with an absolute confidence that left no room for even a shadow of suspicion that she entertained the slightest doubt upon that subject a considerable period now elapsed without the occurrence of any incident worthy of mention except that i observed in the men a quite extraordinary devotion to cardplaying they did no work of any kind whatsoever beyond such necessary duties as making shortening or trimming sale as occasion demanded and when they were not doing this they were playing cards i was at first somewhat puzzled to account for the feverish and unflagging zeal with which this particular form of amusement was pursued by all hands for although sailors are fond of an occasional quiet game of cards they are as a rule by no means devotees of the pasteboards but at length i obtained enlightenment from the man harry they were gambling with the gems for stakes this intelligence disquieted me greatly for i foresaw possibilities of trouble in it and by and by it came meanwhile however i neglected no opportunity to seek intelligence as to any change in the views of these men with regard to the ultimate disposal of myself and miss onslow and learned from time to timemy informant of course being harrythat so far nothing had transpired justifying the suspicion that any departure from the original plan was contemplated this was in a measure gratifying in so far at least as that it still left me a fair amount of time to evolve some satisfactory scheme for our salvationa task in which i had not yet succeeded although i had considered i might almost say hundreds of ideas only to discard them as either impracticable or unreliable at the moment of which i am now about to speakwe were drawing close on toward the meridian of the horn but well to the south of it and the weather was what sailors call dirtya dark scowling sky overhead charged with sleet and rain squalls that when we ran into them lashed us and stung the skin like whips the atmosphere was nippingly raw and thick enough to veil and blot out everything at a distance of more than four miles and the wind was blowing so fresh from the southward that the men had at length been compelled to unwillingly turn out and snug the brig down to doublereefed topsails with the mainsail stowed there was a very steep and ugly beam sea running and the brig was rolling to it as though bent on rolling the masts out of her while the decks were midleg deep with the water that she dished in over the rail at every roll with a regularity that i was very far from appreciating worst of all there was no pretence whatever on the part of the men to watch the ship or keep a lookoutthe scoundrels were well aware that i might be depended on for that the only man on deck was the helmsman and from the condition of those who came staggering aft from time to time at the stroke of the bell to relieve the wheel i more than suspected that a drinking bout was under way in the forecastle such a condition of affairs was amply sufficient at any time to create within me a sense of profound uneasiness much more so at that especial time for we were then in a part of the ocean notorious for sudden savage gales thick weather and floating ice as deadly as any reef that ever trapped a ship and the safety of the brig and of all hands might at any moment be fatally imperilled by the slightest lack of alertness or the briefest powerlessness on the part of the crew it was this conviction alone that restrained me from an immediate endeavour to recapture the brig the conditions were propitious for as i have said all hands were below with the exception of the helmsman the cook it is true was in his galley but if i chose to arm myself with the pistols that had been presented to me by the frenchman aboard the marie renaud it would be no such desperate matter to slip forard and clap the hatch over the forescuttle secure the cook in his galley and then compel the halfdrunken helmsman to surrender but to resort to such measures as those where we then were would have been sheer madness and the idea no sooner occurred to me than it was dismissed as impracticable but although impracticable just then it might not be so later on when we should have arrived in less perilous latitudes and i there and then resolved to do everything that in me lay to facilitate such a coup on the first suitable occasion meanwhile it was little short of madness for the men to drink to excess under the then prevailing conditions of weather and situation and i determined to remonstrate with ogorman for permitting such perilous indulgence so i went aft and took the wheel directing the man whom i relieved to ask ogorman to come aft as i wished to speak to him the fellow slouched away forward lurching and slipping along the wet decks and disappeared down the forescuttle i deemed it not improbable that he would avail himself of the opportunity to help himself to another drink and that it might possibly be quite five minutes or even ten before he returned aft to resume his duty but a full halfhour elapsed and still the fellow remained invisible i had by this time very nearly come to the end of my stock of patience and was on the point of yelling to the cookwho kept close as a limpet to the shelter of his galley with the weatherdoor fast shutto run to the forecastle and summon someone to relieve me when i became aware of a din of excited shouts and yells arising from the forescuttle that momentarily grew in intensity until the disturbance was violent enough to suggest that all pandemonium had broken adrift in that small forecastle the cook from his position in the galley heard the row much more distinctly than i did and forsaking his pots and pans rushed forward where he stood gaping down through the scuttle in an attitude expressive of combined interest and consternation i shouted to him to let me know what it all meant but his attention was so completely absorbed by what was happening below that he had no ears for me while as for me i had my hands quite full with the brig and dared not release my grasp of the wheel for a single instant lest she should broachto and get her decks swept or possibly be dismasted chapter fourteen a double tragedy the rumpus continued for nearly ten minutes and then quite suddenly ceased and as it did so the cook flung his legs over the coamings of the forescuttle and disappeared down the hatchway some five minutes or so later ogorman appeared on deck ghastly white and with his cheek laid open in a gash that extended very nearly from his left ear to the corresponding corner of his mouth the blood was trickling down upon the collar of his jacket and staining the whole of the left breast of the garment and his hands and cuffs were smeared with blood it was at once evident to me that there had been a serious scrimmage in the forecastle a conjecture that was at once confirmed by the fellow himselfwho i may mention was completely sobered by the occurrence if indeed he had been the worse for drink at its outbreak hillo misther he exclaimed as he arrived within speaking distance of me are ye left all alone to look afther the hooker be jabers thats too bad wheres the shpalpeen that ought to be doin his thrick of grindin wather i sent him forard about threequarters of an hour ago said i to tell you that i wished to speak to you and the loafing blackguard never returned but what has been the matter in the forecastle and how came you with that wound in your cheek oh begorra but its a bad job intoirely he answered we was all havin a little game of cards together and to make the game lively we was stakin our gims dirk got claned out at lastlost every stone of his shareand then he jumped up and swore that price had been chatin him price knocked him down for sayin it but he jumped up againwid his mouth all bleedin from jacks blowand in a wink before anny of us knew what he was afther hed whipped out his knife and drove it clean through poor chips heart that was the beginnin of the row when we saw what had been done two or three of us attimpted to seize dirk and disarm him but the murthering villain fought like all the furies layin my cheek open stabbin poor tom in the throat so that hes bleedin like a stuck pig and pretty near cuttin mikes hand off and thats not the worst of it aither some of the other chaps took dirks side swearin that theyd seen chips chatin and in two twos sir all hands had their knives out and we was cuttin and slashin at each other loikeloikesodgers on a field of battle are there any hurt beside tom mike and yourself i asked too completely dazed with the sudden horror of the thing to look at more than one side of it for the moment ay begorra answered the irishman dirks done for i expect and theres others of us thatll want plenty of watchin if were ever to see the other side of the line again is that so ejaculated i then for heavens sake send somebody to relieve me that i may go forard and see what is to be done in the way of stitching and bandaging ay exclaimed ogorman bad cess to me for forgittin it that was what i came aft to ye for and therewith he hurried away forward again and in a few minutes a man came aft and took over the wheel i hurried below and found miss onslow engaged upon some needlework she looked up with a bright smile of welcome as i entered but immediately sprang to her feet exclaiming charlie what has happened you are as white as a ghost have you received information of any fresh villainy no dear no i interrupted something very serious has certainly happened but this time it concerns us only very indirectly the men have been quarrelling and fighting among themselves in the forecastle and one or two of them are rather seriously hurt may i enter your cabin for a moment sweetheart there is a medicinechest there with probably a supply of surgical bandages and so on i will take the whole affair forard as until i have seen precisely what is the matter it will be impossible for me to know what i shall require then charlie are you going to dress the injuries of those wretched men she asked yes dear i answered you need not be uneasy however they will not hurt me they will be quiet enough for some time after this i expect and possibly the occurrence may have the effect of causing them to determine on adopting some less inhuman method than murder to get rid of us god grant itif it should come to the worst answered the dear girl but charlie i was not afraid on your behalf dear they will scarcely lay hands on you while you are engaged in alleviating their sufferings i was about to ask whether you think i could be of any use whether i should go with you certainly not answered i in accents of sternness that were however levelled at the brutes forward not at the sweet woman who was so ready to forget all that she had endured at the hands of these ruffians and to undertake she knew not what in her willingness to forgive and help them no i continued you will remain here darling this is your end of the ship and you can do no better than stick to it whatever may be necessary to be done forward i can and will do i secured the medicinechestwhich luckily happened to be a fairly big one for a vessel of the brigs sizeand carried it forward to the forescuttle where one of the seamen relieved me of it and passed it below half a dozen or so of the gang were now on deck looking very crestfallen and subduedto such an extent indeed that they actually knuckled their foreheads to me as i appeared among them i did not waste time however by attempting to bring home to them the evil of their ways but descended at once into the dark grimy and evilsmelling hole where until a few minutes ago fourteen men had lived in such comfort and harmony as go to make pleasant the existence of forecastle jack heavens what a filthy place it was and how woefully changed for the worse since i had last entered itwhich was before it had received its present tenants it was bad enough even then but it was infinitely worse now it was a triangularshaped apartment the apex of the triangle being the eyes of the vessel it was barely six feet high from the deck to the under side of the beams and deck walls beams and roof were all of one uniform tint of greasy black the result of a coating of dirt so thick that it could actually be scraped off with a knife or with ones fingernail it was fitted all round with a double row of bunks and in addition to them a number of hammocks swung from the beams the place was unlighted save by means of the scuttle and by a kettleshaped slushlamp that swung flaring and emitting a long streamer of fat black smoke from the centre beam the deck was encumbered with the seachests of the original occupantswhich had been taken possession of by ogorman and his gangand was littered with tin plates pannikins fragments of food and empty and broken bottles while its atmosphere was foul with foetid odours prominent among which were those of bilgewater and cockroaches three of the bunks in the lower tier were occupiedtwo of the occupants lying quiet and still while the third moved restlessly at intervals emitting low moans the whileand four men evidently hurt reclined upon the deck with their backs propped up against seachests as for ogorman he stood close by the swaying lamp holding a dirty bloodstained rag to his gashed cheek as his eyes rolled gloomily and sullenly about the dark and stifling hole i gave my attention first to the figures in the bunks beginning with the still and silent ones the one i first approached happened to be the man named tom he was lying on his right side with his white face toward the light his eyes partly closed and showing nothing but the whites and a fearful gash about four inches long in the left side of his throat from which the blood seemed to have been pouring as from a pump judging from the appearance of his clothes and the bunk it was merely oozing now i seized his hand and felt for his pulse there was none i tore open his saturated shirt and laid my hand upon his breast there seemed to be an occasional slight flutter of the heart but if so it was so exceedingly faint as to render the matter extremely doubtful it was clear that the unfortunate man had bled or was bleeding to death and was far beyond such poor and inefficient help as i could afford him i left him therefore and turned to the next bunk which i now saw was occupied by the body of the carpenter he lay stretched out on his back just as he had been tossed in and might have been asleep but for the ghastly pallor of his face and the telltale purple stain upon the breast of his waistcoat and shirt he was dead beyond all doubt so i turned to the next man who proved to be a gigantic dutchman named dirk van zyl the author of all the trouble this man i presently discovered had received no fewer than nine wounds four of which from their extent and situation i considered desperate he groaned and cried and screamed in the most bloodcurdling fashion when i began to examine him begging that he might be left alone to die in peace but i washed his wounds one by one and bound or stitched them up as best i couldthe job occupying fully threequarters of an hour and when i at length left him he seemed somewhat easier the next man claiming my attention was an irishman named mike whose left hand had been struck by the dutchmans knife such a savage blow exactly on the joint of the wrist that the member was nearly severed i could do nothing with such an injury as that but bind it up tightly and place the hand and forearm in splints and a sling leaving nature to work out the rest of the cure if she would there were three other men who had received rather serious hurts and for whom i did my best and finally i stitched up ogormans face for him which completed a fairly stiff mornings surgical work then having again examined the man tom and found him to be quite dead i carefully cleansed myself from all traces of my ghastly labour and went aft reaching the cabin just in time for dinner while taking my afterdinner smoke that afternoon i carefully considered the situation as it had now become altered by the fatal fracas in the forecastle andhaving no desire to be deemed a better man than i really ami may as well confess at once that while i was profoundly shocked by what had occurred it was quite impossible for me to regret it indeed to have done so would have been unnatural for apart altogether from the hardship and anxiety that these men had already so callously inflicted upon me and the woman who was infinitely dearer than life to mei could not forget that they had all planned and agreed together in cold blood to deliberately destroy my sweetheart and myself not one of them except harryso far as my information went possessing even the small modicum of humanity that would have prompted him to demur at the decision and to urge the adoption of a less fatally stringent course i therefore felt little or no pity for any of the victims while so far as the ultimate escape of miss onslow and myself was concerned the prospect of such a result was distinctly improved by the loss on the part of our enemies of two killed and six wounded of whom three of the latter were unfit for duty this reduced the number of ogormans gang to nine effectives or deducting the cook and steward a workingparty of seven all told who would have to be divided into two watches as i reflected carefully upon the matter looking at it in all its bearings it seemed that the moment was opportune for me to endeavour to secure something more than the intermittent and shadowy authority that i had thus far been permitted to exercise and accordingly when i next visited the forecastle for the purpose of taking a look at my patientswhich was near the end of the second dogwatch that eveningi bluntly directed ogormans attention to the fact that we were now shorthanded and suggested that i should take command of one of the watches he considered the question for some few minutes but was suffering altogether too acutely from the smart of his gashed cheek to be able to reflect very deeply upon any subject and at length yielded a rather sulky and surly assent to my proposal the more readily perhaps since he had no one now left whom he could trust to take prices place i was careful to select for my command the watch of which the man harry was a member since by so doing we should both be on deck at the same time and i should thus have an excellent opportunity of conversing with him during the darkness of the night watches without attracting observation or arousing suspicion that same night as soon as it was fairly dark the bodies of price and the seaman tomunshrouded and simply prepared for burial by the attachment to their feet of an iron bar apiece heavy enough to sink themwere unceremoniously launched over the side without the slightest symptom of emotion and in another halfhour their shares of the gems were distributed more or less evenly among the survivors the man dirk excepted on the third day after the tragedy that i have just described a momentary glimpse of the sun during the forenoon enabled me to confirm my dead reckoning and to satisfactorily establish the fact that we were actually a few miles to the eastward of the dreaded horn although with less southing than i could have wished the southerly wind that had prevailed for some time having gradually gone round to the eastward so far that it at length became questionable whether we should succeed in weathering the land and so passing into the atlantic and to make matters worse the wind continued not only to work round but also to increase in strength to such an extent that at length the brig instead of heading east had broken off to due north while it had become necessary to snug her down to closereefed topsails and foretopmast staysail the thick weather moreover added another element of anxiety since i had only succeeded in gaining one solitary sight of the sun for nearly a weekand that not when he was on the meridian hence i was quite unable to determine my exact latitude but the next morning shortly after daylight when by my reckoning i had still forty odd miles of searoom land was made ahead some five miles distant and upon standing in a little closer i was at length enabled to identify it as the headland of cape horn itself whereupon we immediately wore round and stretched away to the southward on the larboard tack i for one being intensely thankful that we had made the notorious cape during daylight but for which happy chance the brig would in all probability have gone ashore and our adventure would have there and then come to a premature end but although fortune had so far favoured us that we were enabled for the present to avoid disaster it was disappointing to discover that our lee drift had been so excessive as to have caused us to lose ground while the slow but steady downward tendency of the mercury seemed to indicate that so far from our being justified in expecting any immediate improvement in the weather there was but too good reason to fear that a change from bad to worse was imminent and it needed but a few hours further experience to prove how well founded were those apprehensions for as the day wore on the aspect of the sky to windward grew increasingly menacing the hue of the thick canopy of vapour becoming hourly darker and more louring while the shredded clouds packed ever closer together in larger masses and of wilder and more threatening form and colour and the wind strengthened until it was blowing a full gale while the already heavy sea gathered weight so fast that by eight bells in the afternoon watch it had in my opinion become perilous to continue sailing the brig and i accordingly proposed to ogorman that we should stow the topsails and heaveto under storm staysails now the experience of the first day or two after the fight in the forecastle had led me to hope that the tragedy of the occurrence had frightened and sobered the men so thoroughly that there would be no more trouble with them so far at least as drink was concerned but therein i gave them credit for a higher standard of feeling than they possessed such sobering influence as the incident had exercised upon the fellows had quickly evaporated and on the particular day to which i am now referring the demon of drink had once more brought them under his influence with just enough effect to render them one and all reckless defiant and utterly unmanageable consequently my proposal to shorten sail and heaveto was met with scornful jeers and a pointblank refusal to do any work whatsoever and the worst of it was that i had held on with the canvas so long that the whole available strength in the ship was now needed to successfully handle it any attempt to do anything unaided or with the assistance of only one or two men being worse than useless there was nothing for it therefore but to let the two doublereefed topsails stand as they were and blow away or not as fate might decide there was one comfortand only oneto be found in the condition of affairs that i have endeavoured to indicate and that was that the brig heavily pressed as she was by her canvas was ratching fast through the water on a course that was not only carrying her off the land but also somewhat to the eastward so that with the moderating of the gale or even a slight shift of wind we might hope to pass clear into the atlantic but after all the amount of comfort to be derived from this reflection was but small and fleeting in face of the steadilyincreasing strength of the gale and the rapidlygrowing height and steepness of the sea even as it was the man harry who happened to be at the wheel at the moment that i now have in mind found his strength and skill taxed to the utmost to humour the brig along through that wild sea the perspiration streaming from every pore of him as he stood there fully exposed to the keen and nipping fury of the blast and it was perfectly evident that unless something were speedily done disaster must quickly overtake us and something was presently done for although my representations and suggestion had been met and rejected with scorn and derision an argument of a most convincing character was soon brought to bear upon the contumacious ones in the shape of a green sea that came right in over the bows halffilling the forecastle and frightening the occupants out of their wits while it carried away some thirty feet of bulwark on the port side the deluge of water that poured down through the forescuttle was sufficient in volume to actually wash several of the men out of their bunks and the instant that the inpour ceased all hands with one accord sprang for the opening fighting together like savage beasts in their anxiety to reach the deck but although that unlucky sea had inflicted upon the poor little overdriven brig a rather serious amount of damage it had produced at least one good result it had completely sobered all hands and brought them to a realising sense of the necessity to take immediate steps for the prevention of further mischief as the fellows gained the deck and saw the great gap in the bulwarks and observed the height steepness and generally dangerous character of the sea something very like a panic seized them and they came rushing aft with loud and excited outcries demanding to know what had happened meanwhile i had sprung to the wheel to the assistance of the helmsman who it was quite clear was nearly exhausted by his tremendous and continued efforts to control the movements of the brig never mind what has happened answered i what is done is done and cannot be helped what you have now to do is to get down the last reef in those topsails and take in the foretopmast staysail when we will heaveto let go your fore and maintopsail halliards man your reeftackles and then away aloft all hands of you before worse happens the fellows by this time quite sober and fully alive to the perils of their situation needed no second bidding but sprang about the deck with all the eager impetuous haste of men fighting for their lives and in less time than i could have believed possible they had bowsed out the reeftackles and were in the fore rigging on their way aloft to complete the operation of reefing the foretopsail ogorman set a good example by himself taking the weather yardarm and passing the earring and all hands were busily engaged in knotting the points when another mountainous sea came swooping savagely down upon us with upreared hissing crest i saw that it must inevitably break aboard us and uttered a loud yell of warning to the hands aloft who raised an answering shout of dismay as they gazed in horror at the oncoming liquid hill the crest of which must have been very nearly as high as themselves some of them abandoning their task sprang for the rigging and by the exercise of superhuman agility actually contrived to reach the top but the rest remained upon the yard to gaze apparently paralysed with terror the poor little brig seemed to shudder like a sentient thing as the great wall of water crashed down upon her burying her to the foremast and then i saw the whole mast buckle like a fishingrod when a strong heavy fish begins to fight for his life there was a crash of timber as the topmast snapped short off at the cap and the next instant away went the whole of the tophamper over the side flinging far into the raging sea the four unfortunates who had remained clinging to the yardarms as for the sea it swept right aft filling the decks to the rail smashing to splinters the boat that was stowed on the main hatch and carrying away the entire bulwarks on both sides as far aft as the main rigging by the time that the decks were clear of water and we were free to think of other matters than our own individual safety the four men who had been flung overboardand one of whom was ogormanhad disappeared for ever and we had made the discovery that we had lost our bowsprit and maintopgallant mast as well as the foretopmast and that we had more than four feet of water in the hold all this mind you with night close upon us the loss of all head sail of course at once rendered the brig unmanageable and thusapart from the effect of the further damage sustainedour situation immediately became one of the extremest peril a circumstance which coupled with the tragic disappearance of their leader from their midst completely cowed and subdued the survivors to the extent indeed of impelling them to come aft and implore me to take full command of the brig needless to say i made no difficulty about acceding to this request for prompt measures were imperative if the vessel was to be saved and with her florences and my own life so without pausing to read the men a moral lesson upon the evils of intemperance i forthwith issued orders for the goosewinged foresail to be set by which means we were at length enabled to get the brig before the wind and thus escape the immediate peril of being swamped this achieved the wreck of the foretopmast and bowsprit was cut away all canvas was furled and the brig was once more brought to the wind and hoveto under bare poles then although the men were inclined to grumble i insisted upon their going to the pumps and relieving the brig of at least a portion of the water in her hold for there were times when the water having accumulated forward the poor little craft became pinned down by the head to so dangerous an extent that it would have been absolutely suicidal to have left her in that condition the fellows toiled on until past two bells in the middle watchby which time they had reduced the depth of water in the hold to two feetand then knocked off utterly exhausted to go below and turn in while i undertook to keep the deck and watch the ship for the remainder of the night chapter fifteen our escape and rescue the brig as she lay hoveto rode comparatively easy and dry requiring no attention all therefore that i had to do was to maintain a sharp lookout and be ready to show a light betimes in the event of another craft heaving in sight and steering such a course as would be likely to bring her foul of us but while my selfimposed duty was thus a light one demanding only alertness on my part the situation and condition of the brig were such as to cause me profound anxiety which was in no degree lessened by the loss of the four men who had gone overboard with the wreck of the foretopmast had the ship been sound this last circumstance would have caused me no regret whatever for the simple reason that their loss reduced the number of my enemies by four but their loss and the casualties due to the fracas in the forecastle resulted in the reduction of the number of the effective crew to six of whom the cook and the steward were two who could be relied upon for little or nothing more than mere pulling and hauling while of the remaining four two were still suffering from wounds sufficiently severe to partially disable them and this reduction with the brig practically a wreck was a serious one moreover the glass remained very low and there was no indication whatever of the speedy abatement of the gale or even any ground for hope that we had seen the worst of it on the contrary the sky looked wilder than ever while the gusts of wind that frequently swept down upon us were certainly growing more savage as the minutes dragged their slow length away at length after what seemed like an eternity of watching the lagging dawn came slowly oozing out of the scowling east revealing a sky of portentous gloom of a deep slateypurple tint blotched with shreds of flying dirtywhite vapour and a sea that was positively appalling in its height and steepness and the fury with which it ran yet heavy as was the sea and swiftly as the great liquid hills came swooping down upon the battered brig the little craft rode them fairly well if a trifle languidlywhich latter characteristic i attributed to the quantity of water still present in her hull and after studying her behaviour by daylight for a full halfhour i came to the conclusion that the sooner that water should be pumped out of her the better so watching my opportunity i rushed forard along the unprotected deck over which the water washed heavily at timesand called all hands to turn out and pump the ship dry and after a great deal of grumbling and much show of disinclination i at length succeeded in getting them on deck and persuading them to man the pumps they pumped steadily until it was time to knock off for breakfast when we sounded the well and found a depth of twentyone inches breakfast that morning was rather a comfortless meal for the cook terrified lest he and his galley should be washed overboard together had not furnished a very appetising spread while the wild movements of the vessel the harsh and dismal creaking of her timbers the frequent heavy washing of water along the decks and the roar of the gale all combining together to create a concert of doleful sounds rendered the cabin a distinctly unpleasant place of sojourn i therefore made no long tarrying at the table merely remaining below long enough to snatch a hasty meal and to say a few words of comfort and encouragement to my sweetheart and then hurried on deck again to see how matters were faring there the scene that met my gaze as i emerged from the companion was depressing and discouraging in the extreme the sky looked darker and more threatening than ever the wind was freshening rapidly and sweeping along in savage gusts that smote the seething wavecrests and tore them into blinding stinging showers of salt spray that so thickened the atmosphere as to completely veil and hide everything beyond a distance of half a mile the sea mountainous as it had been all through the night had grown in steepness and height and had acquired a still more formidable and menacing run during the short time that i had been below while the fact was unquestionable that the brig was labouring more heavily and the sea washing in steadilyincreasing volume athwart that portion of her deck that lay unprotected through the loss of her bulwarks it appeared to me that we should do better and ride easier if we showed a small spread of canvasjust sufficient to steady the vessel to cause her to turn up a good bold weather side to the seas and to place her under command of her helm and i accordingly dodged my way to the forescuttle and sang out for all hands to come on deck to make sail they came at length four of them moving with that slow and exasperating deliberation that the merchant seaman assumes when he considers that he is being put upon and at length by dint of sheer persistence i induced them to overhaul the saillocker with the result that we found a main staysail new and made of good stout canvas evidently intended for a storm sail which still working with the same deliberation and show of indifference they finally consented to bend and set the result was at once apparent the brig began to move through the water taking the seas very much easier as she was humoured at them with the helm while the increased height of weather side that she turned up had the effect of considerably lessening the amount of water washing over the deck and rendering the task of getting fore and aft comparatively safe but i was still not satisfied great as was the improvement effected by the setting of the staysail the brig yet seemed to labour more heavily than was to be reasonably accounted for even by the fact that she had water in the hold and then it occurred to me to sound the well afresh and ascertain whether the amount of that water was increasing i accordingly fetched the rod carefully dried it and watching until the brig was for an instant on an even keel lowered it down the pump barrel upon withdrawing it the startling discovery was made that since the men had last been at the pumps the depth of water in the hold had increased by three inches the water was draining into the hull somewhere and that too in sufficient quantity to keep us busy i directed the attention of the men to the condition of the pump rod and with deep bitter curses levelled at the weather the brigat everything in short except the indifference of themselves and their shipmates that had brought us all to this passthey went to work afresh at the pumps while i made my way to the forecastle and as was my daily wont attended to the injuries of the two wounded men dirk and mike who were confined to their bunks with the brig leaping and plunging so desperately my task was by no means an easy one and upon this occasion it occupied me so long that ere i had quite finished the other men came below still cursing and grumbling to get their dinner i inquired whether they had succeeded in reducing the quantity of water in the hold at all and was informedwith further cursesthat they had only reduced it by about two inches and that they were willing to be eternally condemned if they ever laid a hand upon the pump brake again but about six bells in the afternoon watch while i was at the wheel the man harry came aft sounded the well and shouting to me twentysix inches went forard again with the result that a quarter of an hour or so later they all came aft once more and continued pumping for nearly two hours with what effect however i could not say for none of them condescended to inform me nor did either of them offer to relieve me at the wheel but that i was not at all surprised at as they doubtless considered that what they had done at the pumps was quite as much as could be expected of them i was not forgotten however for florence making use of the fire that i had caused to be lighted in the cabinstove prepared for me a most substantial and appetising meal consisting of toasted rashers of ham cabin breadcarefully cleared of weevilsand tea which she actually brought on deck to me standing by me and tending the wheel in the cleverest fashion while i hurriedly devoured the food not satisfied with doing this for me the dear girl knowing that i had been on deck all the previous night actually proposed remaining at the wheel in the midst of all the elemental fury long enough to enable me to snatch a few hours sleep what think you of that shipmates for devotion on the part of a sweetheart but that of course was going altogether beyond the utmost that i could possibly consent to and thanking her heartily for her generous solicitude i sent her below with strict injunctions to turn in early and secure a good nights rest foralthough i was careful not to hint as much to her even in the most distant fashioni did not at all like the way that matters were going with us the leak and the mens aversion to the labour of pumping taken together made up a bad lookout and i foresaw that unless a change for the better in one respect or the other soon took place it would speedily come to our being obliged to take to the boats throughout the whole of that wet wild cheerless night i stood at the wheel tending the ship and helping her through the seas and it was not until dawn was abroad that anyone came to relieve me when cockney harry made his appearance staggering and dodging his way aft along the flooded decks mornin sir he remarked as he took over the wheel from me you looks dead wore out you do you surely aint been at this here muckin wheel the whole blessed night have ye sir certainly i have said i seeing that the brig had to be looked after and neither of you men saw fit to relieve me well admitted the fellow thats a howlin shime and no mistike the fact is that we was all dead tired with sweatin at them infernal pumps i meant to ha come along and took a spell at watergrindin but in witin for them swines to all go to sleep i went to sleep myself and never woke up agine until five minutes ago quite so said i drily but if you really intended to have relieved me why have waited until the rest were asleep well ye see sir it was this way answered the man when we went below lawst night after knockin off pumping all hands of us was on the growl cause of the heavy work wed had to do and sam up and said that the best thing we could do d be to tike to the boats as soon as the gale broke and let the blessed old hooker go to the bottom rather than have to keep all on pumpin of her everlastinly until we fetched a port and the rest of em agreed with him then dirk ups and asts what was to be done with you and the lidy and nobody else seemin to have a hawnser ready i says that i supposes youll both have to come with us but dirk he says no it wont never do for you to land along of us you knows enough to hang some of us and he for one dont mean to take no risks and tothers all agreed with him and at last twas settled that if the leak dont take up when the gale breaks were to take to the boats leavin you and the lidy aboard to go down with the brig i thought id wait and hear if anybody had anything else to say about it afore comin aft to relieve you and it was while i was witin that i dropped asleep thank you harry for affording me this very important item of information said i you are a good sort of fellow and you may depend upon it that i will not forget the service you have done me and so that scoundrel dirk would leave the lady and me to drown would he after all that i have done for him very well now harry neither miss onslow nor i will be left aboard here to drown you may take your oath of that it is clear to me now that it must be war to the death between the forecastle and the cabin and i shall take my measures accordingly the question is which sidecabin or forecastledo you intend to be on if you choose to join me i will do what i can for you and if you elect to throw in your lot with those murderers forard i will still bear you in mind so far as i can consistently with the ladys and my own safety thankee sir answered the fellow if i might make so bold sir what do you intend to do that said i i can only tell you in the event of your coming over on my side very well sir returned he ill think it over while youre tikin a rest and let you know when you come on deck agine and therewith i went below and flinging myself into my bunk at once fell into a profound and dreamless sleep that lasted until i was awakened by the discordant clank of the pumps about four bells in the forenoon watch when i found miss onslow patiently awaiting me in the cabin with another hot meal all ready for my delectation it was apparent to me immediately upon awaking that the gale had broken and when i went on deck i found that the sky had cleared to windward showing here and there fastwidening patches of blue sky while the wind had already dropped to the strength of a strong breeze the sea however showed little diminution of height although it was no longer so steep nor was it now breaking dangerously but the brig was rolling as furiously and more sluggishly than ever and the clear water that gushed from the pumps told a tale that there was no mistaking i noticed that five men were now working at the pumpsthe cook and steward being two of themand all hands were growling together and cursing both loud and deep as they toiled at the brakes well lads said i approaching them what is the news from the pumps is there any hope of getting them to suck suck exclaimed one of them in tones of ineffable disgust no theyll never suck no more in this world theres upards o three feet o water in the hooker now and shes gainin on us at the rate o two inches an hour while we pumps at her shes bound to the bottom she is and i only hopes shell keep afloat long enough to let us get the boats afloat without smashin of em to smithereens alongside whereabouts is the nearest land mister and how fur off is it ask me after i have taken my sights at noonit looks as though i shall be able to get the sun todayand i will tell you said i then finding the men sulky and quite tired of listening to their curses i went aft and relieved the wheel remaining there until about a quarter of an hour to midday when the sky having cleared i sang out for somebody to relieve me while i shot the sun it was harry who came at my call and as he took over the wheel he remarked just loud enough for me to hear and staring away to windward as he spoke ive made up my mind sir im with you and the lidy i aint agoin to have no more truck with them other chaps theyre no better than murderers theyve mide up their minds to leave you and the lidy aboard and theres no movin of em from that all right my lad said i you will find before many hours are over your head that you have made a wise choice can you read the fellow intimated that he could then said i i will write out such instructions as it will be necessary for me to give you and you must find an opportunity to read them over unobserved by the rest and you must also obey them to the letter for upon your obedience will depend the success or failure of my scheme with which i left him and went below for my sextant upon working out the result of my meridian observation i found that we were close upon one hundred and forty miles from staten island which bore north by east a quarter east of usa distance which might be traversed in less than fortyeight hours by a properlyequipped boat in fine weather but what if it should come on to blow again it was a contingency that i did not care to contemplate there was one point in our favour the mercury was rising slowly and steadily and please god if we were able to leave the brig in good time we might succeed in reaching shelter of some sort before the settingin again of bad weather and in any case it was a contingency that had to be faced since it was perfectly clear by this time that the brig had been so severely battered and strained during the late gale that nothing we could do would avail to keep her afloat much longer having pricked off the brigs position on the chart i proceeded to write out my instructions to the man harry it may perhaps be thought that in committing those instructions to paper i was doing an imprudent thingthat i was in fact furnishing irrefutable evidence of my intentions should the man choose to play me false and show the paper to his companions but i had faith in the fellow there was an honest look in his eyes and the fact that he had of his own free will warned me of the other mens intentions was another point in his favour and last but not least i believed that he had wit enough to see that he would be better serving his own interests by attaching himself to me than by throwing in his lot with the others and that consequently he would have no interest in playing me false i therefore unhesitatingly handed him his instructions at the first opportunity and left him to carry them out with as little delay as possible upon returning to the deck after working out my sights i found that the men had knocked off pumping but were hanging about the deck as though waiting for something instead of going below to dinner and presently i found out what was in the wind the man known as sam stepping forward to inquire whereabout my observation placed the ship i told him then said he if we steers notheanbyeast a quarter east steady were bound to fetch this here staten hiland are we certainly said i and i hope that we shall make it some time the day after tomorrow the day ater tomorrer ejaculated the man do ye mean with this here brig no said i i mean with the boats the brig could never fetch it in her present disabled condition except with a fair wind even if you could keep her afloat so long which i do not for a moment believe a grim smile of satisfactionwhich the fellow strove to conceal flickered for a moment over his rugged sullen features and then he turned away without another word and slouched forward followed by his companions as for me i went aft and took the wheel from the man who was tending it and as soon as he had disappeared lashed it and set about certain preparations that i felt it was now high time to make these did not occupy me long and upon their completion i went below wherethe cook and steward having been busy at the pumps all the morningflorence was awaiting me with a good appetising dinner prepared by herself while we were discussing the meal togetherthe steward having gone forward with the othersi told my companion that the supreme moment was at hand when it would be necessary for us to make a bold dash for our lives and i warned her to prepare for it by putting all her slender stock of clothing together in a parcel and to be ready to act with me at a moments notice as soon as the boats were in the water she received my intelligence very quietly and although she lost her colour and became marblewhite to the lips for perhaps a minute while i explained my plans her courage never faltered and when i had finished she put her hand in mine with the simple remark very well charlie dear you have only to tell me what you wish me to do and you will find me obedient in every particular meanwhile the wind which had been blowing a strong breeze at breakfasttime had been dropping steadily all through the day until toward the close of the afternoon it had softened down to the strength of a royal breeze with a corresponding diminution in the height of the sea yet it was evident that it would not be possible to safely lower a boat for some hours to come but that the men were eager to be off was also perfectly evident for instead of manning the pumps again after dinner they had spent the entire afternoon hanging about the decks inspecting and overhauling the boats getting provisions water and other necessaries togetherthe cook lighting a fire in the galley and boiling a considerable quantity of meat in the copperswhile at intervals one or another of them would sound the well and report the result to his comrades their actions being marked by a curious commingling of stealthiness and candour as though they were quite unable to decide whether to keep their intentions a secret from me or whether it would be possible to still more completely hoodwink me by a pretence of being perfectly frank and open at length however the latter plan seemed to be the favoured one for about sunset the man sam came to me with the information that they had decided to leave the brig at daybreak and theyd be glad to know whether i thought the hooker d keep above water until then without pumpin before replying i inquired what depth of water there was then in the hold and at what rate it was making after which a brief calculation enabled me to assure them that she would probably last until noon next day but that nevertheless i would recommend them to prepare for a start the first thing after breakfast and that the lady and i would be ready by that time from this time forward the brighoveto and with her helm lashedwas left to take care of herself the greatlyimproved condition of the weather permitting of this while the men proceeded in their own slow deliberate fashion with their preparations for abandoning her as for us aft our preparations were of the simplest possible kind consisting merely of the stowing of our clothing in a bundle that could be flung into the boat at a moments noticeand the very careful loading of the brace of duellingpistols with which my unknown french friend had presented me these little matters attended to i urged florence to lie down and endeavour to secure a few hours sleep following the same good advice myself as soon as she had retired to her cabin i was awakened about midnight by the man harry who had been anxiously awaiting the moment for the others to get to sleep in order that he might slip aft unnoticed to inform me of the progress of his own particular share in our enterprise well harry said i how do matters stand have you succeeded in accomplishing all that i directed you to do yes sir said he i was afride at first that i shouldnt get a chaunce to go down into the forepeak without bein noticed but the doctor made that right by asting for somebody to fetch him up a bit more coal which i offered to do for him once i was down in the peak the rest was easy enough the armschist hadnt never been locked so i collared a couple of pair of pistols and then scraped the coal away from under the chist until the whole bag o tricks fetched away and slid down into the water where nobody wont ever find it again then i had a look at the magazine what poor chips had knocked together the door was only fastened by a staple so i soon had it open and when id found a couple o packets of pistolcartridges i just hove everything else i could lay hands on down ater the armschist so even though some of em has pistols they wont have no ammunition for emunless they happened to have a few cartridges by emwhich makes us all right capital exclaimed i and now as to the final arrangements of the men what are they why twas arranged that i was to be on deck sos to keep a sort of general heye on the brig and you and to call all hands forard at daybreakor earlier if the sea flattens down enough to launch a boat afore then then were goin to lower the gig that you had when you picked us upshe bein the most wholesomest boat of the twoand put everything into her that were goin to tike with usincludin plenty o grub and water and at the last minute when were ready to shove off you and the lidy are to be set upon and battened down below and then we all jumps into the boat and makes sail i considered a while and then said reflectively it is just questionable whether it would not after all be the best plan to let the scoundrels get right away and then launch the french boat thats no good interrupted harry the french boat is stove sam thought of that last night says he if we dont mind our weather heye that there feller aft may break his way out from below ater were gone and get away in tother boat and dirk he says tike the doctors coal hammer and smash in a bottom plank thatll stop any sich little gime as you speaks of sam and ater a little more talk sam ups and does it while you was below asleep the scoundrels ejaculated i fiercely so they are absolutely determined to murder us are they very well their blood be on their own heads now listen to me harry and therewith i unfolded my final plans and gave him a few last instructions after which harry went on deck again to be there in the event of any of the others taking it into their heads to go on deck and have a look round anxious to get as much rest as possible i flung myself down upon one of the sofalockers but my nerves were just then rather too tautly strung and all my senses too keenly on the alert to admit of anything like sound sleep and i simply dozed hearing harrys every movement on deck until the grey light of dawn began to ooze down through the skylight when i went to my berth soused my head in a basin of cold water had a good refreshing wash and then went on deck to look round the people forward appearing on deck at the precise moment when i emerged from the companion they seemed to be rather disconcerted at seeing me but i feigned not to have noticed it devoting my immediate attention to the weather it was quite fine now with a nice little royal breeze from about due east the sea had gone down wonderfully during the night and there was very little more than the heavy swell to contend with while even that looked a great deal more formidable than it really was as for the brig she was much more buoyant than i had expected to find her i gave her fully six hours longer to livequite long enough to enable the wretches who meditated my destruction to repair and launch the boat that they had wilfully damaged while the job would occupy them long enough to enable me to gain a good start and get clear away from them the cook went to his galley and lighted his fire quite in the ordinary way and set about preparing breakfast while the rest going to the city of cawnpores gig looked into her talking together in low tones then they cast off the gripes and tackle falls and lowered her until her gunwale was just level with the rail when they began to pass into her and stow the kegs of water provisions and other matters that they intended taking with them and by the extreme care that each man bestowed upon the storage of his own particular bundle of dunnage i felt tolerably certain that their respective parcels of gems were concealed therein seeing them thus employed i slipped down below gave miss onslow a call and then returned to the deck with her and my own bundle together with the chronometer and sextant all of which in an easy offhand manner i placed in the sternsheets as i did so the man sam looked up and exclaimed savagely here what the but was instantly interrupted by one of his mates who murmured a few words in his ear what is the matter demanded i with a great affectation of innocence surely there is room in the boat for the few things belonging to the lady and myself oh ay he growled surlily theres room enoughor if there aint well make room sos you and the lady shall have plenty o clothes for your tripeh mates the others responded with a sinister laugh at the grim humour of the joke but without taking any notice i looked on at the work with just that amount of interest that i might be reasonably expected to take until the steward called me to say that breakfast was ready then with a glance of intelligence at harryto which he respondedi turned away and went below the breakfast was a very good onejust the substantial appetising kind that one would wish to sit down to upon such an occasion and i did ample justice to it at length at what i judged to be the right moment i signed to miss onslow to go on deck and then rose to my feet as though to follow her but instead of springing up the companion ladder i turned to the steward seized him by the throat and flung him violently to the deck the shock stunned him and before he recovered consciousness i had got him lashed arms and legs together like a trussed fowl with a gag in his mouth that i had already prepared for the purpose making sure that he was quite secure and could not possibly release himself or cry out i dashed up the companion ladder and drew over the slide securing it and the doors with wedges harry was sitting on the windlass barrel taking his breakfast al fresco and acting as lookout generally while the others breakfasted below and directly he saw me throw up my hand as a signal to him he slid off the windlass crept softly to the forescuttle and swiftly closed the hatch securing it by thrusting a wooden pin through the staple there was an immediate outcry from below quickly followed by savage bangs upon the underside of the hatch but taking no notice of these manifestations the fellow rushed aft and at once assisted me to place miss onslow in the gig then springing to the tackle falls we lowered the boat smartly the short remaining distance to the water and springing into her unhooked the tackles and shoved clear of the brig then still working for our lives we stepped the mast set the sails and headed the boat to the northward nor were we much too quick for we had scarcely placed a cables length between us and the brig when we heard a crash aboard her and the next instant we saw the fellows rising out of the forecastle and rushing aft of course they at once caught sight of us and promptly blazed away with their pistols at us but none of the bullets came anywhere near then they began to shout imprecations at us and prayers to us to return but we remained equally deaf to both and in a few minutesthe boat slipping nimbly along through the waterwe were out of hearing of them and congratulating ourselves and each other upon our good luck in having succeeded in so neatly effecting our escape without being obliged to fight for the possession of the boat i headed north with the intention of making staten island if possible but we had scarcely been under way two hours when harry who was forward keeping a lookout sighted a sail dead to windward heading our way and we at once so manoeuvred the boat as to intercept her she came bowling down toward us hand over hand and when she was within about three miles of us i made her out to be a frigate she was coming so directly for us that it was impossible for us to miss each other and within half an hour of the moment when we first discovered her i had the supreme satisfaction of assisting florence up the side of her britannic majestys ship ariadne commanded by my former shipmate and very good friend harry curtis while half an hour later the five men whom i had left aboard the brig were taken off her and safely lodged in irons on the ariadnes lower deck of the excitement that ensued upon our rescue i have no space to dwell suffice it to say that the marie renaud had duly arrived in table bay and had there reported the act of piracy of which she had been the victim my letter being at the same time placed in the hands of the authorities who after a proper amount of deliberation had despatched the ariadne in search of the piratical brig is there anything else to tell i think not except it be to mention that miss onslow was the heroine of the ship and every man fore and aft her devoted slave during our passage to the cape where the six survivors of ogormans gang were duly put upon their trial for piracy upon the high seas the man harry acting upon my advice offered to turn queens evidence and the favourable report that i was able to make of his conduct caused his offer to be accepted with the result that he received a free pardon while dirk the dutchman was sentenced to death and the other four to penal servitude for life the dutchman however cheated the gallows by dying in prison of his wounds after lingering for so long a time that it seemed as though he would after all recover and the gems that were the prime cause of so much of your troublewhat became of them i fancy i hear some fair reader exclaim well there proved to be such insuperable difficulties in the way of establishing their rightful ownership that the home government very kindly undertook the charge of them until the man who could satisfactorily prove his right to them should put in an appearance it was a marvellously curious circumstance however that i should have happened to anticipate this precise difficulty and its probable solution almost at the moment when i first identified the distant ariadne as a manowar with the result thatwell there is no need to be too explicit is there it will perhaps suffice if i say that the seaman harry is today living very comfortably indeed as an independent gentleman of considerable means while the four magnificent suites of jewelleryrubies diamonds emeralds and pearlsthat mrs charles conyers nee florence onslow sports from time to time are the eternal envy and admiration of all who get the opportunity to see them the end
