the secret of the sands the water lily and her crew by harry collingwood published by griffith and farran london this edition dated preface the attention of the public has been directed on more than one occasion within the last few years to voyages of a more or less lengthy character undertaken in craft of very small tonnage and a great deal has been said and written concerning the foolhardiness of such undertakings this however is more apparent than real though much must necessarily depend in such voyages on the adventurers skill as a seaman and his nerve and selfpossession in critical moments almost if not quite as much will also depend upon the design construction and equipment of the craft in which such an adventure is undertaken but where all these conditions are favourable the actual danger may be reduced in quite a surprising degree such voyages however if of any considerable length are sure to abound in adventure and in selecting one as the groundwork of my story it has been my aim to endeavour at once to make it interesting and readable to those who have a liking for the sea and for nautical adventure and to convey a few useful hints gathered from my own experience respecting the design and management of small craft and of the precautions which are so absolutely necessary in the navigating of them but it must be distinctly understood that in selecting this subject i have had no intention whatever of advocating or recommending such voyages or of underrating the risks which under the most favourable circumstances they involve my purpose has simply been to combine a little information with i hope a great deal of interest and amusement and if my book serves but to while pleasantly away an idle hour or two for the general reader or conveys a scrap of useful information to the young yachtsman that purpose will be fully accomplished harry collingwood october volume one chapter i the wreck it was the last week in the month of november when the event occurred which proved to be the primum mobile of the following adventures the weather for some days previous had been unusually boisterous for the time of year and had culminated on the morning on which my story opens in a november gale from the southwest exceeding in violence any previous gale within the memory of the oldest inhabitant of the locality this is saying a great deal for i was at the time living in weymouth a most delightful summer resort where however the feelings are likely to be more or less harrowed every winter by fearful wrecks on the farfamed and muchdreaded chesil beach which connects the misnamed island of portland with the mainland we had dined as usual at the primitive hour of one oclock and with bob trunnionabout whom i shall have more to say anoni had turned out under the verandah to enjoy our postprandial smoke according to invariable usage my sister ada would not permit us the indulgence of that luxury indoors and no conceivable disturbance of the elements could compel us to forego it altogether we were pacing the verandah side by side quarterdeck fashion with our hands behind our backs and our weeds between our teeth making an occasional remark about the weather as the sheeted rain swept past us and the trees in the distance and the leafdenuded shrubs in the garden bowed before the fury of the blast when a coastguardman whom i had occasionally encountered and spoken to in my rambles came running past enveloped in oilskins and topped by a souwester as he went by seeing us he shouted ship coming ashore in the west bay sir and was the next minute at the bottom of the hill en route as fast as his legs could carry him for the town our house was situated in a pleasant suburb called rodwell the highroad which passed our door led direct to the smallmouth sands at the farther extremity of which was the chesil beach and we conjectured that the coastguardman had come from the beach along this road to give notice to the chief officer stationed in the town to run indoors don our foulweather rigging and notify my sister that we were off to the scene of the anticipated wreck was the work of a moment the next we were in the road inclined forward at an angle of fortyfive degrees against the wind and staggering slowly ahead in the direction of the sands the coastguardman had a fair wind of it and was going a good eight knots when he passed us but just at the top of the hill as we were exposed to the full strength of the gale we did not forge ahead at more than about one knot however matters mended soon after for we surmounted the brow of the hill and began the descent on the opposite side here the road took a slight bend which brought the wind well abeam so keeping close under the hedge to windward of us we rattled away as fast as we could go after nearly an hours severe exertion we reached the beach the vessel which was expected to come on shore was a fullrigged ship apparently of about eight hundred or a thousand tons and evidently a foreigner by her build and rig some conjectured her to be french some spanish and others avowed their belief that she was a german but she was still too far off and the weather too thick to enable any one to form a clear judgment as to her nationality whoever she is said the chief boatman the skipper of her is a downright good seaman and doesnt intend to lose his ship whilst he can do anything to save her he drove into the bay about two hours ago sir said he turning to me and this is the second time that hes tried to fetch out again but lord he dont know this place so well as i do or hed be as sartain as i be that shell never go outside o the bill o portland again the ship dont float that with her sails alone could get out of the bay once she got into it with the wind and tide the way it is now and afore the tide turns hell be knocked into matchwood or my names not joe grummet there he comes round again continued the man who had kept his eye on the vessel all the time he was speaking but its no good hes more n a mile to leeward of where he fetched last time and hed better give it up and run her ashore whilst tis light enough to get the hands out of her if so be as it please god to let any on em come ashore alive the vessel had as grummet remarked altered her course running off rapidly before the wind and consequently towards the land and those who knew nothing about nautical matters would have supposed that her commander had at length given up the contest and was about to run her on shore but we knew better the vessel had merely been kept away in order to wear her staying in such a tremendous gale and sea being utterly out of the question and as we watched we saw her come slowly to the wind on the opposite tack her yards were braced sharp up her sheets flattened in and once more the battle for life was resumed against the hostile elements but it was evident that the noble ships career was ended the operation of wearing had brought her into fearful proximity with the land and though she carried reefed mainsail and foresail under closereefed topsails and fore and main topmast staysails it was evident that she was driving to leeward at a frightful rate and that the period of her existence must now be measured in minutes now lads bear a hand shouted grummet and lets signal her to run in here the beach is steeper here than anywhere within the next three or four mile and if he happens to come in on the back of a sea hell run up pretty near high and dry and we may get some of the poor souls ashore alive and cheat davy jones out of the best part of his bargain this bout anyway a large red bandana handkerchief was produced and seized to the end of a boathook this extempore flag and staff grummet took in his hand and proceeding to the summit of the beach commenced waving it to and fro to attract the attention of the people on board the doomed ship she was now so close that we could see the two men at her wheel and a man whom we supposed to be the master standing by the mizen rigging just abaft the mainmast and huddled together under the shelter of the weather bulwarks we could see some seven or eight more of her crew and others were doubtless cowering elsewhere out of sight grummet waved his flag energetically from the crest of the beach and the coastguardmen busied themselves in making such slight preparations as were in their power to assist the crew in escaping from the wreck several coils of line had been brought down to the beach one man who announced himself to be a good swimmer had secured an end of the smallest of these to his waist he now stood prepared to divest himself of all his superfluous clothing at a moments notice and to attempt the hazardous experiment of rushing into the boiling surf to drag out any poor unfortunate whom he might be able to reach others were engaged in various ways in preparing themselves to render what assistance was in their power when a cry from grummet announced that the crisis had arrived on looking up we saw that the strangers foretopmast had gone in the cap and now hung to leeward with the topsail and topmast staysail thrashing to ribbons the latter threatening at every jerk to take the bowsprit out of the ship the foresail was also split from head to foot and even as we looked the overstrained canvas gave way and fluttering for a moment in the furious gale parted from the boltropes and came flying like a shred of cloud to leeward the ship thus deprived of her headsail luffed into the wind and the moment that the rest of her canvas shook away it came also leaving her helpless and unmanageable with the sea sweeping her deck fore and aft now stand by men shouted grummet and each one do his best for the poor souls for they were never nearer to deaths door than they will be in another two minutes if he had run her stem on to the beach they might have stood a chance but i fear it is all over with them now for shell come ashore broadside on and all on us knows what that means fortunately the catastrophe had happened immediately to windward of that part of the beach on which we stood a spot as grummet had observed where the shipwrecked crew would have a better chance of reaching the shore alive than they would have had if stranded on any other part of it for some miles on either side but the loss of their sails had rendered the prospect of their escape considerably less than it would have been had they been able to watch their chance sail the ship in on the crest of a wave and so beach her the next half minute or so was one of most intense and painful excitement to us spectators on shore each man moved nearer to the water and cast off some article of clothing or gave a last look to the line or a final adjustment to the lifebuoy round his waist for myself i had stripped off my jacket and waistcoat and placed them together with my hat in the hands of my friend bob who could not swim and i now stood with the end of a line knotted into a bowline in my hand ready to do anything which the emergency of the moment might require the master of the vessel appeared to be aware of our intention and the meaning of the signal which grummet had shown and as it was now impossible to run the ship stem on upon the beach he did the next best thing and waving his hand to the men who like true seamen still stuck to the wheel they put the helm hard up that she might come in stern on the manoeuvre was partially successful but unfortunately she came ashore between two seas and the undertow of the one taking her stern whilst the succeeding sea struck her bow she fell broadsideto in an instant her three masts went by the board and the sea made a clean breach over her one poor fellow was seen to leap overboard at the moment that the ship struck and halfadozen of the men on the beach rushed down into the water making frantic efforts to get at him but he could not swim and those who tried to reach him were flung back bruised and senseless upon the beach only to be dragged away again as the sea receded and had it not been for the ropes and lifebuoys round their waists by which their comrades hauled them on shore they must have lost their lives as it was one of them in some way or other got out of the lifebuoy and we saw him swept away almost from our very feet i was an expert swimmer and as soon as i saw the poor fellow being swept away i slipped my head and shoulders through the bowline knot i held in my hand dashed into the surf and resorting to my usual tactics of diving through the breakers managed to get hold of the man with one hand while i raised the other above my head as a signal to those on shore to haul away upon their end of the line as soon as i felt the line tighten round me i grasped the man round the body and in another moment we were both on the beach in the arms of those who had run down to meet us by these we were dragged up out of reach of the sea and on staggering to my feet i had the satisfaction of seeing the man who had jumped overboard from the wreck being hauled on board again loud were the thanks and praises i received for my conduct in bringing the other on shore but without waiting to listen to them i hastily explained that i would try to take a line on board the wreck as if i could succeed in this there might possibly be some chance of saving the major portion if not the whole of the crew accordingly i dashed into the surf once more and at length after the most superhuman efforts though the distance was barely thirty yards i reached the ships side and was drawn on board by a line which her crew threw to me the men crowded round me rapidly talking in some language which i could not understand and looking as much relieved as though i had the power of taking them all on my back at once and swimming on shore with them i stood for a moment to recover my breath and at the same time looked about to see what resources might be at my command i noticed a towing hawser coiled away upon what had originally been the deckhouse forward but which was now stove in and battered almost out of recognition an eye was spliced in one end of this hawser and taking it up i signed to the men to pass it over the stump of the foremast they understood me and seeing my object in wishing it done they had it over in a twinkling in another moment they had the heavy coil capsized the other end bent on to the line which i had brought on board with me and were paying it rapidly over the side as i turned to address the master of the vessel who i noticed as i was hauled up the side was then standing at the break of the poop issuing instructions to his crew i saw him in the act of descending the poopladder and i stepped towards him at this moment the ship was lifted up by a perfect mountain of a sea and hove over on her beamends all hands of us were flung violently to leeward and before apparently any of us had time to recover our feet another sea swept down upon us there was a terrifican earsplitting crash a wild agonised cry and i found myself clear of the wreck struggling wildly for life with the body of the master within arms length of me he was apparently dead and floating face downwards but i grasped him by the hair turned him on his back and struck out for the beach twice were we flung like corks upon the pebbles of the strand and twice dragged off into deep water again by the merciless undertow the first time i dug my fingers knees and the toes of my boots into the pebbles in the hope of bringing myself and my senseless charge to an anchor but i might as well have attempted to grasp the air the whole of that portion of the beach which was exposed to the action of the sea was a vast moving mass the shingle being alternately thrown up and sucked back again in tons as the water hurled itself high upon the beach and then rushed back into the foaming abyss the second time we were thrown up with such violence that i was stunned but the third time the brave fellows on the beach who had been making the most frantic efforts to get at us would take no denial they watched their chance and as they saw us again drifting in two with ropes round their waists rushed into the sea grasped us one each firmly round the body and though they were lifted off their feet and dragged away to seaward like feathers by the retiring breaker never let go their hold until we were hauled up high and dry clear beyond the reach of the heaviest wave the efforts made to restore me to consciousness were soon successful but my fellowsufferer the master of the vessel appeared to be seriously injured it was nearly half an hour before the faintest signs of returning animation were perceived and when at length consciousness returned the poor fellow appeared to be suffering the most excruciating agony as soon as i was once more able to look about me i found that the wave which had washed the master and me overboard had broken the wreck in two just abaft the mainmast flinging the stern portion much nearer the shore whilst it had turned the other half fairly bottom up precipitating of course all the poor fellows who were so busy paying out the hawser into the sea the people on the beach watched eagerly for their reappearance above water but not one of them was ever seen again it afterwards transpired that there was not a swimmer amongst the entire crew which all told amounted to fifteen hands the intelligence of a wreck had attracted a large concourse of people to the spot notwithstanding the discomfort attendant on being abroad in so violent a gale and one gentleman had taken upon himself to despatch omnibuses from the town well supplied with blankets etc for the relief and benefit of any poor sufferers who might reach the shore alive into one of these vehicles the unfortunate master of the ship was now placed with the utmost care a couch being extemporised for him in the bottom of the bus by piling together all the blankets which had been sent in spite however of the utmost care in driving the jolts were frequent and sometimes rather heavy and the poor fellows groans indicated such intensity of suffering that by the time we were half way to town i decided i would take him to my own house whereby he would be spared nearly half an hour of anguish it fortunately happened that just as i had come to this resolution a gentleman rode up and learning who we had inside volunteered his services i immediately accepted them desiring him to ride back to the town and despatch to my house the ablest physician he could find when the bus drew up at our door the doctor was there in readiness for his patient whom we lifted out apparently in the last stage of exhaustion and carried carefully into the house and upstairs into my own room where my sister advertised by bob who had made the best of his way home on foot had a cheerful fire blazing in the grate hot water in abundance and everything else ready that her womanly sympathy could suggest volume one chapter ii the secret the doctor remained with the sick man more than half an hour and when i heard his footstep descending the staircase i went out and met him the poor fellow is sinking rapidly said he in reply to my inquiries he has received severe internal injuries and is bleeding to death inwardly i can do nothing absolutely nothing for him keep him quiet and humour him as much as you can excitement of any kind will only hasten his dissolution i cheerfully promised to do all i could for the dying man and the doctor took his leave promising to call again the last thing in the evening as soon as the doctor was out of the house i went upstairs and into the sickroom where i found the patient in bed and bob with his boots off gliding as quietly about the room as a trained hospital nurse doing all he could to contribute to the comfort of his charge the opening of the door attracted the sick mans attention and he feebly turned his head in my direction as soon as he recognised me he beckoned me to approach and i drew a chair to the side of the bed asking him how he felt like one whose moments are numbered replied he in perfectly pure english but with a sonorous ring in the articulation of the words which betrayed the fact that he was not speaking in his mother tongue senor he continued i am dying the doctor has candidly told me so though i needed no such assurance from him the dreadful pangs which shoot through my tortured frame are such as no man could long endure and live i am a true catholic senor and i would fain see a priest or some good man of my own creed that i may confess and clear my guilty soul from the stains which a life of sinful indulgence and contempt of heavens laws has polluted it with i know there are many of my faith in england it may be that there are some in this place know you of any such i replied that there certainly was a catholic church in the town but it was situated at some distance from the house in which he now lay consequently it would perhaps be an hour before the priest could be found and brought to him but added i i will send for him forthwith and until he arrive i will sit here and keep you company so saying i called bob on one side and directed him to proceed as quickly as possible into town and bring the reverend father without a moments delay to the house as soon as bob had departed i resumed my seat by the bedside extending his burning hand towards me he clasped mine and endeavoured to raise it to his lips senor said he since it is the will of god that i am to die i can but bow to that will in submission but i would i could have been spared for a few years to testify my gratitude to you for your brave and noble efforts in behalf of my crew and myselfmy poor people my poor people he sobbedall all lost he was silent for nearly five minutes and i took advantage of the opportunity to explain to him that what i had done was no more than any other englishman would do if he had the power under similar circumstances that such conduct was thought nothing of among our nation being regarded as simply a duty which each man owed to every other in like circumstances of distress with his own i knowi know replied he the english are as generous as they are brave but still i would i had it in my power to express my thanks otherwise than in words but i am alone in the world which i am so soon to leave not one have i of my own name or blood to whom i can bequeath my debt of gratitude and when my ship went to pieces today she was my own property senor i became a beggar i have not so much property left as will pay the expenses of my burial and here i lie indebted to a stranger and that stranger a foreigner for the shelter which covers my dying head as i soon shall be for the coffin and the grave which await my lifeless clay i was beginning to say something with the intention of diverting his mind from so painful a train of thought when he interrupted me eagerly and yet continued he poor as i am it is in my power to make you richay beyond the utmost scope of your imagination and i will i will why should i take this secret to the grave with me in a few hours i shall be beyond the want of earthly riches but you senor are young and look forward to a long life doubtless like other men you have already indulged in many a bright daydream which the possession of wealth would go far to realise listen gentil senor i must be brief for i feel that i have no time to lose i have been shipwrecked once before it is now nearly three years ago since i sailed from valparaiso for canton whence we were to proceed to bombay and so home round the cape of good hope i was then chief mate we met with nothing but calms for the first three weeks of our passage after which the weather changed and we had a succession of adverse gales until we were within fifteen degrees of the line here we were worse off than ever for at one moment we were lying in a glassy calm and perhaps in five minutes afterwards were under closereefed canvas or possibly bare poles at length a furious squall threw the ship on her beamends and we were compelled to cut away all three of her masts to save her from foundering and then the squall settled down into a perfect hurricane and we could do nothing but suffer the ship to drive dead before it near midnight we were flung violently to the deck by a tremendous shock the ship was on shore dashing her bottom out upon the rocks and it was so dark senor that we were unable to see each other oh the horror of that night it is as fresh upon me now as it was at the moment that it happened the poor fellows face was streaming with perspiration i begged he would not distress himself by recalling such painful recollections but in spite of my remonstrance he continued his story the ship broke up beneath our feet and i found myself swimming i knew not where in the midst of a quantity of floating wreck to a piece of which i clung i was surrounded on every side by breakers but not far from me i could perceive by the absence of the phosphorescence that the water was smooth i urged myself and the plank to which i clung in that direction and soon reached the smooth water after which i suffered myself to drift the water was quite warm and i experienced no inconvenience whatever from my immersion after the lapse of perhaps an hour possibly more i felt the ground beneath my feet and staggering out of the water i flung myself upon the dry land and notwithstanding the howling of the wind and the roar of the breakers i fell into a deep and dreamless sleep when i awoke the sun was beating fiercely down upon my uncovered head the sky was cloudless and a calm had succeeded to the gale of the night before i rose to my feet and on looking about me discovered that i had been cast upon one of those coral islands which so thickly stud some portions of the pacific i wasas i am nowthe only one who escaped the wreck alive the bodies of my shipmates lay scattered along the shore and a long and arduous day was spent in burying them where they lay in such shallow graves as i could scoop in the sand with the aid of a piece of splintered plank the beach was strewed with wreckage which had been washed over the reef and into the smooth water and i was overjoyed to find amongst this the longboat perfectly uninjured in her i visited the scene of the wreck and there after diligent search i found the means and a sufficiency of appropriate materials to enable me to fit her for a lengthened voyage i was more than two months on the island before my preparations were complete for life was very enjoyable in that delightful spot and i felt in no hurry to get away at length whilst walking along the beach one evening my attention was attracted to three or four pieces of old wormeaten weatherworn timber which i had often noticed before projecting above the sand and curiosity now impelled me to walk up to and examine them a careful scrutiny revealed to me that they formed part of the framework of a ship and i resolved that i would return the next day and ascertain whether what i saw was merely a detached piece of wreck or whether the entire hull lay there embedded in the sand the next morning i repaired to the spot armed with a primitive substitute for a shovel which i had contrived to manufacture and an iron bolt to serve the purpose of a crowbar which i had procured the previous night by burning it out of a piece of wreck i had worked for perhaps an hour when i reached some planking which i immediately recognised as the deck of the ship this i proceeded to clear of sand uncovering the deck in an extending circle from the spot where i had first encountered it until i had an area of about fifteen or sixteen feet laid bare and now i met with a breach in the deck so instead of clearing away further i began to dig down again i toiled thus for four days senor by which time i had discovered that the wreck was that of a small vessel of perhaps one hundred and thirty tons though small as she was she had been built with a full poop that she was a very ancient craft indeed and that her cargo consisted of nothing but gold senor that is with the solitary exception of a strong wooden box which even after so long an interment offered considerable resistance to my efforts to open it containing an assortment of what i took to be pebbles of different kinds but which i afterwards found were unpolished gems yes senor there lay the gold in ingots each wrapped in matting and each ingot as much in weight as i could well lift the matting was decayed in the first three or four tiers and the metal discoloured almost to blackness but towards the centre of the cargo which is probably not more than twelve tiers deep altogether the matting though so rotten that it crumbled to dust as i touched it had preserved the colour of the metal and there it lay bar after bar gleaming with the dull yellow lustre peculiar to virgin gold i ballasted my boat entirely with ingots selecting the most discoloured i could reach so that they might be less easily recognisable as gold and the risk i ran of being ultimately robbed of them reduced in the same proportion i also took a few of the pebbles as i thought them out of the box after which i set to work to cover in the whole once more i completed my task by burning down the timbers which had at first attracted my attention and which i found were a portion of her stern frame so that nothing remained above the surface of the sand to betray the whereabouts of my treasure i then carefully marked the spot in such a manner that i could find it again and completed my preparations for departure with all speed i had been at sea ten days when i was taken ill whether it was the effect of excitement or exposure i know not but i fell into a raging fever which left me almost at the point of death i was so weak that i had not strength to crawl to the watercask and the feeble efforts i made to reach it so exhausted me that at length i fell in a swoon to the bottom of the boat in this condition i was discovered by a passing ship the crew of which took me on board but as a smart breeze happened to be blowing at the time they would not wait to hoist in my boat and she was set adrift with enough gold on board her to have purchased a principality regrets were useless and the loss heavy as it was troubled me little i knew where to find sufficient to satisfy my utmost needs at length i reached home and by the merest accident bethought myself one day of my pebbles i suspected they were valuable or they would not have been found where they were judge of my surprise when i learned that the four i had left for i lost the rest somewhere were worth a sufficient sum to enable me to do exactly what i wished viz buy a ship of my own i did so and was on my way in her to my treasureisland when the gale sprung up which has reduced me to my present condition and now senor i am about to put you in possession of such information as will enable you to find my island it is in latitude abouts and in longitude aboutw as nearly as i had the means of ascertaining and is uninhabited and i should say unknown for during my entire stay there i never observed one solitary sign of mans foot having ever pressed the soil you will readily recognise the island from the fact that it has a remarkable isolated group of seven cocoanut trees growing closely together on the extreme northernmost point of the island the central tree of this group and one of the others bears a mark made by the removal of a piece of bark as large as a mans two hands when you have identified these trees walk away from them keeping them in one until you open clear of the trees on the southern end of the island a portion of the reef which you will observe just rising above the waters edge when you have done this you will be standing as nearly as possible immediately above the hole in the deck of the wreck through which i burrowed to her golden cargo the spaniard for such i found him to be then went on to describe the manner in which i should find the passage through the reef into the lagoon giving me as much information as he could from memory of the various dangers to be avoided he had carefully prepared a chart of the channel before leaving the island but this was on board the vessel he had just lost i could see that the excitement produced by so much talking was fearfully reducing his strength and i more than once endeavoured to persuade him to postpone the completion of his narrative but he was sensible that he had but a short time to live and so anxious was he to give me all the information necessary to enable me to discover this strangely buried treasure that my endeavour to stop him did more harm even than the talking so i was compelled perforce to suffer him to proceed and though i felt it my duty to urge him not to excite himself i must confess that i was deeply interested to learn how i might become possessed of the wealth to which he had referred in such glowing terms for since it was manifest that he could not live to enjoy it himself and as he had declared he had no relative in the world i thought i might as well become his heir he continued to talk for some time longer until he had explained to me everything he could think of which would facilitate my efforts to reach the buried treasure and then with a sigh of mingled exhaustion and relief he closed his eyes and seemed to sink into a half sleep from which he roused himself at frequent intervals to crave the refreshment of a draught of lemonade at length the sound of carriage wheels was heard and almost immediately afterwards bob returned accompanied by the catholic priest the sick man opened his eyes and feebly welcomed the good old man who had so readily answered his appeal for spiritual consolation i then retired leaving them alone to engage in the most solemn rite appertaining to their religion rather more than an hour elapsed before i was recalled to the sickroom when i stood once more at the bedside of the dying spaniard i saw that he had but a few minutes longer to live he was so weak the clergyman said that it was with the utmost difficulty he had succeeded in expressing his wish to see me again before he died as i drew near his eye brightened and a faint smile of welcome lighted up his face his lips moved but so faint was the whisper which escaped them that i was obliged to bow my face close to his ere i could distinguish the words with a painful effort he gasped senor promise me that if you succeed you will have two hundred masses said for my soul when i assured him that his request should be faithfully complied with the contracted brow relaxed the expression of anxiety vanished and in its place a smile of satisfaction and perfect happiness slowly spread itself over the pinched and pallid features where the next moment it was indelibly fixed by the hand of death i have dwelt at such length upon this introductory episode of my story that i must now turn the hands up and make sail in earnest for we have a voyage of many thousands of miles before us and like all thorough seamen having once shipped for the voyage we are impatience personified until the anchor is atrip the canvas sheeted home the watch set and the lively little barkie dashing merrily away over the heaving billows her snowy canvas gleaming in the setting sun and the cliffs of old england fast fading into purple mist astern volume one chapter iii bobs proposition after we had reverently laid the spaniard to rest in his alien grave i gave my friend bob a full and accurate account of all that had passed showing him at the same time the copious notes i had at the earliest opportunity jotted down to assist and refresh my memory in case i should ever find myself in a position to seek the hidden treasure but it is now necessary that i should introduce the dramatis persona who have already cast their shadows on the curtain and this i will do with all possible brevity place aux dames ada collingwood my darling and only sister was at this time approaching her seventeenth year and was a dainty specimen of lovely girlhood just budding into still lovelier womanhood her figure was petite promising in due time to develop into the most faultless perfection of shape and her laughing blue eyes and rich profusion of silky golden hair set off to perfection a face which perhaps no one would have dreamed of calling beautiful any more than they would have dreamed of denying that it was charmingly piquant and irresistibly pretty her temper was equable she was gifted with a rich flow of animal spirits and a keen perception of the ludicrous which would have upset the gravity of the most confirmed hypochondriac nevertheless if occasion required it her merry ringing laugh could be hushed her joyous elasticity of movement could be subdued and no one better than she could assume the role of the sicknurse or the tender and sympathising confidante of distress and lastly she adored with a blind unreasoning idolatry for which there was no excuse your humble servant her unworthy brother of myself it becomes me not to say very much i was just turned twentyone six feet high and vanity whispered in confirmation of my sisters energetic and oftrepeated assertions a trifle more than moderately goodlooking i was an only son as my sister was an only daughter and i had received my education at the royal naval school at greenwich with the understanding that i was to join my father on its completion when he would continue and finish what is there so well begun thus making me every inch a sailor on leaving school i joined my father who was master and part owner of a fine dashing clipper in the capacity of midshipman and went some six or seven voyages with him on the last of which or rather a few days after its termination i was seized with a violent attack of rheumatic fever from which i had not recovered sufficiently to rejoin the ship by the time that she was once more ready for sea i was consequently left at home under adas care my dear mother had been dead some years to recover at leisure and amuse myself as well as i could until another voyage should be accomplished and an opportunity once more offered for me to repossess myself of my quarters in the old familiar berth that opportunity never arrived for at the time my story opens my father had been two years missing he sailed from canton with the first cargo of the new seasons teas and from the moment that the good ship disappeared seaward she had never been heard of not the faintest trace of a clue to the mystery of her fate having so far been discovered bob trunnion was a middleaged man of medium stature great personal strength and no very marked pretensions to beauty but he was as thorough an old seadog as ever looked upon salt water his visage was burnt to a deep brickred by years of exposure to all sorts of weather and his hair and beard which had once been brown were now changed to the hue of old oakum by the same process except where here and there a slight sprinkling of grey discovered itself he had been a sailor almost all his life having crept in through the hawsepipe when he was only twelve years old since when by close application and perseverance he had gradually worked his way aft to the quarterdeck he joined my fathers ship as second mate on the same voyage as i did and on the following voyage took the chief mates berth in place of a man whom my father was compelled to discharge for confirmed drunkenness the last time that my poor father passed down channel outwardbound bob had the misfortune as we thought it then to fall off the poop and break his arm it was what the surgeons call a compound fracture and certainly looked to be a very ugly one so as the ship happened at the time to be off saint albans head my father ran into weymouth roads and sent bob ashore to our house to be cured and to bear me company shipping in his stead the second mate and picking up a new second mate somewhere about the town thus it happened that bob and i old shipmates as we were happened to be both away from our ship when her mysterious fate overtook her as soon as we were both recovered we sought and obtained berths always in the same ship for short voyages returning home about once in every six weeks or two months with the hope of hearing either that my father had returned or that some news had arrived of him for the last twelve months we had abandoned the former hope but the latter would probably be many years before it finally took its flight this introduction and explanation are necessary to the understanding of what is to follow and now having fairly weathered them both we may take up the thread of the story and follow it out to the end without further interruption i have already said that i took an early opportunity to give bob a detailed account of the spaniards revelation to me this was on the evening of the day on which we laid the poor fellow in his grave and i told my story while we and my sister were seated comfortably round the fire after tea with the curtains drawn close and everything made snug for the night bob listened with the utmost attention to my story as did also my sister occasionally requesting me to say that again as some point in the narrative was reached which he wished to bear particularly in mind and when i had finished he sat for some time staring meditatively between the bars of the grate at length well harry my lad what do you intend to do said he that replied i is just the point upon which i want your advice if this story be true no fear about that said bob its true enough the things as plain and circumstantial as the ships course when its pricked off upon the chart there aint a kink in the yarn from end to end its all coiled down as neat and snug as a new hawser in the ropemakers yard and besides dyin men dont spin yarns with no truth in em just for divarsions sake like well said i i am disposed with you to think that the story is quite true the man could have no object in telling it if it were not so the question is what is to be done in the matter done exclaimed ada why what should be done harry except that you go to this island dig up the gold bring it home and live like a gentleman ever afterwards this was adas great ambition that i should be placed in the position of a gentleman she had a theorywhence derived i know notthat it was my destiny to become a man of unbounded means and that my life was to be passed in an atmosphere of splendour and luxury only equalled by that enjoyed by the most favoured heroes of the arabian nights and this was an entirely disinterested feeling on her part too for though she would often laughingly prophesy what would happen when i should become a rich man i never knew her to utter a word which suggested the idea that she would in any way be a gainer by my acquisition of wealth more easily said than done pet replied i patting her soft cheek what is to become of you whilst i am gone why i shall stay here with mrs moseley our housekeeper until your return and be the first to welcome you back said she well replied i i think suitable arrangements for your comfort and safety could be made without much difficulty but said i appealing to bob how is this gold to be got at and brought home in safety i have not the means of purchasing a ship of my own and if i had do you think it would be safe to trust so much treasure with a crew picked up though ever so carefully ah now you pawls me replied bob rubbing the back of his head reflectively ive sailed with crews as you might ha trusted with untold gold at least ive thowt so at the time i was with em but mayhap if temptation was throwed in their way they mightnt be able to stand out agin it theres no gettin to the bottom o the heart o man as to the ship thats easy enough if you aint got the cash to buy you can always charter true said i and if i could make sure of finding a sufficient number of thorough good men that is the course i should be inclined to pursue do you think bob that by diligent search we could find some six or eight really reliable men the craft need not be a large one you know there youve hit the solution of the enigmy as the schoolmaster said replied bob bringing his clenched fist down upon my knee with an emphasis which impressed me for the remainder of the evening how much of that gold now do you reckon would make your fortune lad youre pretty good at figures just cipher it up and lets hear how much exclaimed i oh a very small portion of the whole cargo would satisfy me if i had it here at this moment how much persisted bob would a ton of it be enough for you boy yes indeed laughed i a ton of pure goldwhy what do you suppose that would be worth bob haint much of a idee replied he a ton of pure gold said i is worth over one hundred thousand pounds bob i believe one hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds is nearer its value though i cannot say for certain then said bob if we can manage to get say a couple of tons of it home you will be satisfiedeh perfectly i replied but how do you propose to accomplish this for i saw he had a scheme to bring forward nothing easier replied bob build a little craft big enough to accommodate the two of us with room to stow away our grub and water and the two tons of gold and up anchor and away but said i you forget that this island is somewhere in the pacific such a craft as you speak of would be totally unfit for the voyage we contemplate why inquired bob why repeated i astonished at the question simply because we should never get across the bay of biscay in her to say nothing of the remainder of the voyage why not demanded bob rather pugnaciously do you mean to say i retorted that you can sit there and propose in cold blood such a hairbrained scheme as that we two should undertake a voyage to the pacific in a mere boat i do replied bob emphatically thats a simple way out of all your difficulties the craft will be your own there will be no risk of the crew rising upon us for the sake of our cargo and nobody to say what are we doing here or what do you want there why it will be a mere pleasure trip from end to end all play and no work leastways none to speak on but my dear fellow do be serious protested i you know as well as i do that we should be swamped the first time we fell in with a capful of wind maybe we should if we went to work like a couple of knownothing landlubbers retorted bob but if we went to work like seamen as we are i should like to know whats to purvent our sailing round the world if we like answer me that come bob old man let us hear the full extent of your proposition said i i know that whatever it may be it will be the proposal of a thorough seaman for if any one could carry out the wild scheme you have suggested you are the man taint such a very wild scheme neither replied bob answer me this how many people was saved from the london when she foundered in the bay of biscay nineteen if i remember rightly replied i very well now if a small boat of about twentyfive feet long or thereabouts open mind you from stem to starn could live twenty hours with nineteen people in her as the londons pinnace did in weather that the old ship herself couldnt stand up agin how long will a fulldecked boat of say thirty to thirtyfive feet long carefully constructed and in good trim live with only two men in her and warnt i continued he nineteen days alone in an open boat in the south atlantic and didnt i make a vyge of a thousand miles in her afore i struck soundings at saint helena this last question referred to an adventure which had befallen bob in his younger days on an occasion when he had been cruelly deserted in a sinking ship by the rest of the crew and had made his escape as described by himself after enduring unheardof suffering then questioned i you seriously entertain the belief that the scheme you have suggested is practicable with ease and comfort replied bob now look here harry you can afford to build a craft such as i have described and fit her out for the vyge and still leave money enough at home to keep saucebox here indicating ada who was to him as the apple of his eye comfortable and happy like till we come back youve a rare eye for a seaboat and mine aint bad for that matter lets draught her out ourselves since its our own lives as we are going to trust in her and if we dont turn out between us as pretty a seaboat as ever floated why turn to and lay me up in ordinary for the rest of my days for a useless old hulk thats all a boat thirty feet long decked all over and carefully designed cant sink boy because we can easily arrange matters so as to keep her dry inside shell ride as light as a gull and as dry as a bone when big ships is making bad weather of it and as for the matter of capsizing bein run down or cast away why theyre dangers as we are liable to in any ship and must be guarded against in every craft large or small and our little barkie would carry comfortable all we should want for the vyge for we could touch here and there out and home to make good deficiencies and we two are men enough to handle her in all weathers rig her as a cutter boy i was oncet aboard a cutter yacht in a trip up the mediterranean and youve no idea what a handy rig it is once youre used to it and the way them cutters ll hug the windwhy twould make a difference of nigh on a couple of thousand miles out and home in the length of the passage i began to be infected with bobs enthusiasm the scheme which had at first appeared to me as the very acme of foolhardiness now under the influence of bobs eloquence gradually assumed an appearance of reasonableness and a promising prospect of success which was very fascinating nevertheless i could not but remember that the proposed voyage would take us into latitudes subject to the most frightful and sudden tempests and i could not help thinking as i pointed out to bob that our cockleshell would stand but a poor chance in a cyclone or a black squall look here harry my boy remarked bob gravely as i propose to ship on this here vyge as chief mate i aint likely to forget that theres such dangers as them youve just mentioned but suppose you was to cork up a bottle or clap the lid on an empty biscuittin and heave em overboard do you think theyd live through one or tother in course they would because salt water cant get inside of em and as long as they keep dry holds theyll float let the weather be what it will and so ll our craft for the same reason and when the weathers too bad to sail the barkie we can heave her to and when its too bad for that we can anchor her my boy go below slide on the top of the companion and turn in until the weather clears up but said i we cannot anchor in the middle of the atlantic suppose we should be caught in a cyclone there for instance we can anchor there lad with a floating anchor which will keep her head to wind and with everything snug aloft and on deck and a floatinganchor ahead with about sixty fathoms of cable veered out she would ride out in safety any gale that ever blew out of the heavens this last remark closed the case and secured a verdict for the defendant i knew that every word bob spoke was literally true and the audacity of the enterprise so fascinated me that i resolved on the spot to undertake it if it should be found on going into details that a craft capable of being handled by our two selves could stow away without being overloaded such provisions etc as we should need for the voyage the following morning immediately after breakfast i got out my drawingboard strained a sheet of paper upon it and with bob at my side to give me the benefit of his opinion upon every line i traced upon the paper set to in earnest to design the little craft in which we proposed to embark on our adventurous voyage before putting a line upon paper however we settled the plan of her internal arrangements it was our intention to make her lines as fine as her respective dimensions would permit she was to be in fact a small yacht we knew that every vessel with sharp lines must necessarily be wet unless the weights she would have to carry were all concentrated about her midship section or broadest part so we decided that as far as was practicable such should be the arrangement with us and we knew that if we could succeed in this our barkie might be as sharp as we could make her and still be dry and comfortable we accordingly prepared a list of our requirements as far as we could think of them calculated the space they and the ballast would occupy and then roughly sketched out the proposed lines these were altered rearranged and improved upon time after time until at length we felt we had got them as near perfection as the dimensions of the boat and our own knowledge would carry us and i may as well say at once that throughout the entire voyage we never had the slightest reason to think our little vessel could be in any way improved upon by alteration it is not probable that so long a voyage as ours will be often undertaken again in such a very small craft as we accomplished it in but there are many men i have no doubt who would gladly receive a hint as to the most advantageous form for a small boat in which they might safely adventure alone or with a friend a cruise say round the british isles or across the channel and along the french coast and therefore as this story is written for the amusement only of such people as love boats i think i may venture to trespass so far on my readers patience as to give such a hint in the shape of a brief description of the water lily as ada christened her she was then thirtysix feet long and twelve feet beam on the waterline but in designing her midship section we caused her sides to swell out boldly above water so that her greatest beam was fourteen feet at a point one foot six inches above the waterline at this point her side tumbled home two inches as it was carried upwards to her deck and from the same point the side curved quickly inwards and downwards until it met the waterline when it swept under water with an almost imperceptible curve for some distance and then took a moderately quick bend downwards to meet her keel this gave us a vessel in shape very much like the centreboard model of boat but with a deep keel and consequently great lateral resistance and space low down in the hull for the stowage of ballast we thus secured a very small displacement a light buoyant hull extraordinary stability and a fair amount of power the hull was divided into three compartments by bulkheads with wide doors which if necessary we could close watertight in the fore compartment we decided to place nothing except the smallest and lightest cookingstove we could find in the midship compartment it was intended to stow our ballast watertank provisions the chaincables and in fact everything which we could possibly place there leaving only a narrow passage amidships to pass to and fro the after compartment we intended to make our cabin and there we arranged also to sling our hammocks it will easily be understood that there was not an inch of spare room anywhere but as our lives would be spent almost entirely on deck we did not mind that very much having designed our craft the next question was who should build her bob was strongly in favour of having her built in the town so that we might oversee the laying of every plank and the driving of every nail but i knew there were firms who could safely be trusted to honestly put the best of work and material into the little vessel without being watched and i determined to put her into the hands of a very celebrated firm of london boat builders accordingly bob and i ran up to town taking my sister with us for a holiday and on the morning after our arrival having seen ada safely disposed of for the day with some friends of ours we two men set out for the buildingyard i placed our design in the hands of the principal telling him at the same time that we wanted a boat of those dimensions and if possible built on those lines and that she was intended to keep at sea in all weathers he looked rather surprised at the last stipulation but after carefully examining the drawing and asking us our reasons for certain little peculiarities of shape he confessed that as far as his experience went he could frankly say he had never seen a model better adapted for the purpose and yet gentlemen said he she will be wonderfully fast for in the first place her hull is of such a shape that it will offer but a trifling resistance to forward motion and in the next place these overhanging topsides will give her such extraordinary stability as soon as she begins to heel over that you will be able to carry enormous sails we were very glad to hear our own judgment thus confirmed by a man part of whose business it was to form a correct opinion with respect to the points upon which he had touched and we said as much he took a great deal of interest in what must after all have been a very trifling matter to him and both bob and i had reason often afterwards to congratulate ourselves that we had confided the building of our boat to such good hands he proposed that she should be composite built that is that for the sake of lightness and strength combined her frame should be of steel with an inner skin of thin steel plate and an outer planking of two thicknesses of mahogany the ribs were to be arranged diagonally crossing the keel at an angle of fortyfive degrees and intersecting each other at right angles thus converting her entire frame into a sort of latticework girder it was arranged that all the fastenings of the inner thickness of planking should be of iron whilst the outside planks should be secured with copper fastenings the utmost care was exercised and as experience proved with complete success to prevent the slightest approach to galvanic action and one of the precautions taken was i remember well the painting of the inner planking with melted indiarubber which was laid on coat after coat until there was about onesixteenth of an inch of the rubber between the outer and inner planks as we did not intend to sail until the following summer the builder had about eight months in which to put our little ship together a circumstance at which he expressed great satisfaction as he said it would enable him to pick and choose his materials and put careful work into her we arranged at the same time for the construction of a boat to take with us as we felt that in the event of any untoward accident happening we ought to have something to take to for the saving of our lives and we knew also that there would be many occasions when we should require something to answer the purposes which a boat answers with regard to a ship the designing of this boat was beset by difficulties all originating in one viz want of space in which to stow her to think of carrying her on deck was out of the question as the deck was not spacious enough in the first place to receive such a boat as we wanted and even had it been there was no chance of its remaining there it would have been carried away by the first sea which swept over us we required something large enough to carry us both and a stock of provisions in addition so that should it be necessary to abandon the water lily we might hope to reach land or fall in with a ship we also wanted something that should be essentially a lifeboat whilst she should also be very fast how to obtain all these desiderata and at the same time overcome the difficulty in respect to room we knew not but resolved not to be baffled we set our wits to work and at length schemed out a design of an exceedingly novel character which proved in all respects a most brilliant success two hollow steel cylinders of very thin metal twentysix feet long and one foot diameter in the centre tapering gradually away to nothing at each end were constructed in thirteen lengths of two feet each these lengths being of different diameters stowed one within the other thus taking up very little room indeed in either end of each length was inserted a narrow band of metal thick enough to allow of a worm and screw so that all the lengths of each cylinder could be screwed together perfectly watertight a light steel framework of simple arrangement connected the two cylinders together at a distance of six feet apart with their centre lines parallel and supported at a height of two feet above the top of the cylinders a light stage ten feet long and six feet wide on the top of the stage and connected with the framework was a step for a mast and a gammoniron for a bowsprit and underneath the stage was a centreboard which we could lower or raise at pleasure a broad rudder fixed to the afterpart of the stage completed the design we spent a fortnight in london and having witnessed the laying of the water lilys keel and inspected some of the timber which the builder proposed to use in her construction i saw ada safe home again leaving bob in london to look out for a ship which when i rejoined him a couple of days afterwards he had found we shipped in her for a voyage to constantinople and trebizond which occupied us for eight months and when we returned to london on the termination of this voyage we found the water lily completed with the exception of a few finishing touches which the workmen were then giving her volume one chapter iv our trial trip mr wood as we will call him for the sake of giving the gentleman a name took us into his office and there laid before us a sail draught which he had carefully prepared for the guidance of the sailmaker in making the water lilys sails you have never told me gentlemen said he why you are having this little craft built but the great pains which you have taken in the preparation of her design and the whole tenour of your remarks when giving us the order to build her impressed me at the time with a conviction that her destiny is to be something beyond that of most vessels of her size as we proceeded with our work i could not fail to be struck as you will perhaps remember i was at my first glance at your drawing with the fact that whilst she is eminently calculated to prove a wonderfully fine little seaboat she is equally certain to develop most extraordinary sailing powers and so great is the interest i take in her that i could not be satisfied with intrusting the preparation of her sail draught to any other than myself for i foresee that she will in all probability become a public character so to speak and in that capacity she will undoubtedly reflect great credit on her builders i have therefore calculated with the utmost nicety the proportion of her various sails so that they may take effect to the greatest advantage and this is the result of my labours producing at the same time the drawing to which i have referred i must confess that for my own part i was staggered at the enormous spread of canvas mr wood proposed to pile upon our little boat but he declared that she would carry it with the greatest ease in fact said he i have kept rather within the limit of her powers bearing in mind a remark you made to the effect that she would have to keep to sea in all weathers and so confident am i that she is not oversailed that if you find i am wrong i undertake to bear all the expense of a new outfit of sails and the necessary reduction of spars with regard to your boat though to my mind she looks much more like an ingeniously designed raft the idea is so new that i cannot take it upon myself to utter an opinion about her though i can see no reason why she should not be as fast as she undoubtedly is safe we sent off the saildrawing to lapthorn of gosport determined to have the best made suit of sails it was possible to procure with instructions to prepare them without delay and then started off by the first train to weymouth i found my dear sister safe and well and more lovely than ever but her spirits were subdued by contemplation of the dangers attending the voyage upon which we were now so soon to embark the poor girl had been thinking of little else it seemed during our absence until the liveliest alarm had taken the place of that confidence with which she had viewed the expedition when it was first broached but bob and i had talked matters over together in many a quiet nightwatch canvassing the various emergencies which might arise and the best mode of meeting them and we were now confident that with only the ordinary perils of the ocean to contend with our adventure was not only feasible but that it would certainly be crowned with success and so we were well prepared to do battle with adas apprehensions which we did so vigorously that we at length succeeded in restoring in a great measure the confidence she had lost we arranged after a considerable amount of discussion that our own house should be let furnished as it was during my absence and that my sister should take up her quarters with an aunt who resided on the esplanade mrs moseley accompanying her with unlimited leave of absence from time to time to visit her own relatives these arrangements completed bob and i set out for london again to superintend the rigging of our boat and to bring her round to weymouth from whence we intended to take our final departure on our arrival we found the little craft already in the water with her mast stepped and her ballast which was of lead cast to fit the shape of her bottom in a portion of her ballast consisting of a piece of lead weighing five hundredweight was let into her keel about the midship section and this with two tons of lead inside we thought would prove sufficient after our cargo was stowed part of this cargo we intended to take from london with us viz the watertank filled second suit of sails and flyingkites in the shape of spinnaker jibtopsail squareheaded gafftopsail etc also a fourpound rifle gun with a stock of powder and shot and a few percussion shells these we decided to take in case of our being obliged to assume a warlike attitude towards any savages we might come into contact with as we had heard that the natives of some of the pacific islands are particularly ferocious and require to be dealt with promptly we also provided ourselves with a couple of airguns of improved construction and decidedly formidable character four sixchambered revolving rifles and the same number of revolver pistols also a small but excellent chest of carpenters tools a medicinechest etc but when these and our boat were all stowed away there still remained more room than i expected in our midship compartment and the little craft floated with her loadline nearly a foot above the waters edge i proposed ballasting her down to her proper depth with sandbags but bob seemed anxious to test her sailcarrying powers light as she was urging that though we should start well down in the water she would lift as our provisions grew short and it was desirable to know by experiment beforehand how far we could lighten her with safety our sails had arrived and we proceeded to bend these forthwith and set them as the weather being fine with light air a very favourable opportunity offered for stretching them gently and uniformly we were as pleased with these sails as we were with the hull of our little craft they were perfect masterpieces of the sailmakers art the jibs being angulated and the mainsail squareheaded gafftopsail and trysail being made with gored cloths this latter arrangement was an extravagant one as to the amount of cloth used in the making of each sail but we were more than repaid for it by the perfection of set in the sails which stood as flat as boards our stormsails were made of stout canvas and the fineweather ones of american cotton canvas a most beautiful material extremely light yet so close woven that not a breath of the faintest breeze was lost and they were white as snow our standing rigging was of wire this being lighter and offering less windage than hemprigging of the same strength but in order to counteract its rigidity and give play to the spars we adopted the expedient of connecting the deadeyes to the chainplates by a bolt and shackle arrangement interposing a thick indiarubberwasher between the shackle and the bolthead this plan answered most admirably and i would strongly recommend it to all users of wirerigging i am confident that in a fresh breeze and a chopping sea we gained fully a knot per hour in speed by it whilst our sails were stretching bob and i occupied our time in looking about us for a few things which we thought we could better obtain in london than anywhere else amongst these was a couple of air mattresses for our hammocks which when fully inflated were capable of sustaining the weight of three men each in the water another article was a cookingstove the smallest lightest and most compact thing of the kind i ever saw it had a boiler capable of heating a quart of water and an oven large enough to bake a fowl with kettle saucepan etc for the top the grate proper was filled with fragments of some substance the name of which i have forgotten and underneath the grate was a sliding tray which held a sixwicked lamp the lamp being lighted and placed in position speedily raised the substance in the grate to a state of incandescence and there was our fire which gave out a tremendous heat for the size of the grate as an aid to this stove and an economiser of fuel we purchased also a most extraordinary invention which was named the norwegian cookingstove if i remember rightly this was not a stove at all though it performed the functions of one it was simply a box so constructed that it retained all the heat your dish might happen to contain when placed in it the mode of operation was to place your fowl or pie or what not in the oven until it was thoroughly hot through then take it out place it in the norwegian shut it up for two or three hours take it out and lo your dinner was cooked to perfection the fuel which this affair saved us during the voyage would have bought a dozen of them we spent a week looking about for such things as these and i am confident that but for the economy of space which we were able to secure through the aid of these contrivances our voyage must have come to a sudden and ignominious conclusion at length we were all ataunto sails stretched to perfection and properly bent our impedimenta all carefully and snugly stowed and everything ready for a start at the instigation and through the kindness of some yachting friends of mine i had been introduced to and was elected a member of the royalyacht club so one fine morning towards the latter end of july we loosed our sails set them ran our club burgee up to the masthead and the ensign up to the peak and made a start for weymouth at the last moment mr wood the builder of our little craft came on board saying that as he had nothing very pressing for the day and was curious to see something of the way in which the water lily behaved he would take a passage with us as far as gravesend if we had no objection we were only too pleased to have his company and of course gave him a cordial welcome the moment he came on board we cast off our moorings ran up the jib and foresail and slid rapidly away from the shore the wind was moderately fresh from the northward so we started under mainsail foresail and jib but with the topmast lowered as being in very light trim i did not think it advisable to run any risks by crowding sail upon the barkie we found as i had expected that on an even keel she was crank though hot to the extent i had anticipated but as she began to heel over her overhanging topside supported her so that as the breeze freshened which it did gradually the more she lay down to it the stiffer she became as our confidence in her stability and sailcarrying powers thus became established we grew anxious to try her paces and forthwith got her topmast on end the rigging set up and put the squareheaded gafftopsail upon her this was a very large sail for the size of the vessel though like the mainsail it was not particularly high in the hoist but both sails were very much peaked the gafftopsail so much so that the yard was almost straight up and down with the setting of our big topsail an immediate and very marked improvement in speed became manifest before this we had been darting along at a very respectable speed passing some smartlooking schooners as though they had been at anchor but now the little craft fairly rushed through the water making it hiss and smoke under her sharp bows and leaving a long wake of bubbles behind her she heeled over still more of course but it was with a steady kind of resistance to the force of the wind which did finally away with any lurking fears we might have had that we were oversparred or oversailed we hove our patent log and found that we were spinning along a good eight knots through the water and indeed we came up with and passed with ease several vessels which were being towed down the river bob and i were enchanted and mr wood scarcely less so and when shortly after luncheon he stepped into the boat which he had hailed to put him on shore at gravesend he said i am sure the little craft will come with credit out of the ordeal through which you are going to put her whatever it may be so gentlemen i hope you will favour me on your return with a full account of your and her adventures we took leave of him with a hearty shake of the hand and a faithful promise that we would do so a promise which i intend to fulfil by sending him a handsomelybound copy of this log as soon as printed let draw the foresheet and resumed our course down the river we met with no adventure worthy of record on our passage down unless i except the amusement we derived from the chagrin of the crew of a french steamer bound to havre who to their amazement found that the little english yacht by cutting off corners skimming across shoals and similar manoeuvres was slowly drawing ahead of them and though after passing sheerness she gradually crept ahead of us at first yet as the wind freshened and we continued to carry on until the water was over our deck on the lee side half way up to the companion we actually overtook and passed her until to escape an ignominious defeat she set her own sails and so drew away from us by eight oclock that night we were off the north foreland bowling along at a slashing pace with our mainsail boomed out to starboard and our spinnaker set on the port side jib and foresail stowed it was a glorious summer evening and there was every prospect of its being a fine night the aneroid evinced if anything a tendency to rise and there was a good slice of the moon left though he would be rather late in rising so we determined to keep going all night by ten oclock we were flying through the downs and very ticklish work it was to thread in and out between the ships at anchor there and those beating up without experiencing a jibe but by dint of a sharp lookout we did it by midnight we were off dover and here we took in the spinnaker jibbed the boom over to port and set our jib and foresail bob wanted the spinnaker set again on the starboard side but i would not agree to this as though we had both been on deck hitherto he insisted on taking the middle watch alone while i went below for a four hours sleep and i did not think it prudent to leave him alone with so large and unmanageable a sail i wanted to take in the gafftopsail also but bob would not hear of such a thing he insisted that she was under easy and manageable canvas and that there was nothing like making a passage while we had the opportunity in this sentiment i fully agreed with him but still i thought it better to err on the safe side at least for the present until we had become better acquainted with the capabilities of the craft but bob was obdurate and at last i had to give in and rest content with the assurance that he would give me timely warning if it should become necessary to shorten sail when i came on deck at four oclock i found we were just off dungeness and in the midst of an outwardbound fleet of ships of all sizes and almost all nations the wind appeared to have freshened somewhat during bobs watch but the morning was beautifully clear and fine and as our spars seemed to bear with the utmost ease the sail we were carrying i thought we might venture to try the effect of a little extra muslin accordingly before relieving bob at the tiller i roused out our spinnaker again and as we had hauled up a couple of points for beechy head just as i came on deck i got it to the bowspritend and set it with its sheet led aft to the mainboom end in place of the jib which with the foresail i stowed bob then went below and turned in first giving me strict injunctions to call him at seven bells that he might turn out and prepare breakfast for it now appeared that he intended to unite the functions of chief mate and cook and steward on the voyage we had just started upon so auspiciously the substitution of the spinnaker for the jib and foresail made a very great difference in our rate of sailing when i first came on deck i noticed some distance astern a splendid clippership bowling along with every stitch of canvas set that would draw up to skysails and royal studdingsails by the time i had got my spinnaker set she was abreast of us about half a mile outside and consequently to leeward but now she was unable to draw away from us an inch so great was our speed through the smooth water and when bob came on deck at seven bells she still lay as nearly as possible in the same position with regard to us as when he went below phew whistled he as his eye fell on her so the big chap has found his match has he in a craft the size of his own longboat my eyes harry but this here is a little flyer and no mistake why the postoffice people ll be wanting us to carry their mails for em if so be as they gets to hear on us eh lad closing this remark with a chuckle of intense satisfaction and a leer at our big neighbour bob dived below again and shortly afterwards a frizzling sound from forward and an odour strongly suggestive of bacon and eggs which was wafted upwards from the companion informed me that he had entered upon the duties of the less dignified but equally important part of his combined selfappointment we made a hearty breakfast off the aforesaid bacon and eggs with soft tack laid in the day before and washed all down with some most excellent coffee in the concoction of which beverage bob was an adept and then as soon as he had washed up and put matters to rights in his pantry and made arrangements for dinner i went below and turned in until noon when i went upon deck again i found that the breeze had softened down very considerably and we were slipping along barely five knots through the water our big neighbour the ship could do nothing with us in such light airs and he was now a good six miles astern during the afternoon the wind dropped still more and by eight oclock in the evening we had little more than steerageway the water was absolutely without a ripple our sails flapped the mainboom swung inboard with every heave of the little craft over the long gentle undulations of the groundswell and the different vessels in sight were heading to all points of the compass it was to all appearance stark calm yet there must have have been a light though imperceptible air for on looking over the bows there was a smooth unbroken ripple stretching away on each side showing that we were moving through the water still though very gently and the fact that the little craft answered her helm was additional testimony to the same effect during the night a little air came out from off the land and we mended our pace somewhat but it was not until the following noon that we got fairly abreast of saint catherines point about eight oclock the same evening the wind still being light we were abreast of the needles about a couple of miles to the westward of them and apparently steering pretty nearly the same course as ourselves we saw a cutter yacht about our own size by midnight we were abreast of durlstone head and had gained so much upon the other cutter that we could make out that she had a large and apparently a very merry party on board hearty peals of laughter came frequently across the water towards us from her and occasionally a song generally with a good rattling chorus we continued to creep up to her and at length got abreast of and so near her that with the advantage of a good run an active man might have leaped from one vessel to the other as we ranged up alongside a most aristocraticlooking man stepped to leeward and grasping lightly with one hand the aftermost shroud while with the other he slightly lifted his straw hat in salute he inquired what cutter is that the water lily royalyacht club replied i what cutter is that the emerald royal victoria answered our new acquaintance you have a singularly fast vessel under you continued he i believe i may say she is the first that ever passed me in such weather as this i have hitherto thought that in light winds the emerald has not her match afloat yet you are stealing through my lee as if we were at anchor i presume by the course you are steering that you are like ourselves bound to weymouth if so i should like to step on board you when we arrive if you will allow me i am curious to see a little more of the craft that is able to slip away from us as you are doing in our own weather i am lord he explained thinking i suppose that we should like to know who it was who thus invited himself on board a perfect stranger i shouted back for we were by this time some distance ahead of the emerald that i should be happy to see his lordship on board whenever he pleased to come and then the conversation ceased the distance between the two vessels having become too great to permit of its being continued with comfort it was now bobs watch below but the night was so very close that he had brought his bed on deck and was preparing to turn in on the weather side of the companion for his four hours sleep as he arranged the bedding to his satisfaction he cast his eyes frequently astern to the emerald whose sails gleamed ghostly in the feeble light of the moon which in her third quarter was just rising by george harry exclaimed he if they emeralds baint shifting topsails im a miserable sinner ay there goes his ballooner aloft his lordship dont like the looks of our tail seeminly but i doubt whether in this light breeze his big topsail will enable him to catch us my eyes how we did slip through his lee sure enough tell ye what harry lad that topsail of ourn is a good una rare good un for a reach and in a moderate breeze but we ought to have a ballooner for running off the wind in light weathera whacking big un with a jack as long as the bowsprit and a yard as long as the lowermast im beginning to think we are undersparred and undersailed i could scarcely agree with bob in this it is true that in fine weather we could carry considerably more canvas than we had but i had a thought for the heavy weather also and i knew that as soon as it came on to blow we should find our present sails quite as large as we could manage nevertheless i made up my mind that we would have a balloontopsail as the voyage would be a long one and it was possible that we might have spells of light winds for days together when such a sail could be carried to the utmost advantage notwithstanding the change of topsails we still continued to creep away from the emerald and when we let go our anchor in weymouth roads about six oclock the next morning she was still a good three miles outside of us the wind had in the meantime fallen away so light that it was not until after we had breakfasted that she drifted slowly in and brought up close to us shortly afterwards lordcame on board accompanied by two or three friends and his astonishment was great when he found that we only mustered two hands all told he noticed the absence of a boat from our decks and inquired whether we had lost ours and was still more astonished when we informed him that it was taken to pieces and stowed snugly away below this led to a request that he might be allowed to see it and gradually it all came out that we were bound on nothing less than a voyage to the pacific he was by no means inquisitive his questions were merely such as one yachtsman would naturally put to another but we knew beforehand that it would be difficult to conceal the fact that we were not merely cruising for pleasure so we had come to the conclusion that it would be best to put a bold face upon the matter and state at once that we were going a long trip and bob had proposed that in the event of any questions being asked we should give out that we were going to seek for some traces of my father to this i willingly agreed as i really meant if possible to endeavour to find some clue to his fate though i could not help acknowledging to myself that if we did make any discoveries it would be by the merest accident lordseemed to be singularly struck with the model of the water lily the only fault he found with her being the deficiency of headroom below this fault however was inseparable from her peculiar shape for as i have already stated she had a very shallow body and a flat floor and although she drew seven feet of water aft her depth below her platform was entirely taken up with the ballast and watertank leaving only a height of four feet between the top of the platform and the under side of the beams she was in short an exceedingly small craft for her tonnage we went ashore in his lordships boat at his invitation and as i casually mentioned that i meant on the morrow to put our boat together and give her a trial he very kindly offered to accompany us in the emerald my sister was of course delighted to see us both and equally delighted to hear how thoroughly satisfied we were with our little vessel it was evident that she had not quite conquered her apprehensions on the score of our long voyage in so small a craft but our eulogiums upon the water lilys many good qualities were so enthusiastic and the confidence we expressed in her seagoing powers so thorough that ada soon came to regard the voyage as in no degree more perilous than it would have been if undertaken in a vessel of four or five hundred tons we did not think it necessary to point out to her that we should probably be exposed to many perils besides those of the sea and so the dear girl became satisfied and learned to contemplate our speedy departure with comparative equanimity the next morning we made arrangements with a boatman for the hire of his punt during the short time that we intended to remain in weymouth as we wished our tubular boat to come into use only when we had no other to fall back upon having struck our bargain bob and i jumped into the hired punt and rowed off to the water lily which lay at anchor in the roadstead it was necessary to pass close to the emerald to reach our own craft and as we pulled under her stern lordhailed us to know whether we still intended to make our trial trip and if so how long it would be ere we should be ready i replied that i hoped to be ready in about an hour whereupon his lordship jumped into his boat to pay a visit to the postoffice saying he would be back in time to go out with us as soon as we got on board the water lily we got our tubes on deck screwed the different sections together and launched them overboard the framework connecting the two tubes together and supporting the stage or deck was next fixed then the deck itself which was in three pieces and so contrived that when properly put together and laid in its place a single bolt secured the whole immovably our centreboard and rudder were soon in their places and nothing remained but to step the mast and bowsprit set up the rigging bend sails and be off these latter operations took but a very short time as every device had been adopted which would facilitate the boats equipment and having timed ourselves we found that our boat was ready and under weigh within an hour of the time at which we had first begun to work at her we considered this very smart work but we hoped to shorten the time considerably after a little practice we took a few turns in the bay whilst the emerald was getting under weigh and tried a few manoeuvres with perfect success there was only one thing about which we had any doubt and that was whether she would stay or no in the smooth water close to the shore the wind was strong from the southwest that day she tacked beautifully headreaching a long way in stays and later on in the day we found that in this respect rough water made very little difference to her owing to the peculiar shape of her tubes it was blowing a strong breeze from the southwest as i have already said and we took down a reef in our mainsail whilst the emerald started under trysail and jib keeping her mainsail stowed so as not to run away from us we intended to run out round the shambles lightship and back but as soon as i got clear of the bay and from under the lee of the nothe i hauled sharp upon a wind to test the stability of my craft to my astonishment she did not appear to feel the effect of the wind at all except as it tended to urge her through the water she skimmed along very fast but stood quite upright under these circumstances we of course shook our reef out and bore up for a run away to leeward the emerald could do nothing with us at this game much to the chagrin of her noble owner so she was obliged to in trysail and set her mainsail whilst we hoveto and waited for her but even after her mainsail was set we had the advantage of her she was a regular racerlong lean and deep in the water whilst we floated entirely upon the surface the tubes being exactly half submerged as we noticed when we first started the consequence was that we skimmed along like a feather whilst the emerald had to displace many tons of water with every foot of progress which she made we passed through the opening in the magnificent breakwater which shelters the roadstead at portland and soon afterwards began to feel the heave of the channel our tubeboat rushed along over the crests of the waves with a very easy and steady motion but the emerald started rolling and as we drew farther off the land and got more into the influence of the rough water this rolling motion became so violent that her boom had to be topped up pretty high to prevent it from dipping and dragging in the water every time she rolled to leeward bob sat watching her attentively for some time and at length arent this here emerald the little eighttonner as took so many prizes last year in the regattas said he i replied that she was well said he we beat her all to nothing in a calm or next door to it last night in the lily and im thinking we could run her under water in a breeze like this here with such a jump of a sea as we shall get when we rounds to on our road back whats your idee my lad i think we could replied i she is so long and narrow that she must be a regular wet one closehauled as i expect we shall see shortly if i remember rightly all her prizes were won in light winds or smooth water and though i do not believe we could do anything with her in a staggering wholesail breeze in smooth water i fancy we could give a good account of her in a channel match but you must bear in mind bob that the lily is the larger craft of the two that i deny retorted bob heavier we may be as to tonnage accordin to the way tonnage is measured but shes got double our power ill bet my lowance of grog for the next month to come that shes got good seven ton or more of lead stowed away under her cabin floor whilst weve got two besides the trifle in our keel and power as you know well harry is what tells in a breeze take us all round and in spite of our difference of tonnage i reckon were pretty much of a size and consequently a very fair match so far as that goes i should like to be alongside of her in the lily in such a breeze and such water as this by this time we were close to the lightship still leading and in another minute we shot under her stern and hauled up on the port tack we now felt the full strength of the breeze and i was somewhat alarmed to find how fresh it was blowing but we were as stiff as a house and could have carried half as much sail again had there been more to set we lowered our centreboard just before hauling up and now we found ourselves tearing along in a manner which perfectly astounded me our long slender pointed tubes appeared to offer no resistance whatever to our passage through the water the motion was delightfully easy and gentle the tubes piercing the body of each wave as it rolled towards us without the slightest shock and lifting us gently and easily over the cap of it just as it seemed upon the point of coming in upon our deck there was not an atom of spray we were as dry going to windward as when running free with the emerald it was very different her huge mainsail was almost too much for her now that she was hauled close upon a wind and as we looked astern we could see her taking plunge after plunge and sending her sharp bows clear through the seas at every dive until her jib and foresail were wet half way up to their heads whilst her leerail was completely buried in the boiling surge now that we were closehauled the emerald walked up to us though by no means so rapidly as might have been expected there was no comparison between the powers of the two craft yet though we certainly dropped to leeward a little more than she did it was only a little and the difference in our speeds was very trifling considering the great difference in size between the cutter and ourselves about a quarter of an hour after we rounded the lightship the emerald passed us close to windward she presented a most beautiful sight at least to a nautical eye as she swept by she was heeling over to such an extent that the water was up over her deck on the lee side nearly to the skylights and companion and her immense sails were driving her so irresistibly through the short jumping seas that she had no time to rise to each as she met it her bowsprit plunged deeply into the advancing wave her sharp bows cleft it asunder and then as they rose through it amidst a blinding shower of spray the water shipped forward rushed foaming aft and to leeward like a swollen mountain torrent until it mingled with the water which flooded her decks to leeward as soon as she was past us her crew hauled down a couple of reefs in her mainsail and set a smaller jib this of course relieved her very materially and if anything rather increased than diminished her speed as she kept sailing round and round us with ease until we were well over towards weymouth roads once more and it had become perfectly evident that we needed no looking after as soon as he was quite satisfied of this lordmade the best of his way to the anchorage and brought up having had such a dusting as ought to have satisfied him for some time to come as for bob and myself we were as pleased with our novel boat as it was possible to be she proved to be a perfect success in every way and when we took the tubes to pieces to stow them away we found that so accurately had the joints been made that not a drop of water had penetrated to the interior of either one alteration however we resolved to make and that was in the size of the sails the boat was stiff enough to carry much larger sails than we had provided for her and as we did not know but that a time might come when speed would be a matter of the most vital importance to us we determined to furnish her with sails as large as it was prudent to carry we also decided to alter her rig somewhat by substituting what is known among the initiated as a sliding gunter for a gaffmainsail this gives you a mainsail and jibheaded topsail in one whilst it does away with the gaff altogether whereby you obtain a much flatter standing sail indeed when this sail is properly cut and it is not a difficult sail to shape there is nothing to beat it in this respect accordingly we despatched an order to lapthorn that night for the new suit of sails and also for a balloontopsail for the water lily the dimensions of which satisfied even bob greedy as he was for canvas meantime the remainder of our stores were ordered received and shipped and ten days after our arrival in weymouth roads we had everything on board which we could think of as necessary or likely to be in any degree useful to us on our voyage but when all was shipped we found we had made a mistake somewhere in our calculations and not only had rather more room than we expected but our little craft still floated rather higher than her regular loadline we therefore took in half a ton more lead ballast which brought her down to within an inch of her proper trim and with that we determined to rest satisfied volume one chapter v a gale in the bay of biscay on the evening of wednesday august th having wished all our friends goodbye and pressed my last kiss upon the lips of my sobbing sister i ran hastily down the flight of stone steps before my aunts front door crossed the road and walked briskly down the esplanade until i overtook bob who had gone on before me we then proceeded together to the new quay end found the man of whom we had hired our punt paid him his money and got him to row us on board the water lily we had arranged to start at daybreak on the following morning but as we pulled off to the cutter we remarked that there was a nice little breeze blowing from the westward and as the evening was beautifully fine and clear with the promise of a brilliant starlight when the night should have fully set in the idea occurred to us both that we might just as well be getting on down channel at once as be lying at anchor all night accordingly as soon as we got on board we loosed and set our canvas hove up our anchor and in half an hour afterwards were slipping through the opening in the portland breakwater in little more than half an hour after that we were clear of the dreaded bill when noticing that a small drain of floodtide was still making we hauled our wind on the port tack and stood in towards bridport for an hour then tacked again and stood out towards midchannel so as to obtain the full benefit of the ebbtide which by this time had begun to make by six bells or seven oclock on the following morning we were abreast the start about six miles distant we stood on until eight oclock when we tacked again towards the land having now a floodtide against us and had breakfast by noon we were in plymouth sound when we made a short leg to the southward until we could weather rame head then went about once more stretched across whitesand bay until the ebbtide began to make again and then again hove about and stood to the southward and westward on the starboard tack at six oclock that evening we passed the lizard lighthouse distant two and a half miles and here we took our departure for the benefit of those who may be ignorant of the meaning of this expression i may as well explain that the commander of a vessel takes his departure from the last wellknown point of land he expects to see before launching into midocean by noting as accurately as he possibly can its compassbearing and distance from his ship at a particular hour with these data he is enabled to lay down upon his chart the exact position of his ship at that hour and from this spot the skips reckoning commences the courses she steers and the number of knots or nautical miles sixty of which are equal to sixtynine and a half english miles she sails every hour together with certain other items of information such as the direction of the wind the direction and speed of the currents if any which she passes through and the state of the weather the leeway the ship makes etc etc are all entered in the logbook and at noon every day by means of certain simple calculations the ships position is ascertained from these particulars the entering of all these particulars in the logbook is termed keeping the dead reckoning and the working out of the calculations just referred to is called working up the days work this however only gives the ships position approximately because it is difficult to judge accurately of the amount of leeway which a ship makes and it is not at all times easy to detect the presence of currents both of which produce a certain amount of deviation from the apparent course of the ship to correct therefore all errors of this kind which are otherwise impossible to detect when the ship is out of sight of land various observations of the sun moon or stars are taken whereby the exact latitude or longitude or sometimes both together of the ship at the moment of observation is ascertained this short lesson in navigation over we will now rejoin the water lily which we left at six pm off the lizard on the starboard tack it was my eight hours out that night and when i took the tiller at eight oclock we were dashing along a good honest eight knots under whole canvas and a jibheaded gafftopsail the night was as fine as the previous one but with a little more wind and we were just beginning to get within the influence of the atlantic swell there was no sea on but the long majestic heaving swell was sweeping with stately motion towards the channel rising like low hills on either side of us as our little barkie sank between them and gleaming coldly like polished steel where the moons rays fell upon their crests but the little lily sprang gaily onward upon her course mounting the watery ridges and gliding down into the liquid valleys with the ease and grace of a seabird and without throwing so much as a drop of water upon her deck the serenity and beauty of the night the brilliancy of the stars which studded the deep purple vault above me and the gentle murmur of the wind through the cutters rigging combined to produce a sensation of solemnity almost amounting to melancholy within me and my thoughts flew back to the beloved sister i had so recently parted with wondering whether she was at that moment thinking of me or whether we should ever meet again and if so how long hence and under what circumstances and so on and so on until i was recalled to myself by a sprinkling of spray upon my cheek whereupon i awoke in the first place to the fact that the breeze had so far freshened that the lily was flying through the water with her lee gunwale pretty well under and in the second to the knowledge that i had outstayed my watch a good half hour i lost no time in calling bob and as soon as he came upon deck we got our gafftopsail down and our topmast housed i then went below and turned in but i had time before leaving the deck to notice that we went through the water quite as fast if not a trifle faster now that our lee gunwale was just awash as we did when it was buried a couple of planks up the deck in water when bob called me at the expiration of his watch i found on going on deck that the wind had continued to freshen all through the four hours i had been below and it was now blowing quite a strong breeze it had gradually hauled round to about northwest too which brought it well upon our starboard quarter and we were flying along at a tremendous pace with all our sheets eased well off but although by this change we were running off the wind and consequently did not feel its full force i decided to take down a single reef in the mainsail and shift the jib for there was a windy look in the sky that seemed to promise a very strong blow shortly i did not wish to disturb bob when perhaps about half way through his four hours sleep so i got him to assist me in making my preparations before he left the deck and the promise was amply fulfilled as the sun rose higher in the sky the wind freshening rapidly but hauling still farther round from the northward as it did so by the time that bob came on deck again at seven bells to prepare breakfast i had my hands full the sea was fast getting up and i began to tremble for my spars and gear the glass had fallen rather suddenly and altogether there seemed to be every prospect of a regular summer gale bob was of the same opinion as myself in this respect so we decided to get everything snug and in readiness for the blow before thinking of breakfast this was rather a ticklish job for it was now blowing far too strong to roundto and shorten sail and it required something more than freshwater seamanship to get our big mainsail in without getting into trouble but bob seemed perfectly at home he set the weathertoppinglift up handtaut and took a turn with the lee one then dropped the peak of the mainsail until the end of the gaff was pressing against the leelift triced the tack right up to the throat then let run the throathalliards and hauled down the throat of the sail by the tack trippingline whilst i rounded in upon the mainsheet then by lowering away the peak and carefully gathering in the canvas as it came down we got our big sail snugly down without any trouble this we carefully stowed and covered up with its coat next bob got the jib in closereefed the bowsprit and set the smallest or storm jib with its sheet eased well off i hauled in the weather foresheet until it was just in the wake of the mast and our little barkie was then left to take care of herself whilst we got the trysail bent and set this done we filled away again upon our course with reduced speed it is true but very comfortably indeed it was well we took these precautions when we did for by noon that day it had hardened down into a regular summer gale with a really formidable sea for so small a craft still we continued to run away very nearly dead before it and that too without deviating from our proper course i managed with the utmost difficulty in consequence of the violent motion of the boat to get an observation at noon by which i found that we had run since six oclock on the previous evening a distance of no less than one hundred and sixtyfour miles this placed us at about the entrance to the bay of biscay which we were thus running into in a gale of wind still i did not experience the slightest degree of alarm our little craft was behaving beautifullyangelically bob termed it and really it almost merited the expression as she fell away into the trough of the sea our low sails would become almost becalmed under the lee of the following wave but as she lifted with it the wind would again fill them out and she would dart away again just in time to escape the mishap of being pooped by its breaking and hissing crest at four pm i again succeeded in obtaining an observation this time for the longitude on working it up we proved to be rather to leeward of our proper track so we hauled up a point or so and at six oclock decided to try what she was like when hoveto watching an opportunity we brought her to the wind on the starboard tack first stowing our foresail and found to our great delight that she rode like a gull beyond an occasional shower of spray she shipped not a drop of water although the gale was still increasing and the sea rising rapidly we took a reef in our trysail afterwards hoisting the gaff as high as it would go so as to avoid as much as possible being becalmed in the trough of the sea and then we were snug for the night bob was a veteran seaman and i had been in many a heavy blow before thisin gales in fact to which this was a mere nothing comparatively speaking yet neither of us could help feeling impressedand for myself i may say somewhat awestrickenat the sublimity of the scene as the evening closed in hitherto our experiences of gales of wind had come to us with a good wholesome ship under our feet but now we found ourselves face to face with one in a mere boat little more than a toy craft the sea though nothing like as high as i had frequently seen it before now wore a more formidable aspect than i could ever have believed possible the hackneyed expression of running mountains high seemed strictly applicable and i fairly own to having experienced for i believe the first time in my life a qualm or two of fear on that night the liquid hills their foaming ridges as high as the top of our lowermast swept down upon us with an impetuous fury which seemed irresistible and the effect was further heightened as darkness closed around us by the phosphorescent glare and gleam of their breaking crests but the lily rose lightly and buoyantly to each as it rushed down upon her surmounting its crest in a blinding shower of spray and then settling easily into the trough between it and the next one the roaring of the gale too and the angry hiss of the stormlashed waters contributed their quota to the feeling of awe with which we looked abroad from our pigmy ark but confidence returned after a while as we watched the ease with which the little craft overrode the seas and when i at length turned into my hammock it was with a sense of security i could not have believed possible a couple of hours before we hoisted a carefullytrimmed and brilliant lamp well up on our forestay as soon as night closed in for we were in the track of the outwardbound ships going to the southward and should one of these gentlemen come booming down upon us before the gale during the night it would be rather difficult to avoid him it was well that we took this precaution for no less than five passed us in bobs watch and three more in mine one of them coming near enough to hail but what he said it was impossible for me to hear the howling of the wind and the hissing of the water so close to me utterly drowning the words i conjectured however that it was some inquiry as to whether we wanted assistance of any kind and on the strength of this supposition i roared back at the top of my voice all right very comfortable a figure in the mizzenrigging waved his hand and the noble craft she looked like an australian liner and was carrying topmast and lower stunsails swept onward and was soon afterwards swallowed up in the darkness and mist the falling in with so tiny a craft so far at sea and in a gale of wind and the announcement that she was all right and very comfortable must have been rather a novel experience for them i imagine about noon next day the gale broke and by four oclock the wind had gone down sufficiently to justify us in making sail and filling away upon our course once more this we did by setting our reefed mainsail foresail and number jib the wind had continued to haul round too and was now pretty steady at about northeast this rapidly smoothed the water down so that we had a comparatively quiet night and the wind continuing to drop we shook out our reefs next morning at eight bells and got the big jib and small gafftopsail upon her the evening but one following we got a glimpse of cape finisterre about six oclock and this enabled us to corroborate our position from this point we shaped a course for madeira and after a splendid run of seven days from the lizard and eight from weymouth we arrived at funchal at halfpast five oclock on the wednesday evening following that on which i took leave of my dear sister as bob was busy below getting tea and i was stowing the canvas a steamer came in with a flag flying which on taking a look at it through the glass i recognised as the distinguishing flag of the cape mailboats so i left everything just as it was dashed down below and penned a few hasty lines home giving a brief outline of our adventures so far and taking care not to lay too much stress upon the gale whilst i was equally careful to do full justice to the water lilys seagoing qualities that my sisters apprehensions might be as much allayed as possible as soon as i had finished and sealed the epistle i joined bob upon deck to assist him in putting our novel boat together which done we pulled on board the mailboat where we were very kindly received and i gave my letter into the hands of the captain who promised and faithfully redeemed his promise too to post it on his arrival home i afterwards found that he reported us also so that the water lily duly appeared in the shipping columns of the various papers and my yachting friends thus got an inkling of our success thus far i shall not attempt any description of madeira or indeed of any other of the wellknown spots at which we touched the places have been so often and so fully described in the many books of travel which have been written that any further description or at all events such description as i could give is quite superfluous it will suffice for me merely to say that bob and i spent three days stretching our somewhat cramped limbs in this most lovely island and discussing which route we should take to the pacific we had often discussed this question before but it was with a feeling of indifference which precluded our arriving at any definite and absolute decision upon the matter it was now however time that this point was settled as it would affect our course soon after leaving the island or at all events when we came to the cape de verdes the eastern route would be much longer than the western but i felt disposed to adopt it in the belief that we should be favoured with much better weather i entertained a very wholesome dread of the hornthe notorious cape of storms bob on the other hand was all for the western route im willin to allow observed he that a trip round the horn aint like a days cruise in the solentall pleasuring but ive knowed ships to come round under ryal stunsails and that more than once the place is bad enough but like many another thing not so black as its painted its got a bad name and that we know sticks to a place or to a body through thick and thin ive been round five times twice outwardbound and three times homeward and we always had plenty of wind but only once did i round it in a reglar gale and then had the lily been there ill lay my grog for the rest of the vyage shed have made better weather of it than the old barkie i was aboard of its risky i know but sos the whole trip for that matter though so far by what ive seen of the little craft id as lieve be aboard her in a gale of wind as i would be in ere a ship that ever was launched shes cramped for room and when youve said that youve said all as any man can say agin her besides see how twill shorten the vyage once round the horn and youre there as you may say or next door to it and then theres magellan if when we get down about there things dont look promising for a trip round outside of everything ram her through the straits ive been through em once and an ugly enough passage it was too blowing a whole gale but theres thousands of places where the lily would lie as snug as if she was in dock but where a large ship dursent venture for her life i yielded as i generally did in such matters to bobs judgment and it was settled that the water lily should brave cape horn with all its perils on the fourth day of our stay at funchal we filled up our watertank made a few additions to our stores among others a small stock of the famous wine produced by the island and towards evening stood out to sea again with our mainboom well garnished with bunches of bananas and nets of various kinds of fruits the wind at the time being light from about eastsoutheast with a fine settled look about the weather this lasted us for four days and ran us fairly into the trades and on the third day following just as the sun was dipping beneath the horizon we sighted saint antonio the westernmost of the cape verde islands the trades were blowing very moderately as it happened and the weather was as fine as heart could wish with a nearly full moon into the bargain so we were able to carry not only a jibheaded topsail but also our spinnaker at the bowspritend and under this canvas the little beauty made uncommonly short miles of it tripping along like a rustic belle going to her first ball we fell in with several homewardbound ships all of whom we requested to report us on their arrival as all well so fine a run had we from the cape de verdes that on the morning of the fifth day after sighting them we ran into the doldrums or region of calms and light variable airs which prevail about the line here our light duck did us valuable service for though the wind soon fell so light that it became imperceptible to us and not a ripple disturbed the glassy surface of the water by getting our enormous balloon gafftopsail aloft we managed to catch enough wind from somewhere to fan us along at the rate of nearly three knots true the breeze was very variable our boom being sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other sometimes square out at least as far as the little air of wind had power to project it and sometimes hauled close in as the flaws headed us and broke us off two or three points one side or the other of our course but in spite of the baffling airs such good progress did we make that by two oclock that afternoon we were gliding slowly through a fleet of about forty sail of vessels which were so completely becalmed that they were heading in all directions utterly without steerageway we reported ourselves to such as we passed within hail of and finally about four oclock ranged up alongside of and boarded a beautiful little barque of about three hundred and fifty tons whose monkeypoop we saw full of passengers some of whom were ladies regarding us with die utmost curiosity as we approached she turned out to be from natal bound to london and her captain a perfect gentleman both in appearance and manner not only promised to report us but gave us a hearty welcome on board and so cordial an invitation to dinner that there was no resisting it our story or at least as much of it as we chose to tell which was simply that we were taking the cruise partly as an adventure and partly with the object of seeking intelligence of my father was of course soon drawn out of us and naturally enough it excited the liveliest astonishment in the minds of our hearers and soon got all over the ship we excited some curiosity on board the other ships too for no less than four captains lowered their boats and pulled alongside to learn where the pigmy cutter had sprung from the little craft was regarded with the greatest curiosity and admiration especially by the ladies who are of course good judges of the model of a vessel some of them declaring that they would be delighted with strong emphasis to make a voyage in such a little darling of a yacht we mustered quite a strong party at the dinnertable what with the regular party the four visiting captains who were also pressed to stay and our two selves and a very merry one withal we contributed to the dessert from our stock on the mainboom and they only who have enjoyed it can say what a luxury is fresh fruit on the line especially when one has been a long time on board a ship the skipper produced unlimited champagne of which for a wonder he still had a very fair stock in honour of the occasion and a prosperous voyage and success to the water lily was drunk over and over again that evening we kept it up until nearly midnight the poop being converted into a ballroom by merely hanging a few lamps in the mizzenrigging the orchestra consisting of one of the seamen who played the concertina better than i ever heard it played before or since the weather being as i have described it with out any signs of a change such a departure from the ordinary routine of the ship was permissible and i have no doubt everybody on board was glad enough of an occurrence which gave such an excuse for breaking in upon the monotony of the voyage tedious enough they must have found it for it appeared that they had already been becalmed five days and had not altered their position as many miles and there seemed every prospect of their being becalmed five days more for the glass was as steady as if the mercury had been solid at last we visitors made signs of moving the captains of the other vessels ordered their crews into their boats and i was just about going over the side on my way to our small cabin to write a hasty line to ada our kind host having promised to post my letter for me immediately on his arrival when a seaman stepped up to me and with the usual nautical scrape of the foot and a respectful beg pardon sir intimated a desire to speak to me theres a strange yarn going the rounds of this here crafts focsle said he about your bein on a sort of vyage of discovery ater your father sir i said certainly it was perfectly true well sir said he maybe i might be able to help you in your search it needs no prophet to tell that you are captain collingwoods son when a man gets a fair squint at your figurehead axing your pardon sir for my boldness and if youll just give me your word that nothing i may say shall tell agin me ill tell you all i knows about it and gladly too for i sailed with your father sir and a kinder skipper or a better seaman never trod a deck than he was as ive had good reason to know was exclaimed i with a sudden sinking of heart and is still for aught i know sir at least i hope so theres no reason why he maynt be still alive replied the man fully understanding all the meaning of my exclamation thank god for that replied i fervently but why is this strange pledge required surely fellow you will not have the temerity to tell mehis sonthat he has been the victim of any foul play if so not on my part sir ill take my bible oath said he what i did i was forced to do to save my own life gladly would i have helped the skipper if i could but what can one man do agin a whole ships crew much if he have the will replied i i will give no pledge whatever beyond this tell me your story and if i find you were powerless to prevent the evil which i begin to suspect has befallen my poor father you have nothing to fear but if i find that you have in any way aided never sir if i could have had my will the skipper would not be where i suppose he is now but you shall hear all i have to say and then judge for yourself whether i could prevent anything that happened or no volume one chapter vi the fate of the amazon the man who in this unexpected manner brought me intelligence of my father belonged to the crew of one of the visiting captains boats and a word or two of explanation was sufficient to procure the delay in the boats departure necessary to permit the fellow to tell his story in order to be a little more alone bob who was in a few words made acquainted with the facts of the case the seaman and i went down over the side to the water lilys deck when as soon as we had comfortably bestowed ourselves the man thus began you must know gentlemen to commence with that i was shipped among others on board the amazon at canton dysentery was awful bad among the crews just at that time and no less than seven was ashore from our old barkie bad when she left two chaps run as soon as she got in and couldnt be found agin so there was nine berths in the focsle to be filled when she was ready to sail as i was sayin i was one of the new hands shipped englishmen was scarce somehow just then and the skipper had to take what he could get consequence was he shipped three portuguese a spaniard a greek two frenchmen and a yankee besides myself the third mate was ashore bad and the second mate had died so the yankee who seemed a smartish sort of chap was made second mate and one of the old focsle men was put into the third mates berth when we got aboard we found the hatches on and all ready for a start and that same aternoon we unmoored and away we went we was the first ship as went away with any of the new teas and the skipper was awful anxious for a quick run home we carried on night and day but the weather was light with us and we didnt get along half as such a smart ship ought to ha done for she was a reglar flyer as perhaps you gentlemen both knows well we hadnt been out above a week when whether twas worryin at the light winds or what twas i cant say but the poor skipper was laid on his beamends with fever and it took the chief mate all his time to prevent his jumping overboard however it didnt seem to matter so much so far as the ship was consarned for the yankee second mate turned out to be a firstrate navigator and he in a way took charge of the craft well gentlemen how it all came about i cant say for i never noticed anything wrong true some of the chaps talked a bit queer to me at times but i thought twas all a bit of a flam but howsomever one fine night my yankee gentleman and the new hands takes the ship at eight bells in the first watch the watch below was called and as soon as they came on deck three on em goes straight over and jines the mutineers without a word so it was clear as twas all planned afore among em that left only three whites out of the plotthe lascars had all been bribed or frightened into jining in with tothersand out of us three two was lying on deck lashed hands and heels together when i come up through the fore scuttle the minute my foot touched the deck i was tripped up and secured before i was fairly awake and stowed alongside of the two other chaps then my noble yankee he steps up and stands in front of us three and he says says he now you chaps you see how it is weve got the ship and we means to keep her and weve made up our minds to do a little bit of pirating make our fortunes and then cut the sea and live like gentlemen for the rest of our days ashore if youve a mind to jine us well and good if not theres a plank sticking over the bows and ill be obliged to trouble you to take a short walk on it for the benefit of your constitooshuns youve got five minutes allowed to make up your minds when the time was up one of the chaps was unlashed and the yankee asks him what he intends to do ill walk thatplank if i must says he but i hope im too honest to turn my hand to yourpirating says he all right says the yankee just as you please theres no compulsion only if youre so confounded honest says he youll have to leave this here ship says he for we cant afford the room to stow away sich a bulky article as honesty thats your road and a pleasant passage to ye says he pointin to the plank poor billi can see him now it seems to mehe stood for about half a minute looking far away into the moonlit sky thinking of his friends maybe if he had any and then without a word he steps to the rail puts his hands upon it jumps up on to the top of the bulwarks and next minute there was a splash alongside and he was gone tother chap was then cast adrift and he was asked the same question ive sailed with bill says he for nigh on six years and never knew a truerhearted shipmate or a better seaman says he and since it must be here goes says he to take our last cruise in company and he too jumps upon the rail just as bill did and without waitin a second launches himself overboard ater him it was now my turn id been thinking matters over in my mind whilst all this was going on and ill confess i found it hard to make up my mind to die whilst theres life theres hope thinks i and it can but come to a launch over the side at last if the worst comes to the worst so when they asked me what i intended to do says i tell me first of all whats become of the skipper says i hes below in his bunk says the yankee and the mate with him and there theyre welcome to stay so long as they dont interfere with us says he and ill take good care they dont says he but whats that to do with you well says i i likes the skipper hes been a good friend to me and i couldnt be content to see harm come to him if youll promise to shove him ashore all safe says i i dont mind taking a hand in your little game very sensible indeed says the yankee youve a darned sight better notions in your head than they two stupid cusses as has just gone over the side with nothin to ballast em but theirhonesty says he and as for the skippermake your mind easy weve no grudge agin him all we wants is the ship and now weve got her we means to put the skipper and the mate both ashore somewheres where they can be snug and comfortable like together but where therell be no chance of our hearin anything more from em for the rest of their lives and thats the way it was all settled continued the man i made up my mind id never do no pirating if i could help it and i thought maybe if i stuck to the craft i might be able to help the skipper a bit somehow and if ever i got a chance why id make a clean run for it and i reckoned i should find a way to do that the first port we touched at well as soon as matters was arranged the yankee takes the command and makes the greek chief mate the watches was divided the course altered and away we goes to the eastard on the starboard tack with a taut bowline and everything set as would draw from the skysails down one hand is told off from each watch to keep a look out in the cabin and the steward has his orders to do everything he could for the poor skipper he had a hard time of it poor man for when he was getting better and the truth couldnt any longer be kept from him the mate told him what had happened and the news took him so completely aback that he got as bad as ever again and the wonder is that he didnt slip his cables altogether however he managed to hold on to em and at last the fever left him but he was that weak he hadnt strength to turn over in his berth without help all this time we were going to the eastard or about eastsoutheast with everything set that the spars would bear at last about a month or maybe five weeks after the mutinyi didnt keep much account of the timewe fetches up all standing one dark night upon a coral reef before we knowed where we was there warnt much sea on and we happened to touch where there was nearly water enough to float us so we bumped and thumped gradually right over the reef into deep waterat least about ten fathomson tother side the well was sounded and we found five feet of water in the hold so as there was land of some sort close aboard of us the yankee rams her straight on to it to save her from sinking under us when daylight broke we found ourselves oh the sandy beach of a small island with reefs all round us but a space of about a quarter to half a mile of clear water everywhere between the reefs and the island the cargo was roused out and the ship examined as well as it could be done to learn the extent of the damage for the yankee talked about careening her to repair her bottom but we soon found that the job was too much for us so we stayed on the island about a week fitting out the launch and the pinnace and when all was ready and everything stowed in the boats that it was thought we should want we made sail to the norard and eastard not however until the rest of the boats had been destroyed and the skipper and mate made all snug and comfortable like in a tent ashore then you were inhuman enough exclaimed i to leave my poor father sick as he was on a desert island he was better off there than he would ha been with us replied the man the island was a firstrate spot with cocoanuts and bananas and lots of other fruits no end plenty of fresh water and the bulk of the ships stores to draw from it was a lovely spot lots of shade pure air and pretty nigh everything a man could want what with the stores and the fruit and so on he must have died had we taken him away in the boats for the sun beat down upon us awful and the heat was reflected back from the surface of the water to that extent we was nearly roasted well wed been to sea nigh on to three weeks and was getting pretty short of water though we touched at a couple of islands and filled up again on our way when one eveningthere wasnt a breath of air blowingwe sighted a sail to the norard of us she was becalmed like ourselves the yankee takes a good long look at her or at least at her togallantsls which was all we could see and then tells us hed made up his mind to have a slap at the chap during the night we carefully took her bearings dowsed our canvas and pulled leisurely towards her at last when we thought we were beginning to near her we muffled our oars and then paddled on again both boats within oars length of each other we pulled for about an hour and then waited for some sign of her whereaboutsfor we reckoned we must be close aboard of herbut it was that dark you couldnt see the length of your nose after waiting a goodish spellnone of us speaking a word for fear of giving an alarm we hears eight bells struck somewhere away upon our port quarter we had passed her so we pulled very quietly round and just paddled in the direction we thought she was lying in about five minutes the yankee says i see her says he and we stopped paddling the pinnace was hanging on astern of us sos we shouldnt lose one another in the dark and she was hauled up the men in her told what to do and the ship pointed out to them and then we pulled away very quietly again by this time we could just make out a dim something towering up in the darkness which we knew to be her sails in another minute our boat was alongside on her starboard quarter and the pinnace on her larboard quarter we shinned up her low sides and before the watch on deck could rub their eyelids open we had her she turned out to be a little yankee brig with a cargo of sandalwood and was bound to canton some of her crew joined us the restthe poor skipper and the first mate among emwas hove overboard and the sharks had a good meal she mounted four sixes and had a wellstocked armchest so that with the arms we brought with us from the old amazon we was pretty well off we mustered a good strong crew tootwentynine altogether counting the lascarsso as the brig was a beautiful model and we soon found sailed like a witch our skipper decided to set up for a pirate at once well gentlemen it kept stark calm for two whole days after wed took the brig and johnsonthat was the yankees name edward johnsonhe kept us all busy during that time disguising the craft by painting the hull and spars afresh and such like and the carpenter he was sent over the starn on a stage to fix a plank over the name on which hed carved a lot of flourishes and such like and the word albatross which was what johnson had rechristened her and by the time wed finished her own builder wouldnt have knowed her after everything was finished to his satisfaction he calls us all aft and tells us that hed been thinking matters over and hed decided to take the ship to hongkong and get rid of the sandalwood there and get a lot of things that was wanted to complete our outfit and make us fit for a good long cruise accordinly as soon as the breeze sprang up away we goes never falling in with anything as johnson thought it worth his while to meddle with all the way we had a pretty quick run for the brig sailed quite wonderful and all the while i was turning over in my mind how to get away i intended to take the first chance as offered as soon as we got in but johnson was a cute chap none of us was let out of the ship any moren he could help and then only they as he knowed he could trust at last the cargo was out and the ballast in the brig cleared for the south pacific and everything ready for sailing next morning and id had no chance to get away and i was beginning to think things were looking queer with me but i didnt give up all hope for i knowed a chance might offer at the last minute if i was but ready to take it some time during the night i woke up and went on deck for a minute or two and found it as black as pitch there wasnt a soul moving in the ship i dont know where the anchor watch was stowed away asleep somewheres likely anyhow i thought to myself that now was my chance so without waiting another minute i climbs over the bows and lets myself quietly down into the water by the cable as soon as i was adrift i lets the tide take me for i was afraid of makin so much as a splash whilst i was near the ship i drifted astern for about five minutes and then struck out i hadnt taken no bearings and didnt know where the shore was but i saw a few lights and i shaped a course for them but after id swam about a matter of twenty minutes i found i was farther away from em than i was when i started and then the thought flashed into my mind that the tide must be on the ebb and that i was going out to sea i was so took aback that i went under but i didnt feel like giving up without i was obliged so i struggled to the top of the water again and then turned over on my back to think matters over a bit but i didnt find much encouragement that way and i was beginning to think it was all up with mespecially as i was getting pretty tiredwhen i heard a sound some distance away like a coil of rope hove down on deck i started to swim in the direction of the sound and after perhaps about five minutes i makes out something away on my port bow i gives a shout as loud as i could and that sends me under again so i soon found that game wouldnt answer however i stretched out as hard as i could and got alongside but there warnt nothing to take hold of and she slips past me i was too done up to sing out again but i starts to swim after her when i strikes my head against something and it turns out to be a boat towing astern i got hold of the gunnel and managed somehow to get aboard and then down i goes into the bottom of her too exhausted to do anything i dropped off to sleep pretty soon and was only woke up when the chaps came to hoist their boat in the craft turned out to be a coasting junk bound to shanghai as i managed to make out but not another syllable could i understand of their lingo or they of mine twould seem blest if the very next night we wasnt run down by something or other i never knowed what twas for they hadnt the good manners to stop and pick us up the mainmast of the junk was knocked out of her in the smash and i managed to get hold of it and lash myself to it just in the eyes of the rigging the yard happened to be undermost and so i had a pretty good berth i floated about on thatspar for four days and nights without a bit or drop of anything and then my senses broke adrift and i knew nothing more of what happened to me for some time when i came to myself i found i was on board a dutch ship homewardbound it turned out that they passed close to my spar and seein me lashed to it they picked me up at least so i made it out but i knew no dutch and there was only one chap aboard that thought he knowed english but lord bless ye gentlemen i couldnt make top nor tail of what he said i managed to make out howsever that id had a narrow squeak of it and thats about all by the time i was able to get about on deck again we was well out in the indian ocean and everything seemed going on all right but as it turned out it was all wrong for early one morning we makes land ahead the wind bein light and dead on shore the skipper hauled sharp up on the port tack to try and claw off but a current had got hold of us and away we sagged to leeward do what we would and at last we had to anchor byandby the breeze freshened but we was in a very ugly berth and the skipper didnt like to make a move however we didnt have a chance to settle the matter for ourselves for just about sunset the old barkie struck adrift and before we could get the canvas on her she was in among the rocks and bilged we all got ashore there bein no great matter of a sea running and to make a long story short was made prisoners by the natives what become of the rest of the hands i never knowedthey may be there yet for all i can say an old chap picked me out and made a sort of servant of me and on the whole i had pretty easy times of it i got to find out at last that i was somewhere on the island of madagascar i stayed here nigh on two years i reckon but at last i got a chance to steal a canoe and slip off to a small craft that was becalmed in the offing she was luckier than the dutchman as we got a breeze off the land about an hour after i boarded her she was bound to the cape and there i left her shipping the very same day in the craft i now belong to and sailing for home the same aternoon well said i as soon as the man had finished if your story is trueand i see no reason to doubt ityou at least are blameless as far as the wrong done to my father is concerned the only question now is whereabouts is the island on which he was left ah sir replied he thats moren i can tell i did hear johnson mention the latitude and longitude of it once but im blest if i can remember em now i was determined however to get some clue if possible however faint it might be and i took him into our little cabin and spread a chart of the pacific on the table then i got him to recall as nearly as he could the courses and distances steered by the amazon until the time of her wreck we managed to trace her as far as the northwestern extremity of new guinea the man happening to remember hearing johnson point out some land in sight as the cape of good hope this must manifestly have been the headland of that name on the northwest coast of new guinea but from this point he became bewildered he remembered passing a great many islands after sighting this headland however and was of opinion that the average courses steered were about southeast and he thought it was nearly a month afterwards when the ship was lost this placed the scene of the wreck on one of the islands in the large group in which we expected to find our treasureisland i questioned the fellow until i found i had extracted really every particle of information it was in his power to give and then after rewarding him for his information i let him go as soon as he was gone i wrote a hasty note to my sister cautiously conveying to her the intelligence that we had obtained a faint trace of the amazons fate a trace which i added we intended to follow up as far as we could and having sealed and addressed my missive i hurried up over the barques side and placed it in her captains hands and then took leave of him with a hearty shake of the hand and many good wishes on his part that we might have a safe and pleasant voyage it was time we were off for a gentle breeze was springing up and all parties were anxious to avail themselves of it to the utmost extent as soon as we had once more got all our light canvas spread bob instead of turning in as he had a right to do it being his watch below came and sat down beside me and we began to discuss the strange story to which we had so lately listened it has enabled me definitely to make up my mind upon one point which i will now confess has troubled me not a little said i and that is your proposal to go round the horn bob ever since we settled upon that route i have been thinking of the great risks we must run by adopting such a course and i really think that but for this i should have hauled sharp up upon the port tack as soon as we fell in with the southeast trades now however i feel so anxious about my father and his condition that i would incur double the amount of risk if need were in order to reach the pacific as soon as possible and bob we must find him before we give a thought to the treasure right you are exclaimed bob heartily and theres my hand upon it harry my lad the treasure can wait but it may be of the greatest consequence to the skipper to be found as soon as possible he may be ill or tormented by a parcel of cannibal savages or a thousand things may be happening to him to make it important for him to have a couple of trustworthy hands like ourselves added to his crew as soon as may be so shove the huzzeys nose as straight for the cape as shell look and lets get that part of the job over as soon as we can and as to the danger of the explite well weather it somehow the little beauty has showed us already what she can do and with a couple of prime seamenwhich i take it no man will deny we areto handle her take my word for it shell carry us round as safe as eer a craft that floats theres another thing ive been thinking of within the last hour continued i we talked of going into buenos ayres when we first made up our minds to take the route round the horn but even that short detention i should now like to avoid if possible want of water is really the only cause which would compel us to call there though i confess i should like to write a line to ada from thence to let her know we had safely reached so far as to the first interrupted bob i feel no consarn whatever we are pretty certain to fall in with heavy rains afore we get very far south and if the wind happens to be light we can easily spread one of the sails so as to catch the water and one good heavy thundershower would fill our tank for us and as to letters why we shall perhaps have such another chance as this here that weve just had and that disposes of the second difficulty if we dont get any rain before theres a splendid harbour on the southernmost side of the gulf of saint matias hereaway on our starboard bow somewheres about two or three days sail to the southard of buenos ayres and we can fill up our water there ive been into the place once and a fine snug anchorage it is this was a great relief to me for in my present feverish state of excitement it seemed to me that any stoppage unless absolutely unavoidable would be more than i could endure by this time it was bobs watch on deck but i felt that it would be utterly impossible to sleep if i turned in so i insisted that he should go below instead and after some argument he consented in about ten minutes more certain sounds arising through the companion told me that my friend was too thorough a seaman to be kept awake by excitement and i found myself alone and at liberty to indulge in the new hopes which had so lately been awakened within my breast volume one chapter vii the seaserpent the breeze though it continued light and rather baffling at times still held when the sun rose next morning and on looking astern i found that the homewardbound ships had all disappeared and of the outwardbound craft our light heels had enabled us to get so far ahead that the topsails of the nearest were already dipping of course light winds and smooth water made exactly our kind of weather and the enormous spread of our lighter sails caused the little craft to slip through the water in quite an extraordinary manner whenever we could show them there was just enough wind to barely ruffle the surface of the gently swelling ocean yet our patent log told us we were going rather over six knots mainly through the persuasive influence of our spinnaker and gigantic balloontopsail at noon our observations showed that we were nearly a degree south of the line and i began to be sanguine that the breeze we now had would run us into the trades in this however i was disappointed for about sundown the wind fell so light that we barely had steerageway all night long it continued the same and the greater part of next day and for about sixteen hours i considered that we did not advance more than a knot per hour towards the close of that afternoon however when i came on deck to take the first dogwatch bob directed my attention to the appearance of the sky in the southeastern quarter announcing it as his opinion that there was a look of the trades about it and so it proved for the breeze gradually freshened and drew more round from the eastward and by eight bells we were doing our nine knots with a nice fresh breeze this was doubtless the first of the southeast tradewind for by midnight it had so far freshened that for the sake of our spars it became necessary to take in our spinnaker and balloontopsail and to substitute for them the working jib and our jibheaded topsail even this would have been deemed perilous sail for so tiny a craft by most persons but we were by this time thoroughly acquainted with the lily and knew that she would carry with ease all the canvas that her spars would bear nothing particular occurred for the next two days the wind held and continued to blow with a force which was for us a good staggering breeze but without much sea and we kept flying to the southward at a pace which left even my impatience no reason for complaint on the second day after getting the breeze we passed the brazilian mailboat near enough to show our number in the yachtlist and to ask him by signal to report us all well the next morning it was my watch on deck until noon bob had cleared away the breakfast carefully washing up everything and stowing it away and had been in his hammock about an hour i was enjoying the fresh beauty of the morning and the exultant feeling excited by our rapid motion and picturing to my imagination the delight with which my father would welcome the appearance of our snowy canvas when we should heave in sight when my visions were dispersed by a loud cracking sound like the report of a rifle from some distance away on our weatherbow i looked in that direction and caught a momentary glimpse of some distant object whirling in the air and immediately afterwards the sound was repeated i stood up to get a better view over the low ridges of the sea and at the same instant caught sight of what looked like a jet of steam rising out of the ocean there she blows exclaimed i involuntarily aloud again up whirled the object i had before observed again it descended and again came the riflelike report i knew in an instant now what it was an unfortunate whale had fallen in with his inveterate enemy a thresher and had been forthwith attacked i could plainly distinguish the huge creature plunging along at a great rate and at an angle of about fortyfive degrees with our course so that he was standing in such a direction as would take him across our bows from the persistent manner in which he remained at the surface i came to the conclusion that he had a second enemy to contend with in the shape of a swordfish indeed the way in which he began to plunge about soon put the matter almost beyond a doubt i was turning over in my mind whether i should call bob to see this sight when the whale with a mighty effort flung his huge bulk completely out of the water to a height of i should say fifteen or twenty feet and sure enough hanging to him was a large swordfish with his beak driven deep into the muscles about the root of the persecuted animals tail i shouted to bob to come on deck at once for we had neared each other so much by this time that i had an excellent view of the combat and moreover it struck me that a slight deviation in the course of the combatants might bring them within extremely unpleasant proximity to the little lily and i thought it might be prudent to have bob on deck he was up in an instant not waiting to perform the almost superfluous ceremony of dressing and there we both stood so intensely absorbed in the interest of the exciting spectacle that the little craft was almost left to take care of herself the whale had got very nearly straight ahead of us by this time and not more than half a mile distant bob went forward and stood leaning against the mast to get a somewhat better view suddenly the chase bore sharply up and dashed away at tremendous speed in exactly the opposite direction to that which he had been pursuing before almost at the same instant bob shrieked in a shrill unnatural tone of voice luff harryluff round with her for the lords sake oh my god down went the helm and up flew the little lily into the wind and i was just stooping to let go the headsheets which led aft when i caught a glimpse of bobs face white and drawn with horror and his eyesalmost starting out of his headstaring fixedly at something apparently broad on our starboard bow i looked naturally in the same direction myself and never to my dying day shall i forget the frightful appalling object which met my gaze at a distance of not more than three cables lengths from us rushing through the water at a speed equal to that of a railway train and lashing the water into foam with the rapid movement of his huge convolutions a monstrous serpent appeared darting towards the wretched persecuted whale his vast head and fully twenty feet of his body towered nearly erect above the water and i believe i am not exaggerating nay that i am within the mark when i say that the remaining portion of his body to the tail was at least six times that length his head was shaped much like that of a python and his enormous jaws which he frequently opened disclosed a formidable array of strong sharp fangs his body was of a deep dead brown broadly marked with irregular stripes and rings of pale stonecolour and he emitted a strong musky odour which even at our distance from him was almost overpowering once when he was closest to us he turned his head in our direction and for one dread moment he paused seeming to gather his folds together as though about to dart upon us and the bitterness of a frightful death thrilled through me the next instant he sped on once more at still greater speed and before another minute passed the whale was overtaken the ocean was for a single instant lashed into the semblance of a boiling caldron we saw a rapid whirling movement of the creatures enormous coils and then followed the deep bellowing cries of the tortured whale and the crunching sound of its crushing bones during the minute or two which had passed since our helm was put down the lily had been lying to on the starboard tack our headsheets still remaining fast on the starboard side the seizure of the whale awoke me as from a horrible nightmare to the fearful peril to which we still remained exposed and i jammed the helm hard up and wore the craft sharp round on her heel until dead before the wind when i eased off the mainsheet and we hurried as fast as the wind would take us away from the spot as soon as we had got the water lily round and were fairly running away from our dangerous neighbour we both with one accord turned a look astern to ascertain the condition of things in that quarter the serpent and the whale had both disappeared doubtless the former had sunk with his prey to those profound depths which form his usual habitat there to enjoy his meal undisturbed well at last exclaimed bob ive been knocking about at sea now nigh on thirty year and manys the strange sight these goodlooking eyes of mine have looked upon in that time but this here sarpent beats all i never seed the likes of the thing afore and i dont care if i never sees it agin ive heern tell of such things bein fallen in with sartaintly but i never could meet with a man as had actually seed the beast with his own eyes and i put it all down as a yarn for the marines but seein is believin and weve had a good look at him and no mistake im quite satisfied i dont want to see no more to make me a believer in sich things no replied i it was impossible to make any mistake with such a view as we obtained of the creature and i shall henceforward be far more ready than i have hitherto been to give credit to the accounts which are occasionally published of such appearances i do not at all expect that we shall be believed when we make known our adventure any more than others have been but that will not alter the facts of the case the almost universal scepticism with which announcements of such creatures appearances are treated is after all not very difficult to account for they doubtless inhabit only the extreme depths of the ocean and are probably endowed with the means of sustaining life whilst sunk for long periodsif not for an indefinite timeat those depths it is easy therefore supposing such to be the case to understand that it may be quite opposed to the creatures habits to appear at the surface at all and that when it does so it will beas indeed we have every reason to supposeat very lengthened intervals and then probably only in consequence of some unusually disturbing influence the opportunities of seeing the reptile must necessarily under such circumstances be extremely few and it is quite possible or rather i should say very likely that many of its visits to the upper world have been entirely unwitnessed in the present instance for example no eyes but ours were witnesses of the scene which so lately took place and had we been but a dozen miles from the spot it would have passed unnoticed even by us and my observation of mankind bob has led me to the conclusion that the race are extremely sceptical as to the existence of everything but what is well known very true harry my lad returned bob you reels it all off just like a book and therein you shows the advantages of larning i knows by my own feelins how difficult tis to believe a thing a man dont understand but it seems to me to return to the practicalas ive heard the poor old skipper saythat we might as well haul up on our course agin now and ill go and look after the dinner for i shall be afraid to go to sleep agin for the next fortnight that blamed old sarpent ll hant me like a nightmare now if i so much as shut my eyes for five minutes the sheets were flattened in and the little crafts jaunty bowsprit once more pointed southward whilst bob dived below and in a few minutes more a thin wreath of smoke issuing from the galleyfunnel betrayed his whereabouts and his occupation suddenly he reappeared at the companion and with a serious countenance remarked i say harry lad i spose theres no chance of that devilwith a jerk of the thumb in the direction of our weather quartergetting a sniff of our dinner and making sail in chase is there i assured him that in my belief there was a strong probability that the serpent was at that moment perhaps miles deep in the ocean banqueting royally on the dead whale and seeing the reasonableness of this supposition he retired satisfied nothing further occurred that day to disturb us we continued to bowl away to the southward and as we kept our canvas a good rap full the little barkie tripped along a good honest nine knots every hour the weather was as fine as we could possibly wish with every appearance of being thoroughly settled and there seemed to be a good promise of our making an exceptionally rapid passage it was my eight hours out that night and when bob relieved me at midnight the sky was as clear as a bell and though there was no moon the stars were shining brilliantly and with that mellow lustre so peculiar to the tropics bob declared he was glad to be on deck again for he had been tormented all his watch below by that villainous sarpent visions of which so disturbed his restless slumbers that it was a real comfort to have the craft to look after and something to occupy his mind i anticipated no such disturbing influence myself for though i candidly confess i was awfully frightened at the moment the effect had passed away almost with the disappearance of the monster and the cool freshness of the night breeze had induced a feeling of drowsiness particularly welcome to a man about to retire to his hammock in less than five minutes i was fast asleep when i awoke which i did without being called i was surprised to find the sun streaming down through the skylight and still more so when i observed that we seemed to have gone about during the night the water lily was now certainly on the starboard tack whereas when i turned in we were on the port tack it cant be a change of wind here in the heart of the trades thought i what can bob be about and why has he allowed me to overrun my watch surely the old fellow was not afraid to come below and turn in hallo bob ahoy whats wrong on deck shouted i springing out of my hammock just as i did so i heard the mainsail fluttering as though the boat had luffed into the wind and at the same moment i caught sight through the companionway of the vacant tiller swinging about gone forward to shift the jib thought i and i jumped on deck to lend a hand bob was nowhere to be seen good heavens exclaimed i what dreadful thing has happened i thought of the seaserpent for one moment but dismissed the idea the next as being both too horrible and too unlikely the creature could hardly have approached without giving bob the alarm which i knew he would have instantly communicated to me at that moment my eyes fell upon the mainboom and i missed the lifebuoy which we kept suspended from it in readiness for any sudden emergency bob then had gone overboard taking the lifebuoy with him and that too upon an impulse so sudden that there had been no time or opportunity to arouse me the lily was indeed hoveto as i had observed when i first awoke but it was with both jib and foresheet to windward the probability was then that on bob quitting the helm she had flown up into the wind until her headsails were taken aback when she would of course or most probably pay off on the opposite tack and remain hoveto this must necessarily have happened at least four hours ago it was now eight oclock because had bob been on deck at eight bells he would of course have called me and during all this time the boat had been sailing away from him not very rapidly it is true being hoveto but probably at a rate of at least three knots an hour what might not have happened to the poor fellow in that time he was a splendid swimmer i knew having acquired the art on our last voyage and well able to take care of himself in the water and there was very little sea on besides i felt pretty certain he had the lifebuoy and with its assistance i knew he could keep himself afloat in such weather until worn out with exhaustion from want of food but there were other perils than that of drowning and if attacked by a shark what chance had he these thoughts flashed through my mind whilst busily employed in taking the necessary steps to return in search of him for i had no idea of continuing the voyage without making such a search indeed it would have been impossible and my chances of success were not so meagre as might at first sight be supposed in the first place knowing how difficult it would be to see such an object as a lifebuoy even with a man in it at any great distance from so low an elevation as our deck i had taken the precaution to have each buoy fitted with a contrivance for hoisting a signal this consisted of a small bundle of jointed rods which could be put together like a fishingrod and on the topmost of these was a white flag two feet square on the buoy itself was firmly lashed a step similar to the bucket i believe it is called in which a carriagewhip is placed when not in use by the driver the rods taken to pieces were securely lashed in a compact bundle to the buoy and the bucket was a fixture thus if bob had the lifebuoy he also had the means of indicating his whereabouts and that too at a considerable distance and i knew pretty nearly in what direction i ought to steer in order to take the most effectual means of finding him whilst hoveto the lilys course or drift was on the whole as nearly as possible at right angles to the direction of the wind it only remained then to turn her round and keep the wind directly abeam and i should be going back pretty nearly over the same ground i had been traversing since bob went overboard accordingly i lost no time in getting the lily round when i once more hove her to and went aloft to the crosstrees with my glass to see if the white flag were visible a long and anxious scrutiny followed but without any discovery i did not feel any very great disappointment at this for i thought it very probable i was too far away to discover so small an object even with the aid of my glass once satisfied that it was nowhere to be seen i quickly descended to the deck trimmed the sheets flowing and away the little craft bounded over the bright flashing sea i stood on for an hour exactly when i once more hauled the foresheet to windward and went aloft with my glass again my first look was ahead first with the naked eye and then with the glass but not a speck could i discern to break the monotony of the bluegrey of the sea except an occasional curling foamcrest i next carefully swept the ocean from forward round to windward thinking i might have run too far off the wind once or twice i thought i detected a flickering of something white but it instantly disappeared again and i was obliged to believe it was only the foam of a breaking wave i was about to descend once more to the deck when it occurred to me to take a glance to leeward i once more levelled my glass and swept it over the surface of the sea but again i could see nothing i reluctantly closed it slung it over my shoulder and swung myself off the crosstrees to go down by the masthoops when my eye was arrested for a moment by what i knew at once to be the flag almost as i caught sight of it i lost it again and as the craft was constantly falling off or coming up again into the wind i hardly knew exactly in what point to look for it however i regained by position upon the crosstrees levelling my glass rather inconveniently on the fore side of the topmast to clear the topsail and presently i caught it again yes there it was sure enough about three miles dead to leeward and what was more i could not only see the flag but also the buoy and bob in it he seemed to be waving his arms about in a most frantic manner and making a tremendous splashing doubtless i thought with the view of making his position more apparent as of course he could see the cutter and knew i must be looking for him i slipped down on deck quick as lightning triced up the main tack just high enough to enable me to see under the foot of the sail and squared dead away before the wind ten minutes afterwards i caught a glimpse of the flag right ahead as the boat rose on a sea and then i edged away taking room to run up alongside him on the port tack with my headsheets to windward i could now see bob away on the port bow every time the lily rose on the top of a wave and he was still to my great surprise splashing away furiously and now i caught the sound of his voice shouting surely thought i the poor fellow has not become insane through the dreadful strain to which his nerves have been subjected a minute later the cause of his strange behaviour became apparent a dark object of triangular shape appeared moving in narrow circles round the spot where poor bob was floating disappearing at frequent intervals and then the splashing became more frantically vigorous than ever it was a shark that was thus blockading bob and the splashing was resorted to to frighten the creature from attacking him i carefully measured my distance and exactly at the right moment jammed my helm hard down hauling in the mainsheet as i did so the lily shot into the wind just clearing the buoy by a hairsbreadth i sprang to the rigging stooped down and seized bobs extended hand with mine as he came alongside and then exerting all the strength i could command i fairly jerked him out of the water upon deck just as the shark had apparently made up his mind to be no longer denied with such impetuosity did he make his rush that his snout rose a good two feet fairly above our gunwale and had not the impetus with which i jerked bob out of the water been sufficient to fetch him clear inboard the shark would have had him after all as it was we got a glance into his open jaws and at his six rows of teeth the remembrance of which makes me shudder to this day as the shark disappeared with a savage whisk of the tail poor bob turned to me his lips quivered convulsively for a moment in an effort to speak and then he fell to the deck in a dead faint two or three buckets of water dashed in his face and a glass of neat brandy however soon restored him and it was almost pitiful to listen to the poor fellows heartfelt and reiterated expressions of gratitude for his rescue ever since about half an hour after sunrise was that incarnate devil alongside of me exclaimed he and hadnt it been for my seeing the cutters sails and knowin as you was on the lookout for me i must have give in human natur couldnt hold out agin that sort of thing for long and now i feel that weak and done up that a child might pitch me overboard agin if he was so minded i do believe the lifebuoy came aboard again with bob so i unshipped the signalstaff and took it to pieces made it up in a bundle once more stopped it to the buoy and slung the buoy itself in its old position on the boom the cutter was still hoveto and i allowed her to remain so whilst i went forward to see to the breakfast bob meanwhile changing his wet clothes for dry ones and hanging the former in the rigging to dry i was still busy over the cookery when bob came into the forecastle and observed i say harry theres that spiteful devil still alongside and with a most onchristian longing to make a breakfast off of your old shipmate ill go bail couldnt we contrive somehow to put a stopper on his tormentin purpensities ay ay bob old man replied i i think we may manage to do that without much difficulty you get one of the airguns out of the beckets whilst i look after this coffeeits just on the boiland well try the virtues of cold lead upon his constitution and the powers of the gun at the same time as soon as i could leave the coffee i got a piece of pork out of our small harness cask and lashed it to a piece of line whilst bob under my directions charged the gun this done the pork was hung just outside the taffrail and full in the sharks view but not in the water and i lay down on deck with the gun ready for my gentleman should he make a rush this however he seemed indisposed to do eyeing the bait longingly but keeping at a respectful distance gradually this distance shortened however and he finally ventured close under the boats stern and within about three feet of the pork i kept the gun levelled at him aiming at his eye and now having him so close and so directly under me i thought there was little fear of the bullet being diverted from its proper direction by the water so i fired the lead sped true the blood spirted from the creatures eye and with a tremendous spring he threw himself backward only to roll over on his back with a convulsive writhe or two ere he floated motionless and dead so much for bullyin honest seamen when they has the misfortin to walk overboard observed bob eyeing the carcase with much complacency i shall feel more comfortable like now i knows as your cruise is over for good and all walk overboard bob exclaimed i you surely do not mean to say you walked overboard twas little else my lad but ill tell ye all about it whilst were getting our breakfast stowed under hatches for ill be bound youre longing to hear the rights of the story that indeed i am old fellow so come along below and let us get the yarn and our breakfasts at once i am longing for both having taken a look all round to see that nothing was in sight we went below and seated ourselves at the cabintable and bob forthwith proceeded with his story volume one chapter viii bobs dream youll maybe remember commenced bob that when i came upon deck last night to take my watch i mentioned that i was glad enough to be out of my hammock and away from the tormentin dreams id had of that sarpent well and i was tooi felt better and calmer like the minute i set foot upon the deck and as soon as you was gone below i makes myself comfortable in the chair a low deckchair in which we used frequently to sit whilst steering takes the tillerrope in my hand sets the little crafts course by a star and starts thinking how pleased the skipper will be when he sees his son and his old mate turning up some fine morning at the anchorage which i doubt not lies just under his parlour window i got thinking and thinking until it seemed to me as i could see the old man as plain as i can see you now coming down between the trees with his hand held out and his face all smiling and joyful like and i steps forward to give him a hearty shake of the fin when all of a suddent he changes into that infarnal old sarpent and at me he comes with his eyes glaring and his jaws wide open you may take your oath harry i warnt long in stays round i comes like a top and away i scuds dead afore the wind and hethe sarpent i meanarter me it seemed to me as the faster i tried to run the less headway i made and presently he was close aboard of me there was a great rock just ahead of me and i makes a tremenjous jump to get behind it when whack goes my head agin the mainboom with that force it fairly stunned me and afore i could recover myself i lost my balance and overboard i goes i felt myself going and flung out my hands to save myself naterally and by that means i managed to get hold of the becket of the lifebuoy which in course broke adrift from the boom and came overboard with me well i didnt seem to know where i was or what i was doin for a minute or two and then the cold water revived me i slips my arm through the buoy and takes a look round for the cutter i must have run her pretty nigh dead off the wind in my sleep for i could see her almost straight to leeward of me still standin on but comin slowly to the wind she was a good quarter of a mile away from me and i thinks as how i might still have a chance of fetching her agin if she gets to luffing into the wind and losing her way so i strikes out ater her but lord bless ye harry youve no idea how the little hussy slips along until you comes to be overboard swimming in her wake it seemed to me as though shed never come to and all the while she was walking away to the tune of a good seven knots at last when i rose on the top of a sea i sees as she was in stays and all right thinks i harrys come on deck and missed me and hes comin back ater me but i soon saw as shed run into the wind and hove herself to and that most likely you was still fast asleep in your hammock i next tried to cut her off by swimming in the direction that she was heading but after about half an hours hard tusslin i knowed it was no use she forereached upon me as if i was at anchor so i give the job up and layto in the buoy for a rest for id put out all my strength in chase and was pretty nigh done up i knowed youd miss me some time in the morning and that youd miss the buoy too and i felt sartain that youd come back to look me up so i sets to work to get my signalpole on end and the flag flyin all ready for daylight i watched the little barkie fairly out of sight and then i began to feel lonesome like and ill own that most oncomfortable thoughts came into my head about the seasarpent but strange as you may think it i never give a thought to the sharks i thought as day were never going to break agin but at last i sees it light up a bit away to the eastard and it got gradally brighter and brighter and presently i sees the sun just showin above the horizon then i felt a little bit more cheerful and satisfied like for i knowed youd soon be stirring and i should have you back on the lookout for me of course i gave a good look all round as soon as there was light enough to see properly but there warnt so much as a gull in sight and away to the norard and eastard where i knowed you was the sun dazzled my eyes sos i couldnt see well twas just as id caught a glimpse as i thought of the peak of the lilys gafftopsail that i sees about fifty fathom away the fin of thatshark scullin quietly along i kept pretty still you may swear hoping hed pass me butnot he down goes his helm and he takes a sheer my way and i thought it was all up with me he ranged up alongside as quiet as you please howsever and just dodged round and round me off and on as if he didnt quite know what i was made of i expect it was the flutterin of the flag overhead as he didnt understand but any way he kept very quiet and peaceable for a good long spell and i was beginnin to hope he wouldnt have no truck with me and to cheer me up still more i sees the little lily coming back to look for her chief mate if youll believe me harry im of opinion that devil saw you comin as well as myself and that he knowed hed have to make up his mind pretty soon or lose me altogether for he began to swim round me now tolerable smart and presently he makes a dive id made up my mind what to do as soon as he took to that game and i starts splashing hands and legs all i knowed and shouting too like fury and presently he comes up again well the chap kept me that busy i hadnt a minute to spare and when you ranged up alongside i was that tired out i didnt know how to make another splash so much for going to sleep in your watch on deck master bob said i as the mate brought his yarn to a conclusion ay more shame to me that i should ever have done such a thing replied he greatly crestfallen but i lay the blame of the whole consarn from beginnin to end on thatsarpent though no amount of sarpents will excuse a man fallin asleep in his watch more especially when he has charge of the deck well said i you have been pretty well punished for your fault old man at all events but alls well that ends well and i am heartily glad that you are so well out of the scrape and now i shall insist on your going to your hammock for the rest of the day and ill take care of the craft in fact she will almost steer herself in this weather so i shall manage very well indeed only dont have any more dreams which will cause you to jump overboard please for i really cannot afford to lose you the poor old fellow was so exhausted that though he protested against the proposed arrangement i could see he was glad enough to avail himself of it and after a feeble attempt at remonstrance he yielded to my persuasions and turned in and was quickly in a sound refreshing sleep nothing further of importance occurred for several days to break the monotony of the voyage we continued to make good way to the southward and ten days after crossing the line we lost the southeast tradewinds and ran into a light southerly breeze as we still had a very fair quantity of water on board and indulged in good hopes of getting rain enough shortly to fill our tank up without the necessity of putting in anywhere and as the chances were very great that as we got farther to the southward we should meet with westerly winds i determined to stand to the southward and westward closehauled of course on the port tack so that should the wind come from the westward as we expected we should be in a good weatherly position whilst if we were disappointed in the matter of rain we should have the land close aboard and could run in and fill up the southerly wind lasted us a couple of days and then veered gradually round to about southwest as this broke us off considerably from our course we hove the cutter about and were then able to lie about southandbyeast a good rap full the wind now freshened considerably and we had it stronger than at any time since leaving england except in the gale in the bay of biscay so that we were reduced to doublereefed mainsail reefed foresail and number three jib under this canvas the little lily made very excellent weather of it though the incessant showers of spray which she threw over herself necessitated the constant use of our macintoshes whilst on deck and this we found extremely inconvenient from their warmth however as we had been wonderfully favoured in the matter of weather so far we had no right to grumble if we were now treated to a few of the inconveniences of such a voyage as ours though still making very good way we were not getting on so fast as we had been our low canvas and the heavy sea for a craft of our size which began to get up not permitting us to do more than our seven knots still this was remarkably good work and we ought to have been perfectly satisfied but the little barkie had stepped out at such a rattling pace all the earlier part of the voyage that we could not be contented with any reduction in speed this lasted for five days and then about one pm the wind suddenly dropped altogether and left us tumbling helplessly about without even steerageway the sky had gradually become overcast and the air suffocatingly close and when i went below to look at the aneroid i found it had gone back considerably this might mean only a thunderstorm or it might mean something much worse so we set to work to prepare for whatever might come the mainsail was stowed and the cover put on the foresail hauled down and unbent and the trysail bent reefed and stowed to be set or not as circumstances might require as it turned out it was only a thunderstorm but it was a regular tropical one whilst it lasted the rain came down in sheets without a breath of wind and we not only filled our tank but also every available cask can and empty bottle we had on board and as this was done long before the rain was over though the thunderstorm soon passed off bob and i stripped and enjoyed to our hearts content the unwonted luxury of a wash from head to foot in the most deliriously soft water after which we roused out our dirty clothes and had a regular good washingday the rain lasted about three hours and then cleared away as rapidly as it had come on leaving the air beautifully fresh and pure the sea beaten down until nothing but a long lazy swell remained of the late breeze and ourselves refreshed beyond description by our soap and water bath the sun came out again clear and strong drying our washing in about half an hour and to complete the good work a nice steady wind from the northeast sprang up and sent us bowling merrily along upon our course once more with all our flyingkites aloft to woo the welcome breeze the glass beginning to rise again immediately that the thunderstorm was over two nights after this the wind still holding favourable though rather fresher so that our spars had as much as they could do notwithstanding our preventer backstays to bear the strain of our enormous spinnaker and balloon gafftopsail and the little water lily flying along at as our patent log told usover thirteen knots we dashed past a halfconsumed hencoop a few charred pieces of planking and some halfburnt spars all of which had the appearance of having been but a short time in the water the spars were those of a ship of about a thousand tons and we came to the conclusion that it was one of those melancholy cases in which the good ship after perhaps successfully battling with a hundred storms is made to succumb at last to that terrible foe to seamen a fire ignited by the merest and apparently most trivial of accidents but the reader will see further on that we had but too good reason to alter this opinion we passed this wreckage about the middle of the second dogwatch while bob and i were discussing the propriety of shortening sail somewhat for the night but as the breeze seemed disposed to grow lighter rather than otherwise we decided to let everything stand for the present when bob called me at midnight however the wind had hauled so far round from the eastward that it became necessary to shift the spinnaker to the bowspritend and this we accordingly did the wind had fallen much lighter while i was below it continued to drop all my watch and when i turned out next morning there was barely enough of it to fan us along at about three knots as the sun rose higher it died away altogether and it was as much as we could do through the day to keep the cutters head in the right direction this would have been wearisome work in the tropics but we had been out of them for some days and were getting well to the southward and the air began to feel quite fresh and chilly at night so much so indeed that for the last night or two bob and i had found our thick pilot jackets a very great comfort at last by the time that tea was ready the lily was boxing the compass having lost steerageway altogether so as our big sails were no use we took them in and stowed them away not knowing from whence or how strong the breeze might next come we took a good look all round at the weather and then left the lily to take care of herself whilst we went below to our evening meal this over we both went on deck again to smoke our pipes and have a chat until eight bells it may be thought that two men situated as we were would soon exhaust all available topics of conversation but this was by no means the case bob though he had no education but that pertaining to his profession was a profound thinker and he often amused and sometimes startled me by the originality of his remarks he had knocked about the world a good deal and had the knack of not only a quick observation but also of being able to clearly and accurately recall what he had seen and the impressions thereby produced upon himself he was expatiating on this occasion on the charms of nature of which he was an enthusiastic admirer the subject having been suggested by the beauty of the sunset which we had both been watching and i was thoroughly enjoying the rugged eloquence with which the scene had inspired him when we were startled by a long low wailing cry which rang out upon the still air apparently not half a dozen fathoms from us making our blood curdle and our hair stiffen with horror at its unearthly and thrilling cadence we looked earnestly and eagerly in the direction from which the cry had seemed to proceed but nothing was visible in that or indeed in any other direction the sun had set and the grey of evening was deepening over the glassy surface of the water but there was still light enough reflected from the sky to have enabled us to see any object within sight almost as distinctly as in broad day but not an object of any description could we see not even a solitary albatross we had carefully scanned as far as was possible the entire visible surface of the ocean and had turned inquiringly towards each other when once more rang out that mysterious cry this time apparently close under our stern we turned unutterably horrorstricken in that direction but there was nothing seamen are as a rule as brave as lions but anything mysterious and unaccountable completely cowes them and such i confess was now the case with us the cry was too sharp and loud to have proceeded from any distance and there was no visible explanation of it it was not repeated a third time i am happy to say and i wish never to hear anything like it again what it was or whence it came we never knew and i was and am to this day utterly unable to account for it i have since been informed that such sounds have occasionally been heard at sea by others as well as ourselves but never with the result of any discovery as to their origin during the next three days we had nothing but light variable winds and calms on the morning of the fourth day at daybreak we made a sail directly ahead at this time we had a nice little breeze and were going about six knots as we neared her we noticed that she was hoveto her courses brailed up and her topgallant yards on the caps when close to her it struck us that something must be the matter on board for not a soul could we see about her decks the vessel herself tooa fullrigged ship of about fourteen hundred tonsstruck us as being unusually deep in the water there being no sea on we decided to run alongside and board her thinking she might possibly prove derelict we did so accordingly rounding to under her stern and ranging up alongside on her lee quarter having first however taken in our gafftopsail and lowered our topmast so as not to foul her rigging as we came gently alongside an exclamation escaped bob who was standing forward ready to heave a line on board or jump up the side with it according to circumstances heres been some cursed foul play here by the look of it harry exclaimed he mutiny and murder i should judge by this pointing to the scuppers of the ship from which blood had evidently been flowing large semicoagulated gouts still adhering to the sides of the vessel and about the mouths of the scupperholes the vessel being as i have said very low in the water we had no difficulty whatever in boarding her both springing up the side at the same moment each with the end of a line in our hands good heavens what a sight met our horrified gaze as we leaped down upon the ships deck some three or four and twenty corpses lay there with the blood still slowly oozing in a few instances from wounds in various parts of their bodies the wounds were mostly inflicted by cutlasses and pistolshots but two of the bodies apparently those of officers had the heads almost severed from the trunks the gashes having been evidently inflicted by a keener weapon than a ships cutlass these bodies had the arms lashed tightly behind the back too horrorstricken to speak a word i walked aft bob following me and entered the cabin which was on deck and from which i thought i heard a groan issuing on entering the first object i saw was the body of a young man about four and twenty years of age lying close across the doorway and covered with wounds his left arm was almost completely cut through a long gash had laid his forehead open from above the right temple to the left eyebrow a pistolbullet had entered his forehead nearly fair between the eyes and blood had evidently flowed copiously from his right breast this body lay across three others dressed in the usual attire of seamen on a sofa which stretched entirely across the afterpart of the cabin lay the body of a young and most beautiful girl her nightdress torn to shreds and her fair skin disfigured by deep blue marks and smeared with blood indicating but too clearly that she had been the victim of most atrocious outrages and lastly under the cabintable lay another body from which whilst we stood gazing in speechless horror at these evidences of diabolical atrocity a faint groan issued bob assisted me to draw the sufferer from under the table and we then saw that he was an old man greyhaired and dressed in fine blue cloth garnished with gilt buttons and a stripe of gold lace round the cuffs of the jacket no doubt the master of the vessel bob drew the corpse of the young girl somewhat aside spreading the tablecover over the body reverently to hide the naked limbs and then between us we placed the wounded man on the sofa the cabin had notwithstanding the ghastly appearance it presented been the scene of a wild carouse for the table was covered with glasses and wine and spirit bottles and broken bottles and glasses littered the floor i searched among the contents of the table until i found a bottle only partly empty and from this i poured out a glass of its contents which proved to be port and managed with considerable difficulty to get a small quantity of the wine down the wounded mans throat the skylight was open and the air coming down through it in a cool gentle breeze assisted the wine in restoring him to consciousness he opened his eyes and gazed round him vacantly for a moment or so and then memory returned and he burst violently into tears we soothed him as well as we could assuring him that we were friends and that we would not leave him and in a minute or two he recovered strength and composure enough to speak thank you gentlemen thank you said he but my time here is very short and your wellmeant efforts for my relief are not only useless but they also increase my suffering you are i presume from some ship which has come up with us since those fiends left kindly prop me up a little higher on the sofa gentlemen if you please and i will endeavour to tell you what has happened before i pass away we did so and as we were making his position as easy as we could for him his eye fell upon the body of the young girl and once more his tears burst forth mingled with prayers for her and the most bitter curses upon her destroyers he raised one hand to his face as though to brush his tears away and we then noticed for the first timehorror upon horrorthat his fingers had all been cut or rather hacked out at the knucklejoints the wounds still slowly bleeding he saw our looks of compassion and said as if in reply ah gentlemen willingly would i have submitted to be torn limb from limb by the demons had they but spared my poor rosemy darling my only daughter after another short pause he began it was about midnight last night that we noticed a sail ahead of us which was duly reported there was not very much wind at the time and she did not near us until about six bells as she closed with us her movements became so suspicious that i ordered the armchest on deck called all hands and served out the pistols and cutlasses to them our suspicions were very shortly confirmed for when she was within a cables length of us she sheered suddenly alongside and about fifty men leaped from her on to our deck our poor fellows gave them a warm reception but they were all quickly cut down and in about three minutes the pirates had the ship they immediately began to plunder her and a band of the most ruffianly of them headed by their captain made for the cabin seeing that all was lost my sonhis body lies at the door thereand i rushed in here to make a desperate stand in defence of my daughter the poor fellow killed three of them whilst i severely wounded others but he was shot down and i fell exhausted with the wounds i had already received my poor girl was soon discovered and dragged from her berth the chief then questioned me as to our cargo where we were from and so on and believing that treasure was concealed somewhere in the ship he mutilated me thus holding up his fingerless hands to force me to reveal its hidingplace we had none but he would not be convinced and finding bodily torture of no avail to extract from me the information it was not in my power to give the monsteroh gentlemen my poor poor girl my innocent my gentle rosei cannot say it thank god she soon diedof shame and a broken heart doubtless for even they seemed unwilling to stain their weapons with her blood would that they had would that i had been able so to steel my heart as to have slain her rather than that i should have seen what i did for they first bound me and then placed me so that i could see all as soon as they found that she was dead they ransacked the cabin turned out the lockers and drank and sang until the mate i suppose of the pirate came in and reported that everything of value was transferred to the brig when the leaderwhom i once or twice heard addressed as johnsonbob and i started and looked at each other expressivelyordered the ship to be scuttled and for all hands but those employed on the work to return to the brig they then left the cabin and about half an hour afterwards i believe they left the ship she cannotfloat ververy muchlonger but i shallshall be gone before his voice had been gradually growing weaker and weaker as he approached the end of his narrative and now failed altogether i tore open the front of his shirt to ascertain if his heart still beat and now saw that he had received in addition to other wounds a shot through the chest there was no blood but he no doubt bled internally i could detect not the faintest flutter of the heart so we laid him gently down on the sofa as we did so a small stream of blood trickled out of his mouth he sighed heavily and his jaw dropped seeing that he was dead we left the cabin and stepped out once more into the bright sunshine we noticed that even during the short time we had been on board the vessel had settled considerably in the water it was evidently quite time we were off but we first went all round the deck examining carefully each body to see if either exhibited the least sign of life but all were utterly beyond the reach of our help we accordingly cast off and returned on board the water lily making all the sail we could to get as speedily as possible away from the scene of such diabolical atrocities we were about four miles distant from the ship when we observed her roll once or twice slowly and heavily her stern rose and her bows disappearing beneath the water she gradually became almost perpendicular when she paused for a moment and then sank gently out of sight the moment that johnsons name was mentioned the same idea flashed into both our minds that this was the same man and probably the same ship of which we had so lately heard the captain spoke of the pirate vessel as a brig and we felt no manner of doubt that she was the albatross so then these men the men who had showed such base treachery to my father were still at large and in full prosecution of their villainous designs and not only so but they were in the same quarter of the globe as ourselves and manifestly at no very great distance we felt no difficulty whatever now in attaching a very different and much more sinister significance to the charred fragments of wreck we had lately passed our little craft would of course be but a poor prize to these rascals but since they seemed so to luxuriate in cruelty it behoved us to give them as wide a berth as possible the presence of this craft and that too in our immediate vicinity was a source of the greatest anxiety to us so much so that we took in our gafftopsail and housed our topmast to show but a low spread of canvas and one or other of us remained posted at the masthead all day on the lookout so as if possible to sight her before being seen ourselves should it happen that we were both proceeding in the same direction or on such courses as would bring us together we maintained this ceaseless watch for the pirate brig for four days when judging from the experience we had already obtained of our sailing powers in fine weather as compared with those of other vessels that we had fallen in with we came to the conclusion that all immediate danger of a rencontre with her was past and we accordingly relaxed our vigilance and allowed ourselves some rest which by this time we greatly needed about noon on the seventh day after boarding the ship scuttled by the pirates the name of which i forgot to mention was the massachusetts of new york land appeared ahead it was the falkland group of barren and desolate islands in the vicinity of cape horn as we had been expecting the wind now drew round from the westward fresh though not so much so as to prevent our showing a jibheaded gafftopsail to it under this sail the little water lily made most excellent way going a good eight knots through the water closehauled and against a very respectable head sea as the day drew on the wind freshened and though we carried on as long as we dared wishing to get round the dreaded cape as quickly as possible we were obliged at sunset to take our topsail in in order to save our topmast by breakfasttime next morning it became necessary to further reduce our canvas and we accordingly took down a reef in our mainsail the question now arose whether it would be better to go round outside of everything or to attempt the straits of magellan we hove the little craft to and went below and carefully examined the chart discussing as we did so the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the two routes bob had experience of both and he seemed to feel that in the present state of the weather and with the wind as it was we were likely to make a quicker passage by going on to the southward and passing round the horn i was of the same opinion by no means liking the intricacies of the navigation of the straits or the violent tides which our sailing directions told us swept through them we accordingly filled away again carrying on notwithstanding the still freshening breeze until the little water lily seemed alternately to threaten diving to the bottom with us or taking flight altogether into the air we were nearly blinded by the copious showers of spray which flew over us and our mainsail was wet to its very peak yet it was a real pleasure to see the ease and lightness with which the boat skimmed over the now formidable and angry sea about four bells in the morning watch we passed within three miles of the easternmost end of staten island an hour later the breeze freshened upon us so fiercely that we saw it would be dangerous to trifle with it any longer so we hauled down our mainsail and stowed it and bent and set the trysail in its place singlereefed this change proved a very great relief to the little craft the sway and leverage of the heavy mainboom having made her plunge tremendously whereas now she went along without shipping a drop of water beyond the spray which she of course still continued to throw over herself it was whilst we were busy shifting our after canvas that the little lily experienced perhaps one of the most narrow escapes of the whole voyage we were too much occupied with our work to keep a very bright lookout indeed we considered that beyond the state of the weather there was nothing to demand our attention we had just completed the bending of the trysail when away to windward of us not more than a quarter of a mile distant we observed a large ship running down directly upon us before the wind under topgallant stunsails the lily was almost stationary at the time and the ship was heading as straight as she possibly could for us how the trysail went up it is impossible for me to say we pulled like demons and it seemed to rise instantaneously into its place fully set i sprang aft and put the helm hard up to gather way and we had just begun to draw through the water when the ship took a sheer as though to cross our bows i kept the tiller jammed hard over and eased away the trysail sheet intending to wear when the ship took another sheer directly towards us she was now close aboard of us and not a soul could i see on the lookout bob rushed aft with his eye on the ships bowsprit evidently prepared for a spring whilst i shifted the tiller and flattened in the trysail sheet once more that saved us the cutter luffed just in time and shot literally from beneath the ships bows so close were we that had the stranger been pitching instead of scending at the moment her jibboomend must have passed through the peak of our trysail it may seem to the uninitiated an easy matter to keep out of an approaching ships way by simply observing the precise direction in which she is steering but as a matter of fact a ship when running before the wind sails in anything but a straight line sheering first one way and then another and it is quite impossible for a spectator to judge with accuracy in which direction she will sheer at a given moment hence the danger in which we so unexpectedly found ourselves volume one chapter ix a cape horn gale we stood on to the southward and westward during the remainder of that day the wind continuing still to freshen and the sea getting up with most fearful rapidity the glass fell slowly too and there appeared to be every prospect of our getting a taste of the quality of the weather for which cape horn is so notorious as the sun set the veil of cloudwrack which had obscured the heavens all day was rent asunder in the western quarter and we caught a glimpse of the great luminary hanging upon the verge of the horizon like a ball of molten copper his level beams shot for a few moments across the broad expanse of the heaving and wildlyleaping waters tinging the wavecrests immediately in his wake with deep bloodred whilst all around elsewhere the angry ocean was darkest indigo a few rays shot upward gleaming wildly among the flying scud and then the orb of day sank into the ocean shooting abroad as he did so a sudden baleful crimson glare which gradually died out in the gloom of increasing storm and coming night bob stood by my side watching the wild scene i have so feebly described and as the sun disappeared he turned to me and remarked my eyes harry what dye think of that lad to my mind it needs no prophet to tell us with that afore our eyes that were booked for a reglar thoroughbred cape horn gale of wind and my advice as chief mate of this here barkie is that we makes her just as snug as we knows how for depend upon it afore morning we shall have as thorough a trial of her seagoin qualities as were likely to want for many a day to come my own idea bob replied i i have seldom seen a wilder sunset and if it does not mean wind and plenty of it too all my weatherlore must go for nothing and i shall have to turn to and learn everything over afresh ay ay you may say that returned he and i the same but weve both knocked about too many years at sea to make any mistake in our reading when natur opens so plain a page of her book for us as yond so the sooner we turns to the better say i or we shall have the darkness upon us afore were ready for it thank god weve plenty of searoom so lets rouse up that floatinganchor contrivance of yourn my lad for depend upon it if ever the lily is likely to need the consarn she will tonight this floatinganchor i will describe for the benefit of those who may not have seen such a thing for it is a most useful affair and no small craft should undertake a long cruise without one ours was formed of two flat bars of iron each ten feet in length riveted together in the centre in such a way that they would either fold flat one upon the other for convenience of stowage or open out at right angles forming a cross of four equal arms in each end of each bar was a hole capable of taking a good stout rope swifter which was set up taut when the bars were opened so as to keep them spread at right angles four other holes were punched two in each bar about midway between each end and the centre rivet these were for the reception of a crowfoot as soon as the bars were spread open and the swifter passed and set up a square sheet of the stoutest canvas painted was spread over them the edges laced to the swifter with a stout lacing and the crowfoot toggled through the intermediate holes in the bars and corresponding holes in the canvas a buoy was then attached to the end of one arm to float the anchor with a sufficient amount of buoyrope to allow it to sink to the requisite depth the end of the cable was shackled into the thimble of the crowfoot the buoy streamed overboard and the anchor let go i may as well state here that for the economisation of space the buoy for floating our anchor was an indiarubber ball made of the same materials as an ordinary aircushion and distended in the same way this was enclosed in a strong net of threestrand sinnet which net was attached to the buoyrope we hove the craft to whilst we were preparing the anchor and glad enough was i when it was ready for by this time the sea was running so high and breaking so heavily that i was afraid once or twice when we were caught broadsideto that we should be capsized we let go the anchor with only two fathoms of buoyrope so as to sink it just deep enough to keep us head to sea without materially interfering with the crafts drift as we thought we should ride all the easier for such an arrangement and so it proved as soon as the anchor was let go we got our headsail in ran in the bowsprit and got our topmast on deck the trysail was closereefed and the sheet trimmed amidships the anchorlight hoisted well up on the forestay and our preparations for the night were complete by this time it was blowing tremendously heavy and the howling of the gale overhead the shriek of the wind through our scanty rigging and the hiss of the foaming water around us mingled into such a deafening sound that bob and i had fairly to shout even when close alongside of each other to make ourselves heard and then it began to thunder and lighten heavily still further increasing the wild and impressive grandeur of the scene upon which we gazed in awestruck admiration at one moment all would be deep black pitchy night lighted up only by the pale unearthly shimmer of some foaming wavecrest as it rolled menacingly down upon us gleaming with phosphorescent light anon the canopy above would be rent asunder by the vivid lightningflash and for an instant the vast whirling forms of the torn and shredded clouds would be revealed with a momentary vision of the writhing leaping and stormdriven waters beneath them illumined by the ghastly glare of the levinbrand and stricken into sudden rigidity by the rapidity of the flash we stayed on deck for about an hour after our anchor was let go watching this grand manifestation of the power of the deity sublime as terrible terrible as sublime and then finding that no improvement suggested itself in our arrangements and that the lily rode like a cork over the mountainbillowsthough occasionally the comb of a more than usually heavy sea would curl in over the bows and send a foaming cataract of water aft and out over her taffrailwe descended to the cabin to get our suppers for which by this time we were quite ready so easy was the motion of the little craft that when we got below we found no difficulty whatever in boiling the water and making ourselves a cup of good strong tea while discussing this refreshing beverage and a few biscuits we arrived at the conclusion that as we had done all it was possible to do for the safety of the boat it was useless to keep a watch through the night and that we would therefore take advantage of the opportunity to get a good undisturbed nights rest leaving the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to look out accordingly as soon as our meal was over i left bob to straighten up below while i went on deck to take a last look round and see that everything was snug and as it should be and our light burning brightly i found everything satisfactory except that it seemed to be blowing harder than ever however i could not help that so i went below again closing the companion after me and we both turned in chatted awhile listened to the roaring of the gale and the occasional heavy wash of water along the deck and finally dropped off to sleep i awoke two or three times during the night and once i turned out and pushed the slide of the companion far enough back to put my head outside but the night was still as black as pitch it was blowing harder if anything than before and the air was full of spindrift and scudwater so i pushed over the slide again and tumbled once more into my comfortable hammock very vividly impressed both with a sense of our helplessness in the midst of such a heavy gale and also with the comparative degrees of comfort between the decks and the cabin bob was the first to make a muster in the morning and his first act like mine during the night was to take a look out upon deck blowing hard enough to blow the devils horns off i heard him exclaim and as thick as a hedge and my precious eyes what a sea come up and take a look at it harry boy i never seed nothing like it all the years ive been afloat hurrah young un thats your sort as the cutter rose fearfully near to the perpendicular in surmounting the crest of a sea and then slid down down down into the trough until it seemed as though she would sink to the very oceans bed and dont the little hussy behave beautifully shes as floaty as a gull hal and drier than eer a seventyfour that ever was launched would be in a sea like this now what lubber comes here with his eyes sealed up instead of looking before him jump up harry quick boy we are in a mess here and no mistake no no its all right hell clear us ater all no thanks to him though for theres not a soulah so youre beginning to wake up at last eh here i put my head up through the companion alongside of bobs lovely phiz and saw within forty fathoms of us over the ridge of a sea and broad on our port beam the topmastheads of a brig as we both rose together on the same sea her sails first and then her hull came into view she was not a large vessel about two hundred tons or thereabouts apparently painted all black down to her copper excepting a narrow red ribbon which marked the line of her sheer she was hoveto on the port tack under a stormstaysail and her topgallantmasts were down on deck everything was very trim and manowarlike on board her but no government dockyard ever turned out such a beautiful model as she was when i first caught sight of her she was heading directly for us but as we watched her her head paid off and she swept slowly down across our stern near enough for us to have hove a biscuit on board her some ten or a dozen heads peered curiously at us over her weather bulwarks as she drove slowly past us and one man aft on the quarterdeck the officer of the watch apparently seized a trumpet to hail us but whether he did so or not or if he did what he said we neither of us knew for at that moment we both sank once more into the trough with a perfect mountain of water between us until we lost sight of him altogether for a moment even to his mastheads i took the glass which we always kept slung in beckets in the companionway open and adjusted ready for immediate use and as she rose once more into view i applied it to my eye and the first thing which caught my attention was her name painted on her stern which was now towards us the albatross by all thats unlucky exclaimed i blest if we mightnt have guessed as much if wed been in a guessin humour ejaculated bob honestgoing merchant ships aint so plaguy careful of their spars as that chapleastways not such small fry as he is pity but what they was i often says but where dye find a skipper wholl be bothered to send down his top hamper every time it pipes up a bit of a breeze no let it stand if twill is the word and if twont let it blow away but the chap is a real good seaman harry no manll deny that look how snug hes got everything and all hauled taut and coiled down neat and reglar manowar fashion ill be bound we got i think a clearer idea of the tremendous strength of the gale by watching the brig than we did even by the motions of our own little craft she was tossed about like the merest cockleshell and every time that she rose upon the crest of a sea the wind took her rag of a staysail distending it as though it would tear it clean out of the boltropes and heeling the vessel over until we could see the whole of her bottom nearly down to her keel and then her sharp bows would cleave the wavecrest in a perfect cataract of foam and spray and away she would settle down once more with a heavy weatherroll into the trough well exclaimed bob as we lost sight of her in the driving scud shes a pretty seaboat is yon brig but im blest if the little lily dont beat her even at that game what say you harry aint she proving true the very words i spoke that night when we first began to talk about this here vyage indeed she is bob i answered i am as surprised as i am delighted at her behaviour i could never have believed without seeing it myself that so small a craft would even live in such weather much less be as comfortable as she is but i dont like that continued i as the comb of a tremendous sea came curling in over our bows fairly smothering the little craft in foam for a moment though she came up immediately afterwards shaking her feathers like a duck im afraid one of these gentlemen will be starting our skylight or companion for us and that would be a very serious matter never fear returned bob confidently our bit of a windlass and the mast breaks the force of it before it reaches the skylight and that idee of yours in having it rounded at the fore end is a capital one it turns the water off each side almost like the stem of a ship besides bein stronger than a squareshaped consarn at the same time all this water coming in on deck dont do no good if it dont do no harm but hows it to be pervented i have an idea said i and its worth a trial it can do no harm and if it fails we are no worse off than we were before so saying i dived below and got out a bottle of oil through the cork of which i bored three or four holes with a corkscrew but left the cork in to the neck of the bottle i made fast the end of about a fathom of marline and then going forward i made fast the other end of the marline to one of the links of the chaincable by which we were riding to our floatinganchor i then sung out to bob to give her a few fathoms more chain and as he did so i hove the bottle overboard in about five minutes the success of my experiment became manifest the oil leaked slowly out through the holes i had bored in the cork and diffusing itself on the surface of the water caused the seas to sweep by us either without breaking at all or if they did break it was with such diminished force that no more water came on board i had heard of oil on troubled waters before but at the time that i did so i never expected to put its virtues to so thoroughly practical a test we went below and got breakfast under weigh and whilst discussing the meal our conversation naturally turned upon the appearance of the albatross there can be no question i fear as to its being that scoundrel johnson and his gang of desperadoes said i half hoping to hear bob dispute the probability but he was quite of my opinion no no said he thats the scamp never a doubt of it i noticed the name on his starn but there warnt no name of a port where he hails from for the simple reason that he hails from nowhere in particular besides a man with half an eye could tell by looking at that craft that shes strong handed depend ont harry theres too many hammocks in her focstle for an honest trader and worst luck shes bound the same road as ourselvesat least shes going round the horn but ater she gets round its not so easy to say what course she may steer we must hope shes on the lookout for some stray spaniard or other coming down the coast for if we falls in with her agin shell have someat to say to us mark my words you surely do not suppose the man will condescend to give such a pigmy as ourselves a thought do you thats just what hes doing at this identical moment its my opinion returned bob he is not fool enough to suppose were down here somewheres off the horn in this cockleshell on a pleasure trip and that were not come down here to trade he also knows pretty well or we should have a craft big enough to stow away something like a paying cargo and if were here for neither one nor tother of them objects hell want to know what we are here for and depend upon it he wont be happy till hes found out so take my advice harry and if we fall in with him again lets give him a wide berth decidedly i shall do so if possible returned i but that may prove no such easy matter with so smart a vessel as he has under his feet not in heavy weather certainly said bob but give us weather in which we can carry a topsail even if its no more nor a jibheader and ill say catch who catch can why we can lay a good two pints closer to the wind than he can and still keep a good clean full and the squarerigged craft that can beat us in going to windard must be an outandout flyer and no mistake we must keep a bright lookout and not be caught napping thats all and give everything a good wide berth till were pretty certain of what it is well said i i trust we shall not fall in with him again the pacific is a pretty big place and its not so easy to find a craft in it when you dont know where to look for her if we do meet with him again we must do all we can to avoid him and hope for the best ay ay returned bob hope for the best and prepare for the worst is a good maxim for any man it takes him clear of many a difficulty and enables him to lay his course on the vyage of life clean full and with slack bowlines as for this here johnson id ask nothing better than to have him just out of gunshot under our lee with a nice breeze and not too much sea for the little lily and then let him catch us if hes man enough for the job i certainly could not echo this wish of bobs but it was satisfactory to find that he had such great confidence in the boat and in her ability to escape from the albatross so i allowed him to remain in undisturbed enjoyment of his own opinion especially as it seemed to afford him considerable entertainment and went on deck to take another look at the weather there was no sign of the gale breaking in fact it seemed to be scarcely at its height for away to windward it looked as dirty and as full of wind as ever and the sea was something awful to contemplate it looked of course worse to us than it would to those on the deck of a large ship but even allowing for that it was unquestionably running far higher than anything i had ever seen before i have read somewhere that scientific men assert that even in the heaviest gales and in midocean the sea never attains a greater height than twenty feet from trough to crest but with all due respect to them and their sciencefounded opinions i take leave to assert that they are in this instance mistaken an intelligent sailor and i modestly claim to be at least this much is as capable of judging the height of a sea as the most scientific of mortals and i am confident of this that many of the seas i watched that morning ran as high as our crosstrees which were a trifle over thirty feet above the surface of the water indeed to satisfy myself thoroughly upon this point i climbed so high with the utmost difficulty and at very great risk of being blown overboard and whilst looking over the crosstrees i saw the crest of more than one sea rearing itself between my eye and the horizon so far the water lily had weathered the gale scatheless there was not so much as a ropeyarn out of its place or carried away and as there seemed to be no greater danger than there had been through the night and as i had taken a good look round when aloft without seeing anything we both went below to enjoy the comfort of the cabin for on deck everything was cold wet and dismal in the extreme i was anxious to get a sight of the sun at noon if possible so as to ascertain our exact latitude i knew we were not very far to the southward of staten and i did not know but there might be a current setting us toward it in which case we might find ourselves very awkwardly situated it looked half inclined to break away two or three times during the morning but as midday approached it became as bad as ever and i had the vexation of seeing noon pass by without so much as a momentary glimpse of the sun towards evening therefore i took advantage of an exceptionally clear moment and again scrambled aloft and took a thorough good look all round and especially to the northward there was nothing in sight and with this i was obliged to rest satisfied we noticed just about this time that the seas were beginning to break on board again so i concluded that our bottle of oil was exhausted and accordingly got out another and having bored holes in the cork as i had done with the first it was bent on to the cable more cable paid out and we again rode all the easier our anchorlight was trimmed and lighted and hoisted up and we went below to our tea or supper as sailors generally term it we had found the day dreadfully tedious cooped up as we were in our low cabin and a meal was a most welcome break in the monotony we sat long over this one therefore prolonging it to its utmost extent and when it was over we both turned to and cleared up the wreck by the time that all was done it was intensely dark but before settling down below for the night we both put our heads up through the companion to take a last look round bob was rather beforehand with me and he had no sooner put his head outside than he pulled it in again exclaiming in an awestruck tone look here harry what dye think of this i looked in the direction he indicated and there upon our lower masthead and also upon the trysail gaffend was a globe of pale sickly green light which wavered to and fro lengthening out and flattening in again as the cutter tossed wildly over the mountainous seas it had not the appearance of flame but rather of highly luminous mist brilliant at the core and softening off and becoming more dim as the circumference of the globe was reached and it emitted a feeble and unearthly light of no great power i had never seen such a thing before but i had often heard of it and i recognised our strange visitors at once as corposants or lamps of saint elmo as they are called by the seamen of the mediterranean though our own sailors call them by the less dignified name of davy jones lanterns what dye think of bein boarded by the likes of that again queried bob in a hoarse whisper old davy is out on a cruise tonight i reckon and it looks as though he meant to pay us a visit by his histing them two lanterns of hisn in our rigging did ye ever see anything like it afore harry lad never replied i but i have often heard them spoken of old man and though they certainly are rather queer to look at they are easily accounted for i have heard it said that they are the result of a peculiar electrical condition of the atmosphere and that the electricity attracted by any such points as the yardarms or mastheads of a ship accumulates there until it becomes visible in the form we are now looking at and is the light never visible except at the end of a spar queried bob i believe not i replied but then sail he exclaimed bob excitedly pointing in the direction of our starboard bow i looked in the direction he indicated but was too late we were on the very summit of a wave at the moment that bob spoke but were now settling into the trough as we rose to the next sea however i not only saw the ghostly light but also got an indistinct view of the ship herself she was fearfully close but appeared to be at the moment sheering away from us she looked long enough for a threemasted vessel but one mast only was standing evidently the mainmast the corposant appeared to have attached itself to the stump of her foremast which had been carried away about fifteen or twenty feet from the deck and i thought her bowsprit seemed also to be missing she was scudding under closereefed maintopsail and from her sluggish movements was evidently very much overloaded or what i thought more probable had a great deal of water in her i was the more inclined to this opinion from the peculiar character of her motions as she rose on the back of a sea her stern seemed at first to be pinned down as it were until it appeared as though the following wave would run clean over her but gradually her stern rose until it was a considerable height above the water whilst her bow in its turn seemed weighed down as would be the case with a large body of water rushing from aft forward they evidently saw our light for a faint hail of ahoy came down the wind to us from her in distress and wants assistance by the look of it remarked bob but poor chaps its little of that we can give em heaven and arth look at that harry as he spoke the ship which was rushing forward furiously on the back of a sea suddenly sheered wildly to port until she lay broadsideto the crest of the sea overtook her and breaking on board her in one vast volume of wildly flashing foam threw her down upon her beamends and as it swept over her her mast declined more and more towards the water until it lay submerged then as we gazed in speechless horror at the dreadful catastrophe a loud piercing shriek rang out clear and shrill above the hoarse diapason of the howling tempest she rolled completely bottom upwards and then disappeared broached to and capsized ejaculated we both in the same breath jump below bob and rouse up a coil of line whilst i get the lifebuoys ready exclaimed i after a single moments pause to collect my scattered faculties in an instant i had all four of the buoys ready and two of them bent on to the longest ropeends i could lay my hands on and in another that glorious bob appeared with a coil of ratline on his shoulder and a lighted bluelight in his hand the stops were cut and the ends of the coil cleared in no time and the two remaining buoys bent on while bob held the bluelight aloft at arms length for the double purpose of throwing the light as far as possible over the water and also to indicate our whereabouts to any strong swimmer who might be struggling for his life among the mountain surges and to guide him to our tiny ark of refuge for nearly an hour did we peer anxiously into the gloom in the hope of seeing some poor soul within reach of such assistance as it was in our power to afford but in vain there is no doubt that the vessel sucked all hands down with her when she sank into her watery grave when at last we reluctantly desisted from our efforts and were in the act of securing the lifebuoys once more bob cast his eyes aloft and called my attention to the fact that the corposants had disappeared depend ont harry quoth he them lanterns didnt come aboard of us for nothing they mightnt have meant mischief for us exactlyfor you cant always read old davys signs aright but you see they did mean mischief and plenty of it too for they no sooner appears aloft than a fine ship and her crew goes down close alongside of us and as soon as that bit of work was over away they go somewhere else to light up the scene of further devilry i make no manner of doubt it was utterly in vain that i attempted to argue the honest fellow out of his belief that their appearance was a portent of disaster for his mind was deeply imbued with all those superstitious notions which appear to take such peculiarly firm hold on the ideas of sailors and against superstitions of lifelong duration argument and reason are of but little avail as may readily be believed our slumbers that night after witnessing so distressing a scene were anything but sound bob and i were up and down between the deck and the cabin at least half a dozen times before morning and it was with a sense of unutterable relief that as day broke we found that the gale was breaking also by the time that breakfast was over there was a sensible diminution in the force of the wind and by noon it cleared away sufficiently overhead to enable me to get an observation not a particularly good one certainlythe sea was running far too high for that but it enabled me to ascertain that we were at least sixty miles to the southward of staten about four pm i got a very much better observation for my longitude and i found by it that our drift had not been anything like so great as i had calculated it would be this i thought might possibly arise from our being in a weathersetting current there was still rather too much of both wind and sea to make us disposed to get under way that night but we managed to get the craft up to the buoy of our floatinganchor which we weighed and let go again with five fathoms of buoyrope this was to prevent as much as possible any further drift to leeward and to take full advantage of the current the existence of which we suspected next morning however the weather had so far moderated that tired of our long inaction we resolved to make a start once more so shaking the reefs out of the trysail and rigging our bowsprit out far enough to set a small jib we got our floatinganchor in and stood away to the southward and westward with the wind out from about westnorwest volume one chapter x chased by pirates the weather now rapidly became finer and the ocean no longer lashed into fury by the breath of the tempest subsided once more into long regular undulations the wind hauled gradually more round from the northward too and blew warm and balmy a most welcome change after the raw and chilly weather we had lately experienced we once more cracked on sail upon the little water lily and on the morning following that upon which we filled away upon our course finding by observation that we were well clear of the cape and that we had plenty of room even should the wind once more back round from the westward we hauled closeup and stood away on a norwestandbywesterly course nothing of importance occurred for more than a week the weather continued settled and the glass stood high the wind was out at about north and sufficiently moderate to permit of our carrying our jibheaded topsail and day after day we flew forward upon our course seldom making less than ten knots in the hour and occasionally reaching as high as thirteen we were perfectly jubilant for having rounded the cape in safety we now considered our troubles over and our ultimate success as certain we were fairly in the pacific the region of fine weather and our little barkie had behaved so well in the gale that our confidence in her seaworthiness was thoroughly established so that all fear of future danger from bad weather was completely taken off our minds one morning the wind having fallen considerably lighter during the preceding night as soon as breakfast was over i roused up our squareheaded topsail with the intention of setting it in the room of the small one but when i proceeded to take the latter in i found that the halliards were somehow jammed aloft and i shinned up to clear them no sailor if he really be a seaman and not a tinker or a tailor ever goes aloft without taking a good look round him so after i had cleared the halliards i clung to the slim spar for a minute or two whilst i swept the horizon carefully around sail ho shouted i as i caught a glimpse of the royals of a vessel gleaming snowy white in the brilliant sunshine far away in the southwestern board where away shouted bob broad on our leebow i answered still clinging to the thin wire topmast shrouds what dye make her out to be harry my lad was the next question either a barque or a brig answered i the latter i am inclined to believe though he is still too far away for his mizzenmast to show if he has one why dye think its a brig harry queried bob his canvas looks too small for that of a barque replied i as i slid down on deck having seen all that it was possible to see at present then its thatalbatross again for a thousand ejaculated bob in a tone of deep disgust thats just the pint where he might reasonably be looked for he made sail long enough afore we did ater the gale had blowed itself out and consequently got a good long leg to the westard of us but as weve been steering perhaps a couple of pints higher than he has for most of the time since weve overhauled him and now hes come round to go to the norard and weve fallen in with him once more i was inclined to take the same view of the matter that bob did it is true that when once a ship passes out of sight at sea you can never be sure of her exact position afterwards yet under certain circumstances taking the direction of the wind and the state of the weather as data upon which to base your argument and in conjunction with these the course the vessel was steering when last seen or the part of the world to which you have reason to believe she is bound it is astonishing how near a guess may be and is not unfrequently made as to her whereabouts now we knew that the albatross was bound to the pacific when we last saw her because she was then hoveto evidently with the intention of maintaining as weatherly a position as possible had she been bound to the eastward the weather was not so bad at that time as to have prevented her scudding before it which she undoubtedly would have done under such circumstances making a fair wind of it at the same time there was of course a possibility of our being mistaken as to the craft in sight being the pirate brig it being by no means an unusual thing for vessels as small as she was or even smaller to venture round the cape well said i perhaps it will be safest bob to assume for the present that this brig is the albatross what under such circumstances is your advice which of us has the weathergage dye think queried bob it is rather difficult to decide at present i replied much depends upon which of us is the fastest if we are both going at about the same speed i should say we shall pass extremely close to her how is she heading harry was the next question to the northward rather edging down towards us if anything i thought ay ay chuckled bob it aint every craft as can stick her bowsprit into the winds eye like this here little barkie now i dare swear hes jammed hard up upon a taut bowline and here we are going as close to the wind as he is and every thread ramping full take hold of her a minute hal and lets see what these old eyes of mine can tell us about the stranger i took hold of the tiller and bob went aloft with the deliberation of the seaman who is in no particular hurry having reached the crosstrees he stood upon them with one hand grasping the peakhalliards to steady himself whilst with the other he shaded his eyes i see her i see her he exclaimed were raising her fast harry my boy and in another half hour or so we shall see her from the deck he then went as high as the yard of the topsail and clung there for a good five minutes reading all the signs which a seaman sees in the almost imperceptible peculiarities of rig shape of sails etc having satisfied himself he descended deliberately to the deck evidently ruminating deeply now ill tell ye what i think of the matter harry said he as he came aft and seated himself beside me theres a familiar sort of a look with that craft away yonder i seems to recognise her as someat ive seen afore and ive no moral doubt in the world but what its that villain johnson although we cant be sartain of it until we gets a nearer look at her and ive an idee that if anything its we thats got the weathergage and if so by all means keep it even if we has to run the gauntlet of her broadside for a minute or two once lets be to windard and in such weather as this i wouldnt fear the smartest squarerigged craft that ever was launched we could lead em no end of a dance and then give em the slip aterwards when we was tired of the fun so my advice is to luff up as close as you can not too close ye know lad let her go through it but spring your luff all as you can get and lets try what our friend yonder is made of as long as were to leeward of him the game is his but lets get to windard of him and its ours to do what we like with it i had it in my mind to take in all the canvas and lie perdu until the brig had crossed our course and was well out of our road to the northward but that would still be leaving him the weathergage and i saw fully as clearly as bob did the advantage of obtaining this if possible so on we stood boldly lying a good point higher than we had been before steering yet keeping every sail a good clean full and drawing to perfection the wind however was dropping fast and by the time that the sun was on the meridian we were not going more than five knots this made me extremely anxious more particularly as the stranger proved a remarkably fast vessel so much so that it still remained a matter of doubt which of us would cross the other bob on the other hand was delighted beyond measure stoutly avowing that the falling breeze was little if anything short of a divine manifestation in our favour he declared himself ready to stake all he was possessed of in the world and if the brig should turn out to be the pirate he actually was staking his life on our speed as against that of the stranger in light winds and was already chuckling in anticipation over that crafts discomfiture she was within about five miles of us still maintaining her relative position of about four points on our leebow when bob served dinner on deck as was our custom in fine weather we were very busy with the viands keeping one eye always on the brig however when we noticed something fluttering over her taffrail and the next moment a flag of some sort floated up to her peak i was at the tiller so bob took the glass and levelling it at the brig gave her a more thorough scrutiny than we had bestowed upon her at all hitherto the stars and stripes and a pennant exclaimed he with his eye still at the tube lord bless us for the two pretty innocents he takes us for harry but there of course he dont know as weve got his character and all about him at our fingers ends well anyhow we wont be behindhand with him in the matter of politeness and therewith master bob dived below returning in a moment with our ensign and club burgee in his hand which he bent to their respective halliards and ran them upthe one to our gaffend and the other to our masthead as we had by this time finished our meal bob cleared the things away muttering something about having plenty to do afore long besides eating and drinking our colours had not been displayed above a minute when four small balls were seen ascending to the brigs main royalmasthead where they broke abroad and waved lazily out in the failing breeze as a signal bob at once assumed the duties of signalofficer by once more taking a peep through the glass commercial code pennant said he and then he read out the flags beneath it run down and fetch up the signalbook said i he did so we turned up the signal and read come under my lee i wish to speak you thank ee ejaculated bob not if we can help it mister johnson i reckon twould be about the most onprofitable conwersation as ever the crew of this here cutter took a part in weve got our own wholesome planks to walk aboard here when we wants any of that sort of exercise and though theres not much to boast of in the way of room i dare say theres more of that than wed find on the plank youd give us for a parade ground seems to me hal as were bringing him nearer abeam than he was a while ago aint it so you are right bob i replied glancing at the compass he is more than a point farther aft than he was a quarter of an hour ago but is it not possible that we are giving ourselves needless uneasiness that craft certainly has a look of the albatross but we are not sure that it is her after all dye notice his maintopmaststaysail harry returned he cut like a trysail and set on a stay that leads down just clear of his foretop and into the slings of his foreyard how many vessels will ye see with a sail shaped like that yet i noticed that his was the other day and theres the red ribbon round him too in fact its the albatross all over concluded he with the glass once more at his eye it was but too evident that bob was right i had been hoping that the general resemblance of the brig in sight to the albatross was purely accidental but she was now within less than three miles of us and even without the aid of the telescope certain features if i may so term them were recognisable which identified her beyond all question as the pirate brig what shall we do about answering his signal bob said i let it fly as it is unanswered he replied composedly look where were dropping him to in another quarter of an hour we shall have him fairly on our leebeam and that too out of gunshot unless as is most likely the case hes got a long gun but if he has were a small mark to fire at and well soon slip out of range even of that it was by this time perfectly manifest that whatever he might be able to do in a breeze he had no chance with us in a light air like the present and i entertained strong hopes of being able to slip past him unscathed when i felt sanguine of our ability to get fairly away from him in a chase dead to windward but he evidently had no notion of letting us have our own way in this matter without a pretty vigorous protest on his part for as we were still watching him we saw the brig slowly luff into the wind his foresheet was raised for a moment a flash of flame and a puff of white smoke darted suddenly from his forecastle and then we saw the jets spouting up where the shot struck the water as it came ricocheting towards us he had aimed apparently so as to throw the shot across our forefoot but it fell short by about fifty feet do that again you lubber exclaimed bob contemptuously apostrophising the brig three more such fools tricks as that and well say goodbye tye without ever having been within range see how long it takes him to pay off agin harry very near lost his way altogether when hed a had to box her off with his headyards and by the time hed done that we should be well clear of him well i did think the man had more sense than to do the like of that friend johnson evidently saw his mistake as clearly as we did for he fired no more until we had crept up fairly ahead of him just as we were crossing his bows however and had got his masts in oneby which time he had drawn considerably nearer usthe brig fell off a little not to repeat her former error and again came the flash the smoke and the ringing report here it comes straight for us this time and no mistake exclaimed bob as the waterjets again marked the course of the shot scaldings out of the road all of us thats got thin skulls continued he as the shot came skipping across the water in such long bounds as showed we were within range well missed added he as the shot struck the water close to us and bounded fairly over the boat passing close beneath the mainboom and the foot of the mainsail without injuring so much as a ropeyarn thats his long gun bob said i his broadside guns would never reach so far as this and though were just now in rather warm quarters we shall be out of range again very soon and then i think we need give ourselves no further trouble concerning him any way youve got something very like the fulfilment of the wish you expressed the other day ay ay thats true hal i have answered he with a quiet laugh and i do own its a great satisfaction to me that were carcumventin the chap this a way ill warrant hes walking the quarterdeck at this minute fit to bite his fingers off wi vexation at our slipping past him in this style here another shot from the brig came bounding after us but we offered him a much smaller mark than before inasmuch as he was now nearly dead astern of us and we consequently presented an end instead of a broadside view to him the shot shaved us pretty close to windward nevertheless striking the water for the last time just short of our taffrail and scurrying along and ploughing up the surface close enough to give us a pretty copious showerbath of spray ere it finally sank just ahead of us the next shot which quickly followed passed almost as close to leeward and the third came straight enough but fell just short of us after this he fired no more very cleverly managed i call that harry said bob as soon as we found ourselves once more out of range we can now take things quietly and as its your watch below id recommend you to turn in and get a bit of a snooze its your eight hours out tonight my lad and if the breeze should happen to freshen about sundown and that chap comes after usand by the piper he means that same for im blest if he isnt in staysyoull need to keep both eyes open all your watch this was good advice and i at once proceeded to adopt it cautioning bob to be sure to call me without delay in the event of any further complication arising i had not been below above two minutes when i heard his voice shouting to me to come on deck again wondering what was now in the wind i sprang up the short companionladder and my eye at once falling upon the brig which was now dead astern of us heading in the same direction as ourselves though not lying so close to the wind i saw in a moment that our troubles were not yet by any means over the wind had by this time fallen so light that we were not making above three knots way through the water whilst the pirate appeared barely to have steeragewayin fact his canvas was flapping to the mast with every sluggish roll which the vessel took over the long scarcely perceptible swell friend johnson was evidently greatly nettled at our having slipped so handsomely through his fingers as we had and seemed determined to have a word or two with us yet whether we would or no for he had lowered one of his boats and she was just leaving the vessel in chase i took the glass and counted six men at the oars besides one or two i could not be sure which in the sternsheets this was serious indeed for a light boat propelled by six good oarsmen would go about two feet to our one at our then rate of sailing and must necessarily soon overhaul us our case appeared pretty nearly desperate but a seaman never gives up whilst there is a shot in the locker or a fresh expedient to be tried so i directed bob to keep the cutter away about three points and then lash the tiller and lend me a hand to get our balloon canvas set the topsail was shifted in next to no time and then we got the spinnaker to the bowspritend leading the sheet aft to the mainboom after which we took in our jib and stopped it along the bowsprit ready for setting again at a moments notice and hauled down our staysail this additional spread of canvas coupled with the fact that we were running far enough off the wind to permit of its drawing well made a perceptible difference in our speedquite a knot i considered and bob agreed with me now whats the next thing to be done harry inquired he as soon as we had completed our task of shifting the sails this is all very well as far as it goes but yon boat is overhauling us at every stroke of the oars and weve only postponed the pleasure of an introduction to the chaps unless the breeze happens to freshen up a trifle of which i sees no signs just at present ive made up my mind i replied we must not be taken bob i feel convinced that our lives would not be worth an hours purchase if we fell into the hands of that villain but even supposing he were to stop short of murder his malignity would doubtless prompt him to destroy the little lily and by such an act all our past efforts would be nullified and our future success rendered extremely doubtful we must fight robert my man now that we can no longer run so lets get our gun up and rigged without further delay by the time that we have it ready they will be within range and i think we may persuade them to turn back yet so be it replied bob gleefully id always rather fight than run away harry ladat least when its anything like a fair match so lets rouse up the popgun and have a shy at em this gun was as i think i have mentioned before a fourpound rifled piece which was specially made to my order by an eminent firm it was a most beautiful little weapon exquisitely finished was a breechloader and threw a solid shot about a mile and a shell nearly half as far again it was mounted on a swivel or pivot which we had the means of firmly fixing to the deck we got it out and upon deck and soon had it mounted and ready for service bob took the tiller desiring me to work the gun as i was not only a more practised artillerist than he but knew also how to handle a breechloader and i had the knack somehow of shooting straight i had it loaded and was in the act of levelling it when bob said suppose we was to let them chaps get a bit nearer hal afore we opens fire ive a notion that if we gets em well away from the brig and well within range of our little barker there we might give em such a peppering afore they could get clear of us agin as would sicken em of having any more to do with us perhaps it mightnt be quite onpossible to destry the boat altogether and then theres seven or eight good hands wiped off the chaps books this here aint like a ordinary enemy you see ladhes a sort of general enemy to all mankind and the more harm we can do to him the more good well be doing the rest of the world it sounded rather like coldblooded barbarity this proposal of bobs to attempt the destruction instead of the repulse of the boat in pursuit of us but every word he said in support of his proposition was strictly true and indeed some such idea had been present in my own mind so i withheld my fire for a time at length however they were within half a mile of us and i thought we might now fairly commence operations i carefully levelled the piece accordingly and desiring bob to sit well out of the line of fire and steer as steadily as possible i watched the heave of the cutter and pulled the triggerline the shot sped straight for the boat but striking the water just before it reached her bounded dear over her and into the sea beyond there was a shout from the people in the boat and we could see that they stretched to their oars with doubled exertion straight as it could go harry lad but rather too much elevation try em again boy and look smart about it too for theyre giving way as if the devil was behind em which he probably is if they did but know it bob returned i keep cool old man theres no hurry you attend to the steering of the craft ill undertake to cool their courage for them before theyre very much older ay ay retorted bob keep cool it is but its getting to be rather ticklish work lad aint it i was too busy with the gun to reply just then and in another moment i fired once more this time we saw the splinters fly from the bows of the boat and one of the oarsmen sprang from his seat and fell back into the arms of the man behind him there was a moment of confusion with them and then we saw one of the men in the sternsheets there were two of them step along the thwarts and take the injured mans place this looked like a fixed determination to come alongside at any price so i this time inserted a shell instead of a solid shot which i had before been firing once more after a very careful aim the little piece rang out and again the shot reached its mark this time with terrible effect for the shell exploded as it passed through the boats thin planking and the fragments continuing their flight forward told so severely among the crew that it appeared as if they were all more or less hurt we saw four fall from the thwarts at all events and all hands ceased pulling whilst three of the oars slipped unnoticed overboard i unrove the spinnakersheet from the mainboom before the astonished bob knew what i was about let go the halliards and let the sail down by the run and then jumped to the jib halliards and hoisted the sail like lightning now shouted i luff you may bob and lets heave the craft to and finish the job for them as i said this bob put his helm down whilst i hauled the jib sheet to windward and then i sprang aft again to the gun by this time they had taken to their oars again but there were only two of them pulling a sure indication of the extent to which our last shot had told they were turning the boat round to pull back to the ship and seeing this i felt some compunction about firing on them again and said so dont be such a softhearted donkey harry lad retorted bob settle the whole lot if you can boy itll only be so many skulking cutthroats the less in the world my idee is that every one of them chaps as we can finish off is one honest mans life saved so give em another of them shells my boy they do seem wonderful persuaders small as they be i accordingly loaded again and fired but probably from excitement fired too high and the missile flew harmlessly over the boat the next time i was more careful aiming with the utmost deliberation at length i pulled the triggerline and immediately leapt to my feet to watch for the result the shell struck the boats stern fairly amidships and close to the waterline there was an explosion but both the oarsmen appeared to be unhurt almost immediately however one of them sprang aft and crouched down doing something that we could not make out i took the glass and then saw that a large gap had been made by the explosion of the shell through which the water was doubtless pouring rapidly there was a movement among the wounded men and one man jumped upon a thwart and waved his hat to the brig evidently as a signal of distress her captain had of course been watching us all this time and seemed to have conjectured that his people were getting the worst of it for we now saw that he had a second boat in the water and on taking a look at the brig through the glass we observed that he had a tackle on his main yardarm with which he was hoisting out a gun to put into the boat it is time we were off once more bob i remarked as soon as i saw this so another shot at our friends here and then well fill away the boat was very much disabled and appeared to be sinking gradually notwithstanding their efforts to keep her afloat for they were now baling rapidly but i thought it best to make sure of her so once more loaded and fired the shell passed through her stern this time also and exploded there was a shrill scream from more than one agonised throat and the baling and pulling ceased altogether every man in her was wounded if not killed outright satisfied with our work of destruction and not particularly caring to expose ourselves to the fire of the gun in the other boat which was no doubt much heavier than our own toy of a weapon we filled away and i once more swayed up the spinnaker forward desiring bob to keep just sufficiently away to permit of our balloon canvas fully drawing but no more as soon as i had got the spinnaker set i took the glass and had a good look at the boat we had beaten off she was nearly full of water her gunwale being but an inch or two above the surface i saw three or four figures rouse themselves on board her and recommence baling feebly but their efforts were useless she sank lower and lower and at length rolled heavily bottom upwards throwing her wounded crew into the water almost immediately there was a furious splashing and by the aid of the glass i distinctly saw the dorsal fins of several sharks darting here and there among them whilst over the glassy surface of the water a shriek or two came faintly towards us in less than a minute all was over with the miserable wretches the voracious sharks made short work of it with them tearing living and dead alike to pieces in their eagerness to obtain a share of the prey at the moment that this tragic scene was enacting the second boat was about half way between the brig and those to whose assistance she was hastening and her crew had a nearer and more distinct view of the horrible details of the catastrophe than we had they paused for a moment on their oars as though paralysed with horror and then with a vengeful shout gave way more energetically than before but i felt little apprehension on their account the dying breeze had revived somewhat and the lily was now stealing along though with scarcely a ripple at her sharp bows about five knots and the water looked rather darker to windward as though the wind was inclined to come still stronger the pirates tugged at their oars with might and main passing within oars length of the wreck of the first boat when they again raised a furious yell straining away at their stout ash blades until they made them bend like willow wands they gained on us considerably within the first ten minutes or quarter of an hour and i saw some of the crew preparing to fire the gun which was mounted in the boats bows judging that more powder would have to be burned after all i once more loaded our little piece charging with shell as before and whilst i was doing this our pursuers opened fire upon us they miscalculated their distance however or the powers of their gun for the shot fell considerably short of us much to bobs delight to which he gave expression by the utterance of a few remarks of such biting sarcasm and raillery that they would infallibly have still further incensed the individuals to whom they were addressed could they but have heard them i too was very glad to see the shot fall short for it placed us on somewhat more equal terms than i had dared to hope the boat was a large one probably their launch and pulled ten oars and there were three men in the bows working the gun and the coxswain aft steering making altogether fourteen handsvery heavy odds but then on the other hand the boat was heavy and her crew after their already long pull could not maintain the violent exertions they were now putting forth very much longer and a very trifling abatement in that direction would enable us to slip away from them after all and moreover as they were now within range of our gun which being rifled threw a shot much farther than their smoothbore there was a possibility of our being able so far to disable them as to compel them to give up the chase i accordingly levelled the breechloader and then waited for a favourable opportunity to fire at length it came the shell entered the starboard bow of the pursuing boat about midway between her gunwale and her waterline and immediately to our great surprise there was a violent explosion on board her a vivid flash of flame darted upward and outward the sides of the boat appeared to be violently wrenched apart at their junction with the stem the gun and its carriage rose heavily in the air about ten feet and fell with a tremendous splash into the sea and oars and men were flung wildly about many of them being blown fairly overboard whilst a dense cloud of smoke arose and for a moment hid everything from our view when it cleared away there floated the wreck of the boat just awash and there too among the struggling crew in the water darted to and fro the fins of the terrible sharks very probably the same monsters who had so recently feasted on their shipmates our shell had taken most fearful effect igniting their ammunition and thus blowing their boat to pieces at our first discharge volume one chapter xi the chase diverted there was an awful suddenness about the destruction of this second boat and her crew which almost appalled us and it was with considerably sobered feelings that after a dead silence of a few minutes we proceeded to discuss the character of our next movements our proper course was about northwest that being the bearing of the point the latitude and longitude of which had been given us as that of the treasureisland our charts showed no island exactly at that spot but there were many at very short distances from it indeed it was situated almost in the very heart of that extensive group of islets known as the low archipelago and when talking the matter over before we had decided that it was quite possible we should be obliged to take a somewhat extended cruise among these islands and to examine several of them before coming upon the one of which we were in search under these circumstances we came to the conclusion that it would be unadvisable to give the pirates any indication of our true destination by steering on our proper course as long as they were in sight for the destruction of their two boats with the loss of their crews would undoubtedly kindle such a desire for vengeance in the breasts of the survivors as in all likelihood to prompt them to go a good bit out of their way if necessary to get it so after a long debate and a careful examination of the chart which i brought on deck for the purpose we decided to bear away on a course as though bound to new zealand this took us about a point farther off the wind than we had been steering for the last few hours but we did not trouble much about that as we hoped to give the brig the slip some time during the ensuing night accordingly we bore away upon the course decided on the sails were trimmed with the utmost nicety and then it being about the time for our evening meal i took the tiller while bob went below to look after the kettle the brig was by this time about six or seven miles astern of us and was steering directly after us with apparently every stitch of canvas set that would draw i lashed the tiller for a moment and jumped down below for my sextant with which i returned to the deck and carefully set him by it with the view of ascertaining just before dark whether he had gained anything on us or we on him in the interim tea being ready bob served it on deck and whilst we leisurely discussed the meal we talked over our chances of dodging our pursuer during the night unfortunately these now appeared to be rather slender for there was not a cloud to be seen and the moon well advanced in her second quarter was already visible in the deep sapphire of the eastern sky ere the west had well begun to glow with the rich warm hues of sunset and to add to our difficulty in this respect the wind again fell lighter and ere long died completely away the sun went down in calm and cloudless splendour the golden glories of the west deepened into rich crimson then faded into purple and from purple into warm grey the brief twilight quickly deepened into night and the moon sweet regent of the sky shed her soft silvery beams abroad over the tranquil ocean while the larger stars added their mellow radiance to beautify the scene there was not the faintest breath of wind to ruffle the mirrorlike surface of the long glassy swells as they undulated sluggishly beneath us and the flap of our canvas the pattering of the reefpoints the creaking of the mainboom and the occasional cheep cheep of the rudder upon its pintles served but to mark and emphasise the deep calm of sleeping nature it was a glorious nighta night of such exquisite loveliness as is perhaps never witnessed except when far away from land but situated as we were greatly as we admired its beauty we would rather have witnessed a sky traversed by fastflying clouds and would gladly have exchanged the tender silence which brooded around us for the singing of the wind through our rigging and the hissing sound of the rapidly following surges we walked fore and aft on our short deck one on each side smoking our pipes and whistling for a breeze and pausing occasionally to listen for the roll of oars in their rowlocks or their plash in the water for we did not know what new trick our neighbour astern might feel disposed to play us though we both thought it improbable he would send another boat awayat all events whilst we maintained our present distance from him he was distinctly visible in the bright moonlight and of course we kept a watchful eye upon him but we could detect no signs aboard of him to give us any uneasiness at length just about eight bells as bob was preparing to go below i noticed that the shimmer of the moonbeams which had hitherto played in but a few wavering streaks over the surface of the water close to us was now revealing itself on the horizon spreading gradually abroad on each side of the point at which it had first appeared and slowly advancing over the surface of the ocean towards us here comes the breeze bob i exclaimed stay on deck a few minutes longer until we can see what is to be the order of the night see there it comes away out from the eastward and the brig is already squaring away his yards as though he felt the first faint puffs ay continued i as i took a look at him through the glass there go his stunsailbooms and there go his stunsails to boot now the rascal will run down to us with the first of the breeze and perhaps have us under his guns before we can catch a breath of it cast loose this spinnakerboom old man and lets get it rigged out and the sail set in readiness for the breeze when it comes if we can only get it before he comes within range of us i believe we can walk away from him even in a run to leeward provided we dont have the breeze too strong we worked with a will the reader may be sure and soon had the huge sail set on the starboard side whilst the mainboom was guyed out to port we then went all round the deck taking a pull at the halliards where necessary and then though a heavy dew was falling we got up a small handpump and some hose we had provided ourselves with and gave the sails a thorough wetting the brig ran down to within about a couple of miles of us before the first faint catspaws came stealing over the water towards us then the balloontopsail filled collapsed and filled again the spinnaker ceased its rustle and there was a gentle surge as the light strain first came upon the spars and rigging the tiller began to vibrate beneath my hand a long ripple spread itself out from each bow and the water lily began once more to slip gaily away i got bob to give a look to our preventers in case it should become a matter of sheer carrying on and then sent him below as it had been a day of excitement for him and consequently of fatigue the breeze gradually freshened the water hissed and sparkled away from our sharp bows and the swirling eddies in our wake told a cheering tale as to the speed with which we were flying over the surface of the now crisplyruffled ocean and before my watch was out i had the satisfaction of seeing that we were certainly drawing away from our persevering enemy the broad flat model of the lily being as favourable to her sailing powers before the wind as her deep keel was when closehauled i called bob at midnight and strictly cautioned him to give me timely notice if the breeze freshened sufficiently to necessitate a reduction of canvas or if anything occurred rendering my presence on deck desirable and then i dived below flung off my clothes and tumbled into my hammock and in the twinkling of a pursers lantern was fast asleep when i went on deck again at four oclock i found that the breeze had freshened very considerably during my watch below and under other circumstances i should most certainly have taken in the spinnaker and shifted topsails but though we had dropped the brig considerably he still hung most pertinaciously in our wake so there was nothing for it but still to carry on the craft must have been a splendid sailer for though by this time we were going close upon sixteen knots we had not increased our distance from her much more than four miles during the time i had been below nothing worthy of note occurred during my watch the wind appeared to have reached the limits of its strength and now blew steadily with sufficient force to try our spars and gear to their utmost but not quite strong enough to carry anything away and we continued to increase our distance from the brig at seven bells i called bob who set about the preparations for breakfast and great were our mutual congratulations over that meal at the now thoroughlyestablished fact that fast as the albatross undoubtedly was she was no match for the little water lily in ordinary weather as soon as breakfast was over and the things cleared away i got an observation for the longitude and then went below to have a nap desiring bob to call me at seven bells that i might take a meridian altitude he did so and as soon as i came on deck with my sextant he said look there harry what dye think of that i wouldnt call ye when i first made em out as it only wanted half an hour to seven bells and i knowed youd feel a bit tired after yesterday but aint it a wonderful sight as he spoke he pointed away to a little on our starboard bow and stooping down in order to see under the foot of the spinnaker i there beheld what was indeed to me a wonderful sight away nearly as far as we could see upon the verge of the horizon appeared a vast herd or school of whales spouting in all directions and indulging in the most extraordinary gambols each apparently striving to outvie the others in the feat of leaping entirely out of the water i am afraid to make anything like a positive statement as to the heights achieved by some of the monsters but it really appeared to me that a few of them rose nearly if not quite five and twenty feet into the air descending again with a splash which reminded me of some of the torpedo experiments i had witnessed when staying for a few days at portsmouth i was careful to get my observation which i rapidly worked out and entered in the log after which i relieved bob at the tiller whilst he went below to see to the dinner as he descended the short companionladder he turned round and observed with a comical look i say harry i hope there aint no stray sarpents knocking about in this here neighbourhood twould be uncommon awkard for us to have one of they chaps waiting for us ahead and that infarnal brig still in sight astarn just as dinner made its appearance i descried a sail about two points on our starboard bow it was a vessel under singlereefed topsails heading to the southward and consequently standing across our bows she was too far off for us to make out anything but the heads of her sails from the deck but as soon as i saw her i resigned the tiller to bob and went up as far as the crosstrees to have a better look at her from thence i made her out to be a barque apparently closehauled on the port tack but of what nationality she might be we were yet too far distant from her to decide though i thought from the cut of her sails that she was english i was still standing upon the crosstrees shouting my observations to bob when i noticed a commotion amongst the herd of whales which we were by this time fast nearing and bringing my glass to bear i at length made out three boats pulling towards them the whales were evidently rather doubtful as to the intentions of these boats though we were not we saw at once that the stranger was a whaler and that these were her boats despatched in chase the whales came swimming leisurely to windward with the boats in hot pursuit what to do was now the question with us we ought most certainly to advise the whalers of the character of the brig but it would never do to shorten sail and deviate anything considerable from our course with this object we should very probably be taken before we could accomplish our purpose and in that event we should sacrifice ourselves without doing the others any good however as a preliminary we displayed our ensign and as the boats were coming almost directly towards us i sheered sufficiently out of our course to pass within hail of the leader we were now running through the very thickest of the herd and it was rather nervous work for with a single lash of its mighty tail any one of the monsters might have destroyed us and with such a cloud of canvas as we were carrying the deviations from our course which we dared to make were very trifling had we luffed for example high enough for our spinnaker to jibe the craft would probably have turned the turtle with us or if we had proved fortunate enough to escape this we should most certainly have made a clean sweep of the spars we were almost within hail of the leading boat when she fastened to an enormous whale the creature dived instantly taking out line at a tremendous rate but still continuing on its original course this brought the boat close past us on our starboard side the crew sitting with their oars apeak and the water foaming a good foot above the level of the boats bows as she was towed furiously along i took the trumpet in my hand and as she dashed past i hailed the brig astern is a pirate cut adrift and rejoin your ship as soon as possible the boatsteerer waved his hand but they made no attempt to free themselves from the whale and i feared they had not clearly understood me though i saw the men turning to each other as though comparing notes on the communication i had made and the boatsteerer shaded his eyes with his hand as he took a hasty look at the rapidly approaching brig the two other boats meanwhile were pulling away to the southward in pursuit of a couple of gigantic whales which had separated from the rest of the herd and which from the pace at which they were travelling seemed likely to lead their pursuers a pretty dance it was quite out of our power to convey any warning to those and i was most reluctantly compelled to stand on upon our original course or dead to leeward presently the whale which was struck turned sharp round and came tearing back over the ground he had just traversed i felt more than half inclined to take as broad a sheer as i dared out of his way i did not at all like the look of him as he came foaming down towards us but the desire to repeat my warning was stronger even than my fear of the whale and watching him narrowly as he came up i directed bob how to steer and the instant he was past us bob eased down the helm and we sheered towards the boat he had in tow i stood by with the trumpet as before but it was unnecessary for as they came alongside the boatsteerer sheered our way whilst the crew rapidly paid out line by which means the whaleboats speed was so reduced that we had time to communicate before she passed ahead cutter ahoy hailed the boatsteerer as we rushed along within twenty feet of each other what was that you said just now the brig astern of us is a pirate i replied she fired upon us yesterday at midday and has been in chase ever since i would advise you to rejoin your ship before she comes up if possible your skipper will need all his hands on board if she ranges alongside the devil ejaculated he in reply you dont seem hit anywhere glancing aloft at our taper spars and snowy canvas which showed no wounds or shotholes to vouch for the truth of my statement no answered i he only had time to fire five shots at us before we slipped past him to windward and we escaped untouched hang it he exclaimed in a tone of vexation i dont like to lose this fine fish that were fast to but we shall have to let him go no doubt of that but how the devil am i to recall the other boats i will fire our gun to attract their attention i replied and you can make any signal you think most likely to effect your object thank ee returned he i shall be obliged if you will and then he signalled to the men who had charge of the line and they gradually reduced the speed at which it ran out and finally held all fast with an extra turn round the bollard and away the boat dashed once more i charged the gun which still remained mounted on deck with a blank cartridge and duly greasing the muzzle to increase the report fired the crew of the whaleboat tossed their oars on end and kept them so for a few minutes or until it was seen that the other boats had abandoned the chase and were pulling back toward them the crew of the boat which was fast to the whale were knowing enough not to cut themselves adrift so long as their prize towed them in the direction they wished to go and as he seemed to have started for a regular long run to leeward they appeared to stand a very fair chance of being towed almost alongside their ship she had been making short stretches to windward ever since we first sighted her and we were by this time within a couple of miles of her from her motions we judged that the people left on board to work her had heard the report of our gun and had witnessed the recall of the other two boats and perhaps suspected that something was wrong somewhere for she was now plainly manoeuvring to close with all three of the boats as quickly as possible the whale meanwhile had been running in such a direction as to cross the barques bows about a quarter of a mile distant and he actually ran far enough to enable the crew of the boat which had fastened to him to cut themselves adrift when fairly in their ships course so that in a very few minutes after the stroke of the keen tomahawk had severed their towline they were alongside and the boat was run up to the davits so smart were the crew of the whaler in picking up their boat that they must have swung their mainyard the moment the frail craft was hooked on without waiting until she was actually hoisted up the barque had scarcely begun to gather way before the hands were in her rigging and next moment they were laying out on both topsailyards and turning out the reefs although the breeze was so strong that halfloaded as she was she was careening almost gunwale to we passed close under her stern and her skipper as we drew near walked aft to the taffrail and hailed us thank you sir for your information please report us and this circumstance god knows whether we shall escape the rascals or no i waved my hand to signify that i understood and would comply with his request noting as i did so the name and the port of registry of the vessel which were painted on her stern in white letters the kingfisher of hull scarcely were we past her when we saw a small red flag go fluttering up to her maintopgallantmasthead a signal as we supposed to hurry the other boats back the poor fellows were awkwardly situated had they been hulldown to the northward or the southward the pirates might possibly in the eagerness of their desire for vengeance upon us have allowed her to pass on unmolested but now that the barque lay almost directly within their path we dared not hope for any such display of forbearance there were many stores on board a wellfound whaler which would be most useful to men situated like the desperadoes on board the brig and they would scarcely forego the opportunity of making the acquisition for the sake of continuing to chase a craft which was indubitably walking away from them fast and which must run them out of sight altogether in a few hours more unless some accident occurred to place her within their power we watched the proceedings of the two vessels with the most absorbing interest as may well be supposed the lily was very quickly far enough to leeward of the barque to enable us to see the two boats clear of his bow and we noticed that their crews were pulling with might and main but in about ten minutes time they were once more shut in by the intervention of their vessels hull between us and them and before they could open out astern of her the barque went in stays having apparently stood on far enough to fetch her boats on the next tack the brig had in the interim run down to within about four miles of the whaler and was still flying along dead before the wind with everything set up to topgallant stunsails on both sides and no sign had so far revealed itself on board her by which we could judge of the intention of her crew by the time that she had run another mile we saw the whalers mainyard once more thrown aback an indication that she was about to pick up her other two boats and there now appeared to be a strong probability that she would have time to hoist them in and be off again before the pirate could approach her within gunshot the situation became eminently exciting and so anxious was i that the whaler should have every chance of making her escape that i directed bob to let go our spinnaker outhaul and allow the traveller to run in along the boom in the hope that by leading the pirates to believe it had become necessary for us to shorten sail they might be tempted after all to keep on in chase of us instead of interfering with the barque it would have afforded us almost unmitigated satisfaction to have seen them continue the chase for we now felt perfectly satisfied that in moderate weather we had the heels of the albatross both closehauled and running free and could we succeed in decoying them far enough to leeward to permit of the whaler making good his escape i was willing to trust to the future for the means of ultimately shaking our vindictive pursuer off in further prosecution of this project as soon as bob had got the spinnaker in i lashed the tiller for a moment and jumped forward to assist him in getting in our enormous balloontopsail which i foresaw would have to be taken off the craft shortly if we wished to save the topmast the wind being rather on the increase and our rigging already strained to the tension of harpstrings this done we found time to take another look at the whaler his mainyard was just swinging as we turned our glances in his direction and then his bows fell off until he headed about northwest his men springing into the rigging and scurrying away aloft to loose topgallantsails one hand meantime laying out on the jibboom to loose the flyingjib away went the jolly old craft in magnificent style heading about northwest and evidently upon her best point of sailing she crossed our stern shutting out the pirate brig for a moment and we fully expected that when that craft next appeared we should see her hauled up in chase but nothing of the kind on she came still heading direct for us and i began to hope that our plan of luring her on to follow us was about to prove successful two or three minutes which seemed like ages to us elapsed and then all in a moment his stunsails or studdingsails as i ought more correctly to spell the word collapsed and fluttered wildly for a few seconds in the breeze and disappeared his royalhalliards were let go and the sails rolled up and furled and as he hauled up to follow the barque his foresail lifted and there was a flash a puff of white smoke and before the report had time to drive down to us we saw the shot skipping along from wave to wave as a polite intimation to the barque to heave to but the whaling skipper was not the man to give up without a struggle he had no studdingsails but he was heading in such a direction that the brig could not use hers while following him and it seemed that he trusted to his light trim to enable him to get clear gun after gun was now rapidly fired by the pirates but they were not yet within range though it was only too evident that they would be before very long and i greatly feared that the barques chances of escape were remarkably small in about an hour they both disappeared in the northwestern board but when last seen the barque was still carrying on with the pirate banging away at her most perseveringly with his long gun thank goodness were shut of the blackguards at last exclaimed bob as the sails of the two craft sank below the horizon though im duberous its a poor look out for them whalin chaps if the poor beggars gets caught its small marcy as theyll have showed em unless theres any on em whitelivered enough to jine the brig to save their lives skipper johnson wont be particlar amiable i reckon ater the loss of his two boats crews yesterdaytwoandtwenty hands all told and i dont suppose as hes the man to mind much who he has his revenge upon so longs he gets it but whats to be our next move lad now were once more all alone by ourselves ive been thinking about that i replied i do not expect the pirates will trouble their heads about us any more now that they have lost sight of us but they may and it will be just as well to provide against any such contingency if they resume the chase they will most probably look for us somewhere on the course we were steering when last seen or else to the northward there is nothing to take us to the southward so that is the most improbable direction in my opinion in which they are likely to look for us and that therefore is the direction in which i propose to steer let us make the craft snug and stand away to the southward and eastward full and by and at eight oclock tomorrow morning we will go about and make a leg to the northward and eastward for perhaps twentyfour hours this will place us well to windward and in about the last spot in the world where he would think of looking for us what do you think of the plan bob fust rate responded that worthy a regular traverse and about the most inandout bit of carcumvention as the ingenuity o man could invent lets set about it at once my lad and by the time as weve cleared up a bit and made things comfortable itll be time to see about gettin tea we accordingly set about making things comfortable forthwith the balloontopsail was carefully rolled up and put away the spinnaker which we had only allowed to run in close to the mast and had hastily secured with a stop or two ditto and our topmast housed the spinnakerboom was run in unrigged and secured and we then gibed the mainsail over and stood away closehauled about southeast the little lily staggering along in regular racing style under whole lower canvas when by rights with the amount of wind we had we ought to have had at least one reef down and the number jib shifted for number however we were used to carrying on by this time and had become so thoroughly intimate with the cutters sailcarrying powers that we knew we might safely give her all the canvas her spars would bear by the time that all was done and our gun which we did not think it worth while to dismount and stow away again for the present carefully covered over with its painted canvas coat the sun was on the verge of the horizon the weather having a settled appearance with a promise of the breeze holding good through the night end of volume one volume two chapter i the wreck of the copernicus at eight oclock next morning nothing having occurred during the night worthy of record we went about and stood away about northeast on the starboard tack the wind continued fresh but steady and we averaged quite thirteen knots during the whole of the next twentyfour hours having carried out our plan for eluding the brig and being by this time well to windward of the spot where we parted company with her i considered we might now with safety bear away upon our course which we accordingly did directly after breakfast setting our balloon gafftopsail once more and getting the spinnaker to the bowspritend again this additional canvas had the effect of increasing our speed to fully sixteen knots and the alteration of our course produced a corresponding and very agreeable change in the motion of the yacht the quick jerky plunge of a vessel digging into a headsea being exchanged for a long easy swinging roll which was far more conducive to comfort especially as we now enjoyed the added luxury of a dry deck three days passed utterly devoid of incident except that the wind gradually hauled far enough aft to enable us to shift our spinnaker from the bowspritend to the starboard side and once more we were flying along upon our course with the wind nearly dead fair and every stitch of canvas spread that we had the means of packing upon the little craft with our low hull we must have presented the appearance of a snowwhite pyramid gliding unsupported over the surface of the ocean on the morning of the fourth day as i came upon deck at sevenbells to relieve bob whilst he looked after breakfast the old fellow said here harry your eyes are younger than mine what dye make this out to be away here broad upon our starboardbow i looked in the direction indicated and saw what appeared to be the stumps of three spars just showing above the horizon i took the glass and went aloft as far as the crosstrees and from that coign of vantage made out that they were the lower masts of a fullrigged ship of considerable size for i could see the three lower yards with long streamers of canvas fluttering from them the topmasts were carried away close to the caps and hung over the side with topgallantmasts yards sails etc still attached a great tangled mass of wreck there was no signal of distress flying on board so far as i could see so i concluded that the vessel was derelict but as it would not take us very much out of our way and as we were in no great hurry i resolved to haul up and take a nearer look at her accordingly having advised bob of what i had seen and of my intention we took in the spinnaker and gafftopsail lowered the topmast and then hauled up for the stranger an hour afterwards we were near enough to make out that she was a most beautiful craft of about eighteen hundred tons register with very little the matter with her apparently except that she had been dismasted doubtless in some sudden squall we saw but one boat at her davits and that was the one at her starboard quarter which had been smashed completely in two by the wreck of the mizzentopmast in its fall we therefore concluded that the crew seized by an unaccountable panic had left her we were within a quarter of a mile of the vessel when a solitary figure that of a female appeared upon her lofty poop she no sooner saw us approaching than she waved her handkerchief to us vehemently to which we responded by waving our hats when seeing that her signal had been observed she sank down upon the lid of the skylight and seemed to give way to a violent flood of tears why damn me if it dont look as if the mean cowardly crew have been and desarted the poor thing exclaimed bob with unusual vehemence as we noticed that the figure never moved as though to direct the attention of others to our approach it looks very like it i replied but we shall soon see it will be an awkward matter to board however with all that wreck dangling about to leeward stand by to ease the jibsheet up as i put the helm down another minute and we were hove to on the ships lee quarter as near as we dared approach the young girl for such we now saw her to be had by this time so far recovered her composure as to rise up once more and approach the leeside of the deck taking off my hat and making my best bow i hailed are you all alone on board there yes oh yes she replied in the sweetest voice i had ever heard i have been quite alone for more than a week pray pray do not go away and leave me again sir i have been nearly mad and i shall die if i remain alone here much longer make your mind quite easy my dear young lady i replied we certainly will not leave you come what may but it will be very difficult for us to get on board with those spars swaying about and the attempt to do so may occupy much time but do not suffer the slightest apprehension we will get you off the wreck somehow never fear after all i remarked half to her and half to bob i believe the quickest way out of the difficulty will be for me to jump overboard and swim alongside there are plenty of ropesends hanging over the side to help me on board oh no sir she exclaimed eagerly indeed you must do nothing of the kind there is an immense shark down there pointing under the counter he has scarcely left the ship a moment since the sailors went away this was awkward there seemed no chance of being able to get on board to leeward the whole of the ships starboard side being completely encumbered with wreck and there was far too much sea to permit of our running alongside to windward i took a careful glance at the gear aloft and then made up my mind what to do the ships foreyard was lying nearly square the yardarms projecting several feet beyond the ships sides and i decided to board by means of the forebrace to windward i hailed the young girl telling her what to do to assist me and then set about making preparations for leaving the water lily in bobs sole charge for a while we took a double reef in the mainsail and took the jib in altogether running in the jibboom also this placed the craft under handy canvas for one man to work and at the same time prevented the possibility of the jibboom being carried away we also got our corkfenders upon deck in case of unavoidably dropping alongside and were then ready to make the proposed experiment the young girl had meantime made the lee forebrace fast and had then gone over to windward and cast off the running part of the weatherbrace which she threw overboard i now hailed again telling her what we were about to do and then signed to bob to put the helm up the cutter fell off until she was dead before the wind when we gibed her and hauled again to the wind on the starboard tack so as to cross the ships stern at a sufficient distance to insure the success of our contemplated manoeuvre bob was a splendid helmsman or i should have hesitated about attempting the feat we were now going to put in practice as the slightest nervousness or want of tact on his part would have resulted in very serious damage to the lily if it did not actually cause her total destruction but i had full confidence in his skill and moreover was there not a woman to be rescued from a position which might at any moment become one of the most imminent peril even if it were not so already so as soon as we were far enough to windward i signed to bob to put down the helm and round the little craft came like a top and away we flew down towards the ships weatherside going well free but with the sheets flattened in all ready to luff and claw off to windward the moment i had got hold of the brace down we swept direct for the ships weatherquarter the fair girl standing again upon the poop and watching our motions with the most overwhelming anxiety at exactly the right instant bob eased his helm gently down and the cutter shot along the ships lofty side within ten feet of it i stood just forward of the rigging ready to seize the brace the moment it came within reach and in another instant i had it shouting to bob to luff i swung myself off into the air and made the best of my way aloft hand over hand it had been my original intention to ascend to the yardarm and laying in from thence descend the forerigging to the deck but pausing for a moment in my anxiety to see whether bob would scrape dearwhich he very cleverly did having kept good way on the boati found that aided by the roll of the vessel i might easily swing myself in upon her rail this i soon managed landing upon the deck to find myself confronted by the most lovely little creature you can imagine who extended both her hands impulsively to me as she exclaimed oh welcome sir welcome and a thousand thousand thanks for coming to my help and at such danger too how can i ever repay you i am more than repaid already replied i for the very slight trouble i have taken by the happiness of finding it in my power to rescue you from your present situation the first thing to be done i continued is to provide for the safety of my little craft after which we shall have ample time i hope to make suitable arrangements for transferring you on board her ah a lucky thought continued i as i saw the soundingrod and line attached to the fiferail let us see what water the craft has in her i sounded and found there was barely two feet of water in the hold so it was evident that the vessel was perfectly tight and seaworthy except as to the damage aloft bob had by this time passed ahead and to leeward and was now approaching on our lee quarter once more i waited until he was within hail and then told him to heaveto well clear of the ship as i proposed to cut adrift all the wreck a task which i thought i could manage without very much difficulty and which when done would enable the water lily to come alongside to leeward he waved his hand in reply and the foresheet being already to windward he left the cutter to take care of herself while he seated himself composedly in a deckchair to smoke his pipe and watch my proceedings i soon found a tomahawk and armed with this i went up the mizzenrigging intending to work my way forward it was hard work singlehanded but by noon i had succeeded in clearing the whole mass away and the ship soon drifted free of it leaving her upper spars a confused floating mass upon the water as soon as this was done i got an eightinch hawser off the top of the house forward and managed with considerable labour to get it coiled down afresh upon the poop i then bent on a heavingline to one end of the hawser which by this means i got to the cutter when we moored her securely astern of the ship bob then came on board up a rope which i had lashed to the mizzen boomend for his accommodation and we found time to look around us as soon as our fair hostess saw me fairly at work upon the wreck aloft she had betaken herself to the galley and i saw her from time to time during the intervals of my labour busying herself in sundry culinary operations and she now came upon the poop where bob and i were standing and announced that dinner was ready adding and i am sure you must stand in need of it after your hard mornings work i thanked her and said but before we go below permit me to introduce myself my name raising my hat and bowing is henry collingwood and i am the owner of the small craft now hanging on astern this indicating bob who took off his hat and made a most elaborate scrape is my friend and welltried shipmate robert trunnion who with myself will do all we can to make you comfortable on board the cutter and will stand by you to the death if need be until we have placed you in perfect safety the fair girl seemed much affected by my speech but bowing most gracefully in return she said and my name is ella brand i have been left alone in this ship by what i cannot but believe was a dreadful mistake and i accept your hospitality and help as frankly as you have offered it and now gentlemen that we are properly introduced with a gay laugh permit me to conduct you to the cabin come pussy this last invitation was bestowed upon a pretty little playful kitten which had been following the girl about the ship all the morning when we entered the cabin which as is the case in most large ships was on deck we found a most sumptuous meal prepared whatever other dangers the little fairy might have been exposed to it was quite evident that miss brand had been in no immediate danger of starving like a sensible girl she had obtained access to the ships stores and was evidently well acquainted with the most approved methods of preparing food for human consumption the meal was a thoroughly pleasant one for we were all happy she that assistance had come to her and we that it had been our good fortune to bestow it whilst sitting at table the sweet little creature gave us her history and recounted the circumstances which had placed her in her present position but as there was nothing very remarkable in either i shall give both in a condensed form as i have a most wholesome dread of wearying my readers she told us that she was an only child and that for the last ten years she had been a resident in canton whither her father had proceeded to take possession of a lucrative appointment after a residence of five years there her mother died and her father who was passionately attached to his wife seemed never to have recovered from the blow five years more passed away and the husband followed his fondlyloved companion dying so ella asserted sobbingly of no disease in particular but of a gradual wasting away the result as she believed of a slowly breaking heart she thus found herself left alone and almost friendless in a strange land and after taking counsel with such friends as her father had made she had with their assistance disposed of everything and had taken passage in the copernicus to london in the faint hope of being able to find some friends of her mothers of whom she had heard but had never seen her mother having contracted what is termed a mesalliancein other words a lovematch with one whom her friends chose to consider infinitely beneath her in social position the ship was bound home by way of cape horn having to call at the sandwich islands and buenos ayres on her way and all had gone well until eight days before when it appeared the ship was struck by a sudden squall some time during the night thrown on her beamends and dismasted and as ella had remained during the whole time cowering and terrified in her berth she supposed the crew had gone away in the boats forgetting her in their hurry and panic as soon as the squall was over the ship had gradually righted again and when she went on deck next morning she found everything in a state of wreck and confusion and herself and her pet kitten and a few fowls in the coops the only living things on board her story ended bob and i expressed our sympathy for her friendless condition and repeated our protestations of devotion for both of which we were thanked anew so sweetly that we could have gone on making promises for the rest of the day with the prospect of such a reward at the end of it i am not good at personal description so i shall not attempt elaborately to describe ella brand imagine a petite demoiselle of seventeen years of age of almost fairylike proportions faultlessly formed with most lovely features and a delicate little exquisitely poised head crowned with a luxuriance of rich chestnut hair which apparently defying all its owners efforts to control flowed in a profusion of soft sheeny waves over her beautiful shoulders and down to her taper waist her eyes were clear hazel large and soft as those of a gazelle her lips full and beautifully curved and the expression of her sweet face confiding as that of a child while her manner was a most fascinating combination of the innocent frankness of childhood with the more subtle and graceful refinement of a modest and educated woman her temper as we soon found was perfect and she was gifted with a genial flow of spirits which not only made their owner lighthearted and happy but conferred happiness upon all who had the good fortune to be thrown in her society dinner ended bob and i adjourned to the deck to make preparations for transferring our fair young guest to the water lily so as to be fairly away from the wreck again before nightfall as soon as we were out of the cabin bob observed i call the falling in with this here wrack so he pronounced the word downright providential harry here we has fust of all the very great pleasure of being of sarvice to a most charming young oman and next we has a chance of filling up our stores and waterand not afore twas time too for i bethought me this morning of seeing how our tank stood and im blest if we aint amost at our last drop its lucky theres plenty of it aboard here i sees more watercasks about the deck than will supply all as we wants and i think our first job had better be to get the hose and pump under weigh and fill up our water ater which we can soon strike a few odds and ends into the cutter such asll be useful and then the sooner were off the better we set to work with a will and ella coming on deck at the moment i requested her to pack her boxes in readiness for sending them over the side asking her at the same time whether it would take her long she replied briskly oh no she had brought hardly anything with her only three large boxes and one small one only a chest apiece held bobs and my own stock of clothing and we considered ourselves opulently supplied and here was a young girl who had brought hardly anything with heronly such few trifles as she could stow away in three large boxes and one small one the three large boxes by the way turned out to be considerably larger than either of our seachests and the small one would have sufficed for a seaman on a three years voyage we did not hesitate about helping ourselves freely to the best the ship afforded judging that it was highly improbable she would ever reach a port unless fallen in with and taken possession of by an exceptionally stronghanded vessel and even then our petty appropriations would never be missed and we laid in a liberal stock of dainties of various kinds for the especial benefit of our lady passenger which we should never have dreamed of taking on our own account we also transferred one coop with as many fowls as it would conveniently accommodate to the cutter and i made free with a very handsome swingingcot which i found in the captains cabin also for our passengers use together with a good stock of bedding all these we collected together on the leeside of the deck and when everything was ready we got the cutter alongside and with considerable difficulty got them over the side and down on her deck bob went on board the water lily to receive them and stow them away as i lowered them down and at length all was ready and it only remained to get ella herself on board and shove off we had less difficulty with her than i expected she was rather nervous but nevertheless she seated herself courageously with her beloved kitten in her lap in the bosuns chair i had rigged for her accommodation and held on tight shutting her eyes as she swung off the ships bulwarks until she felt bobs brawny arms receive her on the deck of the cutter i then quickly followed the fasts were cast off and we wore round and stood away once more upon our course just as the sun dipped below the horizon our first task was to crowd all the canvas we could muster upon the yacht to make up for the days delay and when ella came up from the cabin whither she had gone upon an exploring expedition she expressed the greatest surprise and a little alarm at the change we had wrought in the water lilys appearance she could not understand she said how so small a vessel could support such a towering spread of canvas as she now saw courting the fresh evening breeze the presence of our fair guest on board made certain alterations necessary in the internal arrangements of the cutter and i left bob at the helm in animated conversation with ella whilst i went below to effect them our cookingstove was shifted aft and the whole of the forecompartment was thus left free for the accommodation of the young lady and i at once converted it into a sleeping apartment for her by swinging her cot there i selected this part of the vessel for this purpose as it was the only one in which she would be entirely uninterrupted by our passage to and fro and it was a nice light and roomy apartment in proportion to the size of the vessel there being nothing in it and having a large circular plate of very thick roughened plateglass let into the deck above having made the place as comfortable as our resources permitted i returned to the deck and relieved bob at the tiller desiring him to look after the arrangements for tea our guest was sitting close by in one of our deckchairs which bob had gallantly offered her and hearing me speak of tea and understanding that friend robert was about to turn cook she started up with childlike impetuosity and said that is my work now come along mr trunnion and show me your pantry and where you keep all your things and i will soon have your tea ready for you i protested against this as did bob both of us declaring that we could not possibly consent to her being troubled with the cooking or anything else but she drew herself up in a pretty wilful way and said not let me do the cooking indeed but you must i insist on it why it is womans peculiar province to attend to the cooking always men never understand how to cook properly they have neither tact nor patience for it they dress food but women cook it and i will soon prove to you how great a difference there is between the two now you must let me have my own way just this once please turning coaxingly to me as she saw that i was about to make a further protest and then when i had reluctantly consented she turned to bob and said come along bob mr trunnion i mean i really beg your pardonyou shall help me this time and afterwards i shall know exactly where to find everything and the strangelycontrasted pair dived below bob grinning from ear to ear with delight at his novel situation reminds me of little saucebox my sister this do he murmured gleefully as he followed his fair companion below in rather over half an hour i was invited into the cabin to the evening meal bob taking my place at the tiller meanwhile and when i descended i found that a change had indeed taken place in the aspect of culinary affairs a snowwhite tablecloth was spread having been routed out from the deepest recesses of my chest where it in company with others had lain in undisturbed repose since the commencement of the voyage and upon it was spread a variety of dainties of various kinds the produce of our raid upon the copernicuss provision lockers and of all things in the world a plentiful supply of delicious little cakes smoking hot which miss ellas own dainty hands had prepared the tea too instead of being boiled in the kettle as was our usual practice had been prepared in accordance with the most approved rules and was certainly a very different beverage from what we had been in the habit of drinking and altogether the meal was a perfect epicurean feast compared with what we were accustomed to ella presided doing the honours of the small table with the grace of a princess and i began to feel as though i had suddenly become an inhabitant of fairyland as soon as my meal was over i relieved bob and he went below for his share of the good things and though miss ella had been very demure with me i soon discovered by the peals of musical laughter which mingled with bobs gruffer cachinnations floated up through the companion that the two had completely broken the ice between them as soon as the remains of the meal had been cleared away and the wants of her pet kitten attended to the little lady came on deck and commenced an animated conversation with bob and me as we smoked the pipe of peace ella declaring that she quite liked the odour of tobacco asking a thousand questions and full of wonder that such a dear little tiny yacht had come all the way from england she was most anxious to try her hand at steering which she thought she could do quite well and i promised i would instruct her at a more favourable opportunity explaining that we were just then so circumstanced that none but experienced helmsmen could be trusted with the tiller it being more difficult to steer properly when running before the wind than at any other time but it looks quite easy she persisted to hold that handle you do not move it much and surely i could do the little you are doing i used to steer the copernicus sometimes but she never would go straight with me and it was so tiring to keep turning that great wheel round bob laughed joyously at this quaint speech and proceeded laboriously to hold forth on the science of the helmsman interlarding his lecture copiously with nautical illustrations and sea phrases which were so much greek to his pupil who listened with an openeyed earnestness which was most entertaining she heard bob with the utmost patience and attention until he had utterly exhausted his entire stock of precepts when she thanked him as courteously and sweetly as though she had understood every word of it and then electrified us both and set me off into a fit of perfectly uncontrollable laughter by asking him in the same breath to sing her a song whatever bobs accomplishments might be singing was certainly not one of them he could hail the foreroyalyard from the taffrail in a gale of wind and make himself pretty plainly heard too but when it came to trolling forth a ditty he had no more voice than a raven and my sister had often thrown him into a state of the most comical distress by proffering a similar request to that now made by his new friend as soon as she found that bob really could not sing she tried me and as i was considered to have a very tolerable voice i immediately complied giving her tom bowling and a few more of dibdins fine old seasongs as well as one or two more frequently heard in a drawingroom which i had learnt under my sisters able tuition she then sang us a few favourites of her own in a sweet clear soprano and with a depth of feeling for the sentiment of the song which is but too seldom heard in the performances of amateurs about ten oclock she wished us goodnight and retired to her cot and bob then also went below and turned in it being his eight hours in that night and i was left to perform the rest of my watch alone the next morning bob turned out of his own accord and made a surreptitious attempt to resume the duties of the cuisine but at the first rattle of the cups and saucers he was hailed from the forecompartment and ordered to desist at his peril and in a very short time the little fairy appeared blooming and fresh as the morning and master bob received such a lecture that he was fain from that time forward to leave the cookery department entirely in her hands and he retired discomfited to the deck and began forthwith to wash down a permanent improvement now occurred in our style of living and we began to enjoy many little comforts which it is true we never had missed but which were singularly welcome nevertheless and altogether we found ourselves vastly gainers by the presence of the sweet little creature on board she quickly learned to take the chronometer time for my observations and that too with a precision which bob himself could not surpass and in a very short time she could steer as well as either of us which was an immense advantage when shortening or making sail add to all this the amusement we derived from her incessant lively prattle and the additional cheerfulness thus infused into our daily life and the reader will agree with me i think that it was a lucky day for us when we first fell in with little ella brand volume two chapter ii a miracle by the time that our fair guest had been on board a week or ten days she had put me in possession of probably every circumstance of importance which had occurred in her past history and had also touched lightly upon her future which notwithstanding the natural buoyancy of her temperament she seemed to regard with considerable apprehension it appeared that in the first place she had but a very imperfect idea as to the whereabouts of her relatives in england she knew that her grandfather had a place somewhere down in leicestershire and she thought he also had a house in town but as her mother had never heard from him since her marriage ella had been utterly unable to find any clue to the old gentlemans address after a most thorough search through such papers belonging to her parents as had fallen into her hands after her fathers death then bearing in mind many conversations between her parents which had occurred in her presence she felt the gravest doubt as to whether any of her relatives when found would even condescend so far as to acknowledge her as a relative much less assist her in any way she inclined to the opinion that they would not and there were many circumstances to justify this sentiment notably one which had occurred a short time previous to the departure of her parents from england her father was at the time suffering from nervous debility and severe mental depression the result of overwork and incessant anxiety and to such a deplorable condition was he reduced that for a considerable time he was completely incapacitated for work of any kind the family resources dwindled to a low ebb the process being materially hastened by heavy doctors bills and other expenses connected with mr brands condition and the wife and mother found herself almost at her witsend to provide necessaries for her husband and child utterly forgetful of herself all the time at last in sheer desperation she wrote to her father describing her position and entreating that assistance which he could so bountifully bestowand her letter remained unanswered she then wrote to her mother and this time the letter was returned unopened she then tried her two brothers in succession and finally her sister and all her attempts to communicate with these unnatural relatives were treated with the same cold blooded silence matters would soon have crone hard indeed with the brand family had not a former suitor of mrs brands who had been rejected in favour of the man she afterwards took for her husband chivalrously came forward at this juncture not only relieving their immediate necessities but also using all his influence which was potent to obtain for mr brand the appointment which the poor fellow held until his death and supposing said i after listening to this disheartening recitalsupposing that your relatives will not help you have you any plans laid to meet such a contingency hope for the best and provide for the worst is a favourite motto of your friend bob and i really think it is singularly applicable in your case no she replied rather despondently no very definite plan that is i am fairly well educated i believe dear mamma was most accomplished i have often heard papa say and she taught me everything she knew i speak french german and italian and seem to have a natural aptitude for music and i sketch a little in watercolours i have all my materials with me and a few sketches which i may perhaps be able to sell when i reach homei will let you see them some dayand i think i may perhaps be able to get a situation as governess or maintain myself respectably by teaching music and drawing and then you know i am not absolutely destitute i have about twenty pounds with me and i sent home three hundred the proceeds of the sale of our furniture to england and some friends of poor papas in canton say they are sure he must have some money invested somewhere and they have promised to find out if it really is so and to realise it for me and i have given them the necessary powers to do so so you see i shall not land in england actually a beggar god forbid i earnestly ejaculated with regard to your landing in england i ought perhaps to tell you that you must not hope to do so very soon we are now in a part of the world quite out of the usual track of ships and i fear it may be some time before we shall fall in with any and when we do it is questionable whether they will be quite the class of vessel you would like to make the voyage home in my great hope is that we may soon fall in with a sandalwood trader in which case you would have an opportunity of returning to china and reshipping from thence home i hope we shall she responded rather dolefully i thought you have been very good to me andher eyes welling up with tearsi shall never forget you but i know my presence must be a great inconvenience and embarrassment to you pray stop i interrupted you are under the greatest misapprehension if you suppose your presence on board the water lily is any other than a source of the most unqualified gratification to her crew you are evidently quite ignorant of the beneficent influences of your presence here or you would never have spoken of it as an inconvenience your departure will occasion us the keenest regret whenever it takes place and were it not that our cramped accommodations must occasion you very considerable discomfort i should rejoice at almost any circumstance which would necessitate your remaining with us for the rest of the voyage do you really mean it she exclaimed her sweet face brightening up at once oh i am so glad do you know i have thought your anxiety to meet with a ship arose from my being in your way and troublesome and you are really willing to let me remain and go home with you how very kind it is of you i will be quite good and do whatever you tell me and indeed i will not cause you the least bit of trouble andher face clouding over again for a momenti so dread arriving in england an utter stranger and having to search quite unassisted for grandpapa and it would be so dreadful if he were to turn me away from his doors and i should feel oh miserably friendless and lonely if i had really to go about from place to place seeking for a situation or trying to get pupils but if you will let me stay here and go home with you i shall not feel it so much for i am sure you will help me in my search for my friends and it is so delightfulbrightening up againto be dancing over this bright sparkling sea day after day in this dear little yacht and to see the kind faces of that darling old original bob andandandthe kitten and the fowls i suggested demurely but in electing to remain on board the water lily you must bear in mind my dear miss brand that it is not always with us as it is at present just now we are fortunate in the enjoyment of a fair wind and smooth sea but we have been exposed to many dangers since we left england and it is only reasonable to suppose we shall have to encounter many more before we return and if you went home in a larger vessel if you did not escape them altogether they would probably bring less discomfort in their train than they will here what would you advise me to do she asked looking ruefully up into my face well i replied since you ask me my advice is this if we fall in with a comfortable ship bound to england or to any port whence you can transship for england go in her if the ship is not comfortable and it comes to a choice of inconveniences you can be guided by your own judgment but do not leave us until you are sure of gaining some advantage by the change so it was settled that same afternoon as i was lying down on the lockers in our little cabin aft i overheard the following conversation on deck between bob and ella bob said ella she soon dropped the mr in his case but it was still mr collingwood to mebob are we likely to meet any ships very soon do you think ships echoed bob in consternation no missie i hopes not you surely aint tired of the little lily yet are ye no indeed replied ella and i hope you are not tired of me tell me bob am i very much trouble here or very much in the way trouble in the way repeated bob well imthen a strong inspiration between the teeth as though to draw back the forcible expression quivering on his lipsbut there its because you dont know what youre sayin of that you talks that away what put that notion into your pretty little head harrymr collingwood i meanseems anxious that i should go home in some other vessel ella replied dolefully well now thats news that is answered bob since when has he taken that idee into his head we were talking about it this morning said ella and he said it would be more dangerous for me to go home in the water lily than in a large ship is the water lily dangerous bob dangerous exclaimed bob in a tone of angry scorn was she dangerous in that blow off the horn when a big ship capsized and went down with all hands close alongside of us was she dangerous when we had that bit of a brush with the pirates if she hadnt been the little beauty that she is shed ha gone down in the gale and aterwards ha been made a prize of by the cutthroats bob in his angry vindication of the cutters character was wholly oblivious of the bull he had perpetrated and ella seemed too much interested to notice it dangerous why whats the boy thinking about to take away the little barkies character that away i wish bob you would not keep calling hamr collingwood a boy he is quite as much a man as you are though of course not so old i dont likei dont think it sounds respectful exclaimed ella rather petulantly not call him a boy echoed bob why what should i call him then missie in course now you comes to mention it i knows as he is a man and an uncommon fine speciment too but lord when i knowed him fust he was quite a dapper young sprig and it comes natrallike to speak of him as a boy howsever continued he apologetically in course since you dont like it i wont call him a boy no more what shall i call him so please your ladyship now you are laughing at me you horrid old creature said ella with a little stamp of passion upon the deck and i never said i did not like it i merely said that it did not sound respectful why do you not call him captain why not indeed answered bob hes got as good a right to be called skipper as eer a man as ever walked a deck and dash my old wig if i aint a good mind to do it too my eyes how he would stare twould be as good as a pantomime to see him and the worthy old fellow chuckled gleefully as his fancy conjured up the look of surprise which he knew such a title on his lips would evoke from me i declare exclaimed ella in a tone of great vexation you are the most provokingbut there never mind bob dear i do not mean it you are very kind to me and must not take any notice of my foolish speeches and so you really think the water lily is not dangerous why then should mr collingwood wish me to leave her he told me this morning that he should be sorry if i did so and yet he seems unwilling to let me stay dont you believe it little one i heard bob answer he dont want ye to go its some kind of conscientious scruple as hes got into his head that makes him talk that away between you and mehere his voice sank to a kind of confidential growl but i distinctly heard every word neverthelessits my idee that hes got some sort of a notion as we may yet fall in with that infarnal albatross agin but if we do weve got chances of getting away from the chap that large ships havent and for my part if i must be in their blackguard neighbourhood id a deal rather be in the lily than in a large ship their best chance of getting the weathergage of us is by surprise but in a little barkie like this here we larns the knack of sleeping with one eye open and theyll have to be oncommon cute that surprises us oh exclaimed ella i hope and pray that we may not see those wretches it would be dreadful beyond description to fall into their hands do you think mr collingwood would send me away if i said i did not want to go not he dearie answered bob why cant ye see that hebut there i mustnt tell tales out of school if we gets a good chance perhaps it might be as well for ye to take advantage of it but we aint going to get it so i lives in hopes of having your sweet face to brighten us up for the rest of this here vyage but its eight bells and time to rouse the skipper so just step down dearie will ye and give him a call why he should send ella to call me when he had a voice capable of making the little crafts whole interior ring again i could not imagine but as her light step touched the ladder i closed my eyes feeling somehow that i would rather the sweet little thing should not know i had overheard the conversation just past i had scarcely composed my features when she stood beside me i had the feeling that she was stooping over me and i certainly felt her warm breath upon my face for an instant then she seemed to draw back again and i heard a soft whisper of harry then there came a light touch upon my arm and she said much louder mr collingwood it is eight bells ay ay i answered rubbing my eyes then i started to my feet but the little fairy had gone fluttering away forward so i took my sextant and went on deck in a minute or two she reappeared and seeing me with the sextant in my hand opened the chronometer and got the slate in readiness for taking the time i obtained three most excellent sights and from them worked up my longitude i had obtained an accurate observation for my latitude at noon and on going below and laying off our position on the chart i had the satisfaction of seeing that we were drawing well in with the islands and that if the breeze lasted we should be fairly within the group by evening next day when i announced this intelligence to my companions they were both delighted ella especially she having seen no land since leaving the sandwich islands which she declared was ages ago the last land we had seen was staten island though we caught the loom of land or thought we did when about abreast of the western end of magellan straits we were all longing for a run ashore and as i had resolved to thoroughly search the group from end to end if need be for traces of my father i decided that we would commence with the eastern end examining every island which in the slightest degree answered to the description given us of the spot on which the amazon had been cast away our little lady guest spent much of her time on decksitting in a deckchair within easy conversational range of whichever had the tiller and she favoured me with her company during the whole of the first watch it being my eight hours out that night but she was unusually silent gazing in an absent dreamy manner for the most of the time far away over the tranquil starlit sea and softly humming a bar or two of some of her favourite songs occasionally i made one or two attempts to draw her into conversation fearing she was in low spirits but she answered at random and in monosyllables and seeing after a while that i had no chance i gave it up the next morning when bob came on deck to wash down i said bob what is the matter with miss brand have you any idea he looked curiously at me for a moment and then said matter nothing as i knows on what should be the matter with the little dearie nothing should be the matter with her i answered rather tartly perhaps but she seemed unusually silent and unlike herself last night and as you seem pretty deep in her confidence i thought you might know the cause ay ay he returned she do speak pretty free to me ill allow which i accounts for by my being an old manat least she seems to think me so if i may judge by what she said yesterday and as to knowing the cause of her being out of sorts like perhaps i do and perhaps i dont i has my suspicions and pretty strong ones they be too but it aint for the likes of me to say a word axe no questions harry my lad but just leave things to work themselves out shell be all right again shortly you take my word for it is she ill do you think bob i inquired in some anxiety ill do she look like it queried he with a loud laugh no no shes well enough but womens most oncommon difficult to understand boy and the only way is to let em alone and take no notice when they seems queer now dont axe me no questions for i dont know anything about it and what i guess i aint going to tell what the old fellow surmised it was quite impossible for me to imagine and equally impossible to extract from him for he was as stubborn as a mule and if he made up his mind to a certain course nothing earthly had the power of turning him from it so with the unpleasant sensation that there was a mystery somewhere i was obliged to hold my tongue and console myself with the reflection that at all events it could be nothing which concerned me personally shortly after the conversation ella made her appearance at the head of the companionladder and bidding us both a cheery goodmorning summoned me to breakfast as soon as the coffee was poured out and we had fairly commenced the meal she said if you ever have any secrets to discuss mr collingwood i would advise you to seek some other place than the deck of the water lily you sailors appear to have the habit of talking loudly in the open air and i was awakened by your voices this morning and quite unintentionally heard much if not all of your conversation i am sorry that my quiet mood of last night should have given you any uneasiness but i hope you will be relieved when i assure you that there was nothing whatever the matter with me i am singularly susceptible to surrounding influences and the solemn beauty of the night excited within me a feeling ofnot sadness altogether but of gravity almost amounting to it which has now entirely passed away your best plan will be to follow bobs advice and take no notice of my varying moods for they really have no significance i have not the least idea what it is that the worthy fellow suspects as being the matter with me but whatever it is he is quite mistaken for i am happy to say i am perfectly well both in body and mind i felt greatly relieved at this explanation and said so and ella as though to make up for her silence of the previous night was rattling away in a more lively strain than ever when bob shouted from the deck land ho where away queried i springing to my feet and leaving my breakfast unfinished right ahead and up among the clouds by all thats wonderful answered bob i put my head above the companion and there sure enough directly ahead and about ten or twelve degrees above the horizon appeared an island apparently floating in the air it was low and judging from a small grove of trees which distinctly appeared of no great extent i took the glass but through it everything presented a wavering appearance as though the island and all upon it consisted of an infinite number of separate and distinct particles each revolving in a spiral direction upwards i called ella on deck to see the singular phenomenon for it was a more perfect example of mirage than i had ever before witnessed or could have believed possible as we continued to gaze upon the curious spectacle a faint foamy appearance revealed itself between us and the island but still in the sky and about half an hour afterwards this distinctly took the form of flying spray from breakers beating upon a reef the mirage lasted rather more than an hour and then faded gradually away how far dye reckon that island is away harry lad queried bob when we had finished breakfast and were all mustered on deck once more really said i it is a very difficult matter to decide by my reckoning we ought not to see it until about three this afternoon with the wind as it is and i hope we shall see it by that time so as to get inside the reef tonight if it looks very enticing we will stay there a few days and give the little craft an overhaul in hull spars and rigging and miss brand will have an opportunity of getting a few runs on shore meanwhile and perhaps a little fruit as a change of diet my reckoning proved correct for about three oclock that afternoon as i was sitting aft with the tillerropes in my hand i saw the tops of the cocoanut trees appearing above the horizon as i did not wish to disturb bob not feeling sure of our being able to lie at anchor all night without a watch i requested ellawho as usual was assisting to keep the watch on deckto take the tiller whilst i shortened sail the spinnaker and gafftopsail were got in and rolled up the spinnakerboom run in and topped up and by the time that eight bells had struck and bob had come on deck we were near enough to render it necessary to haul up and look out for a passage through the reef at first sight it seemed as though we were not to be permitted to approach the island for an unbroken line of heavy surf extended north and south to a distance of fully nine miles completely barring our passing through the eastern side of the reef and i began to believe that if a channel existed at all and i felt sure there must be one somewhere it must lie on the western side however i did not want to run to leeward if i could help it for though the lily being foreandaft rigged was better suited to turning to windward in a narrow passage than any other class of vessel i did not wish to risk the boat by the performance of such a hazardous operation for i had heard that the channels through these reefs were some of them so contracted that there was positively no room for even a small vessel to tack in many of the reaches so i made a bowline in the end of the gafftopsail halliards and went aloft in it with the intention of remaining there if need be to con the craft in we had hauled to the wind on the starboard tack with our head to the northward and the water lily was now with her foresheet to windward jogging quietly along towards the northern extremity of the island i kept a careful watch on the reef close to leeward but we traversed its whole extent to the northward without any sign of a channel revealing itself so i shouted to bob to go round and stand to the southward again from my elevated position i was enabled to make a tolerably complete examination of the island which exhibited no traces whatever as far as i could see of being inhabited it appeared to be about six miles in length by about three in width at the widest part though its coastline was very irregular and in some places i estimated that it was not much more than half that width it trended about northnortheast and southsouthwest and was very low no part rising apparently much higher than forty or fifty feet above the level of the sea whilst for the most part it did not appear to be higher than perhaps ten or twelve feet vegetation was extremely luxuriant a small grove of cocoanuts occupying a very nearly central position but on the western side of the island whilst the remaining portion was pretty thickly covered with less lofty trees the ground being clothed with deliciously fresh green turf and an endless variety of shrubs a narrow strip of clean white sand bordered the whole island and outside of this again extended the placid waters of the lagoon barely ruffled by the evening breeze this lagoon was as my readers will probably know the belt of water which surrounded the island intervening between it and the encircling coralreef on which the heavy swell expended all its force without being able to reach and disturb the still water inside we were within a mile and a half of the southern extremity of the island when i detected a thin line of unbroken water tortuously threading its way across the reef and extending clear into the lagoon its mouth would never have been observed from our deck or indeed from the deck of a ship for the channel entered the reef at an acute angle and the surf broke so heavily upon the outside and overlapping ledge that the foam and spray were carried quite across the narrow opening and mingled with the broken water on the opposite side but from my elevation i could see that there the channel was and having satisfied myself as we drew down towards it that it was unbroken i decided to run in through it had the lily been a moderately large vessel or squarerigged she could not have been taken through for there was one point about midway across the reef where i believed the passage could not exceed thirty feet in width and it was at a very awkward bend and there were so many sharp turnings to use a shore phrase that a squarerigged vessels yards could not have been handled rapidly enough to meet her frequent and quickly succeeding changes of direction but it was very different with us i directed bob to haul aft his weatherjibsheet and leeforesheet thus providing for the keeping of one of the headsails always full and to trim his mainsail with a moderately flowing sheet after which he might leave the canvas to take care of itself whilst he gave his undivided attention to the helm this was soon done and we bore away in the direction i indicated the lookout ahead from the deck must have been alarming enough for great as was bobs confidence in my judgment and steady as were his nerves he could not forbear hailing me i hope harry shouted he that youre quite sartain about that there passage i sees nothing ahead or anywheres else for that matter on either bow but surf and mind ye lad if we but touches once the little barkie ll be knocked into matchwood we may still claw off if theres any doubt port hard answered i too intent on the channel to enter into any explanation just then steady steady responded bob you stay close to me dearie sos to be within reach if anything happens and mind you dont get knocked overboard with the boom ah all right i sees the opening the water lily shot in past the overlapping ledge and my companions on deck were treated to a copious showerbath of spray for a few seconds and then we began to feel the shelter of the reef we shot along the first reach and soon approached a sharp elbow look out on deck i shouted we are about to jibe and you bob stand by to give her the helm smartly steady starboard now starboard hard ram the helm down so steady now port a little steady again luff you may handsomely not too close and now stand by for a halfboard luff let her come up luff and shake her so now hard up and so on and so on luff and keep her away then jibing now on one tack now on another until after about ten minutes of most ticklish navigation the cutter shot clear of the reef and glided rapidly over the smooth water of the lagoon bob let draw his jibsheet and we stood away towards the southern extremity of the island which we soon rounded i remaining still aloft to look out for any sunken rocks that might chance to be lying about but the bottom was quite clear the sand being distinctly visible from my post at the masthead we were now on the western side of the island and i observed that the grove of cocoanut trees before referred to stood upon the border of a pretty little bay or cove rather for it was very small and as this spot promised very snug anchorage close to the shore i directed bob to steer for it and then descended to the deck and got the anchor over the bows in readiness for letting go as we drew closer to the land our sails became partially becalmed under the lee of the trees and shrubs which densely covered the southern end of the island whilst the water was undisturbed by the faintest ripple save that which streamed away on each side of our sharp bow as i stood forward looking down into the clear transparency of the cool green depths i could discern here and there a few large branches of splendid coral projecting through the sand with multitudes of strangelyformed fishes darting round and about them and in one spot i observed what appeared to be a small bed of oysters of which i instantly took the bearings resolving to pay it a visit and try for a few at length we slid gently into our little cove bob put his helm down the cutter luffed into the wind and as soon as her way was deadened sufficiently i let run the anchor after which with one accord bob and i took off our hats and gave three joyous cheers it was the first time we had brought up since leaving madeira we soon had our canvas furled and whilst ella busied herself with the preparations for tea bob and i got our boat on deck and set about putting her together whilst thus engaged my companion remarked well harry i must say i didnt like the looks of things for a minute or two whilst we was running down upon the reef outside but you piloted us in in capital style did ye happen to think however how were going to get out agin now that were here certainly i did replied i you surely do not imagine that i would run in here without being satisfied beforehand that we could get out again all right there was no time for explanation whilst i was aloft but just before i caught sight of the channel through which we entered i distinctly saw one on this side of the island through which we could have beaten the little craft without much difficulty it appeared to have only two reaches and i think we might have laid up one of them on the port tack and the other on the starboard tack and as to getting out it will be a run with the wind free all the way but what do you think of our berth snug and comfortable as heart could wish responded he with an accent of keen enjoyment and i do hope as youll give us all and the little craft a holiday of a day or two now were here twont do any of us any harm and i really feels as though i could go ashore and lie down under the shade of them trees all day and do nothing but just enjoy the rest and the coolness and ease my old eyes by looking up at the beautiful green leaves with the clear blue sky peeping between em here and there i had a very similar feeling for though the island had nothing very specially attractive about it to us who had looked on nothing but sky and sea for so long it appeared but little short of a paradise so i very readily acquiesced in his proposal the more so as i felt that our health would be very greatly benefited by the change by the time that we had our boat put together and hanging astern by her painter tea was ready so after a comfortable ablution by way of bringing the days work to a close we all seated ourselves at the small cabintable and discussed our meal with a luxurious enjoyment of the perfect steadiness of the cutter and of the absence of all anxiety of every kind which was quite a novelty we finished the meal by lamplight and then adjourned to the deck where as was our regular custom bob and i smoked our evening pipes those only who have endured the monotony of a long seavoyage can understand the pleasure with which we regarded our surroundings and compared them with those of many an evening past the night had completely closed in and the deep unclouded purple vault above was thickly studded with stars which unlike those in the northern hemisphere instead of glittering sparklike and cold beamed with the deep mellow lustre of the softest lamps each being clearly reflected in the mirrorlike surface of the unruffled lagoon we were as i believe i have said before on the western or leeside of the island so completely sheltered from the wind by the thickclustering trees and shrubs which covered its surface that only the faintest zephyr could approach us though it swept briskly through the topmost branches of the cocoanuts gently agitating their leaves and producing a soft rustling sound above which the loud roar of the surf beating on the reef to windward could be distinctly heard mingling with this there issued from the shore a continuous chirping and singing from innumerable multitudes of insects which swelling shrill and high merged into one vast wave of sound which completely filled the air tens of thousands of fireflies flitted to and fro their tiny sparks gleaming brilliantly against the dark background of dense foliage and if we looked over the side for a moment we saw the deep obscurity of the tranquil ocean constantly flashing into sudden brightness as a long trail of pale phosphorescent sparks or a momentary halo betrayed the movement of some finny denizen of the deep we remained on deck until nearly midnight when having observed nothing whatever to excite the slightest apprehension as to our absolute safety we resolved to dispense with the formality of a watch and therefore all retired below with an understanding that the morrow was to be observed as a strict holiday by all hands volume two chapter iii at close quarters with a shark i awoke soon after sunrise the next morning and calling bob in accordance with an arrangement made overnight we both jumped on board the boat and pulling to the opposite side of a tiny headland about a mile away stripped and plunged overboard where we swam and dived and wallowed about in the deliciously cool element for a good halfhour enjoying our bath as thoroughly as though we were a couple of schoolboys playing truant we were strongly tempted to make a small preliminary exploring excursion inland after this but miss ella had solemnly bound us both down not to do so without her so we returned to the water lily instead wonderfully refreshed and invigorated by our dip and quite ready for the early breakfast which was to form the first regular feature in the programme for the day as we rowed back to the cutter i embraced the opportunity to pass once more over the spot where i thought i had observed the oysterbed and on reaching it and peering down in the shadow of the boat i found i was right there lay beneath us a bed of several yards extent of what i felt sure were oysters we described a short circuit round our little craft before stepping on board again and i felt so ashamed of her dingy weatherbeaten appearance that i resolved she should have a fresh coat of paint before she went outside again this we decided she should receive next day i undertaking to wield the paintbrush whilst bob employed himself in overhauling the rigging and examining the spars breakfast was soon disposed of as we were all equally eager to stand once more on mother earth and then bob providing himself with a few biscuits whilst i did the same adding a few knickknacks for my fair companion we jumped into the boat and in a very few minutes reached the shore the painter was made fast to the stem of a stout shrub which grew close to the waters edge and then bob went straight towards the widest patch of shade and the softest turf he could find and flung himself forthwith upon the ground asserting that it was his fixed intention to remain there for the rest of the day and enjoy his holiday in accordance with his own peculiar notions after a few vain attempts to persuade him that he would find it much more pleasant to accompany us in a ramble over the island we gave him up to his own devices and ella accepting the support of my arm we strolled slowly away our steps were directed in the first instance towards the northern end of the island our path being sometimes over the short tender grass with which the ground was thickly clad and at others along the sandy beach to which we were occasionally compelled to diverge in consequence of the dense undergrowth through which it would have been impossible for my companion to force her way we picked up several very beautiful shells on the beach and ella promised herself a long ramble before leaving the island expressly for the purpose of collecting a few of the choicest varieties i was rather disappointed to find such a scarcity of fruit there being none as far as we could discover beyond the cocoanuts and a few wild figs the latter rather insipid to the taste though still a welcome change after the food we had all been accustomed to ella very thoughtfully collected a little of this fruit for bob when we chanced to meet with a tree bearing figs of a superior flavour to the average and i promised her that on our return i would secure a few cocoanuts and treat her to a draught of the delightfully refreshing cool new milk we found walking to be far more fatiguing than we had expected after being pent up so long on shipboard and i think i found it even more so than my companion she having had until recently the comparatively wide range of a ships deck upon which to take exercise whilst we of the water lily could only boast of a fishermans walk two steps and overboard i kept a sharp lookout for fresh water intending to entirely refill our tank and casks and ella was equally anxious for such a discovery as she gave me notice that she intended to hold a grand wash desiring me at the same time to make up a bundle of all my soiled linen etc and deliver it over to her this i of course flatly refused to do assuring her that i was fully equal to the task of doing my own washing and that i never would consent to her descending to the performance of so menial a task for me what said she releasing my arm to speak with the greater energy not allow me to wash a few shirts and socks for you and your pockethandkerchiefs indeed but you must it is womans peculiar province to wash clothes men never wash properly they either half do it or else beat to pieces whatever they may be washing in the vain endeavour to properly purify it now you must let me have my own way just this once please i still refused and added laughingly it seems to me to be a part of your creed that it is womans peculiar province to do certain things for men and that if she is not at hand to do it it cannot be done at all or at all events in a satisfactory manner i remember your urging the plea that it is womans peculiar province to cook as a means whereby to gain my consent to your taking charge of that department and very grateful am i to you for so doing for we have enjoyed our meals as we never did before but as to your doing any washing but your own i cannot and will not consent to it but why not she persisted woman was created as a helpmeet for man and i am sure you will admit that our sex is more thoroughly qualified for the performance of certain duties than is man and where that is distinctly the case it seems to me to point naturally to the conclusion that such duties form a part of her share of the work necessary for the comfort and happiness of the race of course i would not offer to wash for you or for myself if we were in a large ship and with proper servants to do such work but in our present circumstances i see nothing whatever of a menial or degrading character in it perhaps not i replied i cannot enter quite so deeply as you do into the question i can only say that the idea is too repugnant for me to consent to any such division of the necessary work so please say no more about it for my mind is made up and i can be as stubborn as bob himself upon occasion i quite believe you she retorted half playfully and half disposed to be angry though i do not consider bob stubborn at all he always lets me do whatever i like and what an original character he is do you know i quite admire him he is somewhat rough and unpolished i admit but he is as gentle to me as was my own dear mamma and i hold to the opinion that a man who is gentle and courteous to women is a man of sterling worth let his manner be as uncouth as it may i believe that gentleness and courtesy to our sex is the first and most distinguishing mark of natures nobility but why do you permit him to be so familiar and disrespectful in his manner of addressing you i do not consider him in the slightest decree disrespectful i replied he is much older than i am and a man of far wider experience at all events in all matters connected with our profession and that and our long and severelytried friendship abundantly justifies the familiarity of his mode of address i dislike formality with every one except strangers it is all very well as a means of keeping at a distance those you dislike and have no desire to become intimate with but it is a rather formidable barrier to friendship so i think responded ella with animation i do so wish what i inquired she hesitated a little and blushed a great deal and then apparently with some effort replied well i wish you would exchange the formal miss brand for the more friendly and familiar ella that is if you consider me worthy of your friendship i will indeed i replied with very great pleasure if you will permit me to do so and i trust that you in return will call me as i love to be called by all my friendsharry very well she replied gaily i will that is as long as you are good to me and do not displease me in any way the sign of my sovereign displeasure will be a return to the formality of mr collingwood we chatted blithely on after this upon all sorts of subjects and i was both surprised and delighted at the depth and extent of my companions information she had evidently read much and what was more to the purpose had selected her reading with sound judgment storing her mind abundantly with useful facts which she always had ready for production in support of an argument or by way of illustration and she frequently graced her conversation with choice quotations introduced in the best taste and with a manner as far as possible removed from anything like affectation or pedantry i was charmed beyond measure and over and over again thanked the lucky accident which had rendered it my good fortune to be put upon terms of such close intimacy with so fascinating a little creature at length we completed our tour of the northern end of the island returning by way of the eastern shore until we were abreast the clump of cocoanut trees when we struck inland and after a somewhat tortuous course between the thickgrowing shrubs reached the beach on our own side once more unfortunately for ellas projected laundry operations we had not been able to discover the slightest sign of a spring of fresh water anywhere when we arrived opposite the point where the water lily rode peacefully at anchor bob was nowhere to be seen the boat still remained moored to the shrub as we had left her so i concluded that he had grown tired of inactivity and had gone off in the opposite direction to ourselves for a stroll i therefore proposed to ella that she should rest awhile upon the soft velvety turf whilst i returned to the cutter for a piece of rope to aid me in my ascent after the cocoanuts the rope was soon obtained and returning to the shore i passed it in a loose band round the trunk of one of the trees leaving room in the band for the introduction of my own body by bearing against this whilst i raised my feet and then slipping the band up the tree i was easily and quickly enabled to reach the fruit from which i selected an abundant supply of the finest specimens and flung them to the ground whilst thus engaged bob hove in sight and when i reached the ground again he reported that having soon grown tired of doing nothing he had started away on a walk to the southward about half an hour after we left him and had gone to the extreme end of the island that he had enjoyed his walk amazingly was excessively tired and like ourselves had failed to find any fresh water under these circumstances poor little ella was compelled to postpone her washingday i promising that she should have the necessary time allowed her at the first suitable island we happened to reach by this time the dinnerhour was approaching and ella desired to be put on board the cutter to make the few slight preparations for the meal which were necessary as soon as we had put her on board and whilst she was thus engaged i took bob away with me in the boat to try for a few oysters we had no means of trawling for them but i estimated that they lay in not more than about two and a half fathoms of water and i considered myself quite diver enough to reach that distance as soon as we arrived at the spot i stripped and plunged in taking down with me an old canvas clothesbag which i slung round my neck i soon found that i had been deceived by the crystal transparency of the water into underestimating the depth it was fully four fathoms to the bottom and this together with the difficulty i experienced in keeping the mouth of the bag open necessitated four plunges before i had obtained half the bag full there was not time to do more just then so i dressed the bag was hauled up and we returned with our prize to the cutter we resolved to commence dinner with a course of oysters and i forthwith proceeded to open some a task which gave me a very considerable amount of difficulty imagine if you can my surprise and delight when on opening the second oyster i found that it contained several small pearls the third was opened and it also contained several the fourth had none but the fifth on being opened revealed three beauties each as large as the top of my middle finger to be brief i was soon satisfied that i had stumbled upon a bed of pearloysters about half of the bivalves yielding when opened more or less pearls the greater quantity being small such as are set in rings but several goodsized pearls were also found and one magnificent fellow as large as a cherry as may easily be imagined we were all excitement after this and i proposed that as soon as dinner was over we should move the cutter down and anchor her upon the bed and devote the remainder of the afternoon to systematic pearlfishing the proposition was rapturously received ella declaring that she had often read of pearlfishing and should very much like to witness the operation accordingly dinner was no sooner over than we weighed and stood down to the spot under our jib and having reached it the cutter was anchored as nearly as possible over the centre of the bed i had hit upon a plan by which i thought some of my difficulties of the morning might be got over and as soon as we were brought up bob and i got our floatinganchor on deck stretched the canvas upon it and rigging out our spinnakerboom a rope was passed through the sheave in the outer end of it and bent to the crowfoot of the floatinganchor which thus hung suspended like a large tray over the water it was then lowered to the bottom a small pig of ballast was got on deck and slung to another ropesend and i then went below and changed my dress for an old white shirt and duck trousers buckling a belt round my waist to which as it happened a strong sharp sheathknife was attached being now ready to descend i looked over the side and satisfied myself that our floatinganchor lay all right at the bottom and in such a manner as properly to perform its new functions as a tray i then slipped over the side into the water grasping firmly the rope to which the piece of ballast was attached and having well filled my lungs with air i waved my disengaged hand bob let go the rope and the ballast draped me swiftly to the bottom still retaining my hold upon the sinker with one hand i now rapidly shovelled the oysters into my tray with the other as long as i could hold my breath and i was satisfied at the first experiment that my expedient was a complete success thrice as many oysters being deposited in the tray at one dive as i had obtained altogether in the morning i soon had to rise to get a fresh inhalation but by hauling up the sinker every time so as to have the benefit of its assistance in taking me to the bottom i was enabled to reserve all my breath and energy for my work at the oysters and so successful was i that in three descents i managed to place upon the tray as many oysters as it would hold it was now hauled up its contents carefully transferred to the cutters deck and the anchor or tray again lowered to the bottom this operation had been repeated five times with the result that a goodly pile of bivalves now graced the deck and i had crone down a second time on the sixth round if i may so express myself when suddenly a dark shadow fell upon the spot on which i was at work i glanced upward and to my unspeakable horror saw an enormous shark floating motionless within a fathom of and directly above me why he did not attack me at once i could not imagine but i conjecture that it was because lying flat upon the ground as i was he had not room to turn as sharks invariably do when seizing their prey my blood seemed fairly to congeal in my veins as i realised my appalling position i must rise to the surface in a very few seconds or drown where i was and i felt convinced that the moment i was far enough from the bottom to permit of the monster making his rush he would do so suddenly the remembrance of my sheathknife flashed across my brain there was no time to hesitate my powers of endurance were almost utterly exhausted and i felt that i could hold my breath but a second or two longer so i quickly drew the knife and darting suddenly upwards succeeded in grasping the shark with my left hand by his starboard fin whilst with my right i plunged my weapon to the hilt in his gleaming white belly extending my arm to its full length as i did so and thus inflicting a wound nearly or quite two feet in length remembering the wonderful vitality of the shark i did not content myself with this but thrusting my armed hand into the gaping wound i drew the knife two or three times rapidly across his interior arrangements inflicting such severe injuries that in less than a minute after i rose to the surface bloodstained from head to foot and speechless with exhaustion the shark also appeared floating dead within a dozen yards of the cutter bobs strong and ready hand was promptly extended to assist me in over the cutters low gunwale but so thoroughly exhausted was i that i felt utterly unable to make the slightest effort in aid of my shipmates exertions and he was obliged to drag me bodily inboard where after an unavailing effort to stand i sank upon the deck gasping for breath and utterly unable to utter a word ellas eager face blanched deadly white at the horrifying spectacle i presented as i lay prone at her feet my once white clothing now deeply imbued with blood and i thought she would have fainted but she struggled bravely against the weakness though she could not repress a violent shudder which thrilled through her from head to foot sinking to her knees at my side she gently raised me until my head rested upon her throbbing breast and gazing upon my face with a look expressive of the deepest anxiety she inquired where are you hurt harry is it much are you in very great pain i made a powerful but unavailing effort to reply when seeing my lips move but without any sound issuing from them she suddenly lost her selfcontrol and shrieking he is dying bob dying i tell you oh what can we do to save him burst into an overwhelming passion of tears and clasping me convulsively to her bosom she sobbed forth wild prayers for mercy mingled with the tenderest and most endearing epithets that ever sprang from the heart of a passionately loving woman to her lips surprised beyond all power of expression and almost overwhelmed with delight at this utterly unexpected betrayal of her feeling for me i could not suffer her to continue so having by this time somewhat recovered my breath i gasped out i am not hurt ella indeed i am not i was only overcome for the moment with exhaustion pray calm yourself not hurt she exclaimed eagerly not injured at all thank god oh thank god for that butwas it kind sirwas it like a gentleman to permit me to be surprised into such expressions as those which have just escaped my lips how can i ever hold up my head again in your presence or look you in the face hush ella darling i whispered do not distress yourself i entreat you i have much to say to you and what has just passed has but precipitated matters a little retire below for a short time and calm your agitated feelings and this evening i will ask you to favour me with a few minutes of your society on shore when i will enter into such explanations as i trust will prove entirely satisfactory and have the effect of completely healing your wounded sensibility why continued i cheerily that is well the roses are already returning to your cheeks and by the time that i have been down once or twice more and have secured another merciful heaven she exclaimed in horrified accents do i hear aright is it possible you can be mad enough to contemplate going into the water again after having so narrowly escaped from such a horrible death you must not harry and you will not if you entertain the slightest feeling ofoffriendship for me indeed i could not bear it another shock such as i have just received would kill me pray have some little compassion upon me enough ella and more than enough i answered deeply moved henceforward your wishes are law to me and since you object to my going overboard again i promise you faithfully that i will not do so now go below dear and lie down for a short time whilst bob and i take the cutter back to her old moorings as soon as she was out of sight bob who had stood patiently on one side whilst the above denouement was taking place approached and extending his hand exclaimed now that the little beauty has done with ye lad give an old friend a shake of your flipper im right down glad to see ye well and hearty my dear boy he continued with strong emotion we both saw that doubly and everlastingly damned brute range up and take a berth close above ye and to own the plain honest truth i put ye down as good as done for there warnt no time to do anything by way of warning ye or lending ye a hand anyways for afore i could collect my scattered wits we saw ye let go the sinker and next minute the water alongside was like a biling pot and then we seed the blood and damn me if i didnt turn that sick and queer i couldnt see a thing just for a moment and when i hauled ye aboard i couldnt for the life of me tell whether you was dead or alive now lets get up them few histers that was like to have cost us all so dear and get away from the spot as soon as we can we were not very long in getting the remainder of the oysters on board and soon afterwards we had the cutter back at her old berth our first task as soon as the craft was at anchor again was to transfer our booty to the shore where we spread them out on a large tarpaulin on the sand to die the method pursued by the regular pearlfishers i believe is to allow the fish to remain until they are in an advanced stage of decay when the pearls are sought for amongst the putrid mass i felt no inclination however for such a task and moreover did not care to expend so much time as this process involved i conjectured that the fish once dead they might be opened with comparatively little difficulty and i thought that by the time our overhaul and painting was completed the oysters would be in a fit state for operating upon ella now reappeared on deck somewhat more composed though there was still a slight nervous flutter perceptible in her movements i took advantage of her presence on deck to remark casually that i would now go below and change my dress and cleanse myself from the traces of my recent encounter which i forthwith did and when i had refreshed myself with a copious ablution i really felt very little the worse for my adventure indeed i believe that i was less discomposed by it than either of the others after tea was over i took occasion to remind ella that i had somewhat to say to her and requested her to accompany me on shore and take a short walk on the beach that i might speak without being embarrassed by bobs presence she stepped silently into the boat and in a few minutes more we stood together on the strand taking the arm which i offered her she said now harry what is it you wish to say to me simply this i replied from the nature of my occupation i have had as you may suppose but very few opportunities of associating with your sex with the solitary exception of my sister i cannot say that i am intimately acquainted with any woman and i am an utter stranger to everything relating to womankind i know nothing whatever of their characteristics and have not the slightest idea of how they are likely to be influenced by powerful emotions it may be that under such circumstances they sometimes utter words of which they are wholly unconscious and which have not the most remote relation to their actual sentiments if this really be the case a man of honour chancing to hear such words escape the lips of a lady will forthwith forget that they were ever uttered this i am prepared to do with regard to the words spoken by you this afternoon ella if you wish me to understand that they had no meaning true it will dispel a brief but blissful dream in which i have dared to indulge for a short hour or two but what right have i to suppose that i have awakened within your breast any sentiment beyond that of the merest friendship if i may dare to aspire even to that especially when i take into consideration the shortness of the time you have known me it has been but a few days i know but almost from the moment that we met upon the deck of the copernicus a new and hitherto unknown feeling has animated me it has grown with every hour of my life since then and without analysing its nature i have permitted it to strengthen until it has become a part of my very life itself a feeling which i must perforce still continue to cherish whether for weal or for woe it is for you to sayas long as life remains in saying that i never analysed this feeling i am stating what is strictly true but in that dread moment this afternoon when i unexpectedly found myself face to face with death in one of its most dreadful formsmy companion shuddered violentlyin that terrible moment i say the discovery flashed upon me that the feeling to which i have referred is love the most passionate devoted idolising love tell me ella tell me my darling may i dare to hope that at some time in the distant future when you shall have had opportunities of becoming better acquainted with me cease harry the dear girl interrupted with deep emotion cease i pray you to agitate yourself with causeless fears why should i hesitateafter having already given such unequivocal expression to my feelings to avow that like yourself i have loved almost from the first moment of our meeting i know not whether now or at any future time you will deem my heart too easily won but if you do remember that the advantage has been from the first all on your side you appeared as my deliverer from a situation of peculiar trial to a young and delicately broughtup girl and of peril the nature and extent of which you are better able to realise than i am to tell so in judging me you must not forget to take into consideration and give me the benefit of the peculiar circumstances of the case and whether lightly won or not you shall find dear harry that my love is not the less sincere and loyal on that account for never was there a truer or more devoted wife than i will be to you if it please god to permit us to become united and saying this my little darling turned and with unaffected confiding simplicity wound her soft arms about my neck and raised her sweet lips to mine the conversation which followed deeply interesting as it was to the parties engaged need not be reproduced here suffice it to say that the insight i thus obtained of ellas character and disposition amply justified the sudden and precipitate step i had taken that it was precipitate i could not and did not attempt to conceal from myself and that it would have been highly imprudent under ordinary circumstances thus to connect myself by so binding a tie as betrothal to one of whose very existence i was ignorant but a short fortnight before i was also fully aware but after all marriage is to a very great extent a lottery and one can never be really certain until after the nuptial knot has been tied whether one has drawn a prize or a blank there are some women in whom a fresh trait of character is always revealing itself so that just when you think you have at last succeeded in thoroughly understanding them you discover that you are just as far off any reliable knowledge of their character as ever but with ella it was very different there was a childlike openness and ingenuousness of manner about her which quickly revealed to the observer not only the salient points but also the finer gradations of her character and temperament and i believe that i had a clearer insight into both at the time that i thus hastily offered myself than many men who do the same thing after an acquaintance of a season and with such knowledge as they are able to pick up by meeting their charmer at balls picnics canters in the row and what not at length we returned to the cutter where we found bob with his pipe still between his teeth sitting aft fast asleep i wished ella goodnight and then roused master bob up and whilst we smoked a final pipe together communicated my good fortune to him ay ay said he as soon as i had told him you may thank jack shark for having it come upon ye so soon lad it was bound to come sooner or later ive seed it clearer and clearer every day but it warnt for me to say a word one way or tother but the narrer squeak you had for it this aternoon just took the little lady flat aback and afore she could pay off you see she let run a whole string of lovin words that there warnt no way of hauling aboard and coiling down out of sight agin and so she hadnt no chice but just to haul down her colours as soon as you opened fire well youve made a pretty prize harry and i congratulate ye with all my heart a trimmer model or one better ballasted with the right sort of feelins and idees no man need wish to sail the vyge of life in company with and as to her being fond of ye why she couldnt help showing of it try all she would she couldnt talk of nothing else from morning to night but you it dont matter what the conversation started with whether twas ships or flyinfish or hurricanes waterspoutsanything in heaven or airth shed bring it all round in a sort of greatcirclesailing fashion to you and now that youve got her lad i hope as youll be able to sail her properly women is very ticklish craft to handle you must hear in mind as tender in a squall as a racin cutter with all her flyinkites aloft and youll have to keep a sharp lookout to winard and have the halliards and sheets all ready for lettin run at a moments notice or youll maybe get something serous carried away or have a reglar downright wrack altogether afore you knows where you are i could not help smiling at this characteristic speech of congratulation and caution of bobs to which i of course made a suitable reply and then shaking hands we went below and tumbled into our respective hammocks volume two chapter iv the lily among breakers the next morning we were up betimes and that ella might be removed from the scene of dirt and confusion which the cutter would present during the day our first act was to convey on shore the necessary rear and materials for the preparation and consumption of our meals there it being anticipated that one day would suffice for all we intended to do just then by the time that we had done so and had returned to the cutter ella made her appearance on deck meeting me affectionately and then turning to thank bob for the congratulations the honest and warmhearted fellow saw fit to offer on the occasion these over i pulled the dear girl ashore and she forthwith set about seeking for a favourable spot where to spread the tablecloth upon the sward and to arrange her equipage a fire having already been lighted and the kettle suspended over it gipsyfashion from three crossed sticks whilst she was thus engaged i returned on board and routed out our small stock of paints and set to work mixing them whilst bob having already washed down inboard busied himself in casting off and easing up the rigging preparatory to a regular overhaul the first thing after breakfast as soon as the meal was ready ella came down to the beach and waved her pockethandkerchief the signal agreed upon and we pulled ashore and took a hasty meal it being understood that the day would be a busy one i being desirous of finishing all before sunset so as to make a start again next day there being nothing to detain us or to make it worth our while to prolong our stay where we then were breakfast over bob and i pulled back to the cutter where we at once commenced work in earnest leaving ella to amuse herself by strolling along the shore and making her proposed collection of shells by dinnertime i succeeded in finishing the painting giving the craft not only a coat of black from her rail down to the copper with a white stripe or ribbon round the ornamental groove cut for that purpose in the coveringboard but also a coat of pale stonecolour all round the inside of her low bulwarks as well as a touch of varnish on the teak and mahoganyfittings of the deck this left me free to assist bob in the afternoon and such good progress did we make that by sunset the rigging had been overhauled and lifted the masthead examined in the eyes of the rigging new service put on where required and everything got back into its place again the lanyards all set up and the mainsail rebent which it badly required we then had a good wash and adjourned to the shore where we found our fair companion awaiting us with tea all ready and a collection of most beautiful shells to exhibit the fruits of her days gathering as soon as the meal was over everything was transported on board again and put in its place and i then rejoined ella who remained on shore and we had a very enjoyable ramble enlivened with such conversation as lovers delight in the next morning as soon as breakfast was over we all adjourned to the shore once more and whilst ella at my recommendation took another stroll about the island bob and i set to work upon the oysters they were all dead by this time of course and not only so but in such a condition that it taxed our resolution to the utmost to go through with the task about which we had set ourselves but what will man not do for the sake of wealth it is true we both felt sanguine about finding our treasureisland and if the account we had received of it was true there was more wealth there than we had the means of taking away with us still we could not resist the temptation to secure this comparatively speaking small windfall that had come in our way so we persevered and we certainly had no reason to be dissatisfied with our reward when all was over we found that our acquisition amounted to about a quartmeasure full of seedpearls and a similar measure full of pearls of a large size ranging from the size of peas to in one instance a splendid fellow fully as large as a pigeons egg many others being nearly as fine this task occupied us all the morning and when it was finished we returned to the cutter and at once set about taking our boat to pieces and stowing her away below this done we took dinner immediately after which bob and i got the canvas set hove up our anchor and stood away for the western passage through the reef this passage was much wider than the one by which we had entered and not nearly so crooked and as we were just within the influence of the tradewinds and it trended generally in a westerly direction we had a fair wind through so we had no difficulty whatever in passing out between the reefs which we did under easy sail jetting the gafftopsail and spinnaker upon the craft however as soon as we were fairly outside the wind was blowing fresh but steady from about southeast and as our course was westnorthwest we flew merrily away very nearly dead before the wind with our spinnaker boomed out to port bob took the afternoon watch and i retired below and lay down as it was my eight hours out that night ella remained on deck chatting gaily with bob and busying herself with some mysterious bit of sewing and i soon dropped off into a doze nothing of importance occurred for the remainder of that day nor during the next ella now regularly kept the first nightwatch with me whenever it was my eight hours out and many a pleasant chat did we have together and more and more reason did i see for congratulating myself upon my choice of a bride hasty as that choice had been now that we had had an explanation and there no longer existed any reason for the fair girls concealing her ardent attachment to me many little puzzling peculiarities and contradictions which i had before observed in her conduct disappeared and i found her society more charming and her conversation more frank and enjoyable every day there was not a particle of coquettishness or nonsense of any kind about her and she made no hesitation whatever about acknowledging frankly yet modestly the warmth of her affection she questioned me eagerly and with the utmost interest about my father and i saw with delight that there was already springing up within her breast a feeling of regard for him simply because he happened to be my father which promised with but a little encouragement to blossom into deep affection in the prospect of finding the treasure she also exhibited an interest but it was nothing in comparison with the other on one occasion for example when in speaking of it i endeavoured to explain to her that there was no absolute certainty of our being able to find it and that if we failed i should be compelled of necessity to return to my own profession as a means of support she replied well harry dear i really do hope you will find it for it would be very hard to have you away from me for many months at a time or indeed at all but i could reconcile myself to that if we only happen to be fortunate enough to find your dear father so that i might have the satisfaction of knowing that when my darling was absent from me he would be with a beloved parent she was not at all insensible to the advantages of wealth but i could see in many little ways that she was quite sincere in the statement she often made that she would willingly sacrifice our chances of securing the gold for the certainty of discovering my father when i went on deck at sevenbells in answer to bobs call on the morning but one succeeding the day of our departure from the island i found that the wind had dropped almost to a dead calm the lily making no more than about three knots and that there was a heavy sultry feeling in the air quite different from the usual freshness of the sea breeze a thin and almost impalpable vapour was spread over the entire firmament like a curtain and away to the eastward a heavy bank of dark menacing cloud was slowly rising above the horizon a glance at the aneroid which was fixed in the companionway so as to be visible to the helmsman revealed the fact that the pointer of the instrument had gone considerably back and this together with the threatening aspect of the heavens made me fear that we were about to have a very unpleasant break in the fine weather we had been favoured with since entering the pacific i dont like the looks of things harry said bob as i glanced round at the aspect of our surroundings that glass there has gone back a good inch within the hour and this lightflying stuff overhead has sprung from lord knows where within the last ten minutes and that bank down yonder seems to me to be working about in a way thats altogether onaccountable and looks very much as though twas breeding mischief id ha called ye before lad but its only within these ten minutes that theres been anything out of the way about the look of the weather it has a threatening look about it certainly i replied and we will not waste a moment in getting the canvas off the craft and in making her snug for whatever may befall leave the tiller to take care of itself bob and in with the gafftopsail whilst i hand the spinnaker never mind about rolling them up we can do that byandby if we have time so thats well now settle away the peak halliards orhere let me have them and i will lower away both peak and throat whilst you gather in the sail now roll it snugly up and stow it securely and put the cover on whilst i get in the jib and lower the topmast be as lively as you like bob we shall have none too much time by the look of things astern now we may yet roll up these sails and get them out of the way below if we are smart you do that whilst i closereef the foresail i hope that whatever is coming will not last long for we are in rather an ugly berth here among so many islands and it may not be an easy matter to avoid them if we are obliged to scud as i expect we shall be we worked with a will and in a quarter of an hour had the craft stripped with the exception of a closereefed foresail and her topmast lowered all the time that we were working the heavy bank astern had been rising and spreading itself over the heavens like a dark canopy the vast mass of vapour of which it was composed writhing and twisting like the contortions of a wounded snake and by the time that our preparations were complete the entire sky was overspread with the exception of a low strip away on the western horizon which was rapidly lessening even as we looked upon it the interposition of this vast curtain of vapour between us and the sky caused an awful semidarkness to fall upon the scene and this was still further increased by the presence of a kind of smoky mist which now filled the air rendering everything so obscure that it was difficult to see further than a mile on either side ella now came upon deck to announce that breakfast was ready but we had something else to occupy our attention just then and the fair girl placed her arm in mine and gazed with us in silence at the aweinspiring scene the wind had died away altogether but the inky sea exhibited a singular and alarming appearance leaping into low waves which had no run in any direction and which presented more the appearance of what we see on the surface of a simmering caldron than anything else to which i can compare it suddenly a blinding flash of lightning rent the canopy overhead and simultaneously came the cracking rattling crash of the thunder i directed ella to retire below and not to attempt returning to the deck unless i called her advising her also to get her breakfast at once and clear everything away if she wished to save the crockery as i expected we should soon have more of both wind and sea than we wanted i then closed the cabin doors and drew over the slide and well it was that i did so for at that moment there came another flash another deafening stunning peal and then the floodgates of heaven were opened and the rain descended in such blinding sheets that our deck was in less than a minute full to the low rail notwithstanding that there was an inch of clear space all round the craft between bulwarks and coveringboard to enable her to free herself rapidly of water this lasted perhaps five minutes and then the rain ceased as suddenly as it had come on it was to compare great things with small like the emptying of a bucket of water it was a deluge whilst it lasted and it ceased as suddenly as would the shower from a bucket when its contents had all fallen to the ground another minute or two of suspense succeeded and then a pale primrosecoloured streak appeared on the horizon to the eastward rapidly increasing in size and a hollow moaning sound gradually became audible in the air i did not like it at all i was sure something out of the common was about to happen and i desired bob to go forward and haul down the foresail and stow it he had just done this and was coming aft again when he sung out here it comes at last harry stand by the tiller i looked and away astern right and left far as the eye could reach was a rapidly advancing and widening streak of white foam on it came outstripping in speed the fastest express train the sea in front of it inky black whilst behind it was all as white as milk i sat down on deck bracing my feet against the companion and desired bob to do the same and it was well we did so or i verily believe we should have been blown overboard the hurricane struck us fairly astern and i fully expected to see the mast go clean out of the cutter whilst the foam boiled up over the taffrail and surged inboard filling our decks and piling over us in a truly alarming manner however our rigging was all firstrate and stood the tremendous strain bravely and the laws of nature asserting their supremacy even in this wild scene the little lily rose and shook herself clear of the water which had swept in over her and then away she flew at a perfectly frightful speed dead before it had she been of the usual model her bows would have been forced under by the enormous pressure of the wind behind and she would have gone down head foremost but sharp as were her waterlines her bows curved boldly out above water and thus afforded her a support forward which now proved her salvation the first fierceness of the gust lasted perhaps five minutes possibly not so much but it is difficult to measure time on such occasions as these and then we got the strength of the gale proper i thought it blew pretty hard off cape horn but it was a trifle compared with this the sea remained perfectly smooth for the simple reason that it could not get up the tops of the surges as they rose were taken by the wind and swept off as neatly as you would cut a flower from its stalk with a ridingswitch and the air was filled completely with this scud water rendering it so thick that it was impossible to see a cables length ahead as all immediate danger was for the present over i now desired bob to push back the companion slide leaving the doors still closed however and go below and get a mouthful of something to eat as i did not know what call might yet be made upon our energies and it was desirable that we should not allow ourselves to become exhausted from want of food as soon as he had snatched a hasty meal he relieved me and i went below in my turn when i found that ella had contrived to keep some coffee hot for us as well as a supply of the cakes or rolls which she was so fond of making and the dear girl pale and terrified as she was took her place at the table attending to my wants with true womanly assiduity and selfforgetfulness she earnestly entreated to be allowed to accompany me on deck and share whatever danger there might be but this of course i would not allow asserting a little ungallantly i fear that she could do no good there and would only be in the way i gave her permission however to stand in the companionway and look abroad upon the strange scene providing that she wrapped herself well up and put on my macintosh to prevent becoming wet through and this concession she gratefully accepted hour after hour we flew before the fury of the gale my anxiety increasing with every mile that we travelled for my chart told me that a group of islands lay directly ahead as we were then steering and i knew by my reckoning that we must be drawing fearfully close to them if indeed we were not already actually among them the wind had moderated to a certain extent from its first terrific violence but it was still blowing far too hard to permit of our roundingto and making use of our floatinganchor any attempt to do so must inevitably have resulted in the craft turning the turtle with us and i had therefore no choice but to keep scudding the sea began to get up too now and followed us in a very menacing manner the huge foaming crests rearing high above our taffrail and threatening every moment to fall on board so great did this danger at last become that i reluctantly directed bob to go forward and set the foresail which i had closereefed before it was stowed upon the craft this in such weather and with only one hand to do the work promised to be a task of no ordinary difficulty but bob was the man to do it if any one could and he set about the work with all the care and skill of which he was master i sheered the cutter about one point to port to keep the sail steadily drawing and the sheets being carefully trimmed the old fellow took the halliards in one hand knelt down upon the sail and cast off the stops by which it was secured he then steadied the halliards taut sprang to the weatherside of the deck and swayed away catching a turn under a belayingpin the moment the sail was up it almost set itself and by bobs careful management it was filled and drawing without a single flap which would at that moment have insured its destruction the effect of the exhibition of this mere shred of canvas was such a material acceleration of speed that we were no longer in any great danger of being pooped but on the other hand we were now rushing with the greater impetuosity down upon the dangers which i had too much reason to fear awaited us ahead indeed i had abundant confirmation of these fears within the next halfhour for we soon afterwards dashed past an extensive reefover which the sea boiled and seethed with terrific violenceat so short a distance that but for our slight alteration of course when the foresail was set we must have plunged headlong upon it to add to my anxiety it still continued thick as ever rendering it utterly impossible to see above a cables length or two at the utmost on any side of us so anxious did i at last become that i was on the point of resigning the helm to bob that i might go below to consult the chart and ascertain as nearly as i could our exact position when suddenly directly ahead appeared a wild waste of boiling foaming surf swirling seething and leaping high in the air where it became instantly dissipated in the form of a dense driving mist i glanced wildly to port and to starboard vainly hoping i should see clear unbroken water on one side or the other though we were already too near the breakers to escape them but far as the eye could penetrate the dense atmosphere on either side stretched the remorseless breakers and in another minute we were among them on first catching sight of the broken water i had pointed to the companion in which ella still stood and bob seeing the action caught my meaning in a moment and with rather scant ceremony thrust the poor little girls head below and drew the slide close over at the same instant i thought i detected a spot where the sea was breaking somewhat less madly than elsewhere and i gave the cutter a strong sheer to starboard that we might enter the surf at that point it being my opinion that then lay the deepest water i had no hope of escaping but the instinct of selfpreservation asserted itself as it always will and prompted me to avail myself of even the slenderest and most doubtful chance in our favour the cutter heeled violently down burying her lee gunwale halfdeck high in the seething water and i thought for a moment that she was going over altogether with us the foresail jibed with a loud flap and blew clear and clean out of the boltrope and at the same instant the water lily plunged wildly into the boiling surf i braced myself for the shock which i expected would instantly follow accompanied by the crashing in of the poor little crafts timbers but she did not touch the water tumbled on board forward aft everywhere and bob and i were frequently standing waist deep and still the cutter rushed furiously on all my efforts and energies now being directed to keeping as much as possible in those parts where the sea broke with least violence after the first halfminute or so finding that we did not strike hope faintly revived within me especially as the cutter suddenly shot into a belt of unbroken water down this channel we rushed sheering now to port now to starboard as we followed its windings the water becoming smoother with every fathom we proceeded i began to hope that our troubles were coming to an end when suddenly the channel took a quick bend to windward and without sail upon the boat it became impossible to follow it selecting as before that part where the surf broke least heavily i was fain therefore once again to let the little lily drive into the white water and the next moment we touched though but lightly another perilous quarter of a mile was run and then the air being rather clearer i saw some distance ahead beyond the now much reduced surf clear water again but there was an unbroken barrier of foam between us and it and from its appearance i greatly feared that the reef rose everywhere in that direction dangerously near to the surface there was not much to choose in the way of a course just then so i steered for the nearest point of the new channel and was just congratulating myself that we should reach it without touching again when we plunged into the thickest of the foam struck heavily and sheered broadside to heeling over so violently that bob lost his footing and his hold together and fell into the sea to leeward the mainsheet was lying coiled upon the deck under my hand and i threw it over to him bodily he fortunately caught it and exerting his utmost strength succeeded in clambering on board again as he did so a huge roller came foaming and tumbling towards us striking our upturned side so violently that it hove us fairly over on our beamends whilst it lifted us clear of the ledge to which we had hung and launched us into the unbroken water to leeward once clear of the ledge the little craft instantly righted and i put the helm hard up we soon paid off and swept away to leeward once more but we were now in a good broad channel with comparatively smooth water and i saw with satisfaction that the surf on each side of us was becoming less and less heavy every minute five minutes might have elapsed perhaps after we last struck when i saw land looming through the haze ahead and soon afterwards we found ourselves clear of the reefs altogetherinside of them that isand floating on the comparatively smooth surface of an extensive lagoon high land now distinctly appeared ahead of us and we shortly discovered that it formed a portion of an island of considerable size the northern end of which lay about three points on our starboardbow towards this point i at once directed the head of the cutter with the object of getting under a lee as quickly as possible and if practicable into a berth which would permit of our careening our poor little craft and examining into the extent of her damage i directed bob to open the companion now as i was fearful that ella might have received some injury when the cutter was hove on her beamends but to my great joy as soon as the doors were thrown back there she was clinging desperately to the ladder terribly frightened but unhurt as she assured me beyond a few unimportant bruises as we neared the northern extremity of the island towards which i was steering we found that it terminated in an almost perpendicular cliff of some fifty or sixty feet in height constituting the northern part of the base of a high hill rising almost to the dignity of a mountain which was thicklywooded almost to its summit and to the very verge of the cliffs close under which we were now gliding swiftly along as my eye ranged over the northern face of these cliffs which we had by this time opened i detected a rather singular break in them at a particular point and curiosity prompting me i sheered the cutter a little closer to get a nearer view of it approaching still nearer it seemed to me that this break extended quite to the waters edge but it was not until we were almost past it that i felt convinced not only that this was the case but that there actually was a bay or cove of some sort inside it this discovery was made barely in time to enable me to jam my helm hardastarboard and just fetch the opening through which in about five minutes afterwards we gently slid finding ourselves in the midst of a deep basin of almost perfect circular form so completely landlocked and with such a narrow and artfullyconcealed entrance that it was not until we were within a biscuitthrow of the rocks that i felt absolutely certain there really existed a passage at all the basin as i have already said was of circular form and i judged it to be about a mile in diameter the entrance was at the most northerly point in its circumference at which spot as i afterwards ascertained by sounding there was nearly forty fathoms of water though the horns or cusps of the encircling cliffs approached each other so closely that it would have been impossible to take even a small squarerigged vessel through without bracing her yards sharp fore and aft and a craft of say a couple of hundred tons could not have been carried through at all at the entrance the cliffs rose almost perpendicularly out of the water both outside and inside terminating in a wedge on either side from this point however they gradually widened away in the form of a gentlyrising plateau out of which two spurs of the mountain sprang one on each side of the basin between these spurs or shoulders lay a ravine which sloped evenly down from the level of the plateau on each side until it terminated at the southern extremity of the basin in a beach of fine sand this ravine lay of course directly ahead of us as we entered and its smooth lawnlike surface swelling gradually upwards towards the mountain in the rear and the plateaus on each side formed a truly lovely picture under any circumstances and especially to us who had within the last hour been battling with a stormy sea its central portion for perhaps a mile in length and a quarter of that width was luxuriantly clothed with the freshest verdure but was quite destitute of trees beyond these limits however the whole face of the country was thicklywooded cocoanuts and bananas being conspicuously abundant the beach ran about threefourths round the basin being broadest immediately in front of the ravine and gradually narrowing away to nothing at about a miles distance on either side at the western extremity of the beach a beautiful cascade tumbled over the edge of the cliff upon a low rocky platform below from whence it dispersed itself into the sea i took the glass and carefully swept the entire ravine with it to ascertain whether there were any indications that the island was inhabited for i felt convinced that were it so this lovely spot would be the first selected as a place of abode but for all that i could see no human foot had ever pressed the soil and i felt encouraged to go close in and anchor though before doing anything else i determined to make a voyage of discovery inland and settle the question as to the existence or nonexistence of inhabitants if it should really prove that we had this lovely island all to ourselves nothing could possibly be better suited to our purpose of careening the cutter for i found by repeated casts of the lead that the water shoaled with almost mathematical regularity as we approached the beach on shooting through the narrow entrance we had found ourselves almost becalmed under the lofty cliffs though the gale still howled overhead so having made up my mind as to the berth in which i would place the cutter i desired bob to get the jib on her and under this short canvas we slid quietly across the basin to our anchorage bringing up in three fathoms we immediately got our boat out and put her together and as soon as she was ready i took a doublebarrelled shotgun and got bob to put me ashore leaving him to take care of ella and the cutter and telling him that in the event of anything transpiring to render his assistance necessary i would fire both barrels quickly one after the other and not otherwise if a distant view of the country was attractive it was upon a closer inspection perfectly enchanting everything having the appearance rather of the happiest effects of landscapegardening than of an unaided effort of nature the ground which from a distance appeared almost too regular for perfect beauty i found to be finely broken and on each side as i walked up the ravine were constantly recurring elevations and declivities ornamented with fine clumps of tropical trees besides the cocoanuts and bananas i found plantains figs breadfruit pineapples superior in size and flavour to any that i had ever before met with and a large variety of other fruits with the names and qualities of which i was unacquainted innumerable birds of the most beautiful plumage sported among the trees and a few of them sang very sweetly but for the most part the sounds which they emitted were quite unlike any that i had heard before i saw no traces of animals or reptiles great or small and none whatever of man i walked quite to the head of the ravine and then turned off to the right with the object of passing round the base of the mountain but after an hours walk i found that i had my labour for my pains for i came out upon the edge of the cliff on the northwestern side of the island and now discovered that at that spot it not only extended for some distance to the southward but swept round the northern base of the mountain inland rising sheer like a wall for quite a hundred feet after searching unavailingly for some time for a point at which it might be possible for me to pass i was obliged to give it up and retrace my steps reaching the head of the ravine once more i now struck off to the left with the intention of passing round to the eastward another walk of about an hour during which my progress was much impeded as it had been on the opposite side by the dense undergrowth and i came out upon a small platform on the extreme eastern side of the mountain this platform terminated on my left at the edge of the cliff and ahead it gradually narrowed until there was barely room for a man to pass and not then unless he had remarkably steady nerves for on the right rose a perpendicular precipice and on the left was the cliffedge with the lagoon nearly two hundred feet below from my present position i was now able to see that this ledge was the only available point of passage from the northern to the southern side of the island unless one chose fairly to scale the mountain which i was convinced would be a work of considerable difficulty on account of the thickness of the bush or undergrowth along this narrow ledge then i proceeded to take my way and after a perilous journey of half a mile came out upon safe ground once more half an hour afterwards i reached the southern side of the island and clambering with considerable difficulty to the top of a precipitous knoll i obtained an uninterrupted view of the whole southern side of the island it extended from the point upon which i stood a distance of quite twelve miles running nearly due north and south and was divided pretty evenly by a ridge or spur of the mountain which passed down its entire length the island varied considerably in width being irregularly shaped somewhat like a diamond or lozenge with numerous bays and creeks on its western side but none whatever on the east it was well wooded throughout and presented a magnificent parklike appearance i had brought my most powerful glass with me and from the commanding elevation upon which i stood i now carefully swept the entire island as far as the range of my glass permitted but without detecting the slightest trace of inhabitants greatly gratified at the perfect security which this promised i now retraced my steps as the sun which had burst through the clouds was by this time approaching the horizon and in about a couple of hours i found myself once more on board the cutter where i was joyously welcomed by my companions who had both begun to feel very uneasy at my prolonged absence of course i did not fail to take back with me a plentiful supply of fruit upon which we regaled ourselves luxuriously after a late dinner during which i gave a detailed report of my explorations so satisfactory was this that my companions were both delighted when i announced my intention of remaining there for a sufficient length of time to careen and examine the cutter and as this would of course necessitate the taking of everything movable out of her it was arranged that we should commence our work next morning by riggingup a couple of tents on shore in which to take up our quarters until the cutter was once more ready to receive us volume two chapter v attacked by savages when i awoke next morning the sun was just appearing above the cliffs which bounded our basin on its eastern side the sky was cloudless and the tradewind had once more resumed its supremacy sweeping in a gentle breeze over the treecrowned summits of the cliffs though down in the basin we only felt the mildest zephyr calling bob who was still sound asleep i proceeded to the deck to enjoy the balmy freshness of the morning and await his appearance and as soon as he joined me we both jumped into the boat armed with soap and towel and directed our steps to the cascade which was hidden from our present berth by a slight projection of the face of the intervening cliff when we arrived at the spot we found that instead of falling sheer from the top of the cliff to the bottom as it appeared from the basin to do it was arrested at several points in its fall by which the force of the descending water was so much broken that i thought we might safely venture to place ourselves beneath it and thus obtain a most magnificent showerbath the rock upon which it fell had gradually been hollowed away by the action of the descending water and presented the appearance of a gigantic shallow bowl of nearly thirty feet in diameter brimfull of the purest crystal water which gushed away over the western or lower edge into the sea the depth varied regularly from a few inches round the edge to about three feet immediately under the cascade and the whole formed a most princely bath we lost no time in stripping and plunging in when after indulging in a thorough ablution i ventured upon the shower experiment the shock was tremendous and as much as ever i could bear but its after effects were delicious i felt braced and strengthened refreshed and ready for anything but more especially for a good breakfast which of course we found awaiting us in due course when we returned to the cutter as soon as the meal was over ella packed up the washing she was so anxious about and i put her and bob ashore the latter trudging happily along by the side of his lighthearted companion and bearing her bundle on his shoulder i then returned to the cutter hove up the anchor and ran her in under her jib until she gently took the ground when i set about mooring her stem and stern to the beach with warps made fast to stakes firmly driven into the sand bob soon returned and we then unbent the mainsail struck the topmast cast adrift the boom and gaff and ran in the bowsprit and unrigged it and then transporting these spars and all our sails to the beach we rigged up a couple of small but comfortable enough tents into which we transferred our several belongings and such necessaries as we expected we should require during our short experiment in camp life we at the same time availed ourselves of so fine an opportunity as was now afforded us to thoroughly air our spare suit of sails it took up the entire day to clear the cutter of everything ballast included and even then we were compelled to leave our large watertank on board from sheer inability to get it out of the craft without breaking up her deck which of course we could not think of doing we succeeded however after a great deal of difficulty and trouble in shoring it firmly up close to the deck beams having first of all of course pumped all the water out and this left us sufficient room to get at the ballast though with none to spare with everything out of her the cutter floated a good three feet lighter and we at once hauled her in as close to the shore as she would come so as to work at her if need be without the boat simply standing in the water the next morning we ran our anchor the necessary distance away out to seaward broad upon our starboard beam brought the cable on board and hooked it to the throat halyards taking a good look first of all to our shore fasts it was easy work heaving her down for the first halfhour but as soon as we got her fairly down upon her bilge we obtained an idea of how stiff the little craft was even without an ounce of ballast in her we hove and hove until everything cracked again and i really was afraid at one time that we should either spring the mast or carry its head away altogether but we succeeded at last in getting her past the point of greatest resistance without meeting with any casualty and after that she came down pretty easily an hour and a half of hard work saw us at length with the cutter keel out and an anxious scrutiny of her bottom immediately followed to our intense satisfaction we now saw that she had struck on both occasions on that portion of her keel which was loaded with lead two dints in the metal being distinctly visible one was very trifling the other was a jagged notch of some five inches in depth the lead being bent upwards and outwards to starboard in a kind of lip beyond these there were no other injuries even of the slightest kind visible at least on the port side and the copper was as unwrinkled as the day it was put on halfanhours work with the hammer put the keel completely to rights again and whilst i busied myself about this bob employed himself in diligently scouring the copper and would not be satisfied until he had made it almost as bright as gold i had very great hopes that we should find the starboard side in an equally undamaged condition but we determined whilst we were about it to make our overhaul complete so as soon as dinner was over we swung the craft and hove her down again and soon had the gratification of finding our hopes confirmed the copper on the starboard side of course received its due share of scouring for the sake of uniformity and about an hour before sunset the tackles were eased up and the little craft floated on an even keel once more with her slight damages made good and everything in as perfect condition the ordinary wear and tear excepted as when she came out of the builders hands the next day was devoted to a thorough cleansing of the little crafts interior fore and aft so favourable an opportunity not being likely to offer again until after our return to england unless indeed we really should prove fortunate enough to find our treasure but she required it even now so we gave it her finishing off with a coat of paint before leaving her for the night we unscrewed all the deadlights in the deck took off the skylighttop and left the companion wide open so as to ensure a thorough draught through her this answering the double purpose of drying the paint and removing its objectionable odour the following day saw us as busy as ever getting things back into their places filling up our water etc but we did not strike our tents that day a stronger smell than was quite agreeable still remaining from the new paint to fill up our time therefore we turned to upon our firearms and gave them a thorough cleaning up so that they might be in perfect order and ready for service at a moments notice we were up betimes next morning and after our matutinal bath and a good breakfast dowsed the tents got our spars on board and in their places bent the sails and put the few finishing touches which were necessary to make the cutter all ready for sea once more this done it was time to see about finding a way out from among the numerous reefs which girt the island as we believed entirely round we had come through or rather over them once it is true but it was in a fashion that i should have been very sorry to see repeated and on that occasion we had no choice but as i had no fancy for the little crafts again scraping such rude acquaintance with the rocks i resolved to take the boat and make a trip in her along the western side of the island in search of a safe channel to sea accordingly bob and i got the light spars and sails of the boat out rigged and stepped the former bent the latter and then we all sat down to an early dinner it was my original intention to have gone away alone but ella begged so hard to be allowed to come with me that i had not the heart to refuse her especially as there was no sufficient reason for so doing so i consented promising her that after our exploration was over if time permitted she should have a ramble on shore on the southern side of the mountain when we would lay in a seastock of fruit at the same time bob said he would accompany us and try his luck with the fishinglines whilst ella and i took our proposed stroll and to this also there seemed no objection as the cutter was in a berth where the hardest gale that ever blew could not have endangered her safety in the slightest decree accordingly as soon as the meal was over we shoved off some instinct prompting me at the last moment to take one of our revolving rifles and a small supply of cartridges with me we soon slid out of the cove and shortly afterwards rounded the northwestern extremity of the island this was the first trial of our slidinggunter mainsail upon our singularlyconstructed boat and bob and i were thrown into perfect raptures at the truly marvellous speed with which it propelled the craft along the water lily was wonderfully fast but in smooth water and light winds her boat would have sailed round and round her we skimmed rapidly along the edge of the western reef and when we had run about four miles to the southward found a good wide break which looked as though it led out to sea i up with the helm at once and away we darted almost dead before the wind down through it it was rather a circumbendibus sort of affair and somewhat narrow in places though everywhere there was sufficient room to work the lily in and after a run of about half an hour we shot out between two overhanging ledges the extremities of which showed about six feet above water and found ourselves rising and falling on the long swell of the open ocean so far so good and we now hove about to retrace our steps i noticing as we passed in between the two ledges i have mentioned that the rock instead of being of coral formation appeared to be composed of a lavalike substance and i then became confirmed in an impression which had crossed my mind once or twice before that this island was certainly of volcanic origin and that the mountain had once been the crater of an active volcano and the conformation of the summit seemed also to suggest this for it did not taper away to a cone but appeared to form a flat tableland of some extent this however might perhaps have proved on inspection to be hollow the flat appearance of the top resulting merely from regularity in the height of the crater walls in about an hour after reentering the passage through the reef our boat grounded gently on the beach on the western side of the island i leaped ashore and assisted ella to land desiring bob as i shoved the boat off into deep water again to meet us in the bay which i expected he would find behind a low headland which lay about three miles to the southward of us ella took possession of my arm now quite as a matter of course without waiting for me to offer its support and together we sauntered leisurely along in the grateful shade of the trees and giant plants with which we were surrounded for the first halfhour or so we had eyes for nothing but the varied beauties of nature which lay spread before us in such luxuriant prodigality the forms of the trees and plants were for the most part new to us but all were beautiful and the occasional glimpses of scenery which presented themselves through unexpected avenues made glorious by the adornment of all these varied forms and colours in foliage and flowers and enlivened by the presence of thousands of birds of brilliant plumage darting through the air like living gems seemed like an absolute realisation of fairyland or eden time passed swiftly away with us in the enjoyment of so much loveliness especially as we made frequent pauses to admire at our leisure some more than usually bewitching scene and i was in the act of remarking to my companion that bob would certainly think we were lost in the woods when she exclaimed in a startled voice oh harry there is an animal of some sort following us i have noticed the bushes moving rather strangely behind us once or twice already but i did not like to say anything fearing you would think me foolish and nervous but this instant i distinctly saw a dark object glide swiftly behind that large aloelike shrub with the beautiful purple blossoms that we stood admiring so long an animal i exclaimed impossible darling you must surely be mistaken no animals are likely to be on an island like this how could they ever have come here unless provided with wings that i cannot say she replied but i am convinced i was not mistaken stay here a moment then said i i will go back and see whether any creature really is lurking there as you seem to think oh no harry dear please do not she exclaimed i feel so dreadfully nervous though i know it is very foolish but it has startled me and i shall not feel at ease again until we are in the boat let us hasten forward as rapidly as possible please for i cannot enjoy the walk any longer come then said i we will go on at once and since this animal is behind us you had better walk on a pace or two ahead of me we now stepped briskly forward my companion evidently suffering from a violent attack of nervous agitation i did not believe she had seen anything and imputed her feeling to the rather depressing sense of solitude which one is sometimes apt to experience when wandering in a thicklywooded locality nevertheless i took the precaution to glance at my rifle and satisfy myself that all its chambers were loaded and also to verify the locality of my cartridges we had proceeded in this way perhaps five minutes and had just emerged from among the trees upon an open lawnlike level of green sward which sloped gently to the beach there about half a mile distant when something hissed close past me and the next moment i saw an arrow quivering in the earth a few yards beyond savages i exclaimed and i felt my blood curdle and my heart sink like lead for a moment as i realised the dreadful nature of the danger to which my poor little darling was thus suddenly exposed i turned abruptly but could see no sign of a living creature near and with such cheering words as i could find for the moment i urged ella to hasten her steps towards the open where i should be upon more even terms with the enemy poor child she needed no urging she would have taken to headlong flight had i not restrained her for i felt certain that such an action would immediately be followed by a perfect shower of arrows were the savages in force we had not advanced half a dozen yards before i felt a sharp stinging sensation in my left arm it was pierced by an arrow i looked round again but the foe remained invisible and there was nothing for it but to push on the next instant three or four more long slender shafts hissed past us confirming my fears and increasing my apprehensions for my companions safety she saw that i was wounded and would have stopped to render me assistance but time was valuable now and moments as precious as years would be under other circumstances so i only urged her to press forward as fast as she could without actually running on we sped and again came another flight of arrows one of which pierced me in the fleshy part of the thigh whilst two passed through ellas flowing skirts but happily without doing the dear girl any injury i suffered a few moments to elapse and then suddenly faced about bringing my rifle to my shoulder as i did so and there in the centre of the path between the trees which we had just quitted knelt a savage upon one knee in the act of drawing his bow i was always very fond of shooting and had acquired the reputation of being a good snapshot among the rabbits and my skill now stood me in good stead the kneeling figure was instantly covered i pulled the trigger and he leapt convulsively to his feet staggered forward and fell upon his face i had no sooner fired than some twenty natives sprang from their cover and ran towards us they seemed i thought to have seen firearms before for their advance was made with the confidence of those who know that their enemy has just emptied his piece but they were about to make the acquaintance of a new and terrible weapon of the properties of which they were doubtless hitherto ignorant levelling again i fired at the foremost and then quickly turned my piece upon one close beside him the reports rang out sharp and clear one close upon the other and both the savages fell their companions paused an instant in evident surprise and that pause proved a serious if not fatal matter to a fourth whom i immediately afterwards brought down this was too much for them they saw that to stand exposed to view was to court death and with a yell of disappointed rage they sprang back into cover i instantly profited by this retrograde movement on the part of the enemy to make a push for the beach hoping that bob would hear the rifleshots especially the double report which i had arranged with him on a former occasion should be a signal of warning or a call for assistance and hasten to the rendezvous which was now clearly within sight or would be as soon as uncovered by an extensive screen of bush which lay a couple of hundred yards on our right i also reloaded with all dispatch the emptied chambers of my rifle with which i hoped to be able to keep the savages at bay until we were fairly afloat once more but the fight was by no means over yet for we had not gone far when a shower of at least thirty arrows flew about us from a point on our left showing that the savages were following us up under cover evidently with the intention of heading us if possible i was wounded thrice by this discharge one arrow sticking in the back of my neck and causing me the greatest uneasiness a second lodging in my left shoulder and a third completely piercing the calf of my leg i succeeded in removing some of these annoyances by thrusting them right through the flesh breaking off the heads and drawing out the broken shafts but those in my neck and shoulder were firmly imbedded in the muscles and i found i could not remove them without some sort of surgical assistance ella had fortunately escaped again and as soon as i had rid myself as far as i could of the arrows we pressed on once more i keeping as much between my companion and the cover of the foe as was possible the poor girl was nearly fainting with terror but she made a brave effort to keep up her spirits and really behaved wonderfully well there was now a pause of a minute or two in the attack and this enabled us to reach a point where we were not only nearly out of range of the arrows but where we were also enabled to get a clear view of our goal we passed beyond the cover of the intervening bush and there lay the beach with no less than fifteen canoes drawn up on it they were of various sizes some large enough to carry perhaps thirty men others not capable of accommodating more than four or six the headland i had indicated to bob lay about a mile on our right but the boat was nowhere to be seen fortunately there seemed to be no one left in charge of the canoes and i at once made up my mind to take the smallest if i could succeed in gaining the beach and push off in it and finish the fight afloat trusting that bob would yet arrive in time to lend us his aid in effecting our escape i told ella in a few hasty words what i intended directing her to get into the smallest canoe the moment we reached the beach and then lie down flat in the bottom of it we hurried forward for increasing weakness and an occasional swimming of objects before my sight warned me that my strength was rapidly failing with the blood which was trickling from my wounds i had just communicated my intentions to ella when i saw something passing swiftly along beyond the low point which formed the northern extremity of the bay which i knew at once to be the head of the boats mainsail and presently she shot clear of the land and headed well up for the very spot where the canoes lay the savages no doubt saw her too for a shower of arrows was immediately let fly at us but by this time we were out of their range a second shower followed but with no greater success and then with a savage yell at least a hundred blacks sprang forth into the open apparently determined to prevent our escape i at once faced round for though we were beyond the reach of their arrows they were by no means beyond the reach of my bullets and quickly levelling my rifle i took deliberate aim calling on ella to make the best of her way to the canoes as i did so covered the nearest savage and fired without lowering the rifle from my shoulder i quickly selected another mark which in my haste and eagerness i missed hitting a man close behind him however so that my shot was not thrown away then another and another and a fifth this checked their rush and a sixth shot stopped them altogether my rifle was now empty i glanced over my shoulder and saw that ella was within a few yards of the canoe i had indicated and that bob was coming up at a rattling pace so i suddenly dropped the rifle from my shoulder and turned and ran for the beach as fast as my now rapidly failing strength would permit reloading as i ran this as i expected proved the signal for a general chase the savages rushing after me two feet to my one uttering the most terrific cries and yells brandishing their clubs and spears and sending an occasional arrow after me i was soon unpleasantly informed that i was once more within reach of their missiles one of the arrows entering my left shoulder and piercing the shoulderbone a second sticking in my left arm close to the former wound and three entering my right leg almost simultaneously taking effect about six inches above the knee i still staggered on however and in about two minutes more which spread themselves out to the length of ages in that exhausting and agonising race i reached the canoe in which ella had already placed herself as i had directed i had succeeded in reloading all six chambers of my rifle and i now turned to open fire upon my pursuers once more in the hope of checking them long enough to get the craft afloat as i did so the whole earth appeared to rock and heave about me my eyes became dizzy and my sight failed so that i could see nothing but a vast dark crowd of savage faces scowling upon me and surging to and fro before my reeling vision into this heaving crowd i discharged the contents of my rifle rapidly but without any attempt at aim and then turning and flinging the nowuseless weapon into the canoe i concentrated all my fast fleeting energies into one supreme effort to launch her i faintly heard bobs shout of encouragement and earnestly prayed that he might succeed in saving my darling i felt that i was lost and as the cheering cry rang across the water i threw myself with all my weight against the light craft which was already half afloat braced myself against the stem and felt her move a spear at this instant pierced me in the back but its effect for the moment was but to stimulate me further and with another violent effort i succeeded in getting her fairly afloat i saw or fancied i saw the boat within a few yards distance and bob in her with a rope in his hand ready to heave and plunging heavily into the clear cool sparkling water i gave the canoe one final desperate outward impulse and at the same moment felt a crashing stunning blow at the back of my heada million stars seemed to dance before my darkening eyesa momentary feeling of the intensest agony surged through my brain and i sank insensible into the ankledeep wavelets which came rippling merrily up to the shore ellas despairing shriek ringing in my ears as the last faint glimmering spark of consciousness faded away when consciousness at length returned it was accompanied by a sensation of almost unendurable agony from my numerous smarting inflamed and stiffening wounds and to this was added the torture of a burning thirst i was lying completely naked upon the scorching sand a few yards distant from the waters edge whither i had been dragged apparently for the purpose of being stripped of the poor spoil of my clothing the sun now nearing the horizon poured his fiery beams full upon me still further increasing the tortures from which i was suffering but i believe that to this circumstance alone am i indebted for my preservation from death for the glowing rays dried and hardened the blood as it oozed from my wounds and thus prevented my bleeding to death to my great surprise i was entirely alone the sand around me was impressed with numerous footprints from unshod feet and on looking more intently about me i saw that they had all left me in the direction of the beach and the canoes were gone this circumstance excited within me anew the direst apprehensions for i had not the slightest doubt that the savages were away in pursuit of the boat and i every moment dreaded to see her reappear and to hear the triumphant shouts proclaiming our enemies success but the moments laden with excruciating mental and bodily torture wore slowly away and nothing appeared to disturb or break in upon the solitude which surrounded me and now urged by the desire for a cooler spot i sought to drag my agonised frame from the burning sand to the cool fresh verdant greensward which was but a few yards distant slowly and writhing at every movement with the keenest anguish i crawled foot by foot upwards along the beach and at length after half an hour of intense torment sank utterly exhausted upon the utmost verge of the grasscovered plain my exertions caused all my wounds to burst open afresh and i now became aware that i had received several in addition to those inflicted in the fight these last being doubtless the result of wanton cruelty and savage delight on the part of my enemies at finding me in their power but i was still as far as ever from the means of slaking my burning thirst for there was not a drop of fresh water within miles of me as far as i knew and had there been my strength was by this time so completely gone that i could not have crawled another halfdozen yards to save my life or even to quench that thirst which was now to me almost worse than death stern stubborn endurance was therefore my only resource and i sank back upon the cool grass to await in bitter helplessness the death which i felt must soon come to my relief i now relapsed into a state of semiconsciousness my thoughts wandering away from my present condition and fixing themselves with strange pertinacity upon subjects of the most trifling import now plunging into vague speculations and anon indulging in all sorts of fantastic fancies as fever began to assume its burning sway over my tortured frame from this state i was aroused by hearing a joyous shout in the tones of bobs wellremembered voice and raising myself with difficulty only to sink back in utter feebleness i caught a momentary glimpse of the boat in the act of grounding on the beach in a few brief seconds more ella and bob were beside me the former raising my head upon her knee and gazing into my face with an expression of the fondest pity and concern as her fingers swept the hair gently off my forehead wet with the clammy dew of suffering bob too knelt at my side uttering expressions of sympathy and encouragement expressed as usual with true nautical figurativeness of speech seeing that i was conscious however he speedily changed his discourse and informed me that it was necessary i should be immediately removed for though he had succeeded in decoying the whole of the savages away in pursuit of the boat and had led them to such a distance as to admit of his evading them and returning in search of me they were still in chase and no time must be lost in getting away from the present spot and returning to the cutter or we should again be brought into dangerous proximity with them having explained thus far therefore he at once proceeded to raise me in his powerful arms and though he did so with the utmost gentleness the agony attending the movement was so intense that i swooned away when i recovered we were afloat and under way standing off with flowing sheets for the headland i have mentioned as forming the northern extremity of the bay ella was seated on the boats platform or deck with my head in her lap and was bathing my face and neck with her pockethandkerchief wetted from a pannikin of water which stood by her side and which was supplied from a small breaker we had brought with us as soon as i opened my eyes the dear girl bent over me and asked with the tenderest solicitude whether i felt any better yes darling i answered but for the love of mercy pray give me some water i am dying for want of it she handed the pannikin to bob who immediately filled it my eyes drinking in in eager anticipation every cool sparkling drop of the precious liquid as it gurgled crystalclear out of the bunghole of the breaker the next moment the pannikin was drained to the bottom and i was craving for more oh what a delicious draught was that to my parched and burning lips and throat surely the man who first dreamed of nectar must have been thinking of water clear and cool tasted under similar circumstances to those in which i was then placed my thirst at length temporarily assuaged ella once more resumed the bathing of my wounds tearing up the skirt of her white cotton dress to bind them up with afterwards i begged her to desist alluding as delicately as i could to my naked condition and the shock to her modesty which it must occasion and assured her i could and would wait until we reached the cutter when bob would have leisure to attend to me and enact the part of surgeon i know what you mean harry love she answered but do not feel any distress on my account i am i trust as truly and perfectly modest as any woman living you will never have the slightest reason to complain of me in that respect and you know dear that to the pure in thought all things are pure and i can look as i have already looked upon your naked body without one thought save that of sorrow and deepest pity for the cruel wounds with which it is covered my modesty is not of the spurious kind which would cause me to turn away my face and hide it with simulated blushes leaving those gaping wounds to remain uncared for and i hope you will not think the worse of me if i say that i intend not only to dress every one of them now but as often as they require it until with gods blessing you are completely restored and am i not your promised wife that alone and apart from any abstract question of humanity is sufficient to justify my resolve in my own eyes as i trust it will in yours dearest bob is well enough he is a dear old fellow in many ways but utterly unfitted to exercise the delicacy and care and ungifted with the lightness of touch necessary in your case besides it is womans peculiar province towhat are you smiling at ah i know you are laughing at what you have styled my pet phrase but never mind i am rejoiced to see that you can smile at anything in the midst of your pain my poor darling we were by this time rounding the point and the savages had been visible some five minutes about three miles to the southward paddling away most furiously so bob said in the vain hope of overtaking the swift boat it was not a very long journey from this point back to the cove in which the water lily was lying and in about three quarters of an hour we were alongside to transfer me on board and below was a most painful operation and i again swooned away soon recovering however under ellas gentle ministrations to my surprise i found she had caused me to be placed in her own cot forward a proceeding against which i at once protested as strenuously as my feeble powers would allow dearest dearest harry said she leaning over me and pressing her quivering lips passionately to mine do not i pray you exhaust yourself and distress me by saying a single word you are far better here than you would be in your hammock there you would have no room to turn whilst here you have plenty there it is close and stifling hot whilst here there is a cool and refreshing draught from the open decklight and here too i shall have more room to move round and get at your numerous wounds to dress them and here i can remain at your side and watch you constantly whilst i could not do so very well in the other cabin without turning poor bob out of it altogether but said i i protest against your devoting yourself to me so completely as these arrangements imply you will be ill not another word harry she interrupted stopping my lips with a kiss i will not listen to it i am already your wife in the sight of god and he knows that no wife can love more fondly than i do so in this dreadful time i shall perform all a wifes duties towards you dearest as in that way only is there any hope of saving you you are now still under the influence of excitement and do not know the extent of your injuries but you will find all that out byandby when you become more calm and then you will need the most vigilant watching and the utmost care to save you from sinking under the effects of exhaustion oh ella what can i do to repay you for all this i exclaimed deeply moved by the dear twirls devotion live harry she replied passionately live my dearest recover and bless your poor little ella with such love as her heart now feels for you but this will never do she added quickly and with a powerful effort to regain her selfcontrol i must lose no time in getting these dreadful wounds bound up for they are all bleeding afresh and remember i forbid you to speak another word it was time for i was so utterly exhausted that i felt doubtful whether i should ever recover so i lay passive whilst ella tripped about procuring basins of warm water bathing my wounds and binding them up carefully and tenderly with soft lint and ample bandages i had heard bobs heavy tread bustling about on the deck above for a short time but i now missed it and endeavoured to inquire where he was gone this however my nurse would not permit assuring me that i should learn all that it was necessary to know in due time and when i was stronger and better able to listen the work of dressing my injuries was a long and tedious one for i had no less than seventeen wounds in different parts of my body the most serious of which were the spearwound in my back and three close together in my right breast the blow at the back of my head the arrowwounds in my neck and left shoulder where the weapons had been dragged violently out lacerating the flesh terribly no doubt when i was stripped and a spearthrust in my right thigh which completely pierced the limb and seemed to have severed some important artery from the quantity of blood which gushed from it and deluged the bed on which i lay it was quite dark or as dark as it could be with a full moon riding in cloudless beauty overhead before the painful task was over but the soothing effects of the bathing and the bland and cooling properties of the ointment applied to my smarting wounds were such that i soon felt at ease and free from pain compared with what my condition had been an hour or two before and i sank into a feverish doze in the midst of which i still remained conscious of the frequent application of cool wet cloths to my burning brow and of the constant moistening of my parched lips with a cool refreshing beverage of some kind gradually i dropped off into a sounder sleep from which i awoke but once in the night to find my gentle nurse halfsitting halfreclining in a chair beside my cot fast asleep with one soft round arm encircling my neck and her fair head resting on the pillow close to my own volume two chapter vi important news the next day i was in a raging delirium and for nearly a week did i remain utterly unconscious of all that surrounded me entirely engrossing the attention of my companions and taxing their energies and ingenuity to the utmost to prevent my leaping out of the cot or doing myself some injury in the unnatural strength and violence of the fever which burned within me at length their unremitting care and watchfulness were rewarded by seeing me fall into a deep sleep in which i remained all night and until the next morning was far advanced and when i awoke reason had resumed her sway i knew them both and could answer their affectionate inquiries by a faint pressure of the hand or a feeble whisper but beyond this i had no power to go ella poor child looked terribly pale and careworn as well she might for i afterwards learned that during the whole of that fearful time she had never once lain down to rest such sleep as she had been able to obtain being snatched at uncertain intervals in a chair by the side of my cot bob had of course insisted sturdily and stubbornly on performing his full share of the watching but my poor little darling could not even then tear herself away though she was able to do but little beyond supplying my incessant demands for water it being utterly impossible during the whole time to renew any of the bandages and now ensued the terrible state of exhaustion and utter prostration consequent on my great loss of blood and the fever which had so long been devouring me i had not strength even to raise my hand without assistance and as to turning myself i might as well have attempted to fly for nine days did i thus lie hovering between life and death my weakness being such that my wounds had to be dressed one at a time and at intervals and the very pressure of the sheetthe only cover it had been possible to throw over me from the time that i was first brought on boardseemed almost more than i could endure at length however the assiduous care and ceaseless attention which were bestowed upon me had their effect and i began to rally and the turningpoint once passed soon mended rapidly the moment that my recovery seemed at all probable bob got the tents rigged up ashore again and one fine morning when i appeared a little stronger than usual and seemed able to bear the removal i was transferred to the boat and thence to the shore where my own hammock carefully slung and provided with clean linen awaited me the change from the confinement of the small cabin to the tent the fresh and balmy air scentladen from the adjacent groves and above all the view from the open end of the tent of the clear sparkling water gently ruffled by the passing breeze with the treecrowned sunlighted cliffs on either side did more for me than the most skilful doctor or the most potent drugs could have effected and i felt that i was drawing in new life with every inhalation i now slept much and soundly the effect no doubt of the fresh cool air which was freely admitted to the interior of the tent and when i was not sleeping i was generally eating ella exerting all her ingenuity which was great in the concoction of light tempting dishes to provoke my languid appetite bob too was indefatigable in his exertions in my behalf now ranging the woods with his airgun in search of a species of pigeon which he had discovered anon going away in the canoe in which ella had escaped and which he had contrived to retain to the rocks and bringing in sundry delicatelyflavoured fish and then off to the woods again for fruit of which the island afforded any quantity of various kinds as i progressed toward recovery so did ella regain in a measure her former cheerfulness of manner which intense anxiety had greatly subdued and now that she was once more able to take her natural rest the roses speedily returned to her cheeks and her eyes began to resume their former brightness at length the day arrived when i was considered strong enough to listen to bobs story and be made acquainted with all that had occurred since the disastrous afternoon of our walk on the south side of the island you must know he began that as soon as i left you and your precious little dearie here ashore i went straight away back to the channel and anchored the craft in a bit of a nook in the first reach where i thought as i should find some sport well i didnt get so much as a nibble and at lastwhether twas the heat of the sun or what twas i cant tell yei dropped clean off to sleep how long i slept i cant say but i was woke up by the tugtugging of the line which id made fast with two or three turns round my finger i started to haul in and had got my fish very nigh out of water when he broke away and i lost him i was just baiting my hook afresh when i thought i heard your rifle and i fancied id overstayed my time and that you was firing a signal to jine company so i rouses up my killick and makes sail and whilst i was doing it i hears two reports one close upon tother i guessed at oncet that something was amiss so i crowds all sail upon the craft and steers as straight as she would go for the pint whilst i was running down towards it i fancied i heard a shout though i couldnt be sure but you may depend upon it i was now pretty anxious to get round the pint and see where you was and what was going on as soon as i cleared it i sees you and dearie hurryin towards the beach as though somethin was amiss but what it was i couldnt at first make out until i seed the blackies jump out of the bushes and then i knowed at once what a reglar fix you was in i seed ye fire at em lad and bring em up with a round turn and my fingers was just all of a itch to be alongside of ye with one of them same revolvin rifles in my fist though im ater all no great matter of a shot well i seed ye run and i seed the little lady here step into the canoe and lie down and then in course i knowed what you was after so i shapes a course accordin you knows what follerd lad but you dont know and i cant tell ye what i felt when i saw ye struck down almost within reach of my arm and dragged away by them incarnate devils it seemed to me as though every mothers son of em was fighting for the first blow at ye and i give ye fairly up for lost sartain but there warnt much time for thinkin for some of em started to launch their canoes at oncet in chase of dearie here and i only had jist time to sheer alongside and take the craft in tow when they was afloat and ater us i stood away to the southard hardly knowing what i was doin and soon ran away from em hand over hand i was getting little miss here out of the canoe into the boat the best way i could for shed fainted when the idee comes into my old head that if i could but entice the whole lot of em to chase me i might lead em far enough away to give em the slip and run back and get your bodyfor i never doubted but what you was dead so i goes forard and lets run the mainhalliards and down comes the sail accidental like the niggers gives a shout as soon as they sees this and i hauls my wind as though i couldnt go no further to leeward without my mainsail and sure enough the trick answered to perfection for the whole posse of em comes scurryin down to the beach launches their canoes and shoves off paddling like mad to the southard to cut me off all right my hearties go it says i but says i you havent the pleasure of knowin a sartain robert trunnion says i if you supposes as youre going to circumvent him that away so i lets em come well up with me and the nearer they got the louder they yells and the harder they paddles and you might ha thought by the row that all hell had broke loose as perhaps it had or them devils wouldnt ha been there well id got the mainhalliards led aft to where i was sittin and as they closed i gently sways the sail up a few inches at a time and keeps gradlly away until we was all spinnin away dead to the southard they paddlin like fury and i just keepin far enough ahead to be out of range of their harrers wed run i spose a matter of four knots when i sees that the reef sinks lower and lower below the water and by the time that we had gone another couple of miles there was unbroken water all over it so i edges easily away to the westard they following till wed got an offing of about four miles from the shore and there was a tidyish jump of a sea for em to paddle agin though i knowd twould make no matter of difference to the boat and then i gives the tiller to the little lady whod come round agin goes forard and hists the sail full up and then hauls sharp up and goes about keeping as straight away for the bay agin as i dared for the reef the devils set up another yell at this and round they goes like tops heading about east to cut me off but i soon seed as they was pretty well done upfor id kept em paddlin all they knowed in the hopes of coming up with meand i felt satisfied as id be able to get back in time to get your body and be off agin afore they could overhaul me well you knows that part of the story too so it needs no telling directly you was in your cot i rouses the gun out of the cutter into the boat takes a goodish lot of cartridges shot and shell with me and out i goes agin fallin in with the rascals just off the norwestern end of the cliffs they was hugging the shore pretty close and i was dreadful afraid as they knowed the cove and was bound in there so as id loaded the gun afore starting i just gives em a shell right into the thick of em and that seemed to sicken em all at once for they ups helm and away they goes faster even than theyd come and i ater em the first thing i did was to get between them and the land and as soon as they seed that there warnt no chance of gettin ashore and takin to their cursed woods agin away they all goes helterskelter for our passage and directly they was fairly in it i heaves the boat to loads the gun agin and ater em once more for i was determined that id drive em fairly out to sea and then blow em all to hell where they come from andto make a long story shortthats just what i did lad bearing down upon a canoe until i couldnt miss her and then plumping a shell into her at one eend and out at tother i tarred the whole lot with the same brush except one little craft with only four hands in her and she i chased clean out to sea altogether givin em a shot close past em as a freshener of their energies just as i hauled my wind and if ever they gets back to their own country wherever tisill bet my life theyll never be for coming to this here island agin such was bobs story and such the end of the adventure for though we remained at the island nearly seven weeks we never saw any further signs of savages in about a month from the date of the adventure i had so far recovered as to be able to hobble about a little a few yards only at a time and then i began to regain strength rapidly by the end of the following week i was able with the assistance of bobs strong arm to get as far as the cascade every morning and take a bath and this too helped me on wonderfully towards entire convalescence my wounds had closed and were by this time so far scarred over that i was able to dispense with all dressing and bandages and we began to talk about making another start finally arranging to do so as soon as the new moon attained her first quarter which would be in another fortnight it was i believe on the sunday following this arrangement that bob set off the first thing after breakfast to attempt an ascent of the mountain he having discovered as he believed a spot at which an active man with good nerves might surmount the natural impediments which existed near the base i cautioned him to be very careful for our sakes as well as his own for i was still too weak to afford him any very effectual assistance in the event of a mishap and a broken limb halfway up the mountainside would have been death to him just at that time ella and i were of course society for each other and we wandered about the lawnlike ravine and reposed at frequent intervals beneath the grateful shade of the trees in blissful oblivion of the passage of time waiting quite contentedly until master bob chose to rejoin us which he faithfully promised he would in time for dinner at length however the position of the sun in the western heavens warned us that the hour named was long past and i proposed a walk as far as the head of the ravine hoping to meet the truant returning we walked slowly my strength not yet being sufficient to permit of very active exertion and by the time that we reached the point aimed at the entire landscape was flooded in the lovely pinkypurplish haze which immediately precedes sunset still no bob made his appearance and i began to grow seriously alarmed we waited another halfhour and then just as the sun was about to disappear in the purple western wave and we had made up our minds to return to the cutter thinking he might possibly have passed down the ravine on its opposite side he made his appearance to my surprise he seemed singularly uncommunicative and we could get but little out of him beyond the fact that he had with very great difficulty reached the summit and found my conjecture as to its being an extinct crater correct he thawed a little during dinner and volunteered the information that he had seen land far away on the southern boardnearly or quite a hundred miles distant he supposed and had seen the loom of land to the westward or about westnorthwest and also to the northward he was of opinion he said that our late enemies had come from the land seen to the southward and were bound north touching at our island on their way on some marauding excursion as he had been able completely to sweep the island in every direction from the commanding elevation of the mountaintop and had detected no sign whatever of niggers in any direction with this he dropped the subject and adverted to my condition questioning me solicitously unusually so i fanciedas to how i felt the extent of my strength where we had been and what we had seen he was particularly curious on this latter point and asked the same question so repeatedly that ella made some laughing remark i forget what upon it and he carefully avoided any further repetition of it for the remainder of the evening at least as long as ella was with us when at length she retired to her own tent for the night however he became more communicative i was already undressed and in my hammock and he was sitting smoking beside me and after a silence of some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour during which he seemed to be ruminating deeply he began ive something to tell ye lad said he knocking the ashes contemplatively out of his pipe as he spoke but dash my ugly old wig if im at all sartain that i ought to say anything about it tonight seeing as it cant do much good and might only be upsetting of ye for the night but your heads better nor mine in matters of this sort and i confess i should like to have your idees upon the subject afore i sleep maybe theyll in a way mark out a course upon which my idees can travel a good bit of a way betwixt this and morning and even that muchll be an advantage gained the fact is that ive seed something as i didnt expect to see whilst i was away up aloft there pointing with the stem of his pipe backwards over his shoulder toward the mountainand the sight has disturbed me a little and set me thinkin a good deal indeed said i what have you seen bob you must perforce tell me all about it now for you have excited both my curiosity and my apprehensions not much need for the last boy i hope and believe answered he but its best perhaps as you should know at onceso without any further palaver the albatross the pirate brig is inside the reef and is lying at anchor at this very moment in the bay where you was so near losing the number of your mess the albatross exclaimed i nonsense bob surely you must be mistaken is it not some whaler think you come in to water no no said he its no whaler harry whalers wouldnt come so far within the group as this here island and when did ye ever know me mistaken about a vessel as has given us such good reason to remember her as this here brig i knowed her the minute i set eyes on her firstly by a patch in her foresail as you might ha noticed the last time we see her nextly by the shape of her maintopmaststaysail and thirdly and lastly by the whull look of her which enables a seaman to recognise a ship in the same way as one of your longshore folks recognises an acquaintance in the street when they see him though he may be dressed exactly like a score of other people within hail and whats more i can make a pretty near guess as to whats become of that whaler that he went ater when he found we wasnt to be had for i see hes got three of the chaps whaleboats to replace the two as was expended in our little trifle of a brush no doubt this is important news indeed said i and news that provides matter for very serious reflection what do you suppose has brought them in here bob did you see anything by which you could form an opinion yes replied he i did want of water may be one thing but its my idee that theyve come in here to give their craft an overhaul for theyd no sooner let go their anchor than they outs boats and one watch pulls ashore and turns to building huts on the green whilst tother watch sends down tgallan yards and masts and unbends the sails and sends em all down on deck then they are likely to make a pretty long stay said i and in that case we may be discovered at any moment that theyre likely to stay here some time ill not deny returned bob but i dont feel particlar oneasy about bein discovered its like enough as some on em may take the fancy in their heads to scale this here bit of a mountain but ive made it my business to give the place a reglar overhaul this aternoon and the thing cant be done from the southardnot without ladders that is and good long uns at that and ive found out too that though you may get round to tother side of the mountain from here you cant get down to the level ground beyond i never see such a place its nothing but precipices one atop of tother and theres one place i come to which one man might defend agin just as many as ever like to come ater him by just standin behind a sort of wall in the cliff and shoving of em over the edge as they tried to get round it no no you make your mind easy on that pint lad we aint to be got at except tis by water and i reckon theyll be all too busy to spare a boats crew to come the length of this and if they did its a thousand chances to one that theyd never find the openin into this here cove why i run past it myself the day as we brought you in here wounded and id never have found it if i hadnt knowed just where to look for it so its my opinion as we may stay here quiet and comfortable enough so long as weve a mind to and then when were tired of waitin we can slip out quietly in the night and nobody be any the wiser so much for that now for an idee thats come into my head and that i cant get rid of noways wouldnt it be a pretty trick to sarve these chaps if we was to take the brig and carry her out to sea under their noses leavin of em here to amuse themselves the best way they could it would be a pretty trick indeed i replied if it were possible but at this moment i cannot see how it is to be done the difficulties in the way of its accomplishment are too many for only a couple of men to overcome were we halfadozen or even four we might perhaps do it but we could never get her out clear of the reefs by our two selves besides before we could get the canvas on her they would be alongside of us in their boats even if the watch which they will of course leave on board were overpowered i dont reckon as theyll keep much of a watch aboard her where shes lying returned bob shes as safe as if she was in harbour not moren a mile from the beach and on the leeside of the island and as to gettin her out youve only to stand to the southard under foreandaft canvas and its my belief as shed fetch out clear of the reef from where shes lyin in one tack you recollect as i told ye that the reef dipped as it went to the southard well its my opinion as thered be water for her over it by the time she was far enough south to make it worth while to think about heaving of her about thats the road as she came in by if that is the case perhaps it might be done then if we could contrive to gain possession of their boats first of all said i but what is to become of the cutter in the meantime ive no fancy for leaving her here to fall into their hands and to speak the truth now that she has brought us so well thus far i should like to finish the voyage in her no if such a thing were attempted at all it would be attended with the utmost risk and could only be successful in the event of our being able to steal on board and the cutter is not suitable for such service but ill tell you what has just occurred to me there is just a bare possibility of our being able to steal on board in the canoe some dark night and set fire to the brig and then come back here get the cutter under weigh and be off at once but this even can only be done in the event of there being no one left on board at night and this i consider very unlikely thats the plan exclaimed bob with enthusiasm burn the craft afore their eyes and leave em to get off in their boats if they like not so said i if this scheme is undertaken at all i should certainly do it effectually take their boats away and burn the brig and here they must remain prisoners for a considerable time at least for this island is quite out of the route of all honest craft ourselves perhaps excepted better and better still exclaimed bob in high glee now i never should ha thought of that because somehow it seems cruel and unnatral like to burn sich a beauty of a craft as that there brig but its the proper plan haltheres no doubt of that we two couldnt take care of both the brig and the cutter in anything but the very finest of weather and its better to burn the craft beauty as she is than that them villains should misuse her to rob and murder honest seamen and do worse to their wives and darters curse em i shant forget in a hurry that poor young thing as we see lying dead in the cabin of that american ship and id burn the finest craft as ever was launched afore they should have the chance to commit another sich a piece of devilish villainy now harry lad mind me we do this here little piece of work youve got hold of the eend of the right coil of idees and i can see as your hearts set upon it and i robert trunnion am the man asll back ye up in it through thick and thin and theres my hand upon it you get well and strong as fast as you knows how and ill go aloft there every day and keep my eye upon em all day long and see what tis they intends doing and the first chance we has mark me the jobs done now lets blow the light out and get a good nights sleep upon it bob suited the action to the word and in less than ten minutes i had auricular evidence that as far as the sleep was concerned he was carrying his precept most thoroughly into practice on the following morning as soon as breakfast was over bob and i set off up the ravine my companion providing himself with our best telescope a few biscuits and a flask of weak grog as it was his intention to remain on the summit of the mountain the entire day watching the motions of the pirates unless he happened to see anything rendering an earlier return advisable i did not feel quite so easy in my mind as bob did with regard to the chances of a boat being detached to examine the island and in such an event of our cove escaping detection so i arranged with him that if he observed anything of the kind he was to fly his handkerchief from the branch of an isolated tree which grew on a small projecting platform near the summit and which was quite visible both from the cutter and the ravine but was hidden by the mountaintop itself from the pirates and i decided that if the signal were displayed i would convey ella to the spot he had spoken of on the previous evening as capable of being so easily defended and would then return to the cutter try the effect of a shell or two upon the boat if she appeared within the cove and afterwards if need be retire to the place of ellas concealment and make a stand there in furtherance of this arrangement i got bob to show me the spot which i found on personal inspection to be fully as impregnable as he had declared it to be and i also ascertained as he had done that it was quite impossible to get round the mountain by land we then separated bob making the best of his way up the mountainside and i returning to the shore loading myself as i went with the finest and choicest fruit i could find i was met about halfway up the ravine by ella and we both strolled quietly back to the beach together my fair companion following my example and loading herself with fruit when we reached the beach i set about striking the tents and got the sails spars and lighter articles back on board the cutter as there was now no knowing at what moment it might be necessary for us to be off and this task in my then weak condition occupied me the greater part of the daygetting them on board that is and putting the spars in their places rigging them and bending the sails by the time that i had finished everything was back into its old berth with the exception of about a couple of canoeloads of heavy articles which might be run on board in twenty minutes or half an hour and then we should be ready to start at a moments notice i even contrived to take our tubeboat to pieces and stow her away below though the tubes gave me some trouble in getting them inboard but i managed this at last by parbuckling them up over the side with the aid of the throathalliards of course i kept a strict watch on the tree near the summit all this time but no signal fluttered from it so i assumed that they were all too busy on board the brig to make explorations relying on their numbers for safety in case of an attack or else that whatever explorations might be afoot were being conducted by land at length everything was done that my unaided efforts could effect and then taking ella on shore with me in the canoe i set out for another walk up the ravine in quest of a little more fruit to complete our seastock i was rather anxious to take as much of this as possible to sea with me for i have always held the belief that the fruit which flourishes best in any particular climate if partaken of in moderation is beneficial to the health whilst breathing the air of that climate ella expressed her surprise once or twice during the day both at the somewhat abrupt manner in which our encampment on shore was broken up and at bobs sudden predilection for so unsailorlike an amusement as mountainclimbing but i answered her carelessly anxious not to alarm the dear little girl by acquainting her with the fact that we had unexpectedly acquired such very undesirable neighbours near the head of the ravine i was fortunate enough to come upon a bananatree laden with exceptionally fine fruit and i succeeded in possessing myself of two noble bunches of bananas which had arrived at exactly the right condition for cutting each bunch was as heavy as i could well lift and having got them to the ground without bruising any of the fruit i cut a strong stake and placed it with a bunch at each end fair in the pathway which i knew bob would take on his way to the beach feeling certain he would know why it was placed there and would bring it down with him we then returned cutting a few splendid pines and gathering a little breadfruit and a few figs as we went and paddled back to the cutter where ella and i remained fully occupied with each other until it was quite dark when just as the little fairy was on the point of going below to see to the tea i heard bobs hail and jumping into the canoe i soon joined him on the beach well harry said he as i drew the light canoe up a foot or two on the beach it seems that you havent been noways idle whilst ive been aloft there spying into the inimys movements i hardly knowed what to make of it when i first found the tents struck and most everything gone but im glad in one sense that matters is so far forard though im sorry in another for im greatly afeared youve been working hard and have tired yourself and theres just a chance of our havin our hands full of work tonight i stumbled over these here bananas as i was coming down the ravine and brought em along as i spose it was intended i should just so i answered now let me hear the result of your days observations i have amused myself as you see in getting as many of our things as i could back into the cutter for i felt that in the present condition of affairs it may be imperatively necessary for us to be off at a moments notice but i do not feel very much fatigued i am picking up strength rapidly and my experience of today has shown me that i am stronger than i really thought i was there are a few things still lying about here which were rather too heavy for me singlehanded but when these are on board and stowed away we can be off at any moment so much the better returned bob lets get a few on em into the canoe to oncet and whilst were working i can be telling ye what ive seed from my perch up aloft there it wont take very long in the telling in the first place two boats has been right to the south eend of the island they went away full o men and landed all hands excepting a couple of men in each boat and while the shore party was reglar beating the woods the boats paddled slowly back keepin close in shore to take their shipmates off in case of anything going wrong at least that was my idee then i soon made out that another party was working their way to the norard from their camp giving this eend of the island a overhaul i seed em often crossing the open country between the different clumps of trees and was able once or twice to hear faintly their shouts to one another this lot would ha made me very oneasy hadnt i give the place such a complete overhaul myself no latern yesterday for they seemed to be bent on getting up the bit of a mountain and stood off and on this way and that as though they wouldnt be beat but they had to give it up at last and go back though i make no manner of doubt as theyve pretty well decided to come this way with a boat tomorrer and finish their surwey of the island so much for the shore gang theyre all back in their camp by this time and if they dont sleep without rocking it wont be for want of walking and shouting and hollering and let me tell ye lad its no joke to be fighting your way through thick bush for hours at a time as most of them chaps have been doing this blessed hot day now as to the brig its my opinion as they means to careen her just as weve done with our little barkie theyve been working like galleyslaves aboard there all day and have stripped her to her lower masts the sails are all gone ashore for i saw em lowered over the side into the boats with these same two goodlooking eyes of mine but the spars is still aboard theyve been striking out cargo wholesale and to my mind in a most lubberly unseamanlike fashion if it had been me now i should ha built a raft with all the spars and rafted the things ashore but theyve done everything with their boats maybe howsever its valyable stuff and they didnt care to trust it to a raft it was amost all boxes and bales of all sorts and sizes the pickings of many a good ships cargo ill warrant now i reckon that ater the work as this lot has got through today theyll sleep pretty sound too so its my idee that we aint likely to have a much better chance for playin our little trick upon em than we shall have tonight theyre all as tired as tired can be you may take your oath upon that and theyll sleep without any fear of savages for the reason that theyve give the island a pretty thorough overhaul without findin any and tomorrow it may be too late for if so be as they comes this way in a boat it wont do for us to be found here and the chances is that we shall have to cut and run for it without doing em a farthingsworth of harm ater all the sails all being took ashore knocks my little plan for carryin the brig off clean on the head even if her spars was aloft to set em on which theyre not so i spose we shall have to burn the pretty little craft if were to do anything at all now what say ye lad simply that whatever is to be attempted must be attempted tonight i replied the reasons for doing so are too obvious to need enumeration so we will get our few traps on board have tea and then snatch what rest we can between this and midnight when we must be stirring again i would give a great deal to see this brilliantly starlit sky overcast but we must take things as we find them and only use the greater precautions now i think we have as much in the canoe as she will safely carry so lets shove off we can come back for the remainder after tea and mind bob not a word of this before ella trust me for that returned bob let the little dearie turn in and get her nights rest ondisturbed by any anxiety on your account we can slip off quietly at the right time without her bein a bit the wiser and itll be soon enough to talk about this here job when weve done it we were by this time close alongside and no more was said everything was got out of the canoe and stowed in its proper place and we then went to tea getting the remainder of the goods on board and stowing them away immediately that the meal was over after which bob stretched himself out on the lockers below and went to sleep whilst ella and i remained on deck until about ten oclock i was glad when the dear girl wished me goodnight and left me for i could not but feel that praiseworthy and righteous as was our proposed adventure it was one which most seriously involved her safety and wellbeing closely knit with ours as her fortunes were and i could not conceal from myself either that we were about to run a tremendous risk ignorant as we were of what the camp arrangements of the pirates were and i wished to have time to reflect calmly upon all the risks we ran and the best possible means of avoiding them before setting out everything would depend upon whether a watch were set on board the brig or not bob was strongly of opinion that they left her to take care of herself at night but i thought otherwise volume two chapter vii destruction of the albatross i remained on deck until midnight in anxious selfcommunion and then slipping off my light canvas shoes went below and quietly aroused bob he instantly arose and accompanied me noiselessly and barefooted to the deck we had no tools or implements of any kind to hamper us my sole provision for the expedition consisting of a couple of boxes of matches which with our sharp knives and a bottle of grog i considered was all that we needed i confess that my heart throbbed a little more rapidly than usual as our paddles dipped in the water and the light canoe shot away from the cutters side but it was from a feeling that i was at that moment leaving perhaps for ever and to a terrible fate one whom i loved more dearly than my own life and that too without one word of farewell rather than from personal apprehension i left a hastilyscrawled note in pencil on the cabintable to the effect that we had occasion to go away for a short time but hoped to be back in time for breakfast in case we should be delayed longer than we anticipated but this was all as soon as we were fairly out of the cove i communicated my plans to bob impressing upon him all my arrangements in case of contingencies requiring an alteration in my original plan for as soon as we were fairly at work everything would have to be done as far as possible in absolute silence and i did not wish to leave any explanations for a moment when perhaps a single word incautiously uttered might lead to our betrayal we paddled on close under the cliffs and in about half an hour reached the spot where the sandy beach on the western side of the island commenced here we gently grounded the canoe laid our paddles cautiously and noiselessly in lifted the craft far enough up on the beach to prevent her floating away and then keeping as much within the shadow of the trees as we could made the best of our way along the beach to the low point already mentioned as forming the northern extremity of the bay which had witnessed the fight with the savages and in which the pirate brig now lay at anchor there was no moon at this time the young crescent having set some hours before but the night was brilliantly starlit and though the light thus afforded was an assistance in one way it was very much against us in another materially increasing our chances of detection half an hour of rapid walking brought us to a point where i thought that by striking inland we might contrive to cut short across the neck of land forming the junction of the headland with the main so to speak and now the utmost caution became necessary i warned bob to avoid everything which had the remotest likeness to a branch or twig of any kind the sudden sharp snapping of which would be sure to attract attention i thought though the air was filled with the chirping of millions of night insects of all kinds at length we caught sight of the pirates bivouac and almost at the same instant saw a figure rise from the ground stretch itself wearily and throw a pile of branches upon the dying embers of the fire this showed that hard as their work of the previous day might have been here was one wakeful individual at all events among them and upon him we kept our anxious gaze intently riveted watching his every motion with the closest scrutiny we saw him walk to the outside of the circle beyond the limits of the feeble light from the nearly extinguished fire and peer earnestly into the darkness on every side going all round the circle and making the same careful inspection outwards in every direction and lastly he walked down towards the beach far enough to satisfy himself that the boats which we could just discern were all right when he returned flung more wood on the fire and then sat down close to windward of it out of the way of the smoke filled his pipe and lighted it of course we took very good care to conceal ourselves effectually whilst this patrol of the camp was being made and i embraced the opportunity to point out to bob that all the boats seemed to be anchored at a few yards distance from the beach excepting a small punt and she was drawn a foot or two up on the sand the fire now began to blaze up brightly and i thought this a favourable moment to proceed for whilst it afforded us a sufficiency of light to enable us to avoid such obstacles as roots of trees and twigs and branches of shrubs it would dazzle the eyes of the lonely watcher and effectually prevent his seeing anything beyond a few yards distant i accordingly pulled bobs sleeve to attract his attention and pointing to the punt intimated to him that she must be our first object of attack we now both rose to our feet once more and stealing as rapidly forward as we could taking advantage of every little bit of cover that offered to pause and reconnoitre for a moment reached after about twenty minutes of breathless suspense the halfstranded punt to our infinite chagrin there were no oars in her and without these we could do nothing we now commenced a hurried consultation in cautious whispers as to what had better be done keeping a wary eye upon the sleeping camp and its solitary watcher all the while whilst we were doing this i suddenly caught sight of a pair of short oars which i knew in a moment must belong to the punt reared against a tree in the very midst of the bivouac and in the full light of the now brilliant fire and within view of the watching seaman i saw it was absolutely necessary that we should have those oars so i pointed them out to bob and directed him to remain perdu whilst i made an attempt to secure them i then set off down the beach until i was far enough away to be able to walk across the open and into the shadow of the bush without being seen which i succeeded in doing once there i commenced a stealthy approach putting each foot carefully and noiselessly to the ground and not venturing to raise one until the other was firmly planted in this manner i contrived to make my way onward unobserved and at last gained a cover behind the trunk of the tree against which the oars were standing i now took as complete a survey of the bivouac as i could without exposing myself and counting heads i found that there were no fewer than eightythree sleeping pirates within a few yards of me in addition to the man on watch he appeared to be just at the moment either in a fit of deep abstraction or a doze so without waiting for a better opportunity i cautiously reached my arm round the treetrunk grasped one of the oars and brought it round to my own side without so much as the rustle of a leaf emboldened by my success i now tried for the second which i also succeeded in securing taking an oar in each hand i at once proceeded to retrace my steps and for the first stage aimed at getting behind a tree which stood only about three yards distant i soon reached this spot and on slipping behind the trunk and taking a hasty glance backward i was greatly alarmed at seeing the pirate on watch on his feet looking intently in my direction and shading his eyes with his hand i at once concluded that i had been seen and waited in breathless expectancy for the shout which was to raise the entire crew upon me but instead of this i heard after a short pause the voice of the man in soliloquy close to the tree against which the oars had been placed its damned odd i heard him mutter but i could have sworn that them paddles was standin up agin this here tree halfanhour ago what the hells become of em surely none of the chaps is slipped off to have a yarn with old steve he wont thank em for disturbing of him at this time o night and rousing him out from between the guns where ill lay anything the old dormouse is snugly coiled away instead of looking ater the brig as is his dooty ill just slip down to the beach and see if the boats is all right i crouched down behind the tree and peeped cautiously round the bole and there sure enough was my watchful gentleman sauntering down towards the boats i allowed him to get far enough away to prevent his seeing me if he suddenly turned round and then quickly made my way along the edge of the sward keeping within the shadow of the bush until i thought i was far enough away from the fire to permit of my cutting straight across to the punt as soon as the man was once more out of the way i achieved this before the pirate reached the beach and then stood anxiously watching for what might befall i did not fear for bob i knew that his eyes had been taking in everything which happened from the moment i left him and i felt quite satisfied that he would not spoil our game by running any risk of discovery the pirate walked quietly on and at length reached the punt looked into her probably for the missing oars and then turned round and walked back again he had not advanced halfadozen paces before i saw him waving his arms violently i thought i heard a stilled cry and then he fell heavily to the ground and i saw another figurebobskneeling over him i at once started off as fast as i could run taking the oars with me and in about five minutes i stood by my companions side he had got the man down on his face and was busy lashing his arms firmly behind his back i forthwith assisted and between us the unfortunate pirate was soon so securely bound hand and foot that it was impossible for him to move he cant sing out whispered bob for ive stuffed my hankercher as far down his throat as i could get it and have made all fast with a turn of his own necktie through his jaws with a reef knot at the back of his head hes safe enough till morning so it appeared and we therefore left him with perfect unconcern to his fate lifted the light boat and carried her into the water until she was afloat and then stepped noiselessly into herbob taking both oars whilst i sat in the sternsheets ready to take possession of the other boats they were moored at but a very short distance from the beach one of them being anchored and the rest hanging by their painters in a string astern of her bob backed the punt gently off until i had got hold of the painter of the anchored boat which i easily raised there being only a small boatanchor attached to its end this i carefully placed in the stern of the punt in such a position as to afford a secure hold and then taking an oar apiece we pulled noiselessly and as quickly as we dared direct off shore with the whole fleet of boats in tow astern of us i considered that we were safe when we had attained an offing of halfamile for i thought it very unlikely that the pirates would then attempt to overtake us by swimmingthe only means of pursuit they now hadeven if an alarm were given but everything still remained perfectly tranquil and continued so until we had rounded the low point so often mentioned after which of course we were unable to see anything which transpired in the bivouac we decided to take the boats five in number besides the punt over to the mouth of the channel and anchor them there until we could pick them up again on our way out in the cutter and then go back after our canoe so as to prevent the possibility of her falling into the hands of the pirates whilst doing this bob volunteered an explanation of his motives for attacking the pirate i seed all you done harry he observed and thought as everything were going right until that fool of a feller took it into his head to come down to the beach i stowed myself away as well as i could under the quarter of the puntbut if his eyes hadnt ha been choked up with sleep he must ha seed me howsever he didnt and when he turned round to go back thinks i it wouldnt be a bad idee to put a stop to them wanderin habits of yourn thinks i we should be in a pretty mess if you was to come down agin afore wed got fairly off with them there boats and almost afore i knowed what i intended to do id crept up behind him and flung my arm tight round his neck with my knee well into the small of his back and down he comes he tried to sing out but the minute he opened his mouth i rammed my handkercher down his throat and that kept him as quiet as a mouse and so hes like to be till morning when i reckon hell find hisself just about in the centre of a hobble with these here boats all gone and the brig afire fore and aft please god dye think i did right lad excellently i replied nothing could possibly have been done better now here we are and there goes the anchor now lets stretch away as hard as we can for the canoe we have been longer than i bargained for over this business and we shall have daylight upon us before we are finished if we do not look sharp i now told bob what i had heard the pirate say and that from his remarks i gathered that old steve was the only man left on board the brig i arranged with bob that he was to answer in the event of the said old steve hailing us as we went alongside and directed him what to say as bobs phraseology was habitually seasoned far more highly with nautical slang than was my own and he would therefore be less likely to be suspected in the carrying on of a haphazard conversation than myself we soon reached the canoe which lay just as we had left her and taking her in tow we pulled away at once straight for the brig in half an hour we reached her and contrary to the pirates surmise old steve proved to be pretty broad awake boat ahoy hailed he as we approached ay ay answered bob is that you steve in course it is replied that worthy who the hell are you and what do you want off here at this no time o night whisht returned bob warningly belay all that you old sinner theres no need to let everybody know as two friends has brought ye off a bottle of grog and a bit of queerish kind of news heave us a ropesend will ye for its that dark that hang me if i can find anything to make fast this here boats painter to ay ay answered steve look outhere ye are but who are ye at all i cant make out your woice damn me if i can and whos that with ye not make out my woice retorted bob no i spose you cant and i aint surprised at it neither considerin the bushels of smoke as ive swallered from that fire ashore and the thousands of muskeeters as has flied down my throat so thats all right heres the grog old cock steve leaned over the bulwarks and seized the grog and bob and i both climbed the brigs side at the same instant in another moment steve was on his back with bobs knee and his whole weight on his chest and i was soon busy securing the prisoner with a piece of the rope which was lying about in any quantity on the deck this was quickly done and the man gagged with a belayingpin after which we made a rapid tour of the deck cabin and forecastle and satisfied ourselves that there was no one else on board to dispute or interfere with our actions we decided to set the brief on fire in three placesforward aft and in midshipsand we lost no time in making our preparations we found a lot of old sails in a locker at the fore end of the forecastle and these we divided taking away a sufficiency to kindle a good rousing fire in the hold and over these as soon as we had deposited them in a suitable position as well as over those remaining in the locker we poured a few buckets of tar from a cask we found abroach on deck we had no fear about the craft not burning well for she had a large quantity of combustible materials of all sorts in her hold and we hastily made as large a heap of these as we could so as to ensure her effectually taking fire we then went into the cabin and piled the bedding from all the berths upon the floor heaping the chairs and table upon it and pouring a copious libation of tar upon the whole we then put a light to it staying long enough to see the mass burst into fierce flame when we rushed on deck and i dived into the hold whilst bob went into the forecastle where we quickly kindled our respective heaps and then as quickly returned to the deck thin clouds of smoke already poured up through the various openings of the deck promising speedy and effectual destruction to the brig so we had now nothing to do but get away from her and return with all speed to the cutter steve was lowered over the side into the punt bob and i followed and we at once pushed off for the cove in the highest glee at having so successfully carried out our daring scheme daylight was just breaking as we pushed off and by the time that we entered our cove the sun was above the horizon we dropped the punt and canoe astern and the sails being all bent and loose i having made every possible preparation for an immediate start whilst waiting for the hour at which to set out upon our raid we were under way and standing out of the cove in ten minutes more bob got our big gafftopsail on the craft as we ran down towards the passage and i kept a bright lookout for any signs of alarm in the pirate camp the camp itself we could not see of course but i expected to see men moving about on the shore nor was i disappointed for i soon descried a knot of figures standing upon the low point which was the nearest land to the brig watching in apparent stupefaction the progress of their vessels destruction the brig was by this time almost enveloped in flames and had the entire crew been on board they could then have done nothing to save her we were quickly discovered of course and great was the confusion which our appearance seemed to excite but i cared nothing about thatindeed it was a part of my programme that the pirates should know to whom they were indebted for their present disaster very shortly a crowd of men appeared hurrying along the beach in our direction and as we bore away for the passage they saluted us with a straggling musketry fire more in impotent anger than for any harm it could do us for the shot all fell very far short when about a quarter of a mile from the entrance to the channel i hove the cutter to and we hauled the punt alongside took out one of her oars and cast steve adrift from his lashings leaving him to get ashore to his comrades as best he might with one oar we then filled away once more and ran down upon the boats took them all in tow and stood out through the channel another volley of musketry betrayed the irritation of the pirates at the sight of our departure and the loss of their boats to which bob replied by giving three ironical cheers at this juncture ella appeared on deck wonderfully surprised of course at all she saw and i was at once called on to explain i did so briefly narrating the circumstances of bobs fortunate discovery of the arrival of the albatross at the island of his having watched the crew all the previous day of our plan and of the manner in which it had been carried out pointing to the burning brig as the issue of it all oh harry exclaimed she bursting into tears how could you run such a fearful risk only fancy you two men venturing into the very centre of these dreadful peoples camp and without arms too why what would have become of you if you had been taken really i could almost find it in my heart to be downright angry with you both i cannot understand men a bit they seemsome of themto have been born absolutely devoid of the faculty of perception of danger even when it is staring them in the face and accordingly they rush into the midst of all sorts of perils seemingly with a happy unconsciousness that they are doing so and with a heedlessness as to consequences which is perfectly bewildering nonow do not try to coax me harry for i really am seriously angry with you and to think too of your being up all night weak as you are i am surprised that you are not ill again oh harry with fresh sobs how thankful i am that you are safe and that i did not know anything of this until now and do not look grieved darling i did not mean what i said it was very naughty of me i know but i was frightened at the thought of the risks you have run and how all this might have ended oh mercy what is that a shock as if the cutter had struck upon a rocka dull heavy boom and the fragments of the burning brig were scattered far and wide to come pelting down again the next minute in a perfect shower of charred and splintered wood spars ropes and the thousandandone other matters usually found on board a ship the brigs powder magazine had blown up a heavy cloud of dark smoke marked the spot where the explosion had taken place and when it drifted away before the fresh morning breeze one or two halfburnt timbers floating on the water were all that remained of the albatross ah exclaimed bob who was busy coiling down the various halliards etc ive been expectin that any time this past halfhour and i only wonder it didnt happen afore well thats a good endin to a good job well begun and i reckon them chaps ashore there mays well make up their minds to stay where they be for the rest of their natral lives for theyve neither ship nor boats nor stuff to build em with either i dont reckon theres many trees on yon island thatd be much use in a shipbuildin yard no said i i think we may safely consider that their career of crime and bloodshed is put an effectual stop to for some time at least unless indeed some unfortunate ship should come to the island in which case they would have her to a certainty ay returned bob but thats a very onlikely chance these here islands dont lie in the road to nowhere and it may be years afore they sets eyes on a sail again after they loses sight of that goodlookin topsail of ourn i spose they wont starve there will they lad no said i there is very little fear of that the island yields an abundance of fruit as you know amply sufficient for all their requirements and they have their punt which will serve them to go fishing on the lagoon though she is too small for any of them to venture to leave the island in her so on the whole i think they are quite as well off as they deserve we were by this time clear of the reef and in open water so i went down to breakfast leaving bob at the tiller ella was very penitent for her late naughtiness as she termed it and was so lavish with her endearments to make up for it that i would very willingly have experienced such a thundersquall every day of my life to have the air cleared afterwards in so agreeable a manner when i returned to the deck bob asked me previous to his going below to get his breakfast what i intended to do with the boats and the canoe all of which were in tow i had not thought very much about it but now that the question was put i decided to retain the canoe altogether she was so small and so light that i thought we could easily carry her on deck in anything but very bad weather and ordinarily she would tow very comfortably astern if we could contrive to keep her i thought she would frequently save wear and tear in our tubeboat and where a passage of a short distance across the calm surface of a lagoon from the cutter to the shore was all that was required she would answer the purpose perfectly well as to the boats of the albatross i decided to tow them fairly out of sight of the island and then abandon them thus effectually precluding the possibility of their getting back into their owners hands the prevailing winds there being from about southeast which would drive the boats ever farther and farther from the island we accordingly retained them in tow for the remainder of that day and all next night and cast them adrift on the following morning we were now within two days easy sail of the spot which had been indicated to me as the position of the treasureisland and our thoughts naturally reverted to the question as to whether the treasure really existed or not bob feeling the utmost confidence that it would be found precisely as the dying spaniard had described it whilst i began to entertain grave doubts as to our success the important conversation in which the existence and position of the treasure were revealed was recalled almost word for word and the notes which i had made at the time were frequently referred to and certainly everything seemed to abundantly justify bobs confidence whilst i was quite unable to point to a single word or circumstance tending to confirm my doubts the fact is i suppose that as we drew nearer to our goal and began to realise more fully the vast influence which the possession of the treasure would exercise upon our future i must have been influenced by a feeling that it was too good to be true there was so very decided an infusion of the romantic element into everything connected with the affair that my matteroffact mind refused to accept the possibility that there might be truth in it after all i was young then but i have now lived long enough and seen enough of the world to feel convinced that romance enters so largely into the ordinary circumstances of life that any middleaged man might easily furnish from his own experience materials for halfadozen sensation novels and i believe that no novel that was ever written is half as sensational as would be a minute and strictly true record of the incidents marking the life of such a man i have in my mind at this moment a man whose life and occupation has for many years been apparently of the dullest and most commonplace description to every one but myself he has appeared to be simply a thorough businessman punctual to the minutealmost to the secondmethodical accurate without a thought apparently for anything but business his very conversation being brilliant only on matters connected with business he is in short with those who know him pretty well and even with his own kith and kin about the very last man who would ever be supposed to know anything about romance beyond its name yet circumstances have revealed to me beyond all possibility of cavil or doubt that this man has been the hero of a romance so thrilling so startling so very extraordinary in all its phases that it would indubitably make the fortune of the great sensation novelist of the day forthwith if that gentlemans fortune be not already made but to return to the water lily on the evening of the day following that on which we sailed from the pirates island we found ourselves so near the reputed position of the treasureisland that i decided to heave the cutter to for the night so as to avoid the possibility of running upon the outlying reef during the darkness bob went aloft the last thing after the sun had set and before darkness closed down upon the face of the tranquil ocean but he could see nothing that he was able to identify with certainty as land on the extreme verge of the western horizon he saw he said something which might be an island but evening clouds especially in fine weather and when low down on the horizon sometimes assume such forms and hues that it is very difficult for even the most experienced mariner to decide whether what he is looking at is land or merely vapour particularly when land is known or supposed to exist in the direction in which he is looking we took in our spinnaker and gafftopsail therefore housed the topmast lashed our helm alee and hauled the foresheet over to windward allowing the jibsheet to flow it was my eight hours in that night but it was so close below and the weather was so fine that i brought my hammock on deck and turned in there with a waterproofrug rigged tentfashion over me to keep off the dew nothing occurred to disturb the tranquillity of the night and next morning as soon as breakfast was over we filled away upon the cutter again and made sail upon our course bob should have been in his hammock or taking his rest in some other fashion between breakfasttime and noon but he was so anxious to catch a glimpse of the spot which had attracted us over so many thousand miles of ocean and had led us to brave so many dangers that he could not stay below and he spent the entire morning at the crosstrees on the lookout i obtained a most excellent observation for longitude about halfpast nine that morning and on working it up i found that we were barely twenty miles to the eastward of the point we were aiming for and as we had hove the cutter about at midnight so as to keep her as nearly as possible directly to windward of the spot we ought to have been at anchor at noon but mile after mile was traversed and still no land appeared rearing itself above the horizon and at length the time arrived for me to take my meridian altitude this also was a very capital observation and its result was that we found ourselves exactly where the island was stated to be situated with no land in sight in any direction from the masthead i must confess that in spite of the doubts which had lately obtruded themselves upon my mind i felt keenly disappointed and as for bob he was so chopfallen that he had not a word to say it was not until i had carefully gone once more over my calculations of that day and had verified the error in our chronometer for which i had made allowance and had in short satisfied myself thoroughly that we actually were where we supposed ourselves to be that i realised how strongly notwithstanding my doubts i had relied upon finding the island and its buried treasure so far as the primary object of the voyage was concerned it appeared that it had been undertaken in vain and had it not been for our accidental acquisition of intelligence respecting my father we should now have been without an object for the further prosecution of the voyage excepting that of returning home again as quickly as possible to secure the best berths we could and make up as far as might be for lost time we had hove the cutter to whilst i was taking and working up my noon observation and as soon as we had fully realised our great disappointment i got out the chart and bob and i pored over it for a full hour in the endeavour to fix upon the one island out of the many in the great archipelago which was most likely to be the one upon which the amazon was cast away however there were so many all of which would answer equally well to the imperfect description which we had received that we were at last obliged to give it up and revert to our original resolution of examining all the likely places in the hope that we should be more successful in our second search than we had proved in our first we therefore filled away upon the cutter again upon such a course as would take us up through the thickest cluster of islands and such is the elasticity of the human mind before night closed down upon us we appeared to have almost forgotten everything connected with the treasureisland and thought and spoke of nothing but the chances in favour of and against the finding of my father volume two chapter viii my father as the sun went down the wind fell light and we did not average more than four knots an hour all through the three nightwatches i was at first afraid that we were about to have another hurricane as it is not usual for the breeze to fall so light as we had it just then in the trades but the glass was high and steady and the weather looked settled so i did not shorten sail and when the sun rose next morning he brought the breeze up again somewhat fresher with him it was my eight hours out that night consequently i was on deck when day broke as morning dawned and the obscurity of night yielded imperceptibly before the approaches of the great daygod i became conscious that there was a break in the level of the horizon about four points on my starboardbow and watching this as it continued to grow lighter i found that it was land a small and low island apparently about nine miles distant i was rather surprised at this as according to our chart which was constructed from the most recent surveys the nearest land was fully a days sail distant to the westward i decided to take a nearer look at the place and as this would involve a deviation from the course which the cutter was then steering and would necessitate a jibe i left the helm for a moment with a couple of turns of the tillerrope round the head of the tiller and went forward to take in the spinnaker formerly we had considered it necessary that both bob and i should be on deck when handling this large sail but practice had by this time taught us both how to work the cutter alone so that it was now only on occasions of emergency that either called the other to assist in making or shortening sail as the water lily drew in closer with the land i made out that it was a small coral island with the usual encircling reef and lagoon it seemed to be about two miles long but from the direction in which the cutter was approaching it i was unable to judge of its width i was soon near enough to distinguish the line of surf which betrayed the presence of the surrounding coralreef and i then called bob to come on deck and take the helm whilst i went aloft as usual to look out for a channel when he came on deck why harry hows this he exclaimed i thought you said there wasnt no land within a hundred and fifty mile of us last night and heres as pretty a little spot close aboard of us as a man need wish to set his eyes upon i went by the chart i answered and that showed a clear sea all about here but you can never rely upon a chart here in the pacific what is clear sea at the time that a survey is being made may very possibly be dotted with a score of such small islands as the one ahead in a very few years i have read that coral islands form very rapidly this one however cannot be of such very recent growth for there are fullgrown cocoanuts upon it as well as other trees i am surprised that it is not shown on the chart i said this as i was standing at the foot of the mast and on the point of going aloft in a few seconds more i was standing on the crosstrees and examining the line of surf ahead for the narrow strip of unbroken water which would indicate the existence of a passage through the reef as i stood thus my gaze was arrested by the appearance of a small object in rapid motion across the bosom of the lagoon inside the reef and a scrutiny of a few seconds was sufficient to satisfy me that it was a canoe seating myself upon the crosstrees that i might more conveniently use the glass which i had taken aloft with me i quickly focussed the instrument and brought it to bear with its assistance i was now enabled to discern that the canoe was a craft of about the same size as the one which we had towing astern and it held three persons the two who wielded the paddles were black but unless my eyes strangely deceived me the third was a white man i cannot attempt to describe the extraordinary feeling which came upon me at this discovery can it be possible thought i that this is the island upon which the amazon was cast away and am i about to have the inexpressible joy of seeing my beloved father once more and so unexpectedly as this i again had recourse to the glass and being now somewhat nearer i no longer had any room for doubt the individual who sat in the stern of the canoe and who i now saw was steering the craft with a paddle was undoubtedly white i now observed too that the canoe was passing through an opening in the southwestern edge of the reef the passage would have escaped my notice in the then position of the cutter had it not been for seeing the canoe passing through it for it was broadsideon to us as it were and the unbroken water was therefore not easily detected i turned my telescope upon the island and now saw a thin film of light blue smoke as from a wood fire rising from among the trees but there was no sign of a wreck of any description within view and if anything of the kind existed it must be on the other side of the island the canoe was by this time in open water and i saw that she was paddling along the edge of the reef towards us bob now made her out from the deck and hailed me asking if i saw her i answered that i did and in an uncontrollable tumult of excitement descended to the deck i directed bob to keep the cutter away for the canoe for strangely enough the thought never entered my head that her occupants might be enemies i ran down below and got up our clubensign which i hoisted at the peak and as it blew out in the fresh morning breeze we saw the figure in the stern of the canoe rise to his feet and wave his hat i took up my glass once more and was now able to make out that this figure was tall deeply bronzed by the sun and had grey hair and a thick bushy grey beard that is a white man bob in that canoe said i excitedly a white man exclaimed bob then its the skipper harry for a thousand pounds no such luck bob i am afraid replied i this man is greyhaired and my poor fathers hair was dark brown if you recollect true answered bob but if not the skipper hisself it may be somebody belonging to him that cannot be either i returned for according to the account we received from the seaman there was no one left with him but the chief mate who i presume was winterwho you will recollect was put into your berth when you met with your accident and winter was quite a young manscarcely thirty i believe well whoever it may be we shall soon find out all about him now for we shall be alongside the little hooker in another five minutes remarked bob philosophically but with evident disappointment in the tone of his voice this was true for we were nearing the canoe fast i again had recourse to my telescope and with its assistance was now able to see with perfect distinctness the occupants of the canoe i scanned with the greatest intentness the features of him who was steering and who was facing directly towards us and as i did so in a tumult of the most painful agitation and suspense feature after feature once more became familiar and notwithstanding the grey hair and beard i at length recognised with unspeakable joy my father hurrah i shouted hurrah it is heit is my father bob and we have found him after all and that when we little expected to do so thank god oh thank god amen answered bob taking off his tarpaulin reverently for a moment while the tears rolled down his weatherbeaten cheeks we took room and rounded the cutter to and as she came up into the wind with all her canvas shaking the natives vigorously plied their paddles and with a few lusty strokes shot their light craft alongside i went to the gangway and held out my hand to assist my father in over our low bulwarks whilst bob hove the end of a coil of line into the canoe shouting to the blacks now then darkies look out and catch a turn with this here ropesend will ye for if you goes astarn youll have all your work afore ye to overhaul us and get alongside again good heaven that voicesurely i should know it murmured my father thank you sir yours is the first sail i have seen forwhy how is this i had been unable to control myself any longer and to my fathers infinite surprise he suddenly found himself in my embrace and as suddenly recognised the tones of the voice which called him father i thought the dear old man would have fainted but he rallied himself with a powerful effort though it was some little time before he could speak at length my son my noble boy harry exclaimed he great god merciful father i thank thee for this great and unexpected mercy little did i think my dear boy when i saw your white sails standing in for the island what unexpected happiness awaited me and if i mistake not added he this is my old friend and staunch shipmate robert trunnion this is indeed a happy day for me grasping bobs hand heartily a day i have despaired of ever seeing again but tell me what has happened and how come you to be here in this small cockleshell of a craft you surely cannot have been cast away and have built her yourselves if you have you are wonderfully good shipwrights and how came you to find out that i was here or is this happy meeting the result of accident everything is so surprising that i feel perfectly bewildered you shall know all dear sir in good time i answered the story is too long to be told in a breath let us get inside and come to an anchor and as soon as we are sufficiently recovered from our present excitement to tell an intelligible tale you shall know everything well well so be it answered my father and i suppose i had better play pilot in navigating this seventyfour of yours through the channel what water do you draw seven feet aft i answered and she works to perfection so you will have no difficulty with her so much the better answered my father as it will be rather ticklish work keep her well to windward robert do not go closer than forty fathoms to the southern extremity of the surf and now my dear boy one word more how is your sister well quite well i am happy to say at least she was so when we left england little more than four months ago i answered and so was everybody else in whom we are interested i am delighted beyond measure to hear it returned my father this is good news better than i could have dared to hope now keep her away robert starboard your helmhard astarboard so steady now as you go do you see the opening of the channel steer as straight as you like for it this will be a surprise for winter indeed he is still with you then dear sir said i i trust he is in good health yes i am happy to say he is quite well returned my father indeed we have neither of us had a days illness since we have been on the island i was quite an invalid at the time that the ship was lost certainly but i soon recovered thanks to winters care and good nursing but how did you know of his being with me we learned your whole story from the time of your sailing for home up to the day of your being so shamefully abandoned i replied and that by the merest accident we happened to fall in with one of the men whom you shipped at canton on board a vessel which we boarded on the line on our passage out but here is some one with whom i must make you acquainted dear sir i continued as ellas fair head appeared at the companion i then introduced her to my father briefly narrating the circumstances under which she became a member of our little crew and frankly explaining the relation in which we now stood towards each other when i had finished my explanation my father took the dear little girl by the hand kissed her on the forehead and said a few kind words to relieve the embarrassment and agitation under which it was evident she was suffering and i had the very great satisfaction of seeing that these two beings in whom i was so warmly interested were mutually impressed very favourably towards each other we soon worked through the short passage in the reef and then stood away to the westward rounding the southern extremity of the island very shortly afterwards the moment that we cleared this point and opened the western side of the island bob shouted ah there lies the dear old barkie sure enough look at her harry lad shes sorely mauled about poor old beauty but i should still ha knowed her anywheres as far as these old eyes could see her there indeed lay the wreck of the amazon close to the beach about two miles off and sorely mauled about she was so much so that i greatly doubted whether bob would ever have identified her as our old ship had not my fathers presence and the story we had already heard of her loss assisted him her three lower masts were still standing but the whole of her upper works were gone and i at first supposed that they had been used for firewood until we opened up a tiny bay somewhat nearer us to the southward and saw a small vessel in process of being built on the beach you have established a shipyard here i see sir i remarked as this object came in view yes answered my father but we have made but poor progress so far you will be of the greatest assistance to us my dear boyyou and robert here since you have managed to turn out such a sweet little craft as this cutter i shall be strongly inclined to pull our work to pieces and begin all over again afresh how do you mean sir i inquired you surely do not imagine that bob and i built this cutter did you not returned my father then where did you pick her up she was built on the thames i replied and bob and i have managed to bring her out here between us my father was greatly surprised at hearing this but as we were now approaching the anchorage it was decided to defer all explanations until we could have an opportunity of proceeding with them in a straightforward fashion sail was shortened and in about ten minutes afterwards we dropped our anchor in a pretty little wellsheltered bay within a couple of cables length of the beach and in full view of a neat little cottage constructed of bamboo which stood on a lawn of about an acre in extent environed with beautiful tropical trees and plants winter was down on the beach full of curiosity respecting the newcomers and i will leave to the readers imagination the surprise and delight with which he recognised in them two of his old shipmates the two canoes conveyed all hands of us ashore and my father after welcoming us heartily to his dominions as we stepped from the canoes to the beach gave his arm to ella and with me on his other side and bob and winter following arminarm astern and the two natives bringing up the rear we at once wended our way to the cottage where we found that winter had prepared a sumptuous breakfast in anticipation of our arrival whilst discussing this meal i related at my fathers earnest solicitation our whole story commencing with an account of the wreck on portland beach and of the tale of the treasureisland told by the dying spaniard and then going on to relate how we had been induced by a belief in this story to build and fit out the water lily and sail in her in search of the treasure mentioning in due course our meeting with the seaman who had given us a clue to the amazons fate and of our resolve therefore to search the whole archipelago if need be for the abandoned ones and winding up with an account of our late achievement of the destruction of the albatross and of the consequent imprisonment of her crew upon the island we had so recently sailed from great was the surprise of my father and his companion as i proceeded and frequent their comments and interruptions but at last i got through with it and then of course i became anxious in my turn to hear how matters had gone with my father and winter during their long stay where they now were i have very little to tell replied my father in answer to my questions and that little i should not now be alive to relate but for the unceasing care and attention of my friend and comrade winter here who refused to save himself from a possible lifetime of captivity on this island by deserting his commander he watched me all through a long and tedious illness and under god was the means of saving my life for this happy moment we have never quite despaired of being restored to home and friends but latterly we have felt that our deliverance might be the work of years at first we were kept buoyed up by the hope of being rescued by some passing vessel but though we have maintained a ceaseless watch we have never sighted a single sail from the moment of our first arrival here until you hove in sight this morning all my charts and instruments of every description were carried off when the mutineers left in the boats so that i have but a very remote idea of our actual whereabouts but we must be in a very outoftheway corner of the globe as indeed i now gather clearly from what you have told me our first work after my recovery was the building of this hut and then followed the preparation of a garden a short distance inland from here so that we might secure the means of existence as soon as this was completed to our satisfaction we went to work upon the building of a small vessel but our appliances were so inadequate to the task that our progress has been excessively slow as you may judge when i tell you that we have been at work now fully two years and the craft is yet barely halffinished latterly indeed we have got on somewhat better for the two blackswho as far as i can learn from their signs and the few words of english they have picked up since being with us were blown off their own island in a gale of wind and came ashore here in the last stare of exhaustionhave been of the greatest assistance to us in the mere handling of heavy weights and now that you have joined us i think we may make short work of the remainder of the job i was at first disposed to suggest the abandonment of the halffinished schooner for such she was but on more mature consideration i came to the conclusion that it would be better to finish her on many accountsthe chief of which was that as we now mustered seven hands all told including the blacks whom we could not leave behind we should be uncomfortably crowded on board the cutter and i doubted much whether we could find room to stow away in so small a craft a sufficiency of water to say nothing of provisions for so large a party the day was of course declared a high holiday on the island and after our mutual explanations had been fully given we allthe whites of course that isproceeded to the beach to inspect the craft on the stocks she was a much larger craft than the lily measuring fully thirty tons my father and winter had given a great deal of care and attention to her design and the result was a very pretty model though her lines were by no means so fine as the cutters she was immensely strong owing to the fact that it was less laborious to build in the timbers just as they were taken from the amazon or only with such alterations as were imperatively necessary to bring them to the required shape than it would have been to reduce them with the imperfect tools in the possession of the builders the whole of her framing was set up and secured and the garboard and two adjacent streaks on each side bolted to and that was all i could easily understand as i looked on her massive timbers how great must have been the labour for two pair of hands to bring her even thus far forward and in addition to this there was the pulling of it all to pieces in the first instance on board the parent ship and the rafting of the materials down to the bay afterwards after taking a good look at the craft we shoved off in the canoes for the wreck calling on board the cutter on our way that my father and winter might satisfy the curiosity they felt concerning the little craft which had so successfully traversed so many thousand miles of ocean they were naturally delighted at everything they saw and admired her model greatly but were nevertheless loud in their expressions of wonder at what they termed our temerity in venturing on so long a voyage in such a mere boat a quiet paddle of about halfanhour took us alongside the wreck which lay grounded in about ten feet of water pretty much as she had been left by the mutineers we had no difficulty in boarding a substantial accommodationladder having been constructed to facilitate so frequent an operation there was not much to see when we stood upon her deck the whole of the poop having been removed to furnish materials for the schooner but bob and i naturally felt a deep interest in the ship which had formerly been our floating home and as to whose fate we had for so long been in a state of such painful uncertainty we remained on board about an hour during which ella insisted on having pointed out to her the exact spot which my old berth had formerly occupied and then we returned to the shore and visited the garden which had been formed in a small natural clearing within about a quarter of a mile of the house here we found a goodly patch of wheat almost ready for the sickle a large plot of potatoes which my father said grew but indifferently well in that climate a few other english vegetables some yams and several fruittrees of various kinds including the very useful breadfruit which had been carefully selected and as carefully transplanted to their present position where they had flourished amazingly under the not very efficient gardening skill which had been bestowed upon them by the two recluses of animal food there was no lack the small island being almost overrun by the many descendants of three pigs and halfadozen fowls which the mutineers had in an unaccountable paroxysm of generosity left behind the remainder of the day was spent in a tour quite over my fathers limited dominions bob and winter having however devoted the afternoon to the riggingup of a couple of tents close alongside the hut for the accommodation of us of the cutters crew during our ramble which ella sharedthough she at first wished to remain aloof thinking my father and i might have private matters to discuss after so long a separation the subject of the treasureisland again came uppermost and my father seemed to be strongly of opinion that in spite of our failure to find it it really existed and that our disappointment had arisen in some error as to its exact position for my own part i hardly knew what to think i could not for a moment believe that the spaniard knowing himself to be a dying man would tell a wanton and objectless falsehood and i had never supposed him to be otherwise than in the full possession of his senses whilst relating his story but he had given the position of the island definitely and on our arrival at the latitude and longitude named we had found no land at all true there had been a certain amount of reservation in his statement he had given the position as near as he could ascertain it or in words to that effect but allowing the possibility of an error that error was not likely to exceed a few miles and i thought that had the island really existed we ought to have been able at all events to see it from our masthead when in the position ascribed to it we talked the matter over at some lengthfor no one is quite indifferent to the advantages accruing from the possession of wealth but we could make nothing very satisfactory of it so at last the subject was changed and we discussed and arranged our plan of immediate operations my fathers longing for home being a thousand times increased now that he knew we had sent information home of the possibility of his still being in existence we all fully shared in his impatience as i knew that ada would soon begin to feel uneasy if she were not already so at the long period which had now elapsed since she could last have heard from or of us as for winter he was a portland man and the stories bob told him of his kith and kin fully aroused his semidormant longings to see them all once more the next morning we all turned to with a will upon the schooner it happened that more materials were required from the wreck and the obtaining of these and the rafting of them down to the shipyard had hitherto been a work involving the expenditure of much time and great labour as until the arrival of the two blacks in their canoe about six months before my father had nothing in the shape of a boat excepting a rude catamaran sort of an affair and after the acquisition of the canoe though she was of course most useful for many purposes the rafting down of the timbers and planking was almost as tedious and laborious an operation as ever the canoe being too small and too light for towing purposes and their usual mode of procedure had been to kedge down everything but our arrival put an entirely new phase upon this part of the business we got out our tubeboat and put her together and rigged her and then we six menfour whites and the two natives who were strong active ladsmanned her and the cutter and proceeded to the wreck where we combined our forces in taking apart such portions of the wreck as we thought most suitable for our purpose by the middle of the afternoon two goodsized rafts were in the water and the lily taking one of these in tow and the tubeboat which bob insisted on christening as the ella the other we got the whole down to the bay and moored to the beach in little more than an houra task which my father declared had usually occupied him and winter the best part of a day and even then the amount of material transported had scarcely been a quarter as great as that now brought down so great indeed had been the additional assistance afforded by the two pairs of strong arms belonging to the cutters crew that we considered we now had a sufficiency of material to plank the schooner right up to her gunwale i do not know whether i have mentioned it before or not but in fitting out the water lily i had provided a very complete chest of carpenters tools so that we might have the means of effecting any necessary repairs to the cutter as far as our skill would allow and these now came into play with excellent effect we all worked in high spirits for it was now no longer a doubtful question as to whether the schooner could be finished or not the additional strength contributed by bob and myself being found just sufficient to render manageable and comparatively easy work which had before proved too heavy for my father and winter alone or even when aided by the two natives these i may as well now mention were two lads of about eighteen years of age and having been treated very kindly from their first arrival by my father proved very tractable and willing and altogether very valuable aids in many respects we were none of us very skilful in the handling of tools and our work was consequently of no very highly finished character but everything was as strong as wood and iron could make it and within a fortnight we had contrived by dint of sheer hard work to get the schooner planked right up at first we had a great deal of difficulty with our fastenings from want of a smith or a smiths forge and this had been the greatest bar to my fathers progress ella was the means of helping us out of this difficulty by suggesting an idea which i think would never have occurred to any of us men this was neither more nor less than the construction of a rude but efficient smiths hearth out of some old sheet and pig iron obtained from the wreck and the manufacture of a bellows from some boards and stout tarpaulin the nozzle being made of bamboo and inserted into an orifice in the hearth which was packed airtight with clay it was a clumsy contrivance certainly but it answered our purpose well enough to save us a great deal of time and labour the laying of the deck was our next task and it took us another fortnight to do this as we resolved that everything should be as well done as possible this was exclusive of the time occupied in fixing the combings of the hatch and forescuttle cabincompanion skylight and other openings as we got our hands in however we made more rapid progress and in little more than two months from the date of the water lilys arrival the hull of the schooner was completed and in readiness for the reception of her spars these we got out of the spars of the wreck all of which had been sent down long before by my father and winter and carefully stored up for this very purpose another month saw these spars all shaped and fitted and ready to be put into their places this had been the work of my father and myself aided in the lifting turning over and shifting generally by the natives bob and winter busying themselves meanwhile in the manufacture of a suit of sails from those belonging to the amazon our rigging was not very trustworthy being manufactured for the most part out of the old rigging of the wreck but there had been a good supply of new rope also on board as a standby and this we had used in as far as it would go in the most important parts we decided to rig the craft complete upon the stocks and then launch her and tow her down alongside the wreck to take in ballast and her watertanks stores etc this we accordingly did finishing off everything even to the bending of the sails and four months to a day after the water lilys arrival saw her caulked her seams paid her hull painted and in short everything ready even to wedging up for launching volume two chapter ix the treasure this eventful day it was unanimously agreed should be observed as a strict holiday no work except what was absolutely necessary beyond the launch being permissible every preparation had been completed the day before all of us having worked like galleyslaves to achieve this result as soon as it became apparent that launching on this day might be possible the morning dawned fair and serene the sky was without a cloud each quivering leaf and blade of grass glittered with diamondlike dewdrops and the air was laden with the perfume of numberless flowers nature appeared in fact to have arrayed herself in gala attire in honour of the occasion bob and winter were up by daybreak to dress the schooner out with the flags of the old amazon in addition to a brandnew burgeered with a white border and the name ada after my sister in white letterswhich floated gallantly in the breeze from the maintopmasthead and which i need scarcely inform the sagacious reader was the work of ellas skilful finders the cutters flags were equally divided between her and the tubeboat both craft being moored a short distance apart in the little bay our gun which had never been dismounted from the time of the fight with the pirates boats was loaded with a blank cartridge well rammed down and the muzzle plentifully greased to create a louder report so that the schooner might be honoured with a salute as she took the water and one of the blacks was stationed on board the water lily with instructions to pull the triggerline directly he saw the schooner fairly in motion on the ways a bottle of wine was also slung from the schooners stem that the ceremony of christening might not be shorn of its usual rite this occupied the two mates until breakfast was ready when we all sat down to the meal in most exuberant spirits as soon as it was over we all proceeded to the beach and bob climbed on board the craft and took his station forward in readiness to let go the anchor as soon as she had slid far enough off from the land ella took up a position under the bows supported by my father who instructed her how to perform the ceremony of christening after the most approved fashion whilst winter and i stood by to knock away the spurshores and the second native launched and jumped into a canoe to go alongside and fetch bob ashore as soon as his share of the duty was performed when we had all taken our stations is everybody ready inquired my father a general ay ay was the response ella took the bottle of wine in her hand and winter and i poised our hammers then knock away with a will lads exclaimed the skipper a few lusty strokes brought the shores down the schooner began to move and ella dashed the bottle against the crafts bows exclaiming in a clear silvery voice as the wine dripped from the stem god bless the ada and send her success and prosperity we all took off our hats and cheered lustily as the schooner rushed down the ways and plunged stern foremost into the sparkling sea the gun went off with a sharp bang and the native gunner instantly with a terrific yell sprang over the side of the cutter and struck out for the shore with all the vigour and activity that fear could impart to his movements the schooner clove the water smoothly and easily as she drove astern when once fairly afloat and held her way long enough to shoot far beyond her consorts at anchor in the bay as soon as her speed was sufficiently reduced bob let go his anchor and we had the satisfaction of seeing that she floated lightly and on a perfectly even keel as soon as bob came on shore he of course joined us and lent his aid in admiring and praising our own handiwork as is pretty generally the custom with all mortals though some are not so ingenuous in the exhibition of their actual feelings as we were and i think we had very good reason for our admiration for the craft was more than sightly she was decidedly handsome and we who had put her together were after all it must be remembered only unskilled amateurs and though i think i may without undue vanity say that we were all prime seamen and knew perfectly well what constituted a handsome and wholesome craft it is one thing to know this and quite another to make your work correspond accurately with your ideas when we had admired the schooner to our hearts content my father wished to know whether any one had any proposal to make as to the manner in which the remainder of the day should be spent it appeared from the general silence which ensued that no one had but on glancing at ella who remained beside him i noticed an eager look in her face as though she would like to speak but was restrained by a feeling of timidity what is it ella inquired i if no one has anything better to propose she replied i think a picnic would be very nice and i would suggest that the natives be sent on by land with everything necessary to the northern end of the island opposite the poor old amazon of which we are so soon to see the last and that the rest of us take harrys tubeboat and sail in her quite round the islandwhich we newcomers have not seen very much of as yetand stop at the point i have named this of course we all cordially agreed to though i could scarcely help smiling furtively at the idea of a picnic when our lives had been a sort of continuous picnic affair ever since we had been on the island though it is true our pastime had consisted principally of pretty hard work however i made no remark and we all returned to the house and proceeded to pack up the necessary viands etc and to start the niggers as bob invariably termed our black aids in the proposed direction when everything was ready however it was found that there was more than we had the conscience to ask the poor fellows to carry willing as they were so ellas programme was so far departed from as to send them by water in a canoe instead of by land and as soon as they were fairly away we shoved off in the cutters canoe got on board the tubeboat hauled up her grapnel and made sail to the southward here another departure from the programme took place for my father was curious to see how so singular a craft behaved in open water so as there was a nice fresh breeze blowing and sufficient sea on outside to give him a fair idea of her qualities we worked out through the channel as soon as we reached it and sailed round the island outside of everything first of all resuming the original plan as soon as we came inside again both my father and winter were much struck with the smooth and easy motion with which she took the seas especially when going closehauled to windward the short choppy headsea which the breeze had knocked up having not the slightest perceptible retarding effect upon the sharp gentlyswelling tubes which pierced the combing seas absolutely without any shock whatever whereas a boat of the usual mould would have pitched and jerked into them and halfblinded us and wholly wet us through with spray and they were quite as much surprised at her stiffness for her amount of heel was barely perceptible though we were driving her through it under whole canvas whilst had we been in the water lily with a proportionate amount of sail set she would stiff as she was have been lying down gunwale under so rapidly did she skim along over the water too that notwithstanding the extra distance traversed beyond that originally proposed we were in ample time for the mealluncheon or dinner whichever we chose to call itwhich it was arranged we should partake of picnic fashion in the open air i was delighted to observe that both my father and winter keenly enjoyed this short cruise outside it was the first time excepting when my father came out to meet us and pilot us in that either of them had been outside the reef and that they were now fairly at sea and with a staunch and good seaboat under their feet seemed an earnest of their easy escape almost more convincing than the fact that the vessel in which that escape was planned to be made was now actually in the water having made the tour of the island both outside and inside the reef and admired its many beauties we at length sat down to our meal in high spirits and with appetites which enabled us to do the most ample justice to ellas bounteous provision which it now appeared had been in progress the whole of the previous day in anticipation of some such arrangement as that which she had proposed i had noticed an unusual flutter in the dear little girls manner more than once during the morning as well as considerable imperfectly repressed excitement but i had said nothing to her about it attributing it to that which had produced so much excitement of feeling among the rest of us namely the important event of the launch this feeling of excitement still continued to animate us but strangely enough ella seemed the least able of the party to control it and it appeared to have the effect of agitating her nerves considerably moreover she seemed to be singularly preoccupied over something answering remarks at randomsometimes when she was not addressed at alland then flushing up and apologising confusedly when our meal was over a few bottles from a small stock of carefullyhoarded wine from the amazons stores were produced and at ellas especial request we four men proceeded to regale ourselves and assist digestion with the fragrant weed the chief topic of conversation was of course the arrangements to be made for a speedy departure from the island it was decided that on the following day all hands should employ themselves in getting the schooner ballasted provisioned and watered and it was thought that by hard work all might be done in readiness for a departure at daybreak on the succeeding morning my father winter and the two blacks were to man the schooner whilst ella bob and myself were to continue in the cutter and it was of course a settled thing that we were to keep company as long as it was possible we also decided upon certain rendezvous in case of being compelled by bad weather to part company at any particular part of the voyage these rendezvous i may as well mention were melbourne cape town saint helena saint antonio in the cape de verd group and madeira when this topic seemed pretty well exhausted ella remarked nervously it seems then harry that you have quite given up the idea of making any further search for the treasureisland i have not heard it mentioned once foroh ever so long i fear we must think no more of that i replied when the story was first told to me it seemed an easy matter to sail direct to the spot but the fact that some mistake has occurred somewhere with regard to its position has quite thrown us out and to look for it among the numerous islands which constitute this archipelago would be somewhat like searching for a needle in a bundle of hay and the chances of finding either the one or the other would be about equal i should say if i only held a sufficient clue to warrant the slightest hope of success i would willingly prosecute a search but i do not are you quite sure that you do not she returned still very nervously tell us the story all over again perhaps some useful idea may suggest itself to one or other of us if it is all gone carefully over once more certainly i will said i if it be only to gratify you little one i anticipate no further result you must know then ella and gentlemen that the spaniard who told me this story was on his deathbed when he confided it to me he asserted that a treasureship lay buried in the sandy beach of a certain island here in the pacific and he not only gave me the latitude and longitude of the island but he minutely described it so that i might recognise it at once and he also described certain marks whereby i might be able to fix upon the exact spot in the beach where the buried treasureship lay and i suppose you have fixed upon your mind a kind of mental picture of this island drawn from the description given you said ella and i presume you are of opinion that you would recognise the island in a moment if you saw it exactly so i answered i can see it before me at this moment shutting my eyesas distinctly as possible there it lies about three miles away with the surf beating all round it and there in bold relief against the clear blue sky stands the isolated clump of seven cocoanut trees on the extreme northernmost point of the island somewhat like these that we are sitting under at this moment interrupted ella excitedly yees said i certainly somewhat like these it is curious now but i never noticed until this moment that these trees are seven in number if now any two of them were marked in any way somewhat like this again interrupted ella as she started to her feet and placed her hand upon a very perceptible scar in the trunk of the central tree we sprang to our feet as one man infinitely more excited even than ella was and walked up to the tree and carefully examined the mark there was no mistake about it the bark had been deeply cut away with a knife and i cannot for the life of me say how it was that it had never attracted my attention unless it be that the wound was now weatherstained and by no means so conspicuous as i had pictured it in my mind perhaps it was in a great measure due too to the fact that the island we were on though answering accurately to the description given of the treasureisland was quite unlike the picture my imagination had conjured up now for the other mark i exclaimed it is on one or other of the remaining six trees if this really be here it is again exclaimed ella darting to a tree which stood on the edge of the clump and again pointing out a mark very similar to the first of the nature of this mark too there could be no possible doubt i seized a halfconsumed stick from the embers of the expiring fire and getting the two marked trees in line i walked away from them keeping them in one until i saw just clear of the trees and bushes on the southern extremity of the island a small pinnacle of uncovered rock peering blackly out from among the snowy glittering surf i then drove the stick i held in my hand deep into the sandy beach exclaiming here lies the buried treasureship if there be any truth in the story well soon set that question at rest exclaimed bob here you two niggers jump into this here canoe and paddle me down to the cutter as quick as you knows how im off ater they shovels as we laid in for this here very job he explained turning to me and ill be back agin in next to no time whilst he was gone i sought and obtained an explanation from ella of the manner in which she had made this most important discovery it seemed that she had amused herself by wandering pretty nearly all over the island whilst we were hard at work upon the schooner and in one of her rambles her attention had been attracted to this very clump of trees their number had impressed itself upon her and endeavouring to remember what it was she had heard or dreamed connected with seven cocoanut trees the story of the treasure had suddenly flashed across her mind this led of course to an examination of the trees and the discovery of the marks upon them on the day but one preceding the launch of the schooner and seeing that we were disposed to make the launching day a gala day she decided to keep her own counsel until the arrival of the day itself and to let the revelation of the discovery be made at such a time as still further to increase our reasons for rejoicing and upon this resolution had been based her plot for the picnic i am so delighted harry dear she added in conclusion that it is i who have made this discovery you cannot think what a pleasure it is to a woman to contribute to the happiness and prosperity of the man she loves and beside this there is the satisfaction of knowing that if the wealth you have spoken of really lies buried here and i have no doubt whatever that it does you will now be under no necessity for following up a profession which must inevitably have involved long separations from me i am so happy dearest for i do not think i could have endured that i was deeply affected by this and frequent other evidences of the warmth and strength of ellas attachment to me and of the confiding frankness with which she revealed it and i believe most conscientiously that the greatest gratification i derived from the discovery of the treasure arose from a knowledge of the extended power it would bestow upon me to contribute to her happiness bob soon returned with a couple of shovels and springing ashore from the canoe he handed one to winter and began at once to ply the other most vigorously himself exclaiming as he did so there you are my lad now fire away as hard as you like theres only a few feet of sand between us and gold enough to make all our fortins a dozen times over so lets rouse it up and have a look at it without any more words the two men worked with a will and soon stood in a goodsized hole about three feet deep whilst the rest of us looked on at their labours with the keenest interest at length winters shovel struck upon something hard and he announced the fact with a joyous shout bob however still continued working away without meeting with any resistance a few more strokes of winters shovel laid bare a small patch of damp discoloured planking a further proof if we needed one of the truth of the story bob was still digging away as hard as ever presently he ceased digging and began shovelling the loose sand off a piece of the deck or something else which he had got down to this was soon uncovered and we then saw that it was a piece of loose plank which he and winter succeeded between them in raising and underneath it lay a dark hollow cavity to work they both went once more and in a short time three more loose planks were so far uncovered as to permit of their being removed this accomplished it was found that we had been so fortunate as to hit at the first trial upon the hole through which the spaniard had penetrated to the innermost recesses of the ship a creat deal of sand still remained to be cleared away however before we could get at the gold and my father and i were on the point of relieving the two mates when the natives who had looked on at the operations with a great deal of interest and intelligence stepped forward and said no no now me work and though they had probably never seen shovels in their lives before and were a little awkward at first in the handling of them they soon got into the owing of it and did their work as well as either of the others and so they kept on spell and spell the mates and the niggers neither party seeming willing that my father or i should share in the hard work and in about an hour and a half bobs shovel suddenly struck sharply upon something harder than wood he and winter were both working under the influence of powerful excitement so it was not long before they had cleared away the sand sufficiently to enable them to lay hold of and drag forth an ingot black and discoloured almost as rusty iron but heavy enough to prove most satisfactorily that it was not that metal it was handed up and i at once proceeded to scrape away with my strong clasp knife upon its surface quickly establishing the fact that it was indeed the precious metal this i considered sufficient for one day especially as it had been agreed that it should be a holiday so with considerable difficulty i at length persuaded the two mates to come out of their hole and rest after their violent exertions and shortly afterwards our goods and chattels were packed up and put on board one of the canoes in charge of the two natives and the remainder of the party embarked in the tubeboat with the goldthirteen ingots in allthat had been brought to light the sails were hoisted and we ran down to the anchorage in the bay with both canoes in tow it would be difficult to express the satisfaction which all felt at this important discovery but to bob and me the satisfaction was peculiarly great for we had now accomplished all that our most sanguine expectations had led us to hope for in projecting this adventurous voyagemore indeed for as the reader is aware when the subject was first mooted we had no hope of finding my father having quite given him up as dead the next day saw us hard at work again and not to dwell too long upon matters which may be passed over briefly in three days we had the box of gems and as much gold as we considered we could take the schooner was ballasted with it taking in as nearly as we could calculate twenty tons and the precious metal was also substituted for the lead ballast of the cutter the aperture in the deck of the buried ship was then carefully boarded over as before the sand shovelled back into its place and to time and the winds were left the work of completely eradicating all remaining traces of our labours both craft were then fully provisioned and watered abundant preparation having already been made and on the morning following the completion of our final arrangements both craft made sail from the island the ada leading out through the channel and stood away to the southward and westward under every stitch of canvas that would draw we soon found however that in moderate weather the water lily could sail round and round the ada and we had to take in our topsail and haul down a reef in our mainsail to avoid running away from her altogether it was only when it came to doublereefed canvas that her superior power told sufficiently to produce an equality in our speeds it seemed as though everything which we were to meet with in the shape of adventure had befallen us on the first half of our voyage for day after day passed by without anything to distinguish it from the others and after a quick and pleasant run we reached melbourne just in time to catch the homewardbound mail and to send a hurried letter to my sister acquainting her with the agreeable intelligence of our double success i here had an opportunity of acquainting the proper authorities with all the circumstances connected with the destruction of the pirate brig and of the crew being imprisoned on the island and i afterwards learned that a cruiser had been despatched to the spot and that the entire band were captured tried condemned upon a mass of evidence which was soon collected against them and hanged here also i had the happiness of being united to the dear girl who had in so many ways proved herself worthy of my best and strongest love and as our storyexcepting that part of it which related to the finding of the treasurehad got wind the sympathy and kind feeling shewn towards us by the warmhearted colonists was such as to convert our weddingday almost into a day of public rejoicing all the ships without exception were dressed with flags and there was a long article in one of the local papers headed thrilling romance of the sea in which the story of ellas rescue from the wreck told with great affect we remained at melbourne about a week and then made sail once more still with favourable winds and fine weather until we reached the cape of good hopewhich we did in little more than a monthwhen we encountered a very strong breeze from the southward and eastward from which we were glad enough to take shelter behind the fine breakwater in the bay here we again filled up provisions and water and once more despatched letters home by the time that we had done what we wanted the gale was over and we lost no time in making a fresh start we soon got into the southeast trades and as they happened to be blowing strong we made the best of them and did not attempt to stop at saint helena we were fortunate again in crossing the line getting a little slant of wind which carried us handsomely across the usually calm belt which so tries the patience of the homewardbound seaman at that spot and after a remarkably fine passage of thirtynine days from table bay we found ourselves at anchor in funchal roads one of the canoes both of which the schooner carried on deck was got out and my father and i went ashore to the postoffice where we found as we expected letters from my sister in answer to ours from melbourne my poor father was completely unmanned by the warmth of affection breathed forth in my sisters letter to him and i was scarcely less so at the delight she manifested at our safety and success and the warm sympathy with which she responded to the timid message my letter had conveyed to her from her unknown sister we hurriedly got in a stock of wine and once more made sail and after a baffling passage of a fortnight against headwinds and light airs and calms reached weymouth bay on a most lovely evening in the last week of june having accomplished our voyage round the world with all its delays in somewhat under eleven months the moment that we were at anchor one of the canoes was got into the water and my father ella and i were paddled ashore by the two natives who could now speak english tolerably well and had accustomed themselves to the use of civilised clothing bob and winter remaining on board their respective craft that night to take care of them we landed at the flight of steps at the pierend and made the best of our way at once to my aunts house my sister was there eagerly expecting us for it appeared that she had been on the esplanade listening to the strains of the regimental band and had recognised the water lily as we drew in towards the anchorage i will pass over in silence the rapturous meeting which ensued for the feelings of all were of too deep and sacred a character for so inexperienced a pen as mine to deal with suffice it to say that we all enjoyed on that evening one of those short seasons of perfect unalloyed happiness which are occasionally permitted even here on earth little now remains to be told we succeeded after a vast amount of hard work and difficulty in turning our gold into cash and the proceeds were equally divided among us five whites the result being as i suppose i need hardly say a magnificent fortune to each winter like the honest fellow that he was immediately married the girl who had consented to share his uncertain fortune as a seaman and the two blacks attached themselves as a matter of course to my fathers establishment as for bob he asserted roundly that his gold would be of no use or value to him if i turned him adrift so he became i need scarcely say with my hearty goodwill a fixture in my establishment and his whole thoughts are now set on being made sailingmaster of a fine schooner yacht which is building for me i found out ellas relations and communicated the fact of her rescue from the wreck and of her having become my wife but i said nothing respecting our immense wealth merely stating that i was possessed of a comfortable independency as i wished to ascertain whether they were willing to receive her as a relative on her own and her mothers account i regret for the sake of human nature to say that the interview was eminently unsatisfactory and i left their house with a mental resolve that my wife should never with my consent enter the doors of such unnatural relatives the end
