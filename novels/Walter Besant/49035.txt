substitution pray be seated madam the doctor offered his visitor a chair then he closed the door with perhaps a more marked manner than one generally displays in this simple operation i am happy to inform you he began that the arrangementsthe arrangements he repeated with meaning are now completed the lady was quite youngnot more than twentytwo or soa handsome woman a woman of distinction her face was full of sadness her eyes were full of trouble her lips trembled her fingers nervously clutched the arms of the chair when the doctor mentioned the arrangements her cheek flushed and then paled in a word she betrayed every external sign of terror sorrow and anxiety and when can i leave this place this day as soon as you please the woman made no objections none you can have the child i have told you my reasons for wishing to adopt this childhe had never asked her reasons yet at every interview she repeated them my own boy is dead he is dead there was a world of trouble in the repetition of the word the doctor bowed coldly your reasons madam he said are sufficient for yourself i have followed your instructions without asking for your reasons that is to say i have found the kind of child you want light hair and blue eyes apparently sound and healthy at all events the child of a sound and healthy mother as for your reasons i do not inquire i thought you might like they are nothing to do with me my business has been to find a child and to arrange for your adoption of it i have therefore as i told you arranged with a poor woman who is willing to part with her child on my conditions absolutely that isshe will never see the child again she will not ask who takes the child or where it is taken or in what position of life it will be brought up she accepts your assurance that the child will be cared for and treated kindly she fully consents poor creature you will give her fifty pounds and that single payment will terminate the whole business terminate the whole business oh it will begin the whole business there are many reasons for adoption the doctor continued returning to the point with which he had no concern i have read in books of substituting a childintroducing a childfor the sake of keeping a title or an estate or a family the lady answered as if she had not heard this remark the mother consents to sell her child poor creature she accepts your conditions i have told you so go your wayshe goes hers the lady reflected for a moment tell me she saidyou are a man of sciencein such an adoption or perhaps such a substitution interrupted the doctor is there not danger of inherited vice or disease certainly there is it is a danger which you must watch in educating the child he may inherit a tendency to drink guard against it by keeping him from alcohol of any kind he may show physical weakness watch him carefully but ninetenths of socalled hereditary disease or vice are due to example and conditions of life if we do not know the character of the parentsthey may be criminals what if the child should inherit these instincts the doctor who had been standing took a chair and prepared himself to argue the point he was a young man with a strong jaw and a square forehead he had a face and features of rude but vigorous handling such a face as a noble life would make beautiful in age and an ignoble life would make hideous every man has as many faces as there are years of his life and we heed them not yet each follows each in a long procession ending with the pale and waxen face in the coffinthat solemn face which tells so much there is he said a good deal of loose talk about heredity some things external are hereditaryface eyes figure stature hands certainly descend from father to son some diseases especially those of the nervous kind some forms of taste and aptitude especially those which are artistic things which are not natural but acquired are never hereditarynever if the boys father is the greatest criminal in the country it wont hurt him a bit because he is taken away too early to have observed or imitated the sons are said to take after the mothers that is perhaps because they have always got the models before them in your case you will naturally become the childs most important model later on will come in the male influence if there is for instance a putative father there will be of course my husband the doctor bowed again then there was a husband living he will become the boys second model he said in other words madam the vices of the boys parentsif they have viceswill not affect him in the least gout rheumatism asthma consumptionall these things and many more a child may inherit but acquired criminality never be quite easy on that point my desire is that the child may become as perfect a gentleman at all points as hisas my husband why should he not he has no past to drag him down you will train him and mould him as you pleaseexactly as you please you have not told me anything about the mother except that she is in want why should you learn her name or she yours i have no desire to learn her name i was thinking whether she is the kind of woman to feel the loss of her child the doctor as yet inexperienced in the feminine nature marvelled at this sympathy with the mother whose child the lady was buying well he said she is a young womanof respectable character i believe good looking in her speech something of a cockney if i understand that dialect the more respectable she is the more she will feel the loss of her child yes but there is another consideration this poor creature has a husband who has deserted her then her child should console her her husband is a comedianactorsinging fellowa chap who asks for nothing but enjoyment as for wife and children they may look out for themselves when i saw him i read desertion in his face in his wifes face it was easy to read neglect poor creature now hes gonedeserted her nothing will do but she must go in search of him partly for money to help her along partly because the workhouse is her only refuge she sells her baby the lady was silent for a while then she sighed poor creature there are then people in the world as unhappy as i myself if that is any consolation there are well madam you now know the whole history and as it doesnt concern you nor the child best forget it at once poor mother she kept harping on the bereavement as though providence and not she herself was the cause i have told her that the boy will be brought up in easeaffluence eventhe lady inclined her headand she is resigned thank you and when you would like to go up to london this afternoon well i will myself bring the child to the railway station once more as regards heredity if the child should inherit his mothers qualities he will be truthful and tenacious or obstinate and perhaps rather stupid if his fathers he will be artistic and musical selfish coldhearted conceited he might inherit the better qualities of both ah then he will be persevering highprincipled a man of artistic feelingperhaps of powerambitious and desirous of distinction i wish madam that he may become so perfect and admirable a young man he rose i have only i think to receive the money which will start this poor woman on her wildgoose chase thank you ten fivepound notes i will take care that the woman has it at once for your own trouble dr steele my fee is three guineas thank you i shall be on the platform or in the train at a quarter before three please look about for an indian ayah who will receive the child you are sure that there will never be any attempt made to follow and discover my name as to discovery he said you may rest quite easy for my own part my work lies in this slum of birmingham it is not likely that i shall ever get out of it i am a sixpenny doctor you are a woman of society i shall never meet you this little business will be forgotten tomorrow if in the future by any accident i were to meet you i should not know you if i were to know you i should not speak to you until you yourself give me leave even if i should recognize you i should not speak about this business thank you she said coldly it is not however likely that you will be tempted he took up an open envelope lying on the tableit was the envelope in which the lady had brought the notesreplaced them and put them in his pocket then he opened the door for the lady who bowed coldly and went out a few days before this the same lady with an indian ayah was bending over a dying child they sent for the nearest medical man he came he tried the usual things they proved useless the child must die the child was dead the child was buried the mother sat stupefied in her hand she held a letterher husbands latest letter in a day or two he said my lifes work will be finished in a fortnight after you get this i shall be at southampton come to meet me dear one and bring the boy i am longing to see the boy and the boys mother kiss the boy for me and so on and so onalways thinking of the boy the boy the boy and the boy was dead and the bereaved father was on his way home she laid down the letter and took up a telegram already he must be crossing the alps looking forward to meeting the boy the boy the boy and the boy was dead the ayah crouched down on a stool beside her mistress and began whispering in her own language but the lady understood as she listened her face grew harder her mouth showed resolution enough she said you have told me enough you can be silentfor my sake for the sake of the sahib yesyesi can trust you let me think presently she went out she walked at random into street after street she stopped letting chance direct her at a surgery with a red lamp in a mean quarter she read the name she entered and asked to see dr steele not knowing anything at all about the man she was received by a young man of five and twenty or so she stated her object in calling the child i want she said should be something like the child i have lost he must have light hair and blue eyes and the age he must not be more than eighteen months or less than a year my own child was thirteen months old he was born on december i have a large acquaintance in a poor neighbourhood said the doctor the women of my quarter have many babies if you will give me a day or two i may find what you want he made a notelight hair blue eyes birth somewhere near december age therefore about thirteen months at a quarter before three in the afternoon a woman carrying a baby stood inside the railway station at birmingham she was young thinly clad though the day was cold her face was delicate and refined though pinched with want and trouble she looked at her child every minute and her tears fell fast the doctor arrived looked round and walked up to her now mrs anthony he said ive come for the baby oh if it were not for the workhouse i would never part with him come my good woman you know you promised take him she said suddenly she almost flung him in the doctors arms and rushed away above the noise of the trains and the station the doctor heard her sobbing as she ran out of the station shell soon get over it he said but as has already been observed the doctor was as yet inexperienced in the feminine heart about six oclock that evening the lady who had received the baby had arrived at her house in bryanston square now she said when she had reached the nursery we will have a look at the creatureoh the little gutterborn creaturethat is to be my own all the rest of my life the ayah threw back the wraps and disclosed a lusty boy about a year or fifteen months old the lady sat down by the table and dropped her hands in her lap oh she cried i could not tell him it broke my heart to watch the boy on his deathbed it would kill himit would kill himthe child of his old age his only child to save my husband i would do worse things than thisfar worse thingsfar worse things among the childs clothes which were clean and well kept there was a paper the lady snatched it up there was writing on it his namethe writing was plain and clear not that of a wholly uneducated womanis humphrey his surname does not matter it begins with w why cried the lady humphrey humphrey my boys own name and his surname begins with wmy boys initial if it should be my own boyoh ayah my own boy come back again the ayah shook her head sadly but she changed the childs clothes for those of the dead child and she folded up his own things and laid them in a drawer the doctor has not deceived me said the lady fair hair blue eyes eyes and hair the colour of my boy the tears came into her eyes hes a beautiful boy said the nurse not a spot nor a blemish and his limbs round and straight and strong see how he kicks and looklook why if he hasnt got the chinthe sahibs chin it was not much a dimple a hollow between the lower lip and the end of the chin strange so he has do you think nurse the sahib his father will think that the child looks his age he is to be a year and a quarter you know the ayah laughed men know nothing she said in a day or two the supposed parent returned home he was a man advanced in years between sixty and seventy he was tall and spare of figure his features were strongly marked the features of a man who administers and commands his face was full of authority his eyes were as keen as a hawks he stepped up the stairs with the spring of five and twenty and welcomed his wife with the sprightliness of a bridegroom of that elastic age the man was in fact a retired indian he had spent forty years or so in administrating provinces he was a king retired from business a sovereign abdicated on whose face a long reign had left the stamp of kingcraft it was natural that in the evening of his life this man should marry a young and beautiful girl it was also quite natural that this girl should entertain for a husband old enough to be her grandfather an affection and respect which dominated her he held out both arms he embraced his wife with the ardour of a young lover he turned her face to the light lilias he murmured let me look at you why my dear you look paleand worried is anything the matter nothingnothingnow you are home again and the boy where is the boy he shall be brought in the ayah appeared carrying the child here he is quite welland strongand happy your son is quite happyquite happy her voice broke she sank into a chair and fell into hysterical sobbing and weeping he is quitequitequite happy they brought cold water and presently she became calmer then the father turned again to consider the boy he looks strong and hearty but he doesnt seem much bigger than when you carried him off six months ago a little backward with his growth the mother had now recovered but thats nothing hes made a new start already feel his fingers theres a grip your own living picture humphrey ay ay perhaps i would rather for good looks that he took after his mother blue eyes fair hair and the family dimple in the chin when the doctor was left alone he took the envelope containing the banknotes from his pocket and threw it on his desk then he sat down and began to think over the situation what does she do it for he asked her own child is dead there is no doubt about that her face is so full of trouble she wants to deceive her husband at least i suppose so she will keep that secret to herself the ayah is faithfulthats pretty certain there will be no blackmailing in that quarter a fine face she hasmeaning the lady not the ayah hard and determined though i should like to see it soften i wish she had trusted me but there one couldnt expect it of a woman of that temperamentcold reserved haughty a countess perhaps its like the old storybooks somebody will be disinherited this boy is going to do it nobody will ever find it out and thats the way they build up their fine pedigrees the doctor was quite wrong nobody was to be disinherited nor was there an estate this you must understand to begin with the rest i am going to tell you no clue the doctor continued she is quite safe unless she were to meet me no other clue nobody else knows he took up the envelope and observed that it had part of an address upon it all he could read however was one wordlady oho he said there is a title after all it looks as if the latter half were a w theres a conspiracy and im a conspirator humph shes a beautiful creature he fell into meditation on that subject which is always interesting to mere manthe face of a woman then his thoughts naturally wandered off to the conversation he had held with that memorable face i should like if i could to learn how this job will turn out from the hereditary point of view will that interesting babe take after his father will he astonish his friends by becoming a low comedian or will he take after his mother and become a simple honourable englishman or will he combine the inferior qualities of both and become a beautiful and harmonious blend which may make him either a villain of the deeper dye or a common coldblooded man of the world with a touch of the artist chapter ii the only witness gone one afternoon about eighteen years later certain mourningcoaches returning home from a funeral drew up before a house in bryanston square there were three coaches from the first descended a young man of twenty or thereabouts still slight and boyish in figure he had been sitting alone in the carriage from the second came a middleaged man of the greatest respectability to look at he was so respectable so eminently respectable that he could not possibly be anything but a butler with him was a completely respectable person of the other sex who could be no other than a housekeeper in the third carriage there were two young maidservants in black and a boy in buttons at the halting of the carriage they clapped their handkerchiefs to their eyes because they knew what was expected on such an occasion and they kept up this external show of grief until they had mounted the steps and the door was shut the page who was with them had been weeping freely ever since they started not so much from unavailing grief as from the blackness of the ceremony and the dreadful coffin and the horror and terror and mystery of the thing he went up the stairs snuffling and so continued for the rest of the day the young gentleman mounted to the drawingroom where his mother sitting in a straight high chair more like an officechair than one designed for a drawingroom was dictating to a shorthand girl secretary the table was covered with papers in the back drawingroom two other girls were writing for lady woodroffe was president of one society chairman of committee of another honorary secretary of a third her letters and articles were on subjects and works of philanthropy purity rescue white lilies temperance and education her platform advocacy of such works had placed her in the forefront of civilizing women she was a great captain in israel a very deborah a jael she was also which certainly assisted her efforts a very handsome woman still perhaps austere but then her eloquence was of the severe order she appealed to the conscience to duty to responsibility to honour if sinners quailed at contemplating the gulf between themselves and the prophetess who like jeremiah had so little sympathy with those who slide backwards and enjoy the exercise it was a perpetual joy to ladies of principle to consider an example so powerful she was dressed in black silk but wore no widows weeds her husband the first sir humphrey had been dead four years the young gentleman threw himself into a chair lady woodroffe nodded to her secretary who gathered up her papers and retreated to the back drawingroom closing the door well mother said the boy carelessly weve buried the old woman yes i hope you were not too much distressed humphrey i am pleased that you went to the funeral if only to gratify the servants how could i refuse to attend her funeralan old servant like that its a beastly thinga funeraland a beastly nuisance we must not forget her services the lady replied it was in return for those services that i kept her here and nursed her through her old age one does not encumber ones self with sick old women except in such cases as this no thank goodness the young man was in no gracious mood give me a servant who takes her wages and goes off without asking for our gratitude still she was your nurseand a good nurse too ostentatious of her affection especially towards the end she was alsolady woodroffe pursued her own thoughts which was her waya silent woman a woman who could be trusted if necessary with secretsfamily secrets thank goodness weve got none from family secrets family skeletons family ghosts good lord deliver us there are secrets or skeletons in every family i suppose fortunately we forget some and we never hear of others you are fortunate humphrey that you are free from the vexationor the shameor the shockof family secrets which mean family scandals now at all events you are perfectly safe because there is no one living who can create a family ghost for you or provide you with a skeleton humphrey laughed lightly let the dead bury their dead he replied so long as i know nothing about the skeleton it can go on grinning in the cupboard for aught i care did i tell you the young man continued after a pause of her last words what last words i thought i had told you curious words they were i suppose her mind was wandering humphrey said his mother sharply what did she say what words well they sent for me it was just before the end she was lying apparently asleep her eyes shut i thought she was going the nurse was at the other end of the room fussing with the teacups then she opened her eyes and saw me she whispered low down low down master humphrey so i stooped down and she said dont blame her master humphrey i persuaded her and we kept it up for your sake nobody suspects all for your sake i kept it up then she closed her eyes and opened them no more what do you understand by those words humphrey nothing i cannot understand them she was accusing herself i suppose of somethingi know not what what did she keep up whom did she persuade but why should we want to know wandering words nurses will tell you that no importance can be attached to the last words when the brain wanders well humphrey while you were at the funeral i unlocked her drawers and examined the contents i found that she had quite a large sum of money invested one is not in good service for all these years without saving something there is a little pile of photographs of yourself at various ages i have put them aside for you if you like to have them i dont want them he replied carelessly i shall keep them then there is her wardrobe also i believe she had nephews and nieces and cousins in her native village in india all her possessions shall be sent out to them meanwhile there is a little packet of things which she tied up a great many years ago and has kept ever since the sight of them caused me a strange shock i thought they had been long destroyed they revived my memories of a dayan eventcertain dayswhen you were an infant what things are these then they were your own thingssome of the things which you wore when you were a child in arms not more than a few months old oh they are not very interesting are they perhaps not lady woodroffe had in her lap a small packet tied up in a towel or a serviette she placed it on the table humphrey i always think when i look at old things of the stories they might tell if they could of the histories and the changes which might have happened well i dont know mother i am very well contented with things as they are though they might have given my father a peerage as for thinking of what they might have been why i might perhaps have been born in a gutter you might humphreythe widow laughed which was an unwonted thing in heryou certainly might and you cannot imagine what you would be now had you been born in a gutter whats the good of asking then look at this bundle of your things i dont want to look at them no i dare say not but i do they tell a story to me which they cannot tell to you i am glad the old woman kept them lady woodroffe untied the parcel and laid open the things the story is so curious that i cannot help looking at the things i have opened the bundle a dozen times today since i found it i believe i shall have to tell you that story some day humphrey whether i like it or not what story can there be connected with a parcel of socks and shoes to you at present none to me a most eventful story the old nurse knew the story very well but she never talked about it see humphrey the things are of quite coarse materialsone would think they were made for that gutter child we talked about her son stooped and picked up a paper that had fallen on the floor his name is humphrey he read a servants handwriting one would think what was the use of writing what everybody knew perhaps some servant was practising the art of penmanship wellshe tied up the parcel againi shall keep these things myself she put the parcel on the table and presently carried it to her room her son immediately forgot all about the old nurses strange last words and the parcel of clothes and everything this was not unnatural because he presently went back to cambridge where there is very little sympathy with the sentiment of baby linen when the door closed upon her son his mother sprang to her feet oh she clasped her hands can we put her thoughts into wordsthe thoughts that are so swift into words that are so slowthe thoughts that can so feebly express the mind with words that are so imperfect i have never felt myself free until today she is dead she is buried on her deathbed she kept the secret she never wrote it down she never told any one had she written it i should have found it had she told any one i should have heard of it before now and all as she said for the sake of the boy she meant her long silence i feared that at the last when she lay adying she might have confessed i sat in terror when i knew that the boy was at her deathbed i thought that when sir humphrey died and the boy succeeded she might have confessed but she did not good woman and true never by a word or by a look or by a sigh did she let me know that she remembered she breathed deeply as if relieved from a great anxiety i have thought it all over day after day there is nothing that can be found out now the doctor would not recognize me i suppose he is still slaving at birmingham he did not know my name the mother never saw me at last i am free from danger after all these years i have no longer any fear over the mantel hung a portrait of her late husband humphrey she said talking to it familiarly i did it for your sake i could not bear that you should lose your boy all for your sakeall for your sake i screened the child from you at least you never knew that there is notthere has never beenthe least touch of your nobility in the gutter child he is mean he is selfish he has never done a kind action or said a generous word he has no friends only companions he has already all the vices but is never carried away he will become a sensualist a cold and heartless sensualist i am sorry humphrey truly sorry my most noble and honourable husband that i have given you so unworthy a successor yet he is careful he will cause no scandal so far my husband your name is safe chapter iii the three cousins is it possible they repeated gazing each upon each in the triangular fashion every incident in life is a coincident that is to say nothing happens as one expects the reason is that no one considers the outside forces which are unseen very few indeed take into consideration the inside forces which are obvious the trade of prophet has fallen into decay because we no longer believe in him we know that he cannot really prophesy the coincidence to him as to us the future is the unexpected wise folk therefore go about prepared for anything they carry an umbrella in july they build more ships when peace is most profound the unexpected the coincidence gives to life its chief charm it relieves the monotony it breaks the week so to speak formerly it might take the form of invasion a descent upon the coast dwellers by the seaside enjoyed therefore the most exciting lives possible today it comes by telegraph by post by postal express the philosopher of tears says that the unexpected is always disagreeable he of smiles says that on the whole he has received more good gifts unexpectedly than thwacks mostly however the opinion of the multitude which is always right is summed up in the words of the itinerant merchantthe man with the barrow and the oranges we expex a shilling he says and we gits tuppence is it possible these three people had arisen and gone forth that morning expecting nothing and lo a miracle for they were enriched suddenly and without the least expectation by the discovery that they were all three of common kin imagine the boundless possibilities of newly recovered cousinship no one knows what may come out of itan augmentation of family pride an increase of family griefs the addition of sympathy with the lowly the shame and honour of ancient scandals more money perhaps more influence perhaps it may be a most fortunate event on the other hand but for the moment these three had not begun to consider the other side is it possible well it is sometimes best to answer a question by repeating it the place was a country churchyard the time a forenoon in july in the churchyard was a group of four they were all young and two of them were of one sex and two were of the other the girls were the first to arrive they entered by a gate opening into the churchyard from a small coppice on the north side one of the girls evidently the leader had in her face her form her carriage something of pallas athn she was gravethe goddess i believe seldom laughed she was one of those girls who can smile readily and pleasantly but are not anxious to hear good stories like the frivolous man at his club and really saw very little to laugh at even in the unexpectedness of mennothing of course in the ways of women her seriousness was sweet in the eyes of those who loved herthat is to say of all who had the privilege of knowing her her head was large and shapelya shapely head is a very lovely thing in woman her figure matched her head in being large and full her features were regular her cheek was ample like that of a certain bronze venus in the museum her hair was light in colour and abundant not of the feathery kind but heavy and easily coiled in classical fashion her eyes were of that dark blue which is wickedly said to accompany a deceitful nature if this is ever true it certainly was not true of hilarie woodroffe she was dressed in white as becomes a girl on a summer morning with a rose at her throat for a touch of colour as a child of her generation she was naturally tall and being as she was a girl of the highest refinement and culture after such an education as girls can now command and being moreover much occupied with the difficulties and problems of the age she bore upon her brow an undoubted stamp of intellectual endeavour twenty years ago such a girl would have been impossible if you are still happily so young that you can doubt this assertion read the novelsthe best and the worstof that time her companion showed in her face and her appearance more of aphrodite than the sister goddess she looked as sprightly as lallegra herself of slighter figure than the other she was one of those fortunate girls who attract by their manner more than by their beauty indeed no one could call her beautiful but many called her charming her grey eyes danced and sparkled her lips were always smiling her head was never still her face was made for laughing and her eyes for joy her hair was of the very commonest brown colourevery other kind of girl has that kind of hair yet upon her it looked distinguished the dress she woreshe had designed and made it herselfseemed craftily intended to set off her figure and her face and her eyes in a word she was one of those girlsa large classwho seem born especially for the delight and happiness of the male world they are acting girls singing girls dancing girls even stayathome girls but always they delight their people or the public with their vivacity and their cheerfulness and their sympathy by the side of the other girl she looked like an attendant nymph i have always thought that it would be a pleasing thing to detach from dianas train one of those attendant nymphs whose undeveloped mind knew nothing but the narrow round of duty to run breathlessly after the huntress or to bathe with her in a cold mountain stream i would take her away and teach her other things and make her separate and individual but the fear of dian has hitherto prevented me ladiesinwaiting in other words must have a dull time of it both girls of course were strong healthy and vigorous they thought nothing of twenty miles on a bicycle they could row they could ride they could play lawn tennis they would have climbed the matterhorn if it had been within reach they were such girls as we have somehow without knowing how without expecting it presented to modern youth athletic and vigorous of the last decade of the nineteenth century this is my churchyard molly said hilarie you have seen the housethis place belongs to the houseand the whole of it belongs to the family history it must be very nice to have a pedigree said mollyancestors who wore laced coats and swords like the characters on the stage my people i suppose wore smockfrocks i gather the fact because my father never mentioned his father smocks go with silence one would rather i suppose have a pedigree than not small shops also go with silence i wonder why one would rather have a grandfather in a smock than in a small shop i will tell you something of the family history let us sit down on this tombstone i always sit here because you can see the church and the almshouses and the school if you like to take them together so once there was a man named woodroffe who lived in this village seised of a manor as they say he was a small country gentleman an armiger i will show you his tomb presently with his coat of arms this manit was five hundred years agohad four sons one of them stayed at home and carried on the family descent the second son was educated by the bishop and rose to the most splendid distinction he actually became archbishop of canterbury and lord chancellor of england now the father of these lads had friends or cousinsthey came from the next village where their descendants are living stillin the city of london so the two younger sons were sent up to town and apprenticed one to a mercer and the other to a draper and one of these became lord mayorthink of thatand the other sheriff there was a wonderful success for you the effort seems to have exhausted the family for no one else has ever distinguished himself stay there was an indian civilian of that name who died some time ago but i dont know if he belonged to the family my own branch has always remained hopelessly undistinguishedsquires and plain gentlemen and justices of the peace they hunted flogged vagabonds and drank port and of course after all these years one does not know what has become of the citizens descendants still archbishop lord mayor and sheriffthat ought to last a long time it has lasted a long time well when they became old these men resolved to show their grateful sense of the wonderful success which had been accorded to them so they came back to their native village and they replaced the little church by a beautiful and spacious churchthere it is truly it was a great and noble church of proportions quite beyond the needs of a small village its tower and spire standing high above all the country round its recessed porch a marvel of precious work the windows and the clerestory and the roof may be seen figured in all the books on ecclesiastical architecture as the finest specimens of their style yes this church was built by these brothers they walled the churchyardthis is their old grey wall with the wallflowers they built the lychgatethere it isin the churchyard they founded a school for the youngthere it isshe pointed to a small stone hall standing in the northwest corner of the churchyard it was of the same period and of the same architecture as the church the windows had the same tracery the buttresses were covered with yellow lichen a beautiful and venerable structure from the building there came a confused murmur of voices and on the other side of the church they built an almshouse for the oldthere it isshe pointed to a long low building also of the same architecture so you see they provided in the same enclosure a place of worship for the living a place of burial for the dead a school for the young and a haven of rest for the old the sentiment of the history touched her companion who looked about her and murmured it seems a peaceful place everything in the place seems to belong to those four brothers the old house behind those trees the broken cross at the gate the ruined college in the village the very cottages all seem to me to be monuments of those four brothers it is a beautiful thing owning such a house and such a place said the other but i prefer your gardens to your churchyard hilarie i confess just then a young man in a hired victoria drove up to the gate and descended and looked about him with an indolent kind of curiosity he wore a brown velvet coat had a crimson scarf with a white waistcoat carried a pincenez on his nose had sharp and somewhat delicate features carried his head high and was tall enough to convey by that attitude which was clearly habitual the assumption of superiority if not of disdain and there was in him something of the artist his face was pale and clean shaven his lips were thin his hair was light with a touch of yellow in it his eyes when you could make them out were of a light blue and cold his figure was thin and not ungraceful in a word a young man of some distinction in appearance of an individuality certainly marked perhaps selfcontained perhaps selfish he walked slowly up the path when he drew near the girls he raised his hat am i right he asked in thinking this to be woodroffe church yes it is woodroffe church the church built by the archbishop and his brothers this is their church that is their school that is their almshouse would you like to go into the church i have the key with me and am going in at once at this moment they were joined by another young man whose entrance to the churchyard was not noticed he had been walking with light elastic step along the middle of the road a small bag was slung from his shoulder by a strap he carried a violincase his broad felt hat his brown tweed suit his brown shoes were all white with the dust of the road he passed the church without observing it then he remembered something stopped came back and turned into the churchyard he was quite a young man his face was clean shavena mobile face with thin lips and quick blue eyes his hair as he lifted his hat was a light brown with a trace of yellow in it growing in an arch over his forehead his step was springy his carriage free his hairlonger than most men wear itthe blue scarf at his throat his long fingers made one think of art in some shape or other probably a musician in the churchyard he looked about him curiously then he turned to the group of three and put exactly the same question as that proposed by the first young man may i ask he said if this is woodroffe church the attendant nymph jumped up oh she cried its dick you here molly he asked i never expected hilarie said the girl this is my old friend dick we were children together hilarie bowed graciously i am pleased to know your friend she said i was just telling this other gentleman that this is woodroffe church we are going into the church would you like to come too hilarie led the way and opened the door of the south porch within restorers had been at work the seats which replaced the old oaken pews were machinemade and new they wanted the mellowing touch of two hundred years and even then they would be machinemade still the rood screen as old as the archbishop was so polished and scraped that it looked almost as much machinemade as the seats even the roof after its scraping and painting looked brand new yet they had not destroyed all the antiquity of the church there were still the grey arches the grey pillars the grey walls and the monuments there were many monuments in the church two or three tablets in memory of former vicars all the rest shields busts and sculptured tombs in memory of bygone woodroffes a low recessed arch in the north wall contained the figure of a crusader he is one of the woodroffes said the guide a recent tablet commemorated one who fell at the alma he was another of them said the guide you are walking over the graves of a whole family they have been buried here from time immemorial every slab in the aisle and every stone in the chancel covers one of them in the north transept there stood a long low altartomb with carvings on the sides and a slab of grey granite on the top formerly it had been surrounded and covered by a white marble tabernacle richly carved this was now broken away and destroyed except a few fragments in the wall the tomb itself was dilapidated the granite slab was broken in two yet the inscription remained perfectly legible it was as follows hic jacent robertus woodroffe armiger et hilaris uxor ejus qui robertus obiit sep ad mccccxxxix in the righthand corner of the slab were the arms of the deceased this tomb said the guide was erected by the archbishop to the memory of his father on the opposite side of the south transept one of the common elizabethan monuments was affixed to the wall it represented figures in relief and painted the husband and wife both in high ruffs knelt before a desk face to face below them was a procession of boys and girls six in number over their heads was a shield with a coatofarmsthe same arms as on the other tomb the monument was sacred to the memory of robert woodroffe knight and johanna his wife beneath the figures was a scroll on which the local poet had been allowed to do his worst after thy dethe thy words and works survive to shew thy virtues as if still alive when thou didst fall fair mercy shrieked and swoond and charity bemoaned her deadly wounde the orphand babe the hapless widow cryd ah who will help us now that thou hast dyed they made him a knight said the guide against his will james the first insisted on his assuming the dignity it was the only honour ever attained by any of this branch they all stayed at home contented to make no noise in the world at all well i think i have shown you all the monuments this is my ancestor said the man with the violincase pointing to the first tomb not this one at all why the elder robert is my ancestor also said the first young man wondering good gracious he is my ancestor as well cried hilarie in amazement all these woodroffes belong to me and i to them your ancestor is it possible she added turning from one to the other is it possible the two men repeated the archbishops elder brother is my direct ancestor said hilarie he is buried here beneath this stone mine was lord mayor woodroffe said the first young man he was buried in the church of all hallows the less where his tomb was destroyed in the fire and mine was the sheriff said the second young man he was buried in st helens where you may see his tomb to this day oh it is wonderful hilarie looked at her new cousins with some anxiety the first young man seemed altogether quite welldressed wellspoken wellmannered welllooking of goodly stature a proper youth in fact proper in the modern sense his turnout was faultless and of the very daysnot yesterdaysmode she turned to the other circumstances perhaps were against him the dust with which he was covered the shabby old bag hanging round his neck his violincase a gentleman does not travel on foot carrying a violin besides his face was not the kind of face which comes out of eton and trinity it was a humorous face there was a twinkle or the fag end of a smile upon it such a girl as hilarie would not at first take readily to such a face however he looked quiet and he looked goodnatured his eyes realizing the oddness of the situation were luminous with suppressed laughter molly he said please tell this ladyyour friendwho i am hilarie this is dick woodroffe i suppose you have never heard of him i never thought of his name being the same as yours dick is an actor he sings and plays and writes comediettas he is awfully clever thank you molly add that i am now on tramp he looked with some contempt on the other young man since you are my cousin mr woodroffe i hope we shall be friends hilarie shook hands with him my name is hilarie woodroffe and i am descended from the eldest brother the old house which i will show you presently has remained with us and youare you really another cousin she turned to the first comer i hope so my name is humphrey woodroffe oh this is delightful may i ask what your branch has been doing all these years i have a genealogy at home we have had no more lord mayors or archbishops a buccaneer or two a captain under charles the first a judge under william the third and an angloindian my father now dead of some distinction your branch has done more creditably than mine and yours cousin dick he laughed we went down in the world and stayed there some of us assisted in colonizing virginia in the last century by going out in the transports there is a tradition of highwaymen some of us had quarters permanently in the kings bench i am a musician and a mime and a small dramatist yet we have always kept up the memory of the sheriff never mind dick said molly you shall raise your branch again he shook his head there is not so much staying power he said in a sheriff as in a lord mayor hilarie observed him curiously why she said you two are strangely alike do you observe the resemblance molly yes oh yesafter a little consideration mr humphrey is taller and bigger but they certainly are alike good heavens it is wonderful the same coloured hair growing in the same manner the same eyes it is the most extraordinary instance of the survival of a type the young men looked at each other with a kind of jealousy they resented this charge of resemblance like that bounder said the look of the young man of clubs like this piccadilly masher was the expression on the speaking countenance of the man on tramp after five hundred years hilarie pondered over this strange coincidence let us go back to the churchyard at the porch she paused and bade them look round tell me she said if you have ever seen a place more beautiful or more peaceful the amplitude of the churchyard was in harmony with the stateliness of the church an ancient yew stood in one corner the place was surrounded by trees the steps of the old cross were hollowed by the feet of many generations beyond the quiet mounds the dark trees with their heavy foliage made a fitting background two or three of the bedesmen stood at their door blinking in the sunshine the almshouse is a readingroom now said hilarie the old people have quarters more commodious for sleeping but they come here all day long to read and rest they stood in silence for a while the swifts flew about the tower and the spire the lark was singing in the sky the blackbird in the coppice the air was full of soft calls whisperstwitters of birds the humming of insects and the rustle of leaves from the schoolroom came the continuous murmur of childrens voices another old man passed slowly along the path among the graves towards the almshouse it seemed as if he were choosing his own bed for a long sleep everything spoke of life happy serene and peaceful i am glad you came here said hilarie it is your own when you know it you will love everything in itthe church and the churchyard the trees and the birds the old men and the children the living and the dead her eyes filled with tears those of the man with the violincase softened and he listened and looked round those of the other showed no responsethey were resting with admiration upon the other girl comehilarie returned to the duty of hostesslet me show you the housethe old old housewhere your ancestors lived she led the way to the gate by which she had entered she conducted them along a path under the trees into a small park in the middle of the park were buildings evidently of great age they were surrounded by a moat now dry with a bridge over it and beyond the bridge a little timbered cottage which had taken the place of gate tower and drawbridge within was a garden with flowers fruit and vegetables all together and beyond the garden was the house and surely there is no other house like unto it in the whole country in the middle was a highroofed hall at either end were later buildings beyond these buildings at one end was a low broad tower embattled the windows of the hall were the same as those of the church the school and the almshouse you cannot wonder said the girl that i love to call this house my ownmy very own there is nothing in the world that i would take in exchange for this house come in cousin humphrey she said hospitably andandmy other cousin cousin dick besides you are a friend of mollys come in you are both welcome she opened the door within the great hall had a stone bench running all round the highpitched roof was composed of thick beams black with age the floor was boarded the das stood raised three or four inches for the high table the circular space was still preserved beneath the lantern where the fire was formerly made here lived robert said the chatelaine with his four sons there was no floor to the hall then the servants took their meals with the master but below him the men slept on the floor this was the common livingroom she led the way to the north end here was the kitchen built out beyond the hallthere were signs of womenservantsand above itshe led the way up a rude stairthe solar of three or four rooms where the lord and lady slept and the daughters and the womenservants at the other endshe led them to the south end of the hallwas the ladys bower where the lady with her maids sat at their work all day and beyond is the tower where the menatarms our garrison lay these rooms were furnished they are our sittingrooms three or four girls now rose as hilarie entered the room she presented her cousins to them my friends she said simply here we live we take our meals in the hall our servants sleep in the gatehouse we in the solar confess now my newlyfound cousins is it not a noble house she showed them the tower and the dungeon and the guardroom all belonging to the wars of the roses and then she led them back to the hall where a dainty luncheon was spread on a sideboard the high table was laid for about a dozen the girls to whom the cousins had been presented trooped in after them at the lower table stood the servants the coachman and grooms the gardener and his staff the womenservants the wives and children of the men all sat down together at their table which ran along the middle of the hall before hilaries chair in the middle of the high table stood an ancient ship in silver ready for her use was a silvergilt cup also ancient silver cups stood for each of her guests we all dine together she saidmy friends and i at our table my servants below we are one family my ancestorsher cousins sat on each side of herdined in this fashion there is something in humanity which makes those friends who break bread together it is like a picnic five hundred years back said humphrey i have heard talk all my life about this place my father always intended to visit it but at last grew too old hilarie watched her two guests the taller humphrey had the manners of society he seemed to be what the world justly jealous allows to be a gentleman yet he had a certain coldness of manner and he accepted the beauty of this ancient place without surprise or enthusiasm what are you by profession cousin humphrey she asked nothing as yet i have been travelling since i left cambridge he laid his card before hersir humphrey woodroffe you have the title from your father i hope you will create new distinctions for yourself i suppose he said coldly that i shall go into the house my people seem to want it there are too many cads in the house but it seems that we cannot get through the world without encountering cads he looked through his hostess so to speak and upon the third cousin perhaps accidentally you certainly cannot observed the third for instance i am sitting with you at luncheon you will play something presently dick wont you molly sitting on the other side of the table saw a quick flush upon her friends cheek and hastened to avert further danger one may be a cad but some cads are sensitive to an openly avowed contempt for cads dick laughed all right molly what shall i play something serious befitting the place luncheon is overi will play now if you like he looked down the hall that i suppose is the musicians loft that is the musicians gallery it is a late additionelizabethan i believe the musicians gallery well miss woodroffe i am the music let me play you something in return for the fine ancestors you have given me and for your gracious hospitality he took up his violincase to which he had clung with fidelity marched down the hall climbed up into the gallery and began to tune his fiddle hilarie molly said dick plays in the most lovely way possible he carries you quite out of yourself that is why everybody loves him so however the artist standing up alone in the gallery struck a chord and began to play i suppose that the magic belonged to the fiddle itself it is astonishing what magical powers a fiddle may possess this was the most sympathetic instrument possible it was a thought leader or inspirer the moment it began all the listeners including the servants below the salt sat upright their eyes fixed upon the gallery rapt out of themselves hilarie for her part saw in a vision but with a clearness and distinctness most marvellous her ancestor robert with hilarie his wife they were both wellstricken in years they were standing in the porch with their eldest son his wife and children to receive their visitors and first across the drawbridge rode the great lord archbishop and lord chancellor followed by his retinue when the archbishop dismounted the old man and his wife and the son and his wife and his children went on their knees but the archbishop bade them rise and kissed his parents lovingly meantime the pages and the varlets were unloading packhorses and packmules because the archbishop would not lay upon his father so great a charge as the entertainment of his following and she saw next how the lord mayor and the sheriff his brother rode up side by side the sheriff a little behind the mayor and how they dismounted and knelt for their fathers blessing and so all into the hall together to take counsel for the great things they were minded to do for their native village hilarie turned to her cousin on the right cousin she said still in her dream we must think of our forefathers and of what they did we must ask what the archbishop would have done in our place but her cousin made no reply he was looking with a kind of wonder at molly had the man never seen an attractive girl before he had but out of a thousand attractive girls a man may be attracted by one only and the music went on what was it that the musician played indeed i know not things that awakened the imagination and touched the heart no one knows said molly what he plays only he makes one lost to everything as for herself she had a delicious dream of going on the tramp with dick he and she alonehe to play and she but when she was about to tell this dream she would not confess her part in the tramp the music was over the fiddle was replaced in its case the musician was going away in the porch stood hilarie cousin she said do you go on tramp for pleasure or for necessity for both i must needs go on tramp from time to time there is a restlessness in me i suppose it is in the blood perhaps there was a gipsy once among my ancestors but do you reallyliveby playing to people he neednt said molly but he must he leaves his money at home and carries his fiddle oh heavenly why not i fiddle on village greens and in rustic inns i camp among the gipsies i walk with the tramps and casuals there is no more pleasant life believe me he began to sing in a light musical tenor when daffodils began to peer with heigh the doxy over the dale why then comes in the sweet o the year for the red blood reigns in the winters pale the lark that tirralirra chants with heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay are summer songs for me and my aunts while we lie tumbling in the hay you are a strange man said hilarie come and see me again i am a vagabond he replied and my name is autolycus dick took off his hat and bowed low not in piccadilly style at all he waved his hand to molly he glared defiance at humphrey who loftily bent his head and then catching up his violincase he started off with a step light and elastic humphrey the other cousin half an hour later stood beside his carriage i must congratulate myself he said on the good fortune which has presented me to the head of my family to two cousins say oh i fancy we shall not see much of autolycus meanwhile since you kindly grant me permission i hope to call upon you again i shall be very pleased as he drove away his last look was not on hilarie but on the girl beside herthe girl called mollythe nymph attendant some the goddess charms but more the nymph attendant what was she doing with all those girls he asked making a home for them or some such beastly nonsense i suppose chapter iv the consultingroom the doctors servant opened the door noiselessly almost stealthily and looked round the room there were half a dozen people waiting one was an excolonial governor who had been maintaining the empire with efficiency in many parts of the world for thirty years and was now anxious to keep himself alive for a few years in the seclusion of a seaside town if certain symptoms could be kept down there was a middleaged victim to gout there was an elderly sufferer from rheumatism there was an anmic girl there was a young fellow who looked the picture of health and sitting at one of the windows there was a lady richly dressed her pale face with delicate features of the kind which do not grow old looking anxious and expectant they were all anxious and expectant they feared the worst and hoped the best one looked out of window seeing nothing one gazed into the fireplace not knowing whether there was a fire in it one turned over the pages of a society journal reading nothing all were thinking of their symptoms for those who wait for the physician there is nothing in the whole world to consider except symptoms they have got to set forth their symptoms to the physician they have to tell the truth that is quite clear still the plain truth can be dressed up a little it can be presented with palliatives a long course of strong drinks may figure as a short course of weak whiskyandsoda perhaps the danger after all is not so grave patients waiting for the doctor are like persons waiting to be tried for life can a man take any interest in anything who awaits his trial for lifewho hopes for an acquittal but fears a capital sentence the doctors manservant looked round the room and then glided like a black ghost across the thick carpet he stopped before the lady in the window sir robert madam will see you there are some who maintain that the success of this eminent physician sir robert steele md frs is largely due to the virtues of his manservant certainly this usher of the chamber this guardian of the portal this receiver of those who bring tribute has no equal in the profession in his manner is the respect due to those who know where the only great physician is to be found there is also an inflexible and incorruptible obedience to the laws of precedence or order of succession thirdly there is a soft a velvety note of sympathy in his voice as one who would say be of good cheer sufferer i bring thee to one who can relieve thou shalt not suffer long the rest of the patients looked at each other and sighed he who would follow next sighed with increasing anxiety his fate would soon be known he who had yet to wait several turns sighed with impatience it is hard to be tormented with anxiety as well as with pain those symptoms again they may be the final call did christiana when the call came repair first in the greatest anxiety to a physician or they may be only passing clouds so to speak calling attention to the advance of years the doctor in his consultingroom held a card in his handmrs john haveril the name was somehow familiar to him he could not remember at the moment the associations of the name a physician you see may remember if he pleases so many names to every mans memory belongs a long procession of figures and faces with eyes and voices but most men work alone think of the procession in the memory of a physician who all day long sees new faces and hears new voices haveril he knew the name was she the wife of a certain american millionaire lately spoken of in the papers the doctor madam will see you the lady rose and followed him all the patients watched her with the same kind of curiosity as is shown by those waiting to be tried towards the man who is called to the honours of the dock they observed that she was strangely agitated that she walked with some difficulty that she tottered as she went that her lips trembled and her hands shook locomotor ataxis whispered one i myself or perhaps a breakup of the nervous system it is my own but the door was shut and the patients in waiting relapsed into silence the lady followed the manservant who placed a chair for her and withdrew instead of sitting down the patient stepped forward and gazed into the doctors face then she clasped her hands thank god she cried he is the man i do not understand madam i see so many faces the nameis it an american name you think of my husband but i am englishborn and so is he well mrs haveril even the richest of us get our little disorders what is yours i have been very ill doctor but it was not for that that i came here then madam i do not understand why you do come here you dont remember me but i see that you dont her trembling ceased when she began to speak yet i remember you very well you have changed very little in four and twenty years indeed i heard some people at the hotel talking about you they said you were the first man in the world for some complaints and i remembered your name andandi wondered if you were the man and you are the man this is a very busy morning madam if you would kindly come to the point at once what do you want with me doctor i once had a childa boythe finest boy you ever saw it is not unusual the doctor began but stopped because the womans face was filled with a great trouble but pray go on madam i had a boy she repeated and burst into a flood of tears the doctor inclined his head there is no other answer possible when a complete stranger bursts into tears from some unknown cause i lost the boy she proceeded iii lost the boy he died she shook her head no but i lost my boy she repeated my husband deserted me i was alone in a strange town my relations had cast me off because i married an actor i was penniless and i could find no work i sold the boy to save him from the workhouse and to get the money to follow my husband good heavens i remember it was at birmingham your husbands name waswas his professional name was anthony truetrue i remember it all yesyes the child was taken by a lady i remember it perfectly and you are the deserted wife and the rich american is your husband no i followed my husband from place to place but i had to cross the atlantic i came up with him in a town in a western state when i found him he got a divorce for incompatibility of temper i lost both my husband and my child and neither of them died oh and thenthen you came back to look for the boy no i married john haveril it was before he made his money and now you come to me for information about the child who must be a man by this time ive never forgotten him doctor i never can forget him every day since then i have thought of him i said now hes six now hes ten now hes twenty and ive tried to think of him as he grew up alwaysalways i have had the boy in my mind yes but surely perhaps you had no more children no never any more and last spring i fell illvery ill i was what was the matter she told him the symptoms yes nerves of course fretting after the child you know the american doctor did not well and while i was lying in my dark room i had a dream it came again it kept on coming a dream which told me that i should see my child again if i came to london so my husband brought me over and you think that you will find your child i am sure that i shall it is the only thing that i have prayed for oh you need not warn me about excitement i know the danger i dont care so very much about living but i want that dream to come true i must find the boy you might as well look for him at the bottom of the sea why my dear lady your boy was intended to take the place of a dead child i am sure he was i know nothing at all about him there is no clueno chance of finding the child do you know nothing upon my honour madam i cannot even guess the lady did not give me her name and i made no inquiries oh her face fell i had such hopes at the theatre yesterday i saw a young man who might have been my sontall fair blueeyed oh do you know nothing nothing at all he replied decidedly and you came here he went on remembering my name and wondering whether it was the same man well mrs haveril it is the same man and i remember the whole business perfectly now go on where is that child doctor i say that i dont know i never did know the lady gave me the money received the child at the railway station you brought it to the waitingroom she had an indian ayah with her and the train carried her off baby and all that is all i can tell you mrs haveril sighed is that all madam since such precautions were taken it is very certain that no one knew of the matter except the lady herself and she will certainly not tell because as i have already told you the case looked like substitution and not adoption what can i do then you can do nothing i would advise you to put the whole business out of your head and forget it you can do nothing i cannot forget it i wish i could the wickedness of it oh to give away my own child only to run after that villain my dear lady is it well to allow one single episode to ruin your life consider your duty to your second husband you should bring him happiness not anxiety consider your splendid fortune if the papers are true you are worth many millions the papers are quite true you yourself are still comparatively youngnot more than five and forty i should say time has dealt tenderly with you when i knew you in birmingham you were a girl still with a delicate beautiful face how could your husband desert you your face is still delicate and still beautiful you become the silks and satins as you then became your cottons resign yourself to twenty years more of happiness and luxury as for that weakness of yours it will vanish if you avoid excitement and agitation if notwhat did your american adviser warn you she rose reluctantly i cannot forget she said i must go on remembering but the dream was true it was sent doctor it was sent and the first step i am sure and certain was to lead me here after a solitary dinner sir robert sat by the fire in his diningroom a novel lay on a chair beside him like many scientific men he was a great reader of novels for the moment he was simply looking into the fire while his thoughts wandered this way and that he had seen about twenty patients in the course of the day and made in consequence forty guineas he was perfectly satisfied with the condition of his practice he was under no anxiety about his reputation his mind was quite at ease concerning himself from every point of view he was thinking of this and of thatthings indifferentwhen suddenly he saw before him by the light of the four candles on the table the ghost of a date the figures in fact stood out luminous against the dark mahogany of his massive sideboard december he rubbed his eyes the figures disappeared he lay back the figures came again its a trick of memory he said what have i done today that could suggest this date the only important event of the day was the visit of his old patient and the reminder about a certain adoption in which he had taken a part was the date connected with that event he got up and went into his consultingroom there on a shelf among many companions he found his notebook of he remembered the time was winter it was early in the year he turned over the pages he came to his notes he read these words child must have light hair blue eyes agemust be born as nearly as possible to december date of dead childs birth thats the date sure enough he said and the brains just been working round to it without my knowledgeof its own accordstarted by that poor woman humph he put back the notebook and returned to the diningroom he sat down by the fire again crossed his feet lay back took up the novel and prepared for a comfortable hour in vain that business of the adoption came back to him the letters on the page melted into dissolving views he saw the poor woman crying over the child and clutching at the money which would save the boy from the workhouse and carry her to her husband he saw the indian ayah taking the child from him and the lady bowing coldly from the railway carriage a lady through and through said the doctor the torn envelope was addressed to lady she was a woman of title then he got up on the bookshelves of the diningroom was a red book now he said if i go right through this book from beginning to end and if i should find the heir to something or lord somebody born on december i shall probably come upon the victim of this conspiracyif there has been a conspiracy luckily he began at the end at the letter z before long under the fourth letter from the end he read as follows woodroffe sir humphrey arundale second baronet born at poonah december son of sir humphrey armitage woodroffe first baronet gcb gcmg formerly lieutgovernor of bengal by lilias daughter of the fifteenth lord dunedin succeeded his father in educated at eton and trinity college cambridge is a captain in the worcestershire militia residence crowleigh worcestershire and bryanston square london clubs junior united travellers and oriental thats my man cried the doctor with some natural excitement i believe ive found him then there has been substitution after all and not adoption but good lord its lady woodroffe lady woodroffe its the writer and orator and leader oh purity oh temperance oh charity what would the world say if the world only knew he threw the book aside and sat down i told that woman he reflected that i knew nothing about the lady who carried off her child well i did not know then but i do know now must i tell her why disturb things she can never find out let her go back to her adopted land and as for thisthis substitutioni promised solemnly that i would not speak about the business even if i were to chance upon that lady without her leave my dear mrs haveril go home to america and forget the boy who is now the second baronet go home it will be best for your health the first step she said strange the first step but not for you dear lady not for you chapter v guest night i am glad to see you again cousin humphrey it was two months after the meeting in the churchyard hilaries house was full her guests overflowed into the village it was in fact the first guest night of the season this is the beginning of term she said you shall make acquaintance with the college i have heard something about your college he looked round the room which was the ladys bower as if in search of some one you can take me in and i will tell you more about it during dinner there were more than the houseparty the place is within an hour of victoria and a good many friends of the students had come out by train to see what the college was like what it meant and if it had come to stay a new social experiment always draws first it attracts the social wobblers who continually run after the last new gospel then it attracts those who watch social experiments from the outside thirdly it attracts the new woman herself those who are curious about the new woman and those who hate the new woman lastly it attracts those who are always in search of material for copy for all these reasons the guests present wore that expression of countenance called by their friends thoughtful it should rather be called uncertain they looked about curiously as if to find traces of the experiment in the furniture on the walls in the students dresses they listened in order to catch the note of the experiment in the air they cast suspicious looks to right and to left as expecting something to be sprung upon them to be invited at all was to make them realize that they were in the very van and forefront of contemporary intellect it also imposed upon them the difficult task of pronouncing a judgment without a lead now without a lead these philosophers are uncertain hence the aspect and appearance of the guests this evening they did not know what to think or what to say of the collegeno one had yet given them a lead they were uncertain and they would be expected to pronounce a judgment the oracle who waits for a lead is common among us he takes himself seriously he is said by his friends to have made the most of himself not that he has distinguished himself in any way but he has made the best out of poor materials and he would have made himself a good deal bigger and better had the materials been richer as it is he reads all the thoughtful papers in all the magazines he writes thoughtful papers of his own which he finds a difficulty in placing he sometimes gets letters into the papers giving reasons why he being a very little man cannot agree with some great man this makes his chin to stick out he even contrives to get people to read his letters as if it matters a brass farthing whether he agrees or does not agree over a new social experiment once he has got a lead this oracle is perfectly happy we will talk presently said hilarie turning to welcome new guests humphrey stepped aside and looked on while the room filled up the students he remarked who were all dressed in white with ribbons of their own individual choice appeared to be a cheerful company of damsels to be sure cheerfulness belongs to their time of life and to the profession of student about which there should cling a certain lawless joyousnessa buoyancy not found in the domestic circle a touch of the barrack something of the camp because they are recruits in the armies that fight against ignorance and prejudice these whiterobed students were full of cheerfulness which bubbled over in laughter and happy faces one is told that in some colleges there are students entirely given over to their studies who wear dowdy dresses who push back their hair anyhow behind their spectacles who present faces of more than possible thoughtfulness here there were none such none were oppressed with study rightly considered every college for young persons should be interesting we have forgotten that there used formerly to be colleges for old persons for priests as jesus commons and the papey on london wall for physicians for surgeons for serjeantsatlaw for debtors as the fleet for the decayed as an almshouse for criminals as newgate for paupers as the workhouse a college for girls is naturally more interesting than one for young men first because they are girls next because the male college contains so much that is disquietingambition and impatience with effort strenuous endeavour to conciliate fame a goddess who presents to all comers at first a deaf ear eyes that see nothing and a trumpet silently dangling at her wrist the resolution to compel fortune even against her will to turn round that wheel which is to bear them up aloft the strength of these ambitions stimulates the airyou may note this effect in any of the courts at cambridge one remembers also that in most cases fame however persistently wooed continues to dangle the silent trumpet while fortune however passionately invoked refuses to turn the wheel and that the resolution and determination of the petitioner go for nothing one observes also that the courts of the colleges are paved with shattered resolutions which make a much better pavement than the finest granite one remembers also that there are found in the young mans college the prig and the smug the wallower the sloth the creeping thing and the contented creature but pass across the road to the womans college heavens what possibilities are there what ambitions are hers for her field is not mans field though some pretend not hers to direct the throbbing engine and make that thing of steel a thing of intelligence not hers to command a fleet not hers to make the laws she does not construct lighthouses she does not create new sciences she does not advance the old she never invents nor creates nor advances she receives she adapts she distributes how great are her possibilities though she neither creates nor invents she may become a queen of song a queen of the stage a great painter a great novelist a great poetgreat at artistic work of every kind or again while her brother is slowly and painfully working his way up so that he will become a qc at forty a judge at sixty the girl steps at once by marriage into a position that dazzles her friends and becomes a queen of society a patron of art a power in politics far be it from me to suppose that the maidens of any college dream of possibilities such as these perhaps however the possibilities of maidenhood are never quite forgotten there is another possibility also every great man has a mother do maidens ever dream of the supreme happiness of having a great man for a son which would a woman prefer the greatest honour and glory and distinction ever won by woman for herself or to be the mother of a tennyson a gordon a huxley now my cousin said hilarie the dinner is served so two by two they went into the old hall it had been decorated since the summer the lower part was covered with tapestry the upper part was hung with armour and old weapons there were also portraits imaginary and otherwise of women wise and women famous queen elizabeth was there joan of arc was there george sand george eliot elizabeth barrett browning jane austen grace darling rosa bonheur and many others the male observer remarked with a sense of omission the absence of those queens of beauty whose lamentable lives make history so profoundly interesting where were rosamond agnes sorel la vallire nell gwynne alas they were not admitted the house said the president taking her seat is much larger than it looks with the solar and the ladys bower and the tower we have arranged dormitories for forty and half a dozen sittingrooms besides this hall which is used all day long the musicians gallery had been rebuilt and painted it contained an organ now and a piano besides room for an orchestra six of the students were sitting there with violins and a harp ready to discourse soft music during the banquet there were three tables running down the hall with the high table and all were filled with an animated joyous crowd of guests and residents i want to interest you in my college hilarie began when they were seated humphrey examined the menu he observed that it was an artistic attemptan intelligent effort at a harmony if only the execution should prove equal to the conception at present of course we are only beginning what are you yourself doing however i followhumblyart there is nothing else i paint i write verse i compose do you exhibit exhibit court the empty praises or the empty sneers of an ignorant press never i show my pictures to my friends we confide our work to each other hilarie smiled and murmured something inaudible and we keep the outer world outside you i fearhe looked down the roomadmit the outer world you lose a great deal for instance if this mob was out of your lovely house i might bring my friends it would be an ideal place for our pictures and our music and for the acting of our plays i fear the mob must remain hilarie began to doubt whether her college would appeal after all to this young man what we should aim at in life the artist continued is art without humanity i should have said that humanity is the basis of all art her cousin shook his head not true artthat is bodiless i fear you do not yet belong to us no i belong to these girls who are anything but bodiless your college i take it has something to do with helping people certainly my own view is that you cannot help people you may give them things but you only make them want more people have got to help themselves did you help yourself oh i am born to what my forefathers acquired as for these girls to whom you are giving things you will only make them discontented the president of the college looked round the hall there were forty white frocks encasing as many girls students at her college and as many guests there was a cheerful ripple of talk one thought of a dancing sea in the sunlight there were outbursts of laughterlight musical one thought of the white crests of the waves in the musicgallery the girls played softly and continuously one thought of the singing of birds in the coppice the dinner was already half finished there is a solid simplicity about these guest nights a short dinner with jellies ices and puddings most commends itself to the feminine heart let me tell you my design at least i saw that in this revolution of society going on so rapidly around us all classes of women are rushing into work a woman who works ceases to be a woman humphrey spoke and shuddered i think of my greatgrandmother hilarie wife of robert who lies buried in our church she sat with her maids in the ladys bower and embroidered she administered everythingthe food and the drink and the raiment she made them all behave with decency she brought up the children and taught them right and wrong above all she civilized today as yesterday and tomorrow and always it is the duty of woman to civilize she is the everlasting priestess this is therefore a theological college her cheek flushed her eye brightened she turned her head as if suspecting that she had said too much her cousin seemed not to have heard he was in fact absorbed in partridge now that all women want to work will they continue to civilize i know not yet how things may go they all want to work they try to work whether they are fit for it or not they take mens work at a quarter the pay i know not how it will end they turn the men adrift they drive them out of the country and then congratulate themselvespoor fools and for themselves i chiefly dread their hardening the woman who tries to turn herself into a man is a creature terribleunnatural i know the ideal woman of the past i cannot find the ideal woman of the present there isnt any if we surrender the sacerdotal functions what have we in exchange i dont know the manner meant i dont care but hilarie hardly observed the manner i cannot alter the conditions cousin that is quite true but there are some things which can be done hilarie went on at this point to tell a story for one who could read between the lineswhich her cousin certainly could notof a girl dominated partly by a sense of responsibility and duty one who being rich must do something with her wealth partly by that passion for power which is developed in some heartsnot allby the possession of wealth and partly by a deep sympathy with the sufferings and sorrows of her impecunious sisters there are always as we know at every moment of life two courses open to usthe right and the wrong or if the choice is not so elementary the better and the worse but there comes to those of the better sort one supreme moment when we seem to choose the line which will lead to honour or the line which will lead to obscurity to the common sort the choice is only apparent not real men and women are pushed pulled dragged shoved either in the way of fortune or in the way of failure by circumstances and conditions beyond our control to them there is no free will when the time of repentance arrives we think that we choose freely the majority cannot choose their lives are ordered for them with their sins and their follies they might choose but they are not able they cannot see before them or around them a fog lies about their steps they stumble along with the multitude getting now and then a pleasant bit now and then a thorny bit some walk delicately along a narrow way which is grassy and flowery where the babbling brooks run with champagne and the spicy breezes are laden with the fragrance of melons peaches and roast lamb some march and stagger along the broad way thirsty and weary where there is no refreshment of brooks or of breezes it is an unequal world such a supreme moment came to hilarie after long consideration i thought she explained that if the archbishop and his brethren were living today they would do something for the women who work her cousin slowly drank a glass of champagne yes he asked without much affectation of interest i thought that if the archbishop were living he would like to found a collegenot for priests nor for old villagers but for girls not to teach anything but to give them a place where they can go and stay in this college we do not teach anything there are no lectures we need not do any work unless we please every girl does exactly what she pleases some study some paintnot after your school i fear some practise music in fact they do just what they please i believe that at least a dozen are writing novels two or three are writing verse one or two are working for examinations in the evening we amuse ourselves you give them all this certainly they come here whenever they please and they can stay here for three months or more if there is necessity in three words my cousin i maintain an establishment of forty guests and i fear i shall have to increase the number and whats the good of it when the archbishop built his school he argued first that education is good even for the swineherd next that with education follow manners and thirdly that it was good for himself to give so you see it is good for the girls to get the rest and quiet living thus all together in a college raises their standard of thought and manners and thirdly it is good for me as it was the archbishop to give i do not feel myself any call to give anybody anything meantime i keep before myself the great function of woman she is i say the eternal priestess she compels men into ways of gentleness and courtesy she inspires great thoughts by way of love she leads to the upper heights but you do not feel these things i do not i confess if the girls must work i want them ever to keep before themselves the task laid upon them they have hitherto civilized man from the home they must now civilize him from the workshop that my cousin is the meaning of this college youve got some rather pretty girls in the place said humphrey oh pretty what has that to do with it the music ceased there was a general lull the guests all leaned back in their chairs the president knocked with her ivory hammer and they all returned to the ladys bower in the drawingroom humphrey left the president to the people who pressed in upon her and wandered round the room looking apparently for some one presently he discovered surrounded by a company of men the girl who was called molly she too was dressed in white and wore a cherrycoloured ribbon round her neck a dainty damsel she looked conspicuous for this lovely quality of daintiness among them all at sight of her the young man coloured and his eye brightened then his face clouded however he made his way to her she stepped out of the circle and gave him her hand it is a week and more he whispered since i have seen you why not say at once that you dont care about it any longer you are welcome to the college sir humphrey she replied aloud confess that it is a pretty sight the president was talking to you about it all dinnertime i hope that you are interested i think it is all tomfoolery he replied ungraciously and a waste of good money too hilarie wants money to make happiness you do not look in the best of tempers humphrey i am not i couldnt get enough to drink and i have had to listen to a lot of stuff about women and priestesses good stuff should not be thrown away should it like good pearls i want to talk to youaway from this rabble where can we go i will take you over the college she led the way into the library a retired place where she sat down do you ask how i am getting on no i dont he remained standing youll never go on the stage with my consent we shall see by her quick dancing eye by her mobile lips by the brightness of her quaint attractive face which looked as if it could be drawn into shapes like an indiarubber face she belied his prophecy besides hilarie wants me to become a tragic actress please remember once more humphrey that what hilarie wishes i must do i owe everything to hilarieeverything you drive me mad with your perverseness molly i am going to please myself please understand that even if i were engaged to you i would keep my independence if you dont like that take back your offer take it back at once she held out both her hands as if she was carrying it about you know i cant molly i love you too much though you are a little devil then let me alone if one is born in a theatre one belongs to a theatre i would rather be born in a theatre than in a west end square humphrey you make me sorry that i ever listened to you well go and listen to that fiddler fellow who calls you molly curse his impudence oh if you had been only born differently you belong to the people who are all alike you sit in the stalls in a row as if you were made after the same pattern you expect the same jokes you take the same too much champagne you are like the pebbles of the seashore all rounded alike well what would you have the actors and show folkmy folkare all different as for kind hearts how can you know with your tables spread every day and your champagne running like water theres no charity where theres no poverty i dont pretend to any charity it is a dreadful thing to be born rich you might have been so different if you had had nothing then you wouldnt have listened to me thank you listening doesnt mean consenting you cannot withdraw you are promised to me only on conditions you want me to be engaged secretly well i wont you want me to marry you secretly well i wont you are engaged to me i am not and i dont think now that i ever shall be it flattered me at first having a man in your position following around i should like to be my lady but i cant see any happiness in it you belong to a different world not to my world i will lift you into my world it looks more like tumbling down than getting lifted up there is still time however to back out if you dare to maintain that i ever said yes ill say no on the spot there this sweet and loving conversation explains itself every one will understand it the girl lived in a boardinghouse where she took lessons from an old actress in preparation for the stage from time to time she went to stay with her friendher benefactresswho had found her after her fathers death penniless at her country house she met as we have seen her old friend dick and the other cousin the second meeting outside the boardinghouse which the latter called and she believed to be accidental led to other meetings they were attended by the customary results that is by an ardent declaration of love the girl was flattered by the attentions of a young man of position and apparent wealth she listened to the tale she found presently that her lover was not in every respect what a girl expects in a lover his ideas of love were not hers he turned out to be jealous but that might prove the depth and sincerity of his love suspicious which argued a want of trust in her ashamed to introduce her to his own people anxious to be engaged first and married next in secrecy avowedly selfish worshipping false gods in the matter of art and science and worst of all illtempered and boorish in his ill temper lastly she was at this stage rapidly making the discovery that not even for a title and a carriage and a west end square ought she to marry a man she was unable to respect we will now go back to the ladys bower she said this talk humphrey will have to last a long while chapter vi the old lover my dear dick molly ran into the diningroom of her dingy boardinghouse which was also the receptionroom for visitors at last i thought you were never coming to see me again it has been a long summer i only came home last night sit down and let me look at you she put him in a chair and turned his face to the light familiarly holding it by the chin you look very well dick you are browned by the summers sun thats all she released his chin and lightly boxed his ears they had always been on very friendly terms these two well dick tell me about your summer has it been prosperous have you had adventures she laughed because she knew very well the kind of adventures that this young man desired adventures come to the adventurous molly oh how i envied you that day when you turned up among the tombs covered all over with dust looking so fit and going so free if i were only a man to go off with you on the tramp i wish you were molly we would go off together ive often thought of it you should carry a mandoline i would stick to the fiddle we would take a room at the inn and have a little show you should dance and sing and twang the mandoline i should play the fiddle and do the patter we should have a rare time molly we should oh we should do you remember that time when daddy let me go with him and you came too i do i remember how charming you looked even then you were about fourteen you wore a red flannel cap you used to take off your shoes and stockings whenever we came to a brook and wade in it with your pretty bare feet and we rested on the trunks of trees in the woods and had dinner in the open and you talked to all the gipsies in their own language and one night we sat round their fire and had some of their stew for supper oh and we listened to the birds and made nosegays of honeysuckle and the people came to the inn at night while you played the fiddle and daddy sang comic songs and did conjuring tricks oh what a time it was and you danced dont forget your dance molly i taught you that dance the girl laughed merrily then she threw herself into the attitude common to all dancinggirls in all ages and all countriesthe arms held out and the foot pointed i havent forgotten it dicky i only wish i could forget it she sighed it would be better for me if i could if we could go away together molly he took her hand and held it dont dick dont you make me feel a longing for the road and the country theres nothing like it molly darlin nothing when the summer comes im off all the winter i live in a lonely flat and am respectable as respectable as you can be dick well i put on dress clothes and get engagements i dont mind so that in summer i can be a tramp and a rogue and a vagabond not a rogue dick i was born behind the scenes in a circus at st louis before my worthy parent ran away from his wife its in the blood i suppose i dont care molly what they say he sprang to his feet and began to walk about there is no life like it we dont want money we dont try to be gentlefolk were not cooped up in cages all weve got to do is to amuse the people were not stupid were not dull were not selfish we are contented with a little were never tired of it were always trying some new business my poor molly youre out of it pity pity he sat down again shaking his head and you born to itactually born to it well im to have the next best thing to it im to be an actress at any rate an actress well thats something tell me about it molly a serious actressa tragic actress its all settled im to show the world the real inwardness of shakespeare im to be the light and lamp of all other actresses im to be another siddons you another siddons oh molly he laughed but not convincingly the part of the scoffer was new to him you with that face with those lips with those eyes my child you might be another nelly farren but never another siddons the girl laughed too but only for a moment then she became serious its got to be dick dont tempt me dont make me unhappy it would grieve hilarie awfully if i failed or changed my mindwhich is her mind my cousin hilarie hasnt the complete disposal of your life has she she ought to have because she saved my life what should i have done dick when daddy died and left me without a penny there are relations about i dare say but i dont know where my only chance was to get in somewhere you were away what could i do eighteenpence a night to go on no no not with that crew molly there hilarie found me and she thinks she is doing the best thing in the world for me when she gets me taught to be a tragedy queen you shall be a great actress molly you shall rake in fifty pounds a week and you shall wear long chains of diamonds if you like ive got ambition enough if that counts for anything i like that part of it where the great actress sweeps across the stage with all the people shouting and clapping why when daddy took me to the pit and i used to watch the leading lady marching majesticallylike thiswith her long train sweeping it backsoi resolved to be an actress and when she spoke the lines i didnt care twopence about the sense if they had any i was thinking all the time how grand she looked and how splendid it must be to have all the world in love with you you shall have it mollyif you like that is you were always ready to think about fellows being in love with you were you not why not the stories and the plays and the songs are all about love a girl cant help wanting all the world to be in love with her at the theatre i used to see love and admiration on every mans face the womens faces were not so full of love i noticed oh you noticed that did you at so early an age wonderful and now dick now you see ive found out that it means work and after all the work it may mean failure sometimes i thinkdick i dont mind saying everything to yougirls who are beautifullike me in my waywere never intended to work they were to be rewarded for their good looks byyou knowthe prince dick sometimes it comes off dick replied thoughtfully there was claribel winthropjane perks her real name wasin one of my country companies she married a young lord but she worked desperately hard for it all of us looked on and backed her up it might come off that way but i should be sorry molly youre born for better things you ought to have an empty purse what should you say dick if it was to come off that way is there a young lord then already he changed colour he isnt a lord but he is not far off dick and i can have him if i like what sort of a fellow molly oh be very careful it is the devil and all if he isnt the right sort do you like him his face twisted as if he could not find it in his heart to like him hes a baronet hes young he wants to conceal things his mother doesnt like show folk he thinks most people are cads hes rich you dont mean to say its that cousin of minenot sir humphrey she nodded her head you dont like him i know im afraid hes got a temper and i dont know if i shall be able to put up with him you havent promised have you he says i have but i havent really i am always reminding him that there is still time to draw back but dick think to have plenty of money to be independent dick groaned its the greatest temptation in the world eves apple was made of gold and after shed got it she couldnt eat it you think of that molly you cant eat a golden apple now i could give you a real delicious ribstone pippin he sat down beside her and took her hand again its very serious my dear it is the manner of the stage to address the ladies so it means nothing whether it is also the manner to take their hands i know not you must be very careful molly will my other cousin hilarie advise its a secret so far but dont think about it dick ive got to please hilarie first the young man will have to be considered next well if theres nothing fixed molly i dont like the fellow i own i dont like any of the lot who talk about outsiders and cads as if they were a different order still if it makes you happymolly i swear theres nothing i wouldnt consent to if it would make you happy the tears stood in his eyes my dear dick she said theres nobody cares for me so much as you and the tears stood in her eyes as well the young man let go her hand and stood up thats enough mollyso long as we understand now tell me about the studies are you really working really working but oh dick my trouble is that the harder i work the more i feel as if it isnt there i do exactly what i am told to do and it doesnt come off but when you used to sing and dance oh anybody could make people laugh the actor groaned she saysanybody and she can do it and they put her into tragedy whenever i try to feel the emotion myself it vanishes and i can only feel myself in white satin with a long train sweeping to the back of the stage and all the house in love with me this is bad this is very bad molly see here dick im telling you all my troubles i am studying the part of desdemonayou know desdemona who married a black man how could sheand of course he was jealous ive got to show all kinds of emotion before that beast of a husband kills me its a fine partnone finer once i saw it played magnificently she was in a travelling company and she died of typhoid poor thing yes i can see her now he acted as he spoke she was full of forebodings her husband was cold her distress of mind was shown in the way she took up trifles and put them down again she spoke she knew not what and sang snatches of song in her eyes stood tears her voice trembled she moved about uneasily she clutched at her dress in agitation the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow why cried the girl you make me feel ityouonly with talking about it and ialas have i any feeling in me at all dick oh yes its thereits there all right theres tragedy in the most unpromising materials if you know how to get at it i think a womans got to be in love first its a very fine thing for an actress to fall in lovethe real thing i mean then comes jealousy of course and after that all the real tragedy emotions oh love the girl repeated with scorn try again now you know the words molly began to repeat the lines my mother had a maid called barbara she was in love and he she loved proved mad and forsook her she had a song of willow she declaimed these lines with certain gestures which had been taught her she broke off leaving the rest unfinished the effect was wooden there was no pity no sorrow no foreboding in the lines at all dick shook his head what am i to say to hilarie she asked dick passed his fingers through his hair then he sat down again and began to laughlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks you a tragedy queen he said not even if you were over head and ears in love now on the other hand if i had my fiddle in my hand and were to playsothat air which you rememberhe put out his legs straight and sat upright and pretended the conduct of a fiddle and bowcould you dance do you think as you used to dance two years ago she stood before him seeming to listen then she gently moved her head as if touched by the music then she raised her arms and began to dance with such ease and grace and lightness as can only belong to the dancer born thank you molly he stood up as if the music was over we shall confer further upon this pointand other points when may i come again to visit miss molly pennefather he caught her head in his hands and kissed her gaily on her foreheadafter all he had no more manners than can be expected of a trampand vanished if dick could only play desdemona she murmured looking after him at the closed door why he actually looked the part i suppose he has been in love if i could only do it so she imitated his gestures and broke out into singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow no she said it wont do i dont feel a bit like desdemona i am only myself and i am filled with the most unholy longing for moneyfor riches for filthy lucre which we are told to despise her eyes fell upon a newspaper folded and lying on the floor it had probably dropped out of dicks pocket she took it up mechanically and opened it expecting nothing the sheet was one of the gossipy papers of the day full of personal paragraphs she glanced at it thinking of the paragraphs about herself and her grand success which would probably never appear unless she could transform herself presently her eye caught the word millionaire and she read among the nouveaux richesthe millionaires of the westwe must not as englishmen forget to enumerate mr john haveril who has made his money partly by transactions in silvermines and partly by the sudden creation of a town on his own lands he is said to be worth no more than two or three millions sterling so that he is not in the very front rank of american rich men still there is a good deal of spending even in so moderate a fortune mr haveril is by birth an englishman and a yorkshireman he was born about sixty years ago and emigrated about the year his wife is also of english origin having been born at hackney her maiden name was alice pennefather molly looked up in bewilderment there cant be two people of that name she said she went on with the paper they have no children to inherit their wealth they have arrived in london and have taken rooms at the htel mtropole that was all she put the paper on the table alice pennefather why she must be the alice who disappeareddads first cousin but alice married an actor named anthony dad gave her away he often wondered what had become of her this mr haveril is a second husband i suppose and now shes a millionairess i think i might go and call upon her at the htel mtropole i will chapter vii the master of the situation the lady looked at the card sir richard steele md frs and in the corner harley street w who is sir richard steele her visitor came upstairs he stood before her and bowed i was right he said i remember your face perfectly but you do not appear to remember me lady woodroffe indeed sir richard but if you will refresh my memory i have to recall to you an incident in your life which happened four and twenty years ago that is a long time ago so far she suspected nothing yes but you cannot have forgotten it i have called lady woodroffe against my wish to remind you of a certain adoption of a child a few days after the death of your own boy at birmingham just about four and twenty years ago it is impossible that you have forgotten the incident i see that you have not for the suddenness of the thing fell upon her like a paralytic stroke she sat motionless with parted lips and staring eyes you have not forgotten it he repeated sir she said forcing herself to speak you talk of things of which i know nothing what child what adoption why do you come here with such a story let me remind you again you were passing through birmingham with your child and an indian ayah the child was taken ill and died you called at my surgeryi was then a small general practitioner in a poor quarter of birminghamyou asked me if i could procure a child for adoption i understood that it was perhaps for consolation i guessed that it was perhaps for substitution you told me that the child was to have light hair and blue eyes and for age it was to correspond tolerably nearly with that of your own lost child whose birthdate you gave medecember the nd i have the date in my notebook now do you remember anything about it nothing she replied with pale face and set lips nothing i found you out only yesterday by means of this date i was reminded of the date and i suspected substitution i therefore looked through the red book and i came to the name of the present baronet he was born it is stated on december the exact date on which your own child was born i looked out your address i am here i remember you perfectly and i now find that my suspicions were correct do you accuse me of substituting a strange child for my own she spoke in words of indignation but in a voice of terror i merely state what happeneda transaction in which i took part that is all so far where is your proof i deny everything prove what you say it is very easy i recognize in you the lady who conducted the business with me i took the child myself to the railway station i gave the child to the ayah who took it to the carriage in which you were sitting proof what kind of proof is that you look in the red book you find a date and you make up a story a man in my position does not make up stories i am no longer a general practitioner i am one of the leaders of my profession i am no longer either obscure or poor i have nothing whatever to gain by telling this story then sir why do you come to me with it at all partly out of curiosity i was curious to ascertain whether chance had directed me to the right quarter i am satisfied on that score partly i came in order to warn you that the story may possibly be brought to light how how since you are not concerned it doesnt matter does it i may as well go but he did not move from his chair so far as i am concerned there is no truth in it in that case i can do nothing except to tell the person who is inquiring what i know i can send her to you consider again if you please there is no reason for me to hide my share in the transactionnot the least and if you continue to declare that you are not the purchaser of the baby i am freed from the promise i made at the time to maintain silence until you yourself shall think fit to release me from my promise who is inquiring then is the story true the lady hesitated she quailed the physician looked her in the face with eyes of authority his voice was gentle but his words were strong you must confess he said or i shall leave you if you continue to deny the fact i repeat that i shall feel myself absolved from my promise it is true she murmured and buried her face in her hands i only wanted the confirmation from your own lips now lady woodroffe be under no anxiety i hope that this is the only occasion on which we shall discuss a subject naturally painful to you she sat without reply abashed and humiliated i remember he said speaking to you then on the subject of heredity let me ask you if the boy has turned out well no he turned out badly about his qualities now his father was artistic in a way he could sing play and act this boy plays pretty well he makes things which he calls songs and smudges which he calls paintings he is a prig of bad art and consorts with other young prigs his mother was i remember tenacious honest and careful the boy is obstinate and illconditioned her qualities in excess his father was handsome selfish and unprincipled the boy is also handsome selfish and unprincipled humph you speak bitterly lady woodroffe you know what i am what i write what i advocate the whole world knows that imagine then what i suffer daily oh how strong must be the force of hereditary vice when it breaks out after such an education it should make you a little more lenient lady woodroffe your last papers on the exceeding wickedness of man would be less severe if you looked at home this is my punishment i must bear it till i die butshe turned sharply on her accomplicehe must remain where he is there must be no scandal i cannot face a scandal but for that he should have gone long ago back to his native kennel let him remain no one but you can turn him out doctorsir richardcan i really trust you madam hundreds of people trust me i am a father confessor i know all the little family secrets this is only one secret the more it is interesting to me i confess partly because i was concerned in the business and partly because i was curious to know what kind of man would emerge from this boys birth and his education and the general conditions of his life i may rely upon that promise the doctor spread out his hands other people do rely upon my secrecy why not you and you will not tell the boy for that matter if you tell him i would just as soon that you told the whole world i have long since promised that i would reveal the matter to no one unless you gave me leave she sighed she leaned her head upon her hand she sighed again let it be so she said consider me then as one of your patients let me come to you with this trouble of mine which disturbs me night and day it is not repentance because i would do it again and again to shield that good and great man my late husband from pain no it is not repentance it is fear of being found out it is not the dread of seeing this young man turned out of the position he holdsi care nothing about himit is fear of being found out myself madam you can never be found out there is only one person who knows the lady in question and that is myself i have only to continue the attitude which till yesterday was literally truethat i knew nothing about the lady neither her name nor her place of residence nor anything at alland you are perfectly safe no one can find out the fact no one even can suspect it how has the question arisen then what do you mean by inquirers there is only one inquirer at present she is certainly an important inquirer but she is only one she who is it the mother of the child quite a common creature was she not i dont know what you call common say undistinguished born in the lower middle classa nursery governess married to a comedian first and to an american adventurer next who is now a millionaire she called upon me and began to inquire well but what does she know nothing except that she parted with her boy when she was poor and she would give all the world to get him back now that she is rich he would not make her any happier i can assure her of that perhaps not she saw a young man somewhere who reminded her of her husband this made her remember things she heard my name mentioned and came to see if i was the man she knew in birmingham and then all i could say wastruthfullythat i knew nothing about the lady what will she do i dont know but she can discover nothing believe me she can do nothingnothing at all it was well however to warn youto tell you the young man she saw may have been your son it was at the theatre he goes a good deal to the theatreto see the girls on the stage his true father was also i believe inclined that way the best way i take it if i may advise pray advise one way at least would be to take the bull by the horns and bring them together when she finds that the young man so like her husband is your son she will at least make no further investigation in this direction do what you like said the lady sinking back in her chair i desire nothing except to avoid a scandalsuch a scandal sir richard it would kill me there shall be no scandal the secret is mine sir richard rose i promise once more to keep this secret till you give me permission to reveal it will you ever have to ask my permission on my honour i believe not i cannot conceive any turn of the wheel which would make such a permission desirable my death perhaps might set you free and it would rid society of a pretender no for then the scandal would be doubled your husbands name would be charged with the thing as well as your own rest easy lady woodroffe i will make her acquainted however with the young man chapter viii the cousins the hall of a west end hotel on a fine afternoon even in october not to speak of june is a spectacle of pious consolation in the eyes of those who like the contemplation of riches many there are on whose souls the sight of wealth in activity producing its fruits in due season pours sweet and balmy soothing all those lovely costumes flitting across the hall the coming and the going of the people in their carriages the continual arrival of messengers with parcels the driving up to the hotel or the driving off the hotel porters the liveries the haughty children of pride and show who wear themthese things in a desert of longing illustrate what wealth can give and how much wealth is to be envied these things make wealth appear boundless and stable surely one may take such wealth as this to the halls of heaven inexhaustible it must be else how could the hotel bills be paid the magnificent person in uniform with a gold band round his cap makes wealth allpowerful as well as beautiful else how could he receive a wage at all adequate to his appearance and his manners the noble perspective of white tables through the doors on the right and of velvet sofas through the doors on the left proves the illimitable nature of the modern wealth of the millionaire else how could those sumptuous dinners be paid for the american accent which everywhere strikes the ear further indicates that the wealth mostly belongs to another country which makes the true philanthropist and the altruist rejoice non nobis domine he chants but to our neighbours and our cousins so long as there is accumulated wealth which enables us to run these big hotels and to maintain these costly costumes and to keep these messengers on the trot why should we grumble all the world desires wealth it is only at such places as the entrancehall of a great hotel that the impecunious can really see with their own eyes and properly understand what great riches can actually do for their possessor what can confer happiness more solid more satisfying more abiding than to buy your wife a costume for two hundred guineas and to live in such a hotel as this with the whole treasures of london lying at your feet and waiting for your choice about halfpast four when the crush of arrivals was greatest and the talk in the hall was loudest another carriage and pair deposited at the hotel an elderly couple the man was tall and thin his features were plain but strongly marked his hair was grey and his beard which he grew behind his chin was also grey you may see men like him in face and figure and in the disposition of his beard behind his chin in every yorkshire townin fact he was a yorkshireman by birth though he had spent the last forty years of his life in the western states his face was habitually grave he spoke slowly this man in fact was one of that most envied and enviable classthe rich american in those lists which people like so much to read the name of john haveril was generally placed about halfway down opposite the imposing figures dollars reading these figures the ordinary average briton remarked dollars sir dollars not pounds sterling but still two millions and a half sterling and still rolling still rrrrolling the city magnate reading them sighs and says he cannot spend a quarter of the income the rest fructifies sirfrrrructifies john haveril arrived at this pinnacle of greatness by methods which i believe are perfectly well understood by everybody who is interested in the great mystery of making money it is a mystery which is intelligible easy and open to everybody yet only a very fewsay one in twenty millionsare able to practise the art successfully a vast number try to cross that stormy sea which has no chart by which they can navigate their barques rocks strike upon them and overwhelm them hurricanes capsize and sink them disappointment bankruptcy concealment for life flight ruin cruel misrepresentation even open trial conviction sentence and imprisonment are too often the consequences when persons who perhaps possess every quality except oneor all the qualities but one or twoin imperfection corners rings trusts presidencies the control of markets monopolies the crushing of competition the trampling down of the weaker disregard of scruple tenderness pity sympathy belong to the success which ought to have made john haveril happy the fortunate possessor of thirteen millionsdollarsgot out of the carriage when it stopped he looked round him on the steps of the hotel the people drew back hushed and awed john haveril he heard in whispers he smiled it is always a pleasure monstrari digito he marched up the steps and into the hall leaving his wife to follow alone this lady whom we have already met in the doctors consultationroom was dressed in the splendour that belonged to her position it is useless to have thirteen millions of dollars if you do not spend some of them in proclaiming the fact by silks and satins lace and embroidery chains of gold and glittering jewels mr haveril liked to see his wife in costly array what wife would not willingly respond to such a pleasing taste in a husband on this point at least the married couples hearts beat as onein unison mrs haveril therefore ought to have enjoyed nothing so much as the triumphal march across the hall with all the people gazing upon her as the thrice happy the four times happy the pride of her country the millionairess i do not think that she ever under any circumstances got the full flavour out of her wealth you have seen her with the doctor a constant anxiety weighed her down she was weak in body and troubled in mind she was no happier with the millions than if they had been hundreds moreover she was always a simple woman contented with simple waysone to whom footmen waiters and grand dinners were a weariness with her pale delicate face and sad soft eyes she looked more like a nun in disguise than a woman rolling in gold their rooms were of course on the first floor such rooms so furnished as became such guests parcels opened and unopened were lying about on the tables and chairs for they had only as yet been two or three days in london and therefore had only begun to buy things tickets for theatres cards of visitors invitations to dinner had already begun to flow in a waiter followed them upstairs bearing a tray on which were cards envelopes with names and bits of paper with names mrs haveril turned them over john she said i do believe these are my cousins theyve found us out pretty soon it was in fact only the day after the arrivals were put in the papers john turned over the cards humph he said now alice before these people come let us make up our minds what we are going to do for them what brings them is it money or is it love im afraid its money still when one has been away for five and twenty years it does seem hard not to see ones cousins again tisnt as if we came back beggars john thats just it if we had we shouldnt have been in this hotel and they wouldnt be calling upon us theyre all waiting down below let em wait what are we to do alice they want money are you going to give em money it isnt my money john its yours tis thine lass the yorkshireman replied if tis mine tis thine but leave it to me he turned to the waiter who had been present hearing what was said with the inscrutable face of one who hears nothing send all these chaps and women up he said make em come upevery one and alice sit down and never move ill do the talking they came up some twenty in number one of the blessings which attend the possession of great wealth is its power in bringing together and uniting in bonds of affection the various members of a family branches long since obscure and forgotten come to the light again members long since supposedor hopedto be gone away to the ewigkeit appear alive and with progeny they rally round the money the possessor of the money becomes the head of the family the object of their most sincere respect the source of dignity and pride to the whole family they trooped up the broad staircase men and women all together they were old and they were young they presented one must acknowledge that kind of appearance which is called common it is not an agreeable thing to say of any one especially of a woman that heor shehas a common appearance yet of mrs haverils cousins so much must be said if one would preserve any reputation for truth the elder women were accompanied by younger ones their daughters whose hats were monumental and their jackets deplorable the ladies both old and young while waiting below sniffed when they looked around them they sniffed and they whispered half aloud shameful my dear and she only just come homedeploring the motives which led the others not themselves to this universal consent the men for their part seemed more ashamed of themselves than of their neighbours their appearance betokened the small clerk or the retail tradesman yet there was hostility in their faces as if in any possible slopping over or in any droppings from the moneybag there were too many of them for the picking up they stood at the door hesitating the splendour of the room disconcerted them they had never seen anything so magnificent mrs haveril half rose to greet her cousins beside her stood her husbandof the earths great ones at the sight of this godlike person an awe and hush fell upon all these souls they were so poor all of them they had all their lives so ardently desired richesa modest a very modest incomeas an escape from poverty with its scourge that at the sight of one who had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams their cheeks blanched their knees trembled one of them boldly advanced he was a man of fifty or so who though he was dressed in the black frock which means a certain social elevation was more common in appearance perhaps than any of the rest his closeset eyes the cunning in his face the hungry look the evident determination which possessed him the longing and yearning to get some of the money shown in that look his arched back and bending knees proclaimed the manner of the man who was by nature a reptile he stepped across the room and held out his hand cousin alice he said softly even sadly as thinking of the long years of separation i am charlesthe charlie of your happy childhood when we played together in hoxton square he continued to hold her hand this is indeed a joyful day i have lost no time in hastening here though at the sacrifice of most important businessbut what are my interests compared with the reunion of the family i say that i have lost no time though in the sight of this crowd my action might possibly be misrepresented you are doing well charles asked mrs haveril with some hesitation because though she remembered the cousinship she could not remember the happy games in hoxton square pretty well alice thank you it is like your kind heart to ask pretty well mine is a wellknown establishment in mare street hackney i am at least respectablewhich is more than some can say all i want he stooped and whispered is the introduction of more capitalmore capital we cannot talk about that now cousin charles mrs haveril pushed him gently aside but he took up a position at her right hand and whispered as each came up in turn the next was a man who most certainly to judge by his appearance was run down pretty low he was dressed in seedy black his boots down at heel his tall hat limp he stepped forward with an affectation of a laugh i am your cousin alfred alice alf you know she did not remember but she offered him her hand i had hoped to find you alone i have much to tell you a bankrupt alice whispered charles actually a bankrupt and in this company if i am said fortunes battered plaything you ought to be too if everybody had his rights cousin charles made no reply to this charge do any of us get our deserts the bankrupt stepped aside then a pair of ladies old and young stepped forward with a pleasing smile cousin alice said the elder i am sophy this is my daughter she teaches in a board school and is a credit to the family as much as if she had a place of business in mare street im sure pewopener of st alphege hoxton whispered cousin charles and so on while the presentation was going on a young lady appeared in the door she saw the crowd and held back not presenting herself she was none other in fact than molly strange that a little difference in dress and in associates should make so great a difference in a girl molly was but the daughter of a tenthrate player yet she was wholly different from the other girls in the room she belonged to another species of humanity it could not be altogether dress which caused this difference she looked on puzzled at first then she understood the situation and she smiled keeping in the background waiting the event when they were all presented mrs haveril turned to her husband john she said these are my cousins will you speak to them and tell them that we are pleased to see them here john haveril possessed three manners or aspects the first was the latest it was the air and carriage and voice of one who is in authority and willing to exercise it and ready to receive recognition a recently created peer might possess this manner the second was the air and carriage and voice of one who is exercising his trade you may observe this manner on any afternoon near capel court the third manner was quite different it was his earliest and youngest manner in this he seemed to lose interest in what went on his eyes went out into space he was for the time lost to the place and people about him on this occasion john haveril began with the first mannerthat of authority cousins he said you are welcome i take it you are all cousins else you wouldnt have called you dont look like interviewers my wife is pleased to see you again after all these yearsfive and twenty i take it there was a general murmur very well then waiter bring champagneright awayand for the whole party you saw ladies and gentlemen a paragraph in the papers about mr and mrs john haveril yes and you have come in consequence of that notice very well thats true cried cousin charles unable to resist the expression of his admiration to think that we should stand in the presence of millions and so youve come all of you said john of the thirteen millions to see your cousin again out of love and affection some of us said cousin charles i fear that others he cast one eye on the bankrupt and one on the pewopener have come to see what they can get humanity is mixed mr haveril you must have learned that already mixed thank ye sir i have learned that lesson to see our cousin alice once more to desire mr haveril to see youto gaze upon youis with some of us laudable sirlaudable quite so sir highly laudable as for me said the bankrupt abashed i did hope to find cousin alice alone and if mr charles pennefather said the pewopener means that he wants nothing for himself let him go now that he has seen his cousin alice let him go on downtrodding them poor girls in his place of business at this point when it seemed likely that the family would take sides the waiter appeared bearing in his armsi use the word with intentiona jeroboam of champagne he was followed by two boys pages bearing trays and on the trays were glasses a jeroboam the sight of this inexhaustible vessel suggests hospitality of the more lavish generosity of the less calculating it contains two magnums and a magnum contains two bottles can one go farther than a jeroboam there are legends and traditions in one or two of the older hotelsthose which flourished in the glorious days of the regentof a rehoboam containing two jeroboams but i have never met in this earthly pilgrimage with a living man who had gazed upon a rehoboam at the sight of the jeroboam all faces softened broadened expanded and began to slime with a smile not to be repressed cousin charles thrust his right hand into his bosom and directed his eyes as if for penance to the cornice now said mr haveril you came here to see your cousin again you shall drink her healthall of you here she is not so hale and hearty as one could wish but alive after five and twenty years or thereabouts now boys pass it round the glasses went roundthe wine gurgled and sparkled cousin charles gave the word cousin alice he cried all togetherafter me he raised his glass cousin alice he emptied it at one draught i think said the pewopener in an audible whisper to her daughter that it would have been more becoming to offer port wine i dont think much of this fizzy stuff hush mother the daughter had more reading if less experience this is champagne its rich folks drink instead of beer the waiter and the boys went round again the second glass vanished without any toast eyes brightened cheeks flushed tongues were loosened cousin alice said the bankrupt emboldened if i could see you alone dont see him alone whispered cousin charles dont see anybody alone they all want your money they are leeches for sucking and limpets for sticking turn em over to me ill manage the whole lot for you very lucky for you cousin alice that i did call just this day of all days to stand between you and them but cousin alice made no answer and they all began whispering together and the whisper became a murmur and the murmur a babble and in the babble voices were raised and charges were made as of selfseeking pretence hypocrisy unworthy motives greed of gain deception past trickeries known meannesses sordidness and so forth and there was a general lurch forward as if the cousins would one and all fall upon alice and ravish from her on the spot her husbands millions but cousin charles selfelected representative stepped forward and held up his hand we cannot part he said it is impossible for you to leave me with my cousin alice ho cried the pewopener you alone with cousin alice see you alone alice whispered the bankrupt on whose weak nerves and illnourished brain the champagne was working without drinkingone more toast we must drink he said to our cousins illustrious noble and distinguished husband long may he continue to enjoy the wealth which he so well deserves and which none of us envy him no my friends humble and otherwise none of us envy him mr haveril sir i could have wished that the familyyour wifes familywhich is as you know one of eminent respectabilityan ancient family in fact of haggerston grandmother was a laundress said the pewopener everybody knows that all the haggerston people were washerwomen in the old days had been better represented on this occasion by a limited deputation of respectabilitysay by myself without the appearance of branches which should not have been presented to you because we have no reason to be proud of them he glanced at the decayed branch sir we drink your prolonged health and your perpetual happiness we are proud of you mr haveril the world is proud of you with a murmur partly of remonstrance with the speakers arrogance and his insinuations against their respectability and partly meant for a cheer the family drank the health of mr john haveril thank ye he said with no visible emotion now take another glasssend it round waiterwhile i say something its just this as he spoke his manner insensibly changed he became the man of business hard as nails i take it that some of you are here to see your cousin again and some of you are here to get what you can and some for both reasons its natural and i dont blame anybody when a bodys poor he always thinks that a rich man can make him rich too well he cantnot unless he makes over half his pile and ill tell you why a chap is poor because hes foolish or lazy either he cant see the way or he wont stir himself you cant help a blind mannor you cant help a lazy man if you give either of them what he wants he spends it all and then holds out his hand and asks for more the bankrupt dropped his head and sank into a chair the champagne helped him to apply this maxim to his own case the best thing that can be done for any one is to dump him down in a new country where hell sink or swim you sir he pointed a minatory finger to cousin charles you would like more capital would you not in the presence of this multitude mr haveril cousin charles replied those who want capital either here or anywhere else have got to make it for themselves so trueso true said cousin charles listen to this all of you make it for themselves same as i did how much capital had i to start with just nothing whatever you want make it for yourself by your own smartness theres nothing else in the world to get a man along but smartness in whatever line you are cast about for the prizes in that line and look out for opportunities if you cant see them who can help you as for you sir he addressed the bankrupt you want money well if i give you money you will eat it up and then come for more whats the use i ask any of you he looked round nobody answered cousin charles perspiring at the nose murmured faintly so trueso true but not with conviction some of the women wiped away a tearthey had taken four glasses of champagne but fortunately a waiter does not quite fill up the glasses not one of you would be a bit the better off in the long run if i gave him a thousand pounds not to give but to advance said cousin charles not a bit the better off john haveril repeated not a bit weve got to work in this worldto work and to think and to lay low and to watch those who can do nothing of all this had better sit down quiet in a retired spot my friends theres nothing shameful in taking a back seat most of the seats are in the back make up your mind that such is your lot and you may be happy though youve got no money ive been poor and now im rich seems to me i was just as happy when i was poor and looking out he paused for a moment alice doesnt want to throw you over what then whythis any one of you who came to ask for something may do it in writing let him send me a letterand tell me all about it if its a thing that will do you no harm ill do it for you but i dont expect it is only to feel that youve got somebody wholl give you what you ask for just because you ask for it why there cant be in all the world anything worse for him remember that youve got to work for a living to begin with harder if you make your fortune and harder still if you want to keep it thats the dispositions of providence and im not going to stand in the way of the lord go home then take example by me if you can but if you came to coax dollars out of alice give it up the audience looked at each other ruefully they did not know what to say in reply nor did they know how to get off nobody would move first cousin charles stepped forward mr haveril he said in the name of the family worthy or unworthy as the case may be greedy or disinterested as it may be i thank you whatever words may drop from you sir will be treasured what you have said are golden words we shall i hope write them down and engrave them on the marble tombstones of our hearts they will be buried with us my friends he addressed the family you can go not without you said the pewopeneryou and your respectability some of us will prepare that little note i dare sayi fear so mr haveril cousin charles went on in business as you know the introduction of capital is not a gift nor a charity but i will explain later on when these have gone not without you said the lady pewopener planting her umbrella firmly on the carpet there was so much determination in her face that cousin charles quailed he bent he bowed he submitted on another a more favourable occasion then when we can be private he said goodbye cousin alice you look younger than ever ah if these friends present could remember you as i can in the springtime of youth and beauty among the laurels and the laburnums and the lilacs of hoxton square loves young dream cousin loves young dream he grasped her hand his voice vibrating with emotion alice he said on sunday evenings we gather round us a little circle at south hackney intellect and respectability supper at eight i shall hope to see you there soon and often he then seized mr haverils hand if i may sirif i may you may siryou may he held out a hand immovable like a signpost as men of businessmen of businesswe shall understand each other very like very like said mr haveril with distressing coldness he had fallen into his third manner and his eyes were far off he spoke mechanically cousin charles clapped his hat on his head and walked out he was followed by the lady pewopener who called out after him over the broad balustrade you and your respectability indeed go and sweat your shopgirls you and your respectability chapter ix one more they are all gone john said alice oh what a visit i am ashamed i never thought my people could have gone on so as for cousin charles hes just dreadful one was left the unfortunate bankrupt overcome by the champagne was asleep in his chair john haveril dragged him up by the collar now then you sir what do you mean by going to sleep here the unfortunate rubbed his eyes and pulled himself together presently he remembered where he was cousin alice he said are we alone he whispered confidentially they all want your moneyparticularly charles hes the most grasping greedy cheeseparing avaricious unscrupulous bully of a cousin that ever had a place of business dont give him anything give it to me im starving alice i havent eaten anything all day its true ive got no work and no money john give him something its no good said john hell only eat it and then ask for more but give him something let him eat it john plunged his hand into his pocket after the manner of the eighteenth century it was full of gold well take it he transferred a handful to the clutch of the poor wretch take it go and eat it up and dont come back for more the man took it bowed low and shambled off it made alice ashamed only to see the attitude of the poor hungry creature and the abasement of poverty well alice said john weve seen the last of the family until their letters begin to come in halloa whos this for john became aware of the girl who had been standing beside the door unnoticed when all were gone she stepped in lightly mrs haveril she saidi ought to call you cousin alice but i am afraid you have had cousins enough my name is pennefathermolly pennefather why i was a pennefathersame as charles whos just gone out and the ragged wretch who was cousin alfred yes and others of the truly dreadful people who have just gone out i dont know any of them fortunately they wouldnt have anything to do with my poor old dad because he disgraced the family and went on the stage if they hadnt been so haughty i might have had to know them now your father is he willy pennefather he was but he died five years ago he died poor willy oh john if youd known my cousin will how clever he was and how bright dead is he he was never a great success you know because he couldnt settle down and at last he died and i well im studying for the stage myself oh you are willys daughter my dear you look straight but theres been such a selfseeking i dont want your money indeed oh but have you got money my dear no but some day i suppose i shall haveby my art thats the way to talk about the profession nowadays well i mean that i dont want your money cousin alice if you havent got any money and dont want any john began you see we are not all built like mr john haveril she interrupted with a sweet smile art i am told makes one despise money when i am furnished with my art i dare say i shall despise money oh coom now lass from time to time but rarely john haveril became yorkshire again despise the brass not the people who have the brass that is an accident i dont know about accidents well youve got money once you hadnt youre john haveril all the samesee besides its quite right that some people should have money they can take stalls at theatres if you will let me be friends with you mr haveril and wont look so dreadfully suspicious well i dont care he said you look as if as if i was telling the truth shake hands then mrs haveril gave her a hand and then looking in her face threw her arms round her neck my dear child she said youre the very picture of your fathercousin will i thought there must be some one in the family fit to love she hugged and kissed the girl with a sudden wave of affection oh molly my dear i am sure i shall love you im so glad well may i call you alice i will tell you what theatres to go to oh i shall make myself very useful to you she clasped her hands laughinga picture of youth and truth and innocence some time or other you shall see me on the stage we get lots of actors out in the westand actresses too some of them are real lovely said john haveril she laughed oh there are actresses and actresses and some elevate their art and some degrade it now let me see oh father is dead poor dear i told you and the rest of the family well you saw for yourself cousin they are not exactly the kind of people for a person of your consideration you should lend them all some moneynot muchand make them promise to pay it back on a certain daynext monday week at ten oclock its a certain plan then youll have no further trouble with them otherwise theyll crowd round you like leeches i cant let my own flesh and blood starve starve rubbish they wont starve what have they been doing while youve been away unless you encourage them not to work and now she sank gracefully upon a footstool and took her cousins hands oh she said it is so nice to have a relative of whom one may be proud after all those cousins oh it must be a dreadful thing to have such lots of money why ive got nothing youve had no champagne said cousin john lifting his jeroboam thank you cousin john i dont drink champagne well now what can i do for you this afternoon i dont know my dear we neither of us know much about london and we just wander about for the most part or drive about and wonder where we are the girl jumped up order a carriage and pair instantly i shall drive you round and show you the best shops you are sure to want something as for me remember that i want nothing an actress appears in costume which the management finds you however alice are different you must dress as becomes your position my dear child said alice in the very first shop you must let me give you a dressyou really must i dont want it i assure you she laughed but if it pains you not to give me one why i will take it she did take it that evening there arrived at the boardinghouse addressed to miss pennefather first a bonnet for which five guineas would be cheap a dress the price of which the male observer could not even guess a box of kid gloves a mantle and two or three pairs of boots and oh said the girl when she left the hotel that night what a lovely thing it is to feel that there will be no horrid mercenary considerations between us you will admire my art but i shall not envy your money cousin john admit that i am better off than youone would rather be admired than envied she reached home in her room lay the parcels and the packages she opened them all she put on the bonnet she stroked the soft stuff with a caressing palm she gazed upon the gloves she held up the boots to the light am i a dreadful humbug she said i must bei must be what would dick say but one cannot no one cannot refuse i am not a stick or a stone and cousin alice actually enjoyed the giving but no money molly you must not take their money chapter x cousin alfreds secret it was a few days later in the forenoon john haveril was gone into the city on the business of keeping together what he had gota business which seems to take up the whole of a rich mans time and more so that he really has no chance of looking for the way to the kingdom of heaven his wife sat at the window of her room in the hotel contemplating the full tide of life below she was not in the least a philosopherthe sight of the people and the carriages and the omnibuses did not move her to meditate on the brevity of life as it moves some thinkers it pleased her she thought of places where she had lived in western america and the contrast pleased her nor was she moved as a poet to find something to say about this tide of life the poet you know looks not only for the phrase appropriate but for the phrase distinctive mrs haveril had never heard of such a thing she only thought that there was nothing like it in the western states and that she remembered nothing like it in the village of hackney molly was lying on the sofa reading a novel one of the hotel pages disturbed her dreamery which was close upon dropping off by bringing up in a silver salver a dirty slip of paper on which was written in pencil mr alfred pennefather for mrs haveril bearer waits is it a man in rags is he a disgrace to the hotel well maam he is in rags as for his being a disgracehe says hes your cousin here he laughed holding the silver salver before his mouth i wouldnt laugh at a poor man if i were you why said mrs haveril drawing a bow at a venture youve got cousins of your own in the workhouse send him up right away she added the man came in the page shut the door quickly behind him to conceal the figure of rags not often seen in that palatial place it was alfred the broken strange to say though it was less than a week since he had received that gift of golden sovereigns the appearance of the man was as seedy as ever his hata ridiculously tall silk hat with a limp brimcan anything look more forlornhis coat with ragged wrists his boots parting from the soles a ragged and decayed person more ragged more decayed than before well the ladys voice was not encouraging you came here last week with the rest of them i did alicei did you had champagne with the rest you heard what my husband had to say when the rest were gone he gave you money what have you done with that money what do you want now i want to have a quiet talk with you the man had that sketchy irresolute face which foretells in certain levels of life social wreck not an evil face exactlythe man with the evil face very often gets on in lifebut with a weak face you may see such a face any day in a policecourt first it is a charge connected with the employers accounts then it is generally a charge of petty robbery the last case i saw myself was one of boots snatched from an open counter between the first charge and the second there is a dreadful change in the matter of clothes but there is never any change in face as for alfred pennefather one could understand that he had once been the gay and dashing alf among his pals that he had heard the midnight chimes ring that he knew by experience the attractions of the public billiardroom and the joys of pool that he read the sporting papers that he put a bit on his fancy that whatever line of life he might attempt therein he would fail and that repeated failures would place him outside the forgiveness of his friends for repeated misfortunes as well as repeated follies we can never forgive you can talk said his cousin thisyoung ladyshe was going to say cousin of yoursdoes not count go on i hoped the other day alice to find you alone in that crowd of greedy impudent beggars and flatterers i could not i assure you i was ashamed of being in such company as for cousin charles if it had not been for you go on to something else please you all came for what you could get now what do you want ill sit down he took the most comfortable chair in the room and stretched out his legs this is

prove to you alice that the money was well laid out when after many days the man at the bottom of the ladder gets a few pounds in gold the first temptation is to make a night of it what we are not moneygrabbers tomorrow for a new rigout tomorrow for the weary business of finding employment tonight for joy and the winecup when the morrow dawns the winecup still lingers in the brainbut the gold pieceswhere are they gone as a dreama splendid dream of the night thus after a little sleep and a little slumber poverty cometh again as a robber and want as an armed man dont lets talk about money spent he said cheerfully lets talk about the future im right down at the bottom of the ladder alice help me up if a man says that he is at the bottom of the ladder he generally speaks the truth it is one of those little things about which we are agreed not to tell lies and when he asks to be helped up he always speaks with sincerity i have no money of my own youve things that make money his eyes fell on a bracelet lying on the table alice shook her finger at him cousin alfred she said if you mean that i am going to give you my husbands presents for you to take to a pawnbroker i will have you

respectability and youre like the sparks that fly upward when i came here the other day i thought i was coming to see a respectable woman out molly advanced upon him he placed a chair in front of him i know where your husband isin the marylebone workhouse infirmary thats where he is i shall go to him anthony i shall say your wifes over herewith another man molly threw the chair down and rushed at him he fled before the fire and fury of those eyes molly dear alice asked am i hardhearted i have not a spark of feeling left for that man it moved me not in the least to hear of his wretched plight he is to me just a strangera bad mansuffering just punishment but his name is woodroffe that is strange is it not yes his name is woodroffe he belonged he always said to a highly respectable family that fact did not make him respectable i wonder if he is any relation to dickmy old friend dick woodroffe hes a musician now and singer too and his father was a comedian before him well dear i dont know as for that man in the infirmary i dare say john will go and see if anything can be done for him he deserted me first and divorced me afterwards molly twentyfour years agofor incompatibility of temper that is the kind of man he is chapter xi the doctors dinner the secret of success is like the elixir of life inasmuch as that precious balsam used to be eagerly sought after by countless thousands and because also like the elixir it continually eludes the pursuer one man succeeds how he does not know and he does not inquire a thousand others who think they are as good fail why they cannot discover but each of the thousand failures is ready to show you a thousand reasons why this one man has succeeded first of all he has really not succeeded secondly his success is grossly exaggerated thirdly it is a cheap successthe unsuccessful are especially contemptuous of a cheap successthey would not themselves condescend to a cheap success fourthly it is a success arrived at by tortuous winding crooked arts which make the unsuccessful sick and sorry to contemplatewho would desire a success achieved by climbing up the back stairs if a man writes and succeeds in his writings so that ordinary people flock to read him he succeeds by his vulgarity or he succeeds by his low tasteswho that respects himself would pander to the multitude or he succeeds by vacuity fatuity futility stupiditywhat selfrespecting writer would sink to the level of the fatuous and vacuous he succeeds with an a because he is asinine with a b because he is bestial with a c because he is contemptible and so on through the alphabet similar reasons are assigned when a man succeeds as a painter a sculptor a preacher a lawyer now sir robert steele is one of the most successful physicians of the day his success is easily understood and readily accounted for on the principles just laid down by those of his profession who have not by any means achieved the same popularity he humours his patientsevery one knows that he has a soft voice and a warm handhe makes ignoble profit out of both above all he asks his patientssome of themto the most delightful dinners possible the latter charge has a foundation in fact he does ask a few of his more fortunate patients to dinner more than this he gives them a dinner much too artistic for most of them to understand to bring art into a menu to invent and build up a dinner which shall be completely artistic in every part a harmonious whole one course leading naturally to the next a dinner of one colour in many tints the wine gurgling like part of an orchestra is a gift within the powers of very few sir roberts reputation as a physician is justly at least assisted by his reputation as a great poetic creator of the harmonious dinner i think having myself none of the gourmets gifts that the possession of them must cause continual and poignant unhappiness it is like the endowment of the critical faculty at its highest nothing pleases wholly when the critic of the menu dines out alas what false notes what discords what bad time what feeble rendering what platitude of conception he must endure let us not envy his gifts let us rather continue to enjoy unheeding dinners which would be only a prolonged torture to the sensitive soul of the perfect critic the doctor made his selections carefully from his patients and friends he knew all the amusing people about town especially those benefactors to their kind who consent to play and sing for afterdinner amusement he knew all the actors especially those who do not take themselves too seriously he knew the men who can tell stories sing songs and are always in good temper he loved them as king william loved the red deer he esteemed them higher than princes more excellent company than poets more clubable than painters among his friends of the profession was mr richard woodroffe whom the doctor esteemed even above his fellows for his unvarying cheerfulness and his great gifts and graces in music and in song him he invited to dinner on a certain evening partly on account of these gifts and partly for another reasonthe other guests were the haverils who would be useless in conversation miss molly pennefather their cousin who would not probably prove a leader in talk sir humphrey woodroffe whom he invited for reasons which you knowand others yet conscious beforehand that the young man would be out of his element and perhaps sulky and two umbr persons of no accountmere patientsto make up the number of eight the only number unless it is four which is permissible for a dinnerparty for the menu there was only one person to be considered dick for instance would eat tough steak with as much willingness as a chateaubriand mr haveril knew not one dish from another humphrey whom he had met at his mothers table would be the only guest capable of understanding a dinner moreover humphrey would have to be conciliated by the dinner itself to make up for the company the doctor therefore prepared a dinner of a few plats harmonized with the desire of pleasing a young man who was most easily approached he had already discovered by means of any one or any group of the senses dinner as every artistic soul knows appeals to a group of the senses which is the reason why civilized man decorates his tables those unhappy persons to whom dinner is but feeding might as well serve up a single dish on one winecase and sit down to it on another the reason apart from his social qualities why sir robert invited richard woodroffe to the dinner was not unconnected with a little conversation held at a smoking concert a few nights before it was a very good smoking concert a highly distinguished company was present and the performers were all professionals richard did his turn and then took a seat beside sir robert i havent seen you since last june dick have i ive been on tramp what do you go on tramp for because i must when the summer comes i cant stay in towni take the fiddle and sling a handbag over my shoulders and go off where do you go anywhere first by train twenty miles or so out of london and then plunge into the country at random you tramp along the road and then wellyou seethe real point is that i take no money with meonly enough for the first day or twofive shillings or so the fiddle pays my way i play for bed and supper in a roadside inn the people of the village come to hear sometimes i play and sing sometimes i play for them to dance then i collect the coppers next day i go on it sounds delightful for your audience for me listening to you is sufficient as for the rest its more delightful than you can believe why i know all the gipsies and their language sometimes i camp with them and i know most of the tramps some excellent fellows among the tramps and theres no dresscoat and no dinnerparties what do you mean by saying that you must go well i dont know its something in the blood its heredity i suppose my father was a vagabond before me did he also go on the tramp well he was always moving on he was an actorof sorts some of them still remember him over here though he went to america five and twenty years ago do i remember him was his name woodroffe his stage name was anthonyjohn anthony his real name was woodroffe anthony the doctor sat up anthony i have heard that name oh yes i remember anthony strange only the other day he broke off did you hear that name coupled with anycreditable incident nono not very it was in connection with aa former wife how old are you dick i am two and twenty yes i remember the case nowit was four and twenty years ago one is always getting reminders dick theres a young fellow of your namea baronetson of an angloindian are you any relation to him ive met him we are very distant cousins i believe the more distant the better you dont like him well he isnt quite your sort is he all the same dick come and dine with me next tuesday you will meet him but that wont matter i expect some american people as wellrich peoplenouveaux richesthe woman is interesting the man is plain they bring a girl with thema girl miss molly pennefather whats the matter for dick jumped molly i know mollybless her ill come doctor even if there were twenty sir humphreys coming too and after dinner ill sing for you if you like now you understand why this selection was made for the first time in his life sir robert invited a company which could not possibly harmonize there would be no talk worth having his wine would be wasted his cuisine would meet with no appreciation but he would have them all before himmother son stepsonif richard could be called a stepsonhalfbrothers and the master of the situation would study on the spot an illustration of heredity unsuspected by the patients themselves mrs haveril arrived clothed chiefly in diamonds why not her husband liked her to wear those glittering things which help to make wealth attractive otherwise we might all be contented with poverty but the pale ladys delicate nunlike face would have looked better without them with her came molly now her daily companion the girl was dressed for the first time in her life as in a dreama dream of paradise she wore such a frock with such trimmings as makes a maiden if by happy chance she sees it in a window gasp and yearn for the unattainable yet go home thankful for having seen it and humbled by the sense of personal unworthiness yet what says the poet ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp else whats a heaven for the girl wore the dress with as little selfconsciousness as one would expect it was such a dress as she had seen upon the stageelaborate dainty decorated perhaps a little too old for her but then an actress must be excused for a little exaggeration her rle this evening was not a speaking part she was only a lady of the court meanwhile she was on the stage and it pleased her to find that her audience admired though they could not applaud i have invited to meet you said the doctor two distant cousins they bear the same name and are of the same descent but their families have gone off in different channels i understand for some hundreds of years it is not often that people can claim cousinship after so long a separation one of them is the only son of the late sir humphrey woodroffe a distinguished angloindian woodroffe alice asked it was my first husbands name very possibly he too was a cousin the other is a young fellow called richard woodroffe again the name said alice yes the distant cousin he is a musician and a dramatist in a small and clever way dick is my oldest friend said molly i am very glad then that he is coming tonight sir robert considered this young lady more attentively because a girl who was dick woodroffes oldest friend must be a young lady out of the common there was he observed something certainly uncommon in her appearance something which might suggest the footlights any old friend of dick woodroffe must suggest the footlights it is strange said the doctor to have three of our small party belonging to the same name the other guests arrived the last was humphrey he looked round the room with that expression of cold and insolent curiosity which made him so much beloved by everybody outsiders all that look expressed he greeted dick with a brief nod of astonished recognition as if he had not expected to meet him in a drawingroom he stared at mrs haverils diamonds and he smiled with some astonishment but yet graciously on molly you are properly dressed tonight he whispered i have never seen you looking so well doctor said mrs haveril as he led her down the stairs i wish i could go and sit in a corner why you are trembling what is the matter i feel as if i was in a dream it is the sight of these two young men one is the young man i saw at the theatrethe young man i told you ofso like my husband the other is like him too but differently i am haunted tonight with my husbands face it is imagination you have been thinking too much about certain things their name is the same as your husbands probably he too if you knew was a distant cousin its not imagination it is the fact i am sorry you are so disturbed but above all do not agitate yourself he whispered as they entered the diningroom i will keep up doctor but its dreadful to sit with two living images of your first husband from the ordinary point of view the dinner was not so great a success as some of those given at this house the conversation flagged yet below the surface everybody was interested humphrey took in molly but dick sat on the other side of her and told her stories about his last tramp humphrey therefore became sulky and absorbed wine in quantities alice gazed at the two young menher husbands eyes her husbands mouth her husbands voice her husbands hair in both of themboth like unto her first husband yet both unlike they were also like unto each other yet unlike she heard nothing that was said she listened to the voice she saw the eyes and she was back again after all those years with that vagrant man that vagabond in morals as well as in ways the man who so cruelly used her the comedian and stroller the doctor also watched the two young men they had to begin with many points of resemblance they were alike however as brothers who often differ in disposition as much as strangers the elder of the twothe doctor considered mrs haveriltook after his mother and was serious at least he thought of lady woodroffes remarks about him selfish yes there was a way of eating his food and absorbing his wine that betokened a selfish pleasure in the food above the delights of society and conversation he did not converse he sat glum illconditioned and badtempered lady woodroffe said the selfishness and probably the bad temper he inherited from the father from his education he obtained of course the air of superiority which like the order of the garter has nothing to do with intellect or achievement or distinction from his education also his features had probably acquired a certain manner which we call aristocratic he kept his guest in something like good temper by asking his opinion pointedly as if he valued his judgment on the champagne he had little talks with him on vintages and years and brands in which the young man was as wide as most youths at the club where champagne flows and he asked sir humphreys opinion on the plats and let the others feel that his opinion carried weight so that his guest forgot something of mollys perverseness in listening to her neighbours stories and of the intolerable nuisance of sitting down to dinner with such a company he turned to the other cousindick this fellow like unto humphrey was yet so much unlike him that to begin with his face was as undistinguished as was his cousins mind yet a clever face capable of many emotions he was full of life and talk he was interested in everything he could listen as well as talka young man of sympathy the artistic side of him came from his father as did also the nomad side of him the sympathy and kindliness and honesty came to him from his unknown motherone supposed as for john haveril he was chiefly engaged in considering the girl who had thus unexpectedly come into his life to cheer it with her brightness and her grace i have never found any man so old or so selfmade as to be insensible to the charms of sprightly maidenhood and youthful beauty john haveril was quite a homely person he had not been brought up to think of beauty and lovely dress and charming airs and graces as belonging to himself in any way it is this sense of being outside the circle which makes working men apparently deaf and blind to beauty adorned and cultivated why admire or think upon the unattainable they might as well yearn after the possession of an ancient castle and noble name as after beauty decorated and set off and now this girl belonged to them he himself and his wife were only happy when this girl was with them she came every day to see them she drove out with them took them to see things taught them what to admire and what to buy dined with them consented graciously to accept their gifts but refused their money at all events she refused to take any yet she liked the things that money can buylovely frocks gloves hats ribbons laces gold chains and bracelets and necklaces to him contempt for money combined with love of what only money can buy seemed incongruous the contempt was only a phrase molly had been taught that art ought to despise wealth she had not been taught to despise the things artistic that money can buy the rich man chuckled to think how much money can be spent upon a girl who despises it he was pleased to make the girl happy by heaping unaccustomed treasures on her gratified shoulders it was pleasant to be generous to a bright happy smiling girl who kept him alive and made him forget the burden of his riches and as he thought of these things he fell into his third mannerthat of the gardenerand his eyes went off into space after dinner molly sat down to the piano and began to sing in a full flexible contralto an old ditty about love and flowers taught her by dick himself who possessed a treasurehouse full of such songs new and old and of all countries and in all languages there is but one theme fit for a songthe theme of youth and love and the sweet season of roses humphrey stood listening to this young man perhaps to others the effect of mollys singing as of her presence and of her voice and of her eyes was to fill his mind with visions they came to him in the shape of dancinggirls with tambourines and castanets when a girl is endowed with the real faculty of singing she may create in the minds of those who hear those visions which best fit their inclinations and their natures to this young man came the troop of dancinggirls because his disposition inclined him that way they sang as they danced and they threw up white arms to a music of wild and reckless joy they filled him with the longing the yearning for the delirium of youth and rapture which seizes every young man from time to time and sometimes possesses him all the days of his youth and casts him out long before his youth is over to the husks among the swine others more fortunate feel the yearning too but they make of it a stimulus and an incentive there is no such rapture beneath the sky as young men dream of yet the vision may make them poets and may strengthen them for endeavour and it may fill them with the worship of woman which is the one thing needful for a man humphrey wholly filled and possessed by this rapture would not be cast forth to the husks becauseoh sordid reasonhis mother would pay his debts alas poor molly and she so ignorant she had no such visiongirls never do when young men reel and tremble with the vision of rapture inconceivable girls have to be contented with a mild happiness to them there comes no dream of gleaming armsno imagined magic of voice and eyes and face there is no such thing as a prodigal daughter the humble rle of the prodigal girl is to minister as with the white arms and the castanets to the service of the prodigal son for which she too has to go out presently to sit with the swine and to maintain a precarious existence on the husks molly had no such vision yet by the mere power of her voice she could awaken this vision in the mind of a listener it is a power which makes an actress makes a queen makes a lady of authority whom all obey to whom that power appeals molly i say had no respect at all for the flowery way she could not understand nor did she ask why young men should want to dance handinhand with the girls nor why they like to crown their heads with roses nor why they drink huge draughts of the wine that fizzeth in the cup to make their heads as light as their feet she created however quite a different vision in the mind of the other young man dick knew all about the flowery way and in fact despised it you see he belonged to the service he played the fiddle for the dancers like those who gather the roses polish the floor lay the cloth open the champagne cook the dishes decorate the rooms and write the songs he belonged to the show the flowery way was nothing to him but a show the white arms amused him not the soft cheeks he knew were painted the smiles and the laughing looks were practised at rehearsals as for molly she was his companion and a helpmeet one to whom he would impart and give with all that he had and who would in return love and cherish him what is the flowery way compared with the way of love this and nothing else is the real reason why the show folk are so different from the other folk there is no illusion to them they are the paid dancers makers of rosy wreaths musicians and singers of the flowery way mollys song therefore opened another kind of vision to master richard all he saw was a long road shaded with hills and molly in the middle of it marching along with him singing as she went and carrying the fiddle when the song was finished molly got up may i sing you one of my own songs humphrey asked her paying no attention to the rest he sat down and struck a note and began a song it had no melody it was without a beginning and without an end the words told nothing neither a story nor a sentiment like the music to which they were set they began in the middle of a sentence and ended with a semicolon his voice was good enough but uncultivated when he finished he closed the piano as if there was to be no more music after him it is music he said coldly of the advanced school i am proud to belong to the music of the futurethe true expression of art in song i will show yourichard opened the piano and took his placei will show you something of the music of the present with vigorous and practised fingers he ran up and down the notes then he struck into an airlight easy catching and began to sing the song of the trampone of his vagabond songs mrs haveril sat watching the two young men when dick began the other one turned away sullenly and began to look into a portfolio of etchings with the air of one who will not listen doctor she whispered that young man sings and plays exactly like my husband it might be the same he would sit down and sing just that same way as if nothing ever happened and nothing mattered i wonder how men can go on like that with age and sickness and the end before them women never can oh how like my husband he is the other is not like him in manner not a bit yet in faceoh in faceand voiceand eyesand hair it is wonderful one can hardly expect the son of sir humphrey woodroffe to be altogether like a comedian yet she repeated so like him in face and everything i cannot get over it just then humphrey looked up there was just a momentwhat was ita turn of the face a look in the eyes that made the doctor start heavens he thought hes exactly like his mother dick finished john haveril walked over to the piano before he got up mister he said i like it i find it cheerful if you could see your way now to look in upon us of an evening i think you might do good to my wife whos apt to let her spirits go down come and sing to us i will with pleasure when shall i come come tomorrow evening come every evening if you like young gentleman my wife doesnt care for the theatres much if we could sit quiet at home with a little lively talk and a little singing she would like it ever so much better you and molly know each other it appears come to dinner tomorrow and see how you like us the party broke up sir humphrey was left alone with the doctor stay for a cigarette sir robert rang the bell i hope you liked the dinner and the wine both sir robert were beyond and above all praise an artistic dinner is so rare it was thrown away upon some of my guests however if you will come another day you shall meet a more distinguished company i did not understand sir humphrey until this evening the very strong resemblance you bear to your mother indeed it is my father whom i am generally thought to resemble yes you have no doubt a strong resemblance to him but it is your mother of whom you remind me from time to time most strongly it came out oddly this evening the inheritance of face and figure and qualities interests me and your own case sir humphrey the son of such a father and such a mother is extremely interesting he took a cigarette extremely interesting i assure you chapter xii the other child of desertion molly richard arrived before the time and found his old friend alone you here again last night i could not ask what it meantthe ineffable frock and the heavenly string of pearls what does it mean she had on another lovely frock with the same pearl necklace it means dick she replied with much dignity that alicemrs haverilis my fathers first cousin and is therefore my own cousin it also means which you will hardly credit that she is very fond of me that is indeed difficult of belief and you are a good deal with them and this other frock too this thingis it cloth of gold or samitewas given to you by your cousin molly molly have a care the love of gold creeps upon one as a thief in the night dick she assumed an injured air when it affords them so much pleasure to give me things why should i refuse and confess ridiculous creature that you never saw me look so nice before you look very nice mollyvery nice indeed but i never knew you look otherwise you dear old boy she gave him her hand you always try to spoil a simple shepherdess but i say molly is this kind of marble hall good for study does it bring you nearer to mrs siddons does it suit the cothernus methinks the liquefaction of black velvet more befits the tragic muse than the froufrou of the flowered silk very well put dick i will remember tell me something about them molly if i am to entertain them you know mr john haverilwhom i call john for shortis slow of speech dont take that however for dulness everybody says hes as sharp as a razor and he speaks slowly and hes got a way while he talks of gazing far away and madam she looks like a saint in sadness because shes got to wear cloth of gold instead of sackcloth she is in delicate health her husband is always anxious about her dick he has many millions and you always used to say that a man cant get rich honestly but he does seem honest and hes awfully fond of his wife a man may be fond of his wife and yet not austerely honest go on molly before they come in well dick molly lowered her voice she has something on her mind i dont know whatshe hasnt told me yet but she will its some trouble sometimes the tears come into her eyes for nothing sometimes she has fits of abstraction when she hears nothing that you say sometimes she becomes agitated and her heart begins to flutter i dont know what the trouble is but it robs her life of happiness she wants something she goes to church and prays for it if she were not such a good woman i should think she had done something what shall i play for her play something that will rouse her play one of your descriptive things dick i will play an accompaniment for you make the fiddle talk to her as you know how nobody plays the fiddle quite so well as you dick they dined in the public room where molly observed with profit making mental notes the dresses of the ladies dick on his part as an observer of manners listened to the conversation and wasted his time most conversation in public places is naught very few people can say anything worth hearing either in public or in private most people cannot forget that they are in a public place and may be overheardbut the modesty is passing away the world follows the example of the young man who was admonished by swift not to set up for a wit because he said there are ten thousand chances to one against you the young man took that advice and is therefore unknown to history at this table the conversation was difficult not so much because there was no wit among the small company as because there were no opportunities for the display of wit it is necessary for wit to have something to work upon there can be no repartee where there is no talk it is also difficult if you think of it to provide conversation for an elderly gentleman who for the greater part of his life has been more accustomed to pork and beans than to ctelettes la soubise who has habitually consumed bad coffee with his dinner instead of claret and champagne who is wholly ignorant of literature has never looked upon a good picture and has never heard of science except in connection with railways who was originally apprenticed to a gardener who in early life belonged to the primitive methodists he might have discoursed upon shares and corners but on such matters not even his own wife knew anything one is apt to imagine that the man who has rapidly made millions by playing upon the gambling spirit of the people upon their greed and their credulity and their ignorance must have moments at least of misgiving perhaps of remorse we talk of the ruined homes the wrecks of families the desolated hearths well that is not the way in which the man who has succeeded where the rest all fail looks at it it is not the way in which john haveril regards his own career he puts it in his own way this evening at dinner unaccustomed to the society of the rich dick dropped some remark slightly mal propos about moneymaking in yorkshire sir said john haveril when a man buys a horse he buys him as he stands its his business to find out that animals faults its the business of the owner to crack up the animal thats trading all the world over the man who wins is the man who knows the man who loses is the man who gambles i have never gambled i thought it was all gambling i buy stocks which i know are going up i buy mines when there is going to be a run upon mines i buy land where i know there will be built a town other people buy because they see others buying the world gambles all the time men like me sir do not gamble we buy for the rise in the market which we understand i know nothing really said dick abashed no sir but you know as much as anybody i have read in an english paper that i have ruined thousands that is not true they have ruined themselves they buy in a rising venture not knowing that it has risen too high and they sell when it falls my secret is that i know how do you know that sir i cannot explain why do you sing and play that fiddle of yours better than anybody else it is your gift sir so its mine to know in spite however of these new lights on the mystery or craft of moneymaking which were of little use to mr haverils guests the conversation languished the elder lady was pensive and sad the marvels and miracles of the chef were thrown away upon her she looked as if she longed to be upstairs again lying on her sofa looking out upon the full tide of human life surging round charing cross after dinner they took coffee in their private room now said dick taking out his violin i want to play something that will please you mrs haveril he began to tune his instrument talking the while molly thinks that you would like a little foolish entertainment that i sometimes givea descriptive piece the fiddle describes i only explain with a word or two and molly plays an accompaniment molly took her place and waited you must understand what we are going to talk about first of all otherwise you will understand nothing very good i am just a strolling player or a musician as you please i carry my fiddle with me and i am on tramp in my pocket there is no money i earn my bed and my supper and my breakfast with the fiddle and the bow i take any odd jobs that i can get at country theatres or at musichalls or taverns or anything my girl is with me of course she can sing a little and dance a little so that on occasion we are prepared with a little show of our own we carry no luggage except a bag with a few necessaries it is my business to carry the bag my girl carries the fiddle which is lighter now you understand at the mention of the word tramp mrs haveril who had composed herself to quiet meditation at the window while the others talked sat up and turned her head so dick struck a chorda bold loud chord which compelled the mind to listen we are on the road he went on talking in a monotone with murmurous voice which became subordinated to the music so that one heard the latter and forgot the former insomuch that the music seemed by itself and without any aid to bring the scene before the eyes it was the work of a magician molly played a running accompaniment which helped the illusion if it added nothing more dick watched that one of his audience whom he desired to hold after a little her eyes dropped she sat with clasped hands listening carried awayenchanted by the sorcerer we are on the road he went on the broad highroad with banks of turf at the side there is nobody else upon the road we swing along we sing as we go it is morning the village is behind us another village is before us we pick flowers from the hedge we listen to the lark in the sky and we catch the voice of the blackbird from the wood we sit down in the shade when we are tired we dine resting on a stile the air is fresh and sweet the flowers are all aflame in hedge and meadow as he played and as he talked the listener heard the birds the cool breeze of the country fanned her cheek she saw the flowers the sun warmed her the hard road fatigued her she listened to the birds in the woods the rustle of the leaves the whistling of the wind in the telegraphwires she sat in the grateful shade she bathed her feet in the cool running water alice listenedcarried away her cheeks were flushed she clutched the cushions of the sofa far awayout of sightforgottenwere the grand rooms of the rich mans hotel far awayforgottenwere the diamonds and the silks dick watched with grave and earnest face the effect of his playing with him it was always an experiment he tried to mesmerize his people to charm them into forgetfulness sometimes he went on i get a place in a country theatrein the orchestra you know this is the orchestra he became on the spot a whole orchestra blatant tuneless paid to make a noise you heard all the discordant instruments played together alice sank back in her chair she did not care much about the orchestra dick changed quickly sometimes i join a circus and play in the procession through the town the band goes first in a cart you can hear how the bumping shakes the music indeed it didthe cart was without springs and the road was uneven behind us are the horses with the splendid riders the music passed down the street while the patter of the horses on the road was loud enough to be heard above the music last of all the riders before the clown and the rest of the people is the lady equestrienne of the haute cole at sight of her all the girls in the town yearn for the circus and the hearts of all the young men sink with love and admiration no mrs haveril cared very little for this part of the show either sometimes we come to a village where there is a green then the people come outit is a fine summer eveningand i play to them and they dance what shall it be sellingers round or barley break take your partnerstake your places curtsey and bow and hands across and down the middle and up again and one place lower now then keep it uptimetimetime again the lady sat up and listened with rapt face dick watched her closely now we find a schooltreat in a fieldi play to them jump and dance boys and girls come out to play lasses and lads take leave of your dads boys dont be rough with the girls but dance with each other now hands alland round we go and round we go then the tears came into the pale ladys eyes goodbyewe are on the road again the sun is sinking the swallows fly low we shall have rain luckily weve got our supper in the bag my girl we must take shelter in this barn comeyou are tiredi play my girl to sleep with a gentle lullaby sweet haysweet hayit hath no fellow sleep dear girl sleep good night good nightgood night he stopped and laid down the fiddle well pleased with himself for that part of his audience to which he had played was in tears molly jumped up alice dear what is the matter oh molly it is beautiful oh it is beautiful for ive done it i know it all ive been on tramp myselfjust as he played itwith the fiddle toojust as he made it oh i know the country fair and the village inn and the circus and all i remember it all when last i went on tramp i had my alice her husband interposed dont my dear it is four and twenty years ago i remember it all so well i had my aliceher husband stopped her again she sighed yesyes i try not to think of it he deserted me after that last tramp he couldnt bear the crying of the dear child he deserted me and when i found him again in america he put me awayby the law as if he was ashamed of me desertion and divorce said dick were my mothers lot as well she too was deserted and divorced is it a common lot his name said alice was the same as yours it was woodroffeand you are strangely like him my fathers name was john anthony woodroffe alice sprang to her feet and clasped her hands oh my dreammy dream is it coming true you areyou are oh how old are you she caught him by the arm and gazed into his face as if seeking her own likeness there as well as her husbands i am twentytwo no it is impossible she sank back for a moment i thought you might bemy own boy yet you are his oh it is strange who was your mother then she was a rider in a circus and he married her and deserted her yesand divorced her and i know nothing more about him he must have married your mother directly after he divorced me no doubt he has treated a dozen women in the same manner since then said dick with unfilial bitterness the fifth commandment always presented insuperable difficulties to me your mother was a player too said alice he always grumbled because i could not play my mother was the equestrienne of the haute cole that i talked about just now she was represented on the bills as the pride of the states the envy of europe who had refused princes in the lands of tyrants rather than forsake natures nobility and the aristocracy of the republic i remember dick said molly you used to tell my father all about it i was born and brought up in the sawdust and i played all the instruments in the orchestra one after the other and i was afraid to go to church on account of that terrible announcement about the generations to follow the wicked man he will suffer he must suffer said alice but i have long since put him out of my mind my mother never put him out of her mind she died hoping that he would be made to suffer for my own part i hope that i may never meet him my dream my dream first the doctor then my husbands son the past is returning alice covered her face with her hands to hide the tears nay nay said her husband keep quietkeep quiet she sank back on the couch and lay still with closed eyes and pale face molly felt her heart it is beating too fast she said let her be still awhile thus the evening which began with an attempt at mere amusement and entertainment became serious alice recovered and opened her eyes john she said does he understand i think so dick replied you were my fathers first wife in order to be free he divorced you he then married my mother believe me madam my mother was wholly ignorant to the last of this history indeed i believe it i do not think there was a woman in america who would have married a man with such a record at all events my mother would not and you aremy stepson no dick considered if i were your stepson my mother would have come first im not your stepson in fact there isnt a word in the language to express the relationship butif i may venture alice molly interposed make a friend of dick as you have of me he will be the handiest usefullest friend you can have and he really is the best fellow in the worldarent you dick of course i am he replied stoutly as for trying to get money from you he is incapable of it dick is one of the few people in the world who dont want money you must call him dick though the pale lady smiled faintly dick she said if i may we have a common sorrow and a common misfortunemine to have married a bad man you to be his son can these things make a foundation for friendship let us try said dick with something like a moistening of the eye he was a tenderhearted sentimental creature who could not bear to see a woman suffer alice held out her thin white hand dick took it and kissed it if friendship he said can exist between mistress and servant then am i your friend but if not then your servant at your command this place john haveril laid his hand upon dicks shoulder is your home and what we have is at your service dick said molly we are now a kind of cousins and you are a sort of stepson of the house so long molly as you dont call me brother johnafter the young people had gonedid you tell him about his father no i didnt john sat down and gave his reasons very slowly why this way i thought hes the young mans father thats true but he ran away from his wife and his childtwice he did that wont make the son respect the father much will it next alice ive been to see the sick man youve been to see him john you are a good man john you deserve a less troublesome wife when that creature in rags wanted to sell his secret i pretended i didnt care but i did it made me sick and sorry to think of that poor bad man without a friend or a helper in his time of need you are not jealous are you john i did love the man once he is a worthless wicked man you are not jealous are you john i have no such feeling left for him it is all pitypity for a man who is punished for his sins not i lassnot i pity him as much as you please tell me what he looks like well hes like this young fellow dick also hes like that other chapsir humphreymore like him than the other hes grey now and thin cheeks sunk in and fingers like bits of glass i told him who i was but he only half understood he wont desert any more women i reckon theyve got stories about him at the hospitalthe boys there pick up everything no alice i dont think it would make this fellow they call dick any happier to see his father ill go again dont think of him any more my dear remember what the doctor said keep quiet chapter xiii a midnight walk let me walk home with you said dick it is a fine night and we can walk they left the hotel and turned northwards across trafalgar square the pale worn face of that poor woman haunts me molly it is a strange adventure you will love her dick as much as i do but there is that trouble behind whatever it is that she has not yet told me dick looked up and straightened himself they were in the crowdthe crowd infect and horrible at the top of the haymarket it is really peaceful night he said the air just here is corrupt with voices and there are shapes about that mock the peace of darkness but it is really peaceful night and overhead are the stars just as in the country you are like the lady in comus molly these are only shapes and shadows that you see they do not exist except in imagination they are the ghosts and devils that belong to night in streets molly pressed a little closer to him but made no reply what do men understand of the wonder the bewilderment with which a girl looks on the rabble rout if ever she is permitted to see it what does it reveal to her this mockery of the peaceful night presently they came to the upper end of regent street which was quieter and to portland place which was quite deserted and peaceful and then to the outer circle of regents park where they were beyond the houses and where the cool wind of october fell upon their faces from the broad level of the park it is almost country here let us walk in the middle of the road molly he held out his left hand molly linked her little finger with his that is the way we used to walk what time we went on tramp molly yes dick it was this way she was strangely quiet contrary to her usual manner you must never become a town girl molly or a west end woman or a society woman i dont know dick perhaps i must they went on a little farther molly i wanted to talk to you about something else but i must talk about this evening its been a very remarkable evening i am enriched by a kind of stepmothera stepmother before the event so to speak not aftera relationship not in any dictionary i am the child of a younger sultana who would expect to meet in a london hotel in the person of a middleaged millionairess the elder sultana ought one to be sorry for you dick you couldnt have a better stepmother not sorry exactly but she recalls the sins of the forefathers i have always understood that he was that kind of person my mother who took it wrathfully was careful that i should know the kind of person he was her history halved the fifth commandment this good lady takes it tearfully she was thinking of her own dead child for a moment she thought you were her son does one weep for a child four and twenty years after its death there was more than a dead child in those tears it was your playing then you never played so well the violin talked all the time it made me glow only to think of your birds and breezes and flowers i shall call on her tomorrow she wants to talk about it again molly its a wonderful thing what is a wonderful thing for he stopped woman is a wonderful thing acting as you know my poor molly makes real emotion difficult for us because we are always connecting emotion with its theatrical gesture when we ought to weep we begin to think of how we weep you talk like a book sometimes dick where do you get all your wisdom not from books come on tramp with me and you shall learn where i get it molly all the thoughts worth having come to a man as he walks along the road especially by night books cant tell him anything i say that we cant help connecting emotion with the stage way of expressing it this makes us quick to understand emotion when we do see it without the stage directions which is odd but its true an actor born is a kind of thoughtreader what are you driving at dick i mean that an actor knows real emotion just because it isnt like the stage business well what then i was thinking of that poor pale lady molly its four and twenty years since her husband deserted her and she thinks about him still there isnt room in a womans heart for more than one lover in a life thats all what then its the lingering passion that she thinks was extinguished long ago poor old haveril is all very well but he hasnt the engaging qualities of the light comedian good no doubt at making money and without the greater vices but molly my dear without the lighter virtues and these she remembers well but that isnt what lies on her mind you will be a thoughtreader indeed dick if you can read what is written there they walked on together side by side in silence then the figure of the pale fragile sad woman went out of their thoughts they returned as is the way with youth to themselves you are happy molly he asked i am happy enough she sighed most of us are we make ourselves as happy as we can of course nobody is entirely happy till he gets all he wants for my own part i want very little and i am very nearly quite happy because ive got it all except one thing molly hadnt we better talk about the wisdom acquired on tramp that is just what i am doing my dear child tonight the stars are out the skies are clear the air is fresh i smell the fragrant earth across the park i can almost believe that we are miles and miles from a town and i want to have a real talk with you molly will you let me talk first certainly if you wont abuse the privilege but leave time for me to answer we mustnt throw away such a chance as this i know what you want to say very well i dont ask you to put it out of your head because oh dick you know very well that i like you ever so much you are the only kind of brother i ever had by your leave molly you never had any brother you might have had the kindness to call me pal or cousin or comrade or companion or confidential clerk evenbut not any kind of brother that relationship doesnt exist for you i might as well call myself the child of that good lady being only a kind of posthumous stepson now molly you may go on i only mean so that i can tell everything to you that is permitted now i shall not interrupt very well first of all hilarie is anxious about my appearance so am i she remains firm in the belief that i am the tragedian of the future dick shook his head vain hopes fond dreams you know dont you dick that it is impossible comedy light and sparkling if you please molly as soon as your name is made i shall write a part for you on purpose you shall take the town by stormyou yourself as you are witch and enchantress which makes it the more unfortunate that im compelled to go in for the other business what about advertising lady macbeth and getting ready a burlesque molly took no notice of this suggestion hilarie thinks the time is now approaching when i ought to make my dbut dick i declare that i dont care one farthing about disappointed ambition i told you so before but i do care about disappointing hilarie and that weighs on my soul more than anything almostmore than the two other things what are the two other things i am coming to them either of them you see would bring consolationof sortsfor disappointed ambition first your cousin sir humphrey oh he goes on making love does he he goes on pressing for an answer what answer shall i give him i will try to answer as if i was a disinterested bystander you must consider not what he wants but what you want he offers me position andi supposewealth he wants me to marry him secretly and to live out of the world while he smooths matters with his mother dick stopped in the middle of the road what he cried he wants you to marry him secretly thetheno i wont use names and language marry him secretly and go into hiding why because you love the man but you dont because he will make you lady woodroffe but he wonthe will hide you away because he is rich my dear i know all about him he has no money at all the money is his mothers she could cut him off with a shilling if she liked because he is clever he isnt hes the laughingstock of everybody except the miserable little clique that he belongs to they talk of artwho have no feeling for art they hand about things they call art which are that will do dick add to this that he is a moody illconditioned beast if he loves you its because any man would love you hed be tired of you in a week i know the man my dear ive made it my business to find out all about him he is unworthy of youquite unworthy molly if you loved him it might be different i say might because then there might be some lessening of the misery you would draw on your headi dont know it might only mean greater miserybecause you would feel his treatment more you are incoherent dick could you marry a man without loving him molly i ask you that here is a seat said molly evading the question which is always a delicate one for girls should theyought theyever to marry without love one would rather not answer that question there are conventions there are things understood rather than expressed there are imaginations men are believed to be what they are not the secret history of men is not suspected there are reasons which might possibly make love quite a secondary consideration it is not indeed a question which ought to be put to any girl here is a seat molly repeated it is chilly but i am tired let us sit down for a minute dick he pressed his question could you possibly marry this fellow molly when you cannot respect him or love him about loving a man dick i suppose its quite possible to marry anybody whether you love him or not whether a girl can screw up her courage to endure a man all day long when she doesnt like him i dont know women have to do a great many things they dont like very few women can afford to choose you can molly and if a man is a gentleman he may be trusted i suppose not to do horrid things he wouldnt get drunk he would be tolerably kind he would not spend all the money on himself he would not desert one he wouldnt throw the furniture about thats a contented and a lowly state of mind molly well and you must consider what a man may have to offer money position independence you should listen to girls talking about these things with each other go on molly its a revelation not really dick why as for love i dont know what it means i dont indeed dont tell lies molly he said pressing her fingers i mean that i dont love sir humphrey a bit in that case why not present him with the boot he wont leave me alone he hangs about the street waiting for me when i go to my lesson he comes to the college when i am staying with hilarie and oh dick cant you understand the temptation of it no i cant well then try to understand it here i am a girl with no money dependent on hilarie who is all sweetness and goodness yet dependent and this man who may bevery likelyall that you say offers me this promotion you ought not to be tempted he is insulting you if he means what he says why doesnt he take you by the hand and lead you to his mother he wont he wants to hide you away but he shall not mollyhe shall not so long as i breathe the upper air molly made no reply what was there to say fine love very fine love dick snorted i dont think i care much about his being all that you say dick because if i have no particular regard for him i should not inquire and i should not mind i suppose he would be tolerably wellbehaved with me then you are credulous molly because he cant behave well to anybody and while i am pulled this way and that way with doubts hilarie is wanting me to make my first appearance and to conquer the world and my teacher thinks i shall do pretty well and learn by experience and i know the contrary because you say so dick certainly quite the contrary and you are always telling me what you want i want you molly nothing short of that will satisfy me then comes another temptationworse than anything what is that its alice she wants me does she hiss diamonds in your ear no she says that shes so fond of me she cannot live without me and she wants me to live with them altogether and john chimes in says he will adopt me and make me his heiress think of that dick millions all for mefor me the daughter of a failure molly dick spoke with solemnity suitable to the occasion this goes to the very root of things you cant go on tramp with me if you begin to hanker after millions no one ever heard of a great heiress talking to a gipsy or dancing in a barn it cant be done the weight of the dollars would nail your very heels to the boards but dick theyre my own people you know my childdick rose for it was getting coldthis is the most alarming temptation of all it must be stopped right away look here molly they were standing face to face under the lamppost beside the railings of the park you know very well that you are only shamming you love me and iwell shall i say it stage people have no emotions dick you said so yourself just now this is not an emotion it is part of me i live in it i breathe it i only exist my molly because of you there isnt any stage gesture to signify my state of mind the stalls would be disturbed in their little minds if one put this passion into visible representation even the gallery wouldnt understand put your arms on my shoulders molly she obeyed she was quite as tall as her lover and she had no difficulty in throwing her arms quite round his neck which she did if she blushed the stars which blink because they are shortsighted could not see it the lamp on the lamppost is of course used to such things you are the best girl in the world he said the best and the dearest and i promise you mollythe best and the dearestthat humphrey shall never marry you and that mrs siddons shall never have a rival in you and that you shall never become miss molly pennefather haveril heiress of millions with decayed dukes and barefooted barons languishing after you he kissed her on the forehead and the lips the girl made no reply except to draw a long breath which might have meant remonstrance and might equally well mean satisfaction she took up the violincase if i must carry the fiddle she said let me see how it feels he made no objection the action was a symbol he accepted it as a visible expression of acquiescence and so side by side in silence they walked home under the stars and the lampposts chapter xiv the first move no my children alice replied it was two days later they were sympathetic children they would feel for one i am not afraid to tell you what troubles me day and night i am not afraid but i am ashamed you need not be ashamed said molly stoutly whatever you did must have been well done alice sighed i wish i could think so sit down one on each side of me and i will tell you take my hand molly dear she was lying on a couch in these days she was troubled with her heart and lay down a good deal so lying with closed eyes she had the courage to tell her storythe whole of itsuppressing nothing the terrible sale of her child she told them all my child was taken away she concluded it was the choice of that for him or the workhouse my people would do nothing for me partly they were pooryou know them mollyand some of them were methodists and serious so i thought of the childs welfare and i thought i should find my husband with the money and soand so you let him go molly finished the sentence i have never known a days peace sincenever a day nor a night without selfreproach weve prosperedoh how weve prospered everything we touch turns to gold and not a single day of happiness has ever dawned for me because i meet the reproachful eyes of my boy everywhere but you gave him to a lady who would treat him well the doctor promised for her but how am i to know that she has treated him well if i could only find out where he is and then came that dream what dream it came three times by which i know that it is a true dream three times each time as vivid and plain as i see you two i was sick i thought i was dying but i wasnt and i know now that i shall not die without seeing my boy that i know because in the dream some one i dont know who pointed to england and said go over nowthis very yearthis fall and you shall find your boy if you wait longer you will never find him that was a strange dream to come three times running wasnt it strange yes a very strange dream so we came john will do anything i ask him we shall losei dont know how muchby coming away but he came with me weve been here three weeks now listen first i found out by accident the doctor who took my child away to be sure he says he knows nothing more about him but it is a first step and now ive found my husbands second sonthat is a second step and both by accident that is both providential what shall i find next i think said molly with profound sagacity that you should give dick a free hand and tell him to search about you dont know how wise dick is he gets his wisdom by tramping at night let him think for you dear you want some one to think for you mrs haveril turned to dick can you help me dick he rose slowly and began to walk about the room can i well i could try but i confess the thing seems difficult its a new line for me the detective line four and twenty years ago we dont know who took the childwhere she took the child whether it is still living whether the lady who took it is living we want to find the clue dick said molly if we had a clue we shouldnt want your assistance find one for us he sat down at the piano ideas come this way often he played a few chords and got up not this morning well let us see the doctor says he doesnt know if he doesnt who can who else was there an indian ayah where is that woman no mark on the child no nothing put up with the clothes a rattle ah people dont keep rattles and a paper with his christian name people dont keep such papers and so the child disappears how shall we find him after all these years have you anything to suggest do you suspect anybody in the whole wide world no theres only the young man i met at the doctors hes so wonderfully like your father and like you too but they say hes the son of some great man hes bigger than you dick your mother was a little woman i should say she was slight like most american women this young man is tall your father was a personable man and hes bigmuch like my family dick when i first saw him my heart went out to him i thought oh my boy must be like you tall and handsome would it not be better dear lady to make up your mind to forget the whole thing consider it is so long ago i would if i could but i cant no dick i can never forget it force yourself to think about something else it seems so desperately hopeless she shook her head when you play my thoughts go out after him whether i will or not i am sitting with my son somewhere or walking with him or talking with him i dream of him at night perhaps he is deadbecause i dream of him so much but i cannot think of him as dead oh dick if you could find my son for me my dear lady i will do what i can you must think said molly morning noon and night about nothing else consult your violin you may whisper it into the pianocase yes yesmeantime its no use going to see the doctor he says he doesnt know but if he called upon the woman at her hotel he must have inquired for her by name he did not she came to him her own child was dead did she come to the place before the child died or after i cannot tell you who else was concerned let us consider an indian ayah now one doesnt bury a child and adopt another child without other people knowing it you cant do itservants must know perhaps the child was substituted that has been done i believe but servants must know the secret then there are the undertakers who buried the child the place where it is buried if we knew the name of the child i believe it would be easy after all to trace it then there is the place where the child died it isnt often that a child dies in a hotel there are the doctors who attended the childthey might remember the case if we only knew the name of the child without that we are powerless i told you dick said molly that we want you to find the clue if we knew the name of the child we could go on quite easily without you very likely he continued there was no concealment it was an open adoption known to everybody concerned who were only three people then why did the lady conceal her name she was probably anxious that the child should not know his relations at all perhaps dick if you were to go away and think for a bit molly insisted oh yes presently meantime there is one very simple way will you spend some money john will let you spend as much as you please very well then he sat down and took pen and paper the most simple way is to advertise let the world know what you want offer a reward same as for a lost dog what do you think of this whereas in the month of february a child was adopted by a lady unknown in the city of birmingham the mother of the child will be most grateful to the lady who adopted it if she will send her name and address to what shall we say r w care of the hall porter dumfries flats i will receive the letters but the reward i am coming to that molly in case of the ladys death a reward of will be paid for such information as will enable the child now a young man of twentysix if he is living to be identified nothing will be given for any information except such as is capable of proof no persons will be received and no verbal communications will be heard there molly what do you think of that it might have been observed that neither then nor afterwards did richard consult mrs haveril he took the conduct of the case into his own hands and mollys dick i knew you were awfully clever i think it a splendid way as if such a thing as an advertisement was entirely novel and previously unknown yes said dick contemplating the document with pride i flatter myself that it is a good idea looks well on paper doesnt it he held it at arms length to catch the noontide sun whereastheres a legal note as they say about it well now molly let us see how this will work if the adoption was real somebody must know of itwhether the lady is living or dead then we shall get a reply in a day or two in a day or two alice think of that if it was a substitution we shall get no reply from the lady but then we may expect that other people know about itservants and such then the reward comes in oh isnt he clever alice in a weekat leastyou shall have your boy now i go dick concluded with one more admiring glance at the paper before he folded it up and put the advertisement in the leading papers all over the country and keep it going for a week unless we hear something let us live in hope meantime sir robert read the advertisement over his breakfast ah he said she has found an adviser she means business she will spend money what is the good she can just prove nothing i am the master of the situation yet there remained an uneasiness for although he was the master of the situation it might be at the cost of declaringor swearing in a courtthat he still knew nothing as to the name and position and residence of the lady lady woodroffe read the advertisement as well one of her secretaries pointed it out to her as an interesting item in the days news she read it she held the paper before her face to hide a guilty pallor her heart sank low the dreadful thing was already in the papers soon perhaps it would appear again with her name attached to it next morning a letter was received by the advertiser it enclosed the advertisement cut out of a paper with these words you need not advertise any more the child has been dead for twenty years nowrichard read the letter twice before he began to think about itwhat does this mean if it was adoption why not come forward if it was substitution then the child may be dead or he may not i dont think he is for my part i believe it is a tryon to make us give over we shall not give over dear madam he continued the advertisement therefore for another week yet there came no more letters and no discovery oh dick and i have been waiting day after day we must change the advertisement the anonymous letter proves pretty clearly that there is reason for concealment else why did not the writer sign her name it was in a ladys handwritingnot a servants the adoption therefore to put it kindly was not generally known let us alter the advertisement we will now put in a few more details we will leave the mother out and we will no longer address the lady in consequence of this resolution the following advertisement appeared next day whereas in the month of february in the city of birmingham a child adopted by a lady to take the place of her own recently dead was taken to the railway station was there delivered to the lady and carried to londona reward of two thousand guineas will be given to any person who will give such information as may lead to the discovery and identity of the child nothing will be given for proffered information which does not lead to such discovery and identity no advance will be made for expenses of travelling or any other expenses and no person will be received who offers verbal information address by writing only to r w care of the hall porter dumfries flats i dare say that many of my readers will remember the interestnay the racketcreated by the appearance of this strange series of advertisements which were never explained the mystery is still referred to as an illustration of romance in upper circles some of the american papers quoted it as another proof of the profligacy of an aristocracy concluding that it was the substitution of a gutter child for the scion of a baronial stock this time there were shoals of answers they came by hundreds they came from all parts of the country one would think that adoption by purchase was a recognized form of creating heirs to an estate one railway porter wrote from birmingham stating that he remembered the affair perfectly well because the lady gave him sixpence that he saw the lady into the carriage carrying the baby which was dressed in white clothes with a woollen thing over its face that on receipt of travelling money and a trifle of on account he would run up to london and identify the baby another person conveyed the startling intelligence that she herself was the mother of the child that she could tell by whom it was adopted my child she said is now a belted earl but my conscience upbraids me better a crust with the reward than the pricks of a guilty conscience a third wrote with the warmth of a man of the world did the advertiser believe that he was such a juggins as to give away the story without making sure of the reward if so but the writer preferred to think that he was dealing with a man of honour as well as a man of businesstherefore he would propose a sure and certain plan there must be in delicate affairs a certain amount of confidence on both sides the writer knew the whole history which was curious and valuable and concerned certain noble houses he had the proofs in his hands he was prepared to send up the story with the proofs which nobody could question after once reading them by return of post but there must be some show of confidence on both sides for himself he was ready to confide in their promise to pay the reward let them confide to some extent in him a mere trifle would dothe twentieth part of the rewardsay a hundred pounds let the advertiser send this sum to him in registered letter care of the dog and duck aston terrace birmingham in tenpound notes and by return post would follow the proofs or if as might happenthe writer thought it best in such matters to be extremely prudentthe advertiser did not trust this plan he had a brother in a respectable way in a coffeehouse and lodgings for single men kingsland road let the money be deposited in his hands to be held until the proofs and vouchers had been received nothing could be fairer than the proposal and so on and so on richard greatly enjoyed these letters human faces he said may differ legs are long or short eyes are straight or skew but the human mind when two thousand pounds are involved is apparently always the same meantime which was disappointing he was not a bit advanced in his inquiry sir robert read this advertisement as well she is well advised he said shes going the right way to work they calculate that servants know and they offer a big reward if that doesnt fetch them therell be a bigger but its no goodits no good nobody knows what i know he thought it best however to reassure lady woodroffe i hoped he said that we should have no further occasion to speak about a certain transaction i suppose however that you have heard of certain advertisements i have do you think i do not think nay i am certain lady woodroffe remember that there is only one person who knows the two women engaged in that transaction i stood between them i am not going to bring them together unless you desire me to do so i came to say this in case you should be in the least degree uneasy thank you sir robert she answered humbly she trusted in that squarejawed beetlebrowed man yet she was humiliated i certainly confide in you he got up then i will waste your time no longer you are always at worki see and read and hearalways at workgood worksgood works her lips parted but she was silent did he mean a reflection on the one work that had not been quite so good but he was gone the advertisement was repeated in all the papers england scotland ireland the colonies knew about this adoption and the anxiety of the mother to recover her son at this stage of the investigation the subject began to be generally talked about the newspapers had leading articles on the general subject of adoption it was an opportunity for the display of classical scholarship of medival scholarship of historical scholarship cases of pretence of substitution are not uncommon there are noble houses about which things are whisperedthings which must not be bruited abroad the subject of adoption open or concealed proved fertile and fruitful to the leaderwriter one man for instance projected himself in imagination into the situation and speculated on the effect which would be produced on a young man of culture and fine feeling of finding out at five and twenty that he belonged to quite another family with quite another set of traditions prejudices and ideas thus a young man born in the purple or near it brought up in great respect for birth connections and family history with a strong prejudice in favour of an aristocratic caste suddenly discovers that his people belong to the lowest grade of those who can call themselves of the middle class and that he has no kind of connection with the folk to whom he has always believed himself attached what would be the effect upon an educated and a sensitive mind what would be the effect upon his affections how would he regard his new motherprobably a vulgar old womanor his new brothers and sistersprobably preposterous in their vulgarity what effect would the discovery have upon his views of life what upon his politics what upon his opinions as to small trade and the mean and undignified and sordid employments by which the bulk of mankind have to live at dinnertables people talked about this mysterious adoption what could it mean why did not the lady come forward was it as some of the papers argued clearly a case of fraudulent substitution if not why did she not come forward she was dead perhaps if so why did not some one else come forward if however it really was a case of substitution then the position was intelligible for instance the case quoted the day before yesterday by the daily news that was surely a similar case and so on all the speakers wise with the knowledge derived from yesterdays paper are we sufficiently grateful to our daily papers and our leaderwriters for providing us with subjects of conversation the subject was handled with great vigour one night at lady woodroffes own table sir robert was present he argued with ability that there was no reason to suppose any deception at all that in his view the lady had adopted the child and had resolved to bring up the child in complete ignorance of its relatives who were presumably of the lowlier sort that she had seen no reason to take her servants into her confidence or her friends and that she now saw no reason to let the young man learn who his real relations were and he drew a really admirable sketch of the disgust with which the young man would receive his new cousins lady woodroffe while this agreeable discussion was continued sat at the head of her table calm pale and collected then there appeared a third advertisement it was just like the second except that it now raised the reward to ten thousand guineas it also included the fact that the child had been received at the birmingham station by an indian ayah this advertisement caused searchings of heart in all houses where there had been at any time an indian ayah the suggestion in every one of these houses was that a child had died and another had been substituted the matter was discussed in the servants hall at lady woodroffes the butler had been in service with sir humphrey and his household for thirty years i came home he said from india with sir humphrey we came to this house my lady and the ayahshe that died six or seven years agowere already here with the childnow sir humphrey did you know the child again know the child id know sir humphreys child anywhere why i saw him every day till he was six months old a lovely child he was with his light hair and his blue eyes did my lady come from birmingham what would my lady be doing at birmingham she came straight through from scotland from her noble pa lord dunedin the ayah told us so the page who was listening resigned with a sigh the prospect of getting that reward of ten thousand guineas lady woodroffe upstairs read the third advertisement and grew faint and sick with fear sir robert read the advertisement very good he said very good indeed but if there had been any one who knew anything at all there would have been an answer to the offer of two thousand pounds let them offer a million if they like dick said molly it seemed very clever at first but you see nothing has come of it on the contrary something has come of it mind you the whole world is talking about the case if it was a genuine adoption the unknown woman would certainly have come forward why because there could be no reason for concealment as it is she remains silent why because there has been substitution instead of adoption she has put forward another baby in the place and in the name of the dead child how can you prove that i dont know molly i believe i have missed my vocation i am a sleuthhound give me a clue put me on the scent and let me rip his face hardened his features grew sharper his eyes keener he bent his neck forward he was no longer the musician he was the bloodhound looking for the scent the acting instinct in him made him while he spoke adapt his face and his expression to the new part he played to look the part is if you consider essential chapter xv two jumps and a conclusion the advertisements produced no answer except from persons hoping to make money by the casesuch as the railway porter who could swear to the baby the lady who was really the mother or the detective who wanted a good longstaying job there seemed no hope or help from the advertisement well then what next by this time richard woodroffe though never before engaged upon this kind of business found himself so much interested in the subject that he could think of nothing else he occupied himself with putting the case into a statement which he kept altering he carried himself back in imagination to the transference of the baby he saw the doctor taking it from the mother and giving it to an ayah in the railway station and there he stopped his friend sir robert was the doctorhis friend sir robert who knew all the theatrical and show folk as well as the royal princes and the dukes and illustrious folk well he knew this physician well enough to be certain that a secret was as safe behind those steady deepset eyes as with any father confessor that square chin did not belong to a garrulous temper that big brain was a treasury of family secrets he knew where all the skeletons were kept this was only one of a thousand secrets his patients told him everythingthat was of course because he was a specialist in nervous disorders which have a good deal to do with family and personal secrets fortunately personal secrets are not family secrets there is a deepseated prejudice against the upper ten thousand in the matter of family secrets they are supposed to possess a large number of these awkward chronicles and they are all supposed to be scandals aristocratic circles are supposed to be very much exposed to the danger of catching a family secret a disease which is contagious and is passed on from one family to another with surprising readiness they are supposed also to be continually engaged in hushing up hiding away sending accomplices and servants cognizant of certain transactions to america and the antipodes even dropping them into dungeons they are believed to be always trying to forget the last scandal but one while they are destroying the proofs of the last scandal for my own part while admitting the contagion of the disorder i would submit that an earl is no more liable to it than an alderman a baron no more than a butcher middleclass families are always either going up or going down with those which are going up there is an immense quantity of things to be forgotten we wipe out with a sponge a deplorable greataunt we look the other way when we pass her grave we agree to forget a whole family of cousins we do not wish ourselves to be remembered more than say thirty years back we desire that no inquiry other than general shall be made into our origins in a wordif we may compress so great a discovery in a single sentencethe middle classthe great middle classbackbone legs brain and tongue as we all know of the countrythe class to which we all or nearly all belongis really the home and haunt of the family secret this secret however was not in the ordinary runnot those which excitable actresses pour into the ears of physicians moreover if the theory was true it was a secret richard reflected as much of the doctors as of the ladys and again since adoption became substitution although the young doctor may have assisted in the former the old doctor might not be anxious for the story to get about now that it meant the latter here however were the facts as related by alice herself an unknown lady according to the doctors statement called upon him and stated that she was anxious to adopt a child in place of her own which she had just lost by death this was early in february the lady stated further that she wanted a child about fifteen months of age lighthaired blueeyed the child she adopted was thirteen months of age did the child die in birmingham as the lady was apparently passing through did the child die at a hotel dr steele called upon alice then in great poverty and distress and asked her if she would let the child be adopted or whether she would suffer it to go into the workhouse she chose the former alternative and accepted the sum of fifty pounds for her child the money was paid in fivepound notes she did not know the numbers there were no marks on the child by which he might be identified on the childs clothes before giving him up the mother pinned a paper giving his christian namehumphrey he was the son of anthony woodroffe in the woodroffe family there was always a humphrey nothing else nothing elseno clue no suggestion or hint or opening anywhere except resemblance the strange likeness of this young man humphrey to himself haunted dick he looked at himself in the glass any one could see that his features his hair his eyes were those of humphrey differences there werein stature in expression in carriage dick was as elastic and springy as the other was measured and slow of gait as for that other resemblance said by alice to be even more markedthat between humphrey and anthony woodroffe the actor john anthonyit was even more remarkable these resemblances one may look for in sons and in brothers but not in cousins separated by five hundred years another point which he kept to himself was the resemblance which he found in humphrey to alice his mother by theory it was not the same kind of resemblance as the otherfeatures face head all were different it was that resemblance which remindsa resemblance not defined in words but unmistakable and all day long and all night dick saw this resemblance he put down the points the strongest possible resemblanceso stated by the mother of the adopted childof son to father a strong resemblance as between brothers or sons of the same father a resemblancewas it fancy of his ownas between mother and son the lady who adopted the boy must have belonged to an indian family because there was an ayah with her the age of the child adopted corresponded very nearly with the age of sir humphrey he went to the british museum and consulted debrett he took the trouble to go there because he did not possess the volume and none of his friends had ever heard of it there he read as the doctor had read a few weeks before that the present holder of the woodroffe baronetcy was humphrey arundale second baronet son of the late sir humphrey etc born on december the nd there was nothing much to be got out of that little paragraph but as dick read it again and again the letters began to shift themselves it is astonishing how letters can by a little shifting convey a very different meaning this is what he read now woodroffe humphrey falsely calling himself second baronet and son of the late sir humphrey really son of one john anthony woodroffe distant cousin of sir humphrey vocalist comedian and vagabond by alice daughter of tom dick or harry pennefather engaged in small trade of hackney born in sold by his mother in february through the agency of sir robert steele md frs expresident of the royal college of physicians now of harley street to lilias lady woodroffe daughter of the earl of dunedin who passed him off as her own child collateral branchesrichard son of the late john anthony woodroffe by bethia his second wife after he had divorced and deserted the above mentioned alice october unmarried has no club musician singer comedian vagabond he put back the volume its a very remarkable red book he said nobody knows how they get at these facts now i for my part dont seem able to get at the truth however much i try and there debrett has it in print for all the world to read he then looked up the same work twelve years before he found under the name of woodroffe the fact that sir humphrey the elder retired from active service and returned to england early in february the old man came home then he said at the very time when the adoption was negotiated at that very time how does that bear on the case well if his own child died there was perhaps time to get another to take its place before he got home now dick in a small way was a storyteller he was in request by those who knew him because he told stories very well and also because he told very few and would only work when he could capture an idea and when a story came of its own accord he was the author of one or two comediettas further he had been on the stage and had played many parts from this variegated experience he understood the value of drawing your conclusion first and putting together your proofs afterwards perhaps the proofs might fail to arrive but the conclusion would remain geometry wants to build up proofs and arrive at a conclusion which one would not otherwise guess who could possibly imagine that the square on the side opposite the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle not even the sharpest woman ever created would arrive at such a conclusion without proofs in law also chiefly because men are mostly liars exact proof is demandedproof arrived at by painfully picking the truth out of the lies this young man for his part partly because he was a storyteller and a dramatist partly because he was a musician found it the best and readiest method to jump at the truth first and to prove it afterwards he arrived at this conclusion which perfectly satisfied him without any reason like a kangaroo by a jump in fact he took two jumps it is always a great help in cases requiring thought and argument and constructionbecause every good case is like a story in requiring constructionto consult the feminine mind if you are interested in the owner or tenant of a certain mind it makes the consultation all the better richard woodroffe consulted molly every day by talking over the case again and again and by looking at it in company one becomes more critical and at the same time clearer in ones views there were as you know many reasons why richard should consult this young lady apart from her undoubted intelligence why molly he askedwhyi put it to your feminine perceptionswhy was this good lady so profoundly moved by the mere sight of the fellow she wasnt moved by the sight of me yet i am exactly like him i believe it was at the theatre she was in a private box he was one of a line of johnnies in the stalls she was so much affected that she had to leave the house she met him again at steeles dinner she was affected in the same way why she is presumed never to have seen the fellow before she certainly has not seen him for twentyfour years why i ask was she so much affected she tells me that the sight of him always affects her in exactly the same waywith the same mysterious yearning and longing and with a sadness indescribable wait a minute hear me out is it his resemblance to a certain manher first husband but again i am like him and she does not yearn after me a bit what can it be except an unknown sensethe maternal instinctwhich is awakened in her what is it but his own identity which she alone can understandwith her child dick said molly its a tremendous jump yet of course of course i knew you would agree with me the intuitionsthe conclusionsthe insight of women are beyond everything molly it is a blessed thing that you are retained in this case the sight of you is to me a daily refresher the look of you is a heavy fee and the voice of you is an encouragement stand by me mollyand i will pull this halfbrother of mine down from that bad eminence and ask him when he stands beside me with an entirely new and most distinguished company of cousins how he feels and what has become of his superiority you shall introduce him to the pewopener and i will present him to the draper again there was the second jump i ask you that molly do you imagine that the doctor is really and truly as ignorant as he would have us believe of the ladys name he knows lady woodroffe he asks her son to dinner to be sure he knows half the world if he attended the dead child of course he would have known her name but i suppose he did not if so since the lady came to him immediately after the death he might have consulted the registers to find what children of that age had died during a certain week in birminghamif the child did die there of which we are not certain even in a great city like birmingham there are not many children of that age dying every day very few dying in hotels and very few children indeed belonging to visitors and strangers molly mineif the doctor did not know the doctor might have known is that so deny it if you can i suppose so dick though really i dont see what you are driving at very well then we go on why did the doctor go out of his way to invite humphrey to meet his true mother now i know dr steele hes an awfully good fellowcharitable and goodnatured hell do anything for a man but hes a man of science and hes always watching and thinking and putting things together ive heard him talk about heredity and what a man gets from his ancestors now im quite certain mollywithout any proofi dont want any proof hang your hardandfast matteroffact evidence i am quite certain i say that steele invited humphrey and his mother and myself in order to look at us all and watch differences and likenesses you see the case may be a beautiful illustration of hereditary qualities here is a young man separated from his own people from infancy there can be no imitation and now after twenty years and more the man of science can contemplate the son brought up in a most aristocratic and superior atmosphere the mother who has always remained in much the same condition except for money and another son who has been brought up like his father a vagabond and a wandererwith a fiddle it was a lovely chance for him i saw him looking at us all dinnertime in the evening when i was playing i saw him under his bushy eyebrows looking from humphrey to his mother i wondered why now i know the doctor molly is an accomplice an accomplice oh and a man in that position an accomplice after the act not before it my theory is this dr steele met the lady after he came to town how he managed to raise himself from the cheap general practitioner to a leading london physician one doesnt know its like stepping from thirty shillings a week to being a star at fifty pounds no one knows how its done do you think lady woodroffe was useful in talking about him if i wrote a story i should make the doctor dog the ladys footsteps and coerce her into advancing him but this isnt a story however i take it that he met her recognized her and that they agreed that nothing was to be said about this little transaction of the past then of course when alice turned up unexpectedly and asked where the child was to be seen there was nothing to do except to hold up his hands and protest that he knew nothing about the child but all this is guesswork dick yes i am afraid we have nothing before us but guesswork unless we get some facts to go upon look here a woman is standing on one side of a high wall another woman is on the other side of the wall there is a door in the wall sir robert keeps the key of that door in his pocket there is only one key and he has it unless he consents to unlock the door those two women can never meet and so my halfbrother will remain upon his eminence they fell into a gloomy silence dick broke it molly what about our good friend the mother of this interesting changeling she is strangely comforted by the reflection that the matter is in your hands dick you have found favour in her sight and in her husbands good so far and she is firmly persuaded that you will bring the truth to light she still clings to her dream you know does she talk about humphrey was she taken with him she says little she lies down and shuts her eyes then she is thinking of him she likes me to play so that she may think about him when we drive out i am sure she is looking for him in the crowd if he were to call she would tell him everything and i am certain that she dreams of heaping upon him all that a young man can possibly desire as soon as she gets him back i hope the poor soul will not meet with disappointment but i fear mollyi fear he relapsed into his gloomy silence i hold the two ends of the chain in my hands but i cannot connect the ends i might go to steele and show him what i suspect he would only laugh at me he laughs like the sphynx sometimes if i went to lady woodroffe i should be handed over to her solicitors and by them conducted to the high court of justice i should hear plain speaking from the judge on the subject of defamation of character everybody would believe that i was a blackmailer i should be called upon to pay large sums of money as damages and i should have to go through the court of bankruptcy the mind of this inquirer had never before been exercised upon any matter more knotty than the presentation of a simple plot or the difficulty of getting people off the stage sometimes in moments of depression he even doubted his own conclusionsa condition of mind fatal to all discovery because it is quite certain that the eye of faith first perceives what the slow piecing together of facts afterwards proves you must perceive the truth somehow first before you can prove it perhaps it is not the truth which is at first discerned in that case the seeker after truth has at least an imaginary object by which to direct his steps it may lead him wrong on the other hand it may help him to recover the clue which will lead him straight to the heart of things in a word one wants a theory to assist all research in things of science or in things of practice dick said molly about those registers what about them why that the doctor might have found the name of the child by simply looking into the registers if the child that is to say died in birmingham yesif it died in birmingham well then dickif the doctor could search those registers she stopped for a moment they always do it on the stage to heighten the effect well molly why cant you dick sat down suddenly knocked over by the shock of this suggestion good heavens molly oh the depth and the height and the spring and the leap of womans wit why cant i why cant i molly i am a log and a lump and a lout i deserve that you should take my halfbrother nonot that goodbye goodbye incomparable shepherdess he raised her hand and kissed it i flyi hastenon the wings of the windto birminghamthe city of hidden truthto read the revelations of the register chapter xvi a wretch hilarie sat alone in the deep recesses of the western porch of the old church although it was november this sheltered porch was still warm the swallows that make the summer and their friends the swifts were gone the leaves which still clung to the trees were red and brown and yellow the grass which clothed the graves no longer waved under the breeze with light and shade and sunshine none of the old bedesmen were walking the churchyard even the children in the school were silent over their work as if singing only belonged to summer and the wind whistled mournfully in the branches of the yew her face always so calm and restful to others was troubled and disturbed as she sat by herself she held two letters in her hand one of them was open she had already read it twice now she read it a third time it was from molly and it ran as follows dearest president of the only college where they teach sweet thoughts and gracious manners and nothing elsewhere they have only one professor who is the president and the chaplain and all the lecturersi have not seen you for so long a time that i am ashamed now i am going to tell you why i must make confession and then i must ask your advice i can do this much better by writing than by talking so that i will write first and we will talk afterwards i have to tell you most unexpected things and most wonderful events they are full of temptations and quandaries first for my confession your ambition for me has been that i should be ambitious for myself i have done my best to meet your wish i have tried to be ambitious in the best wayyour way you thought that i might make a serious attempt at serious actingthat i might become a queen of tragedy alas i have felt for some time that i must abandon the attempt i cannot portray the emotions i cannot feel the emotions of tragedy my nature is too shallow i cannot realize a great passion i only know that it must produce in voice and face and speech and gesture changes and indications that cannot be taught as for me when i try i become either stilted or wooden the passion does not seize me and possess me ambition of a kind is not wanting i like to imagine myself a great actress sweeping across the stage with a velvet train i like to think of the people rising and applauding but as for the part i am not moved at all i think about nothing but myself if i look in the glass i am told that i have not the face for tragedy if i begin to declaim i cannot feel the words i am just like the young man who kept on dreaming that he was a great poet until he made the disagreeable discovery that in order to be a great poet it is absolutely necessary to write great poems my dear hilarie i must put a stop to this attempt at once i have been a burden to you for five long years let me not load you with more than is necessary i dont say anything about thanks because you knowyou know dickyou remember dick my fathers old young friendthe dick that turned up on tramp that day you three cousins mettells me that in comedy i should do well you shall hear directly that it is quite possible that i may change the buskin for the sockwhich he says is the classical way of putting it he tells me that an expressive facemine can screw up or be pulled out like an indiarubber facea tall figure and a fairly good voice are wanted first of all and that i have all three but you will see directly that poor dick is not quite a disinterested person still he may be right and i must say that if i am to go on the stage i would rather make them laugh than cry it must be much more pleasant to broaden their faces with smiles than to stiffen them with terror at the sight of the bloodstained dagger the stage seems the only profession open to a girl like me if i am to have a profession at allwhich you will understand directly is no longer absolutely necessary i was born behind the footlights dick was born in the sawdust so there seems a natural fitness however until i knew you all my acquaintances were these folk i have never learned to think of myself as belonging to the world at all to my young imagination the world consisted of a great many people whose only occupation was to scrape money together in order to buy seats at a theatre some made things some painted things some built things some contrived things some wrote things they were extremely industrious because their industry brought them tickets the shops i imagined were only established and furnished for the purpose of providing things wanted by the show folk i have never in fact got rid of that feeling the show was everything all the world existed only to be dramatized even the church you see could be put upon the stage so as i said the stage is the only profession for me if i am to choose a profession there is another thing i suppose i got this idea too from my upbringing it is that to be an actress is the one honourable career for a woman not to be a great actressbut just an actress thats all i believe that the people who really belong to this profession from one generation to another dont really care very much about being great actors they are just content to belong to the profession just as most doctors have no ambition to become great doctors but are just content with being in the profession in acting it is the newcomer who wants to be great there is something comfortable and satisfying in a position of humble utility i may possibly become the housemaid of farce with a black daub upon my face the next thing is about my newly discovered cousin alice haveril she is the kindest of womennext to one she heaps kindnesses upon me she loads me with dresses gold chains bonnets gloves and would load me with money if i could take it but i will not have that form of gift i am very much with her because she has no friends here and her husband is much engaged with his affairs she is in most delicate health with a weak heart she has a terrible trouble the nature of which i have recently learned and she wants some one with her constantly i spend most of the day with her i drive with her go shopping with her read to her and talk to her now dear hilarie here is my temptation my cousin alice wants me to go back to america with her and her husband he would like it too they are enormously rich they could make me an heiress the husband john haveril is as honest and kindly a man as you could wish to find he is a man who has made his own way he has not the manners of society but he is not vulgar he is well bred by instinct this is i confess a great temptation it is more than a temptation it seems almost a duty i have found this poor fragile creature i know why she suffers i think i ought not to leave her if i accept their offer i shall become one of the rich heiresses of america it will mean millions but then i really do not want millions i shall have to give up all my friends if i go away to america this would be very hard i should also lose the happiness of desiring things i cannot now obtain i believe that longing after things unattainable is the chief happiness of the impecunious only think of forming a wish and having it instantly realized how selfish how thoughtless of other people how fat and coarse and lazy one would become dick has often spoken of the terrible effect produced upon the mind by the possession of wealth perhaps he has prejudiced me the next temptation comes from a certain young man he besieges mehe swears he cannot live without me he wants me to be engaged secretlyhe says that i have promised but i have not as for keeping any secrets from you and especially a matter of this importance it is ridiculous the young man is in fact one of the cousinssir humphrey at this point hilarie started laid down the letter looked up read the words again went on with a red spot in either cheek i confess humbly that the position which he offers attracts me that so humble a person as myself should be elevated without any warning so to speak to this positionhis mother is a great leader in the philanthropic part of societyis a curious freak of fortune it is like a storybook as for the manwell for my own feeling about him it is certainly quite true that i could very well live without him i certainly should not droop and languish if he were to go somewhere else yetyou know him hilarie he is clever in a way he thinks he has ideas about arthe paints smudges puts together chords and writes lines that rhyme he also plays disjointed bits and complains that they do not appeal to me that is harmless however his manners are distinguished i suppose he is quite contemptuous of everybody who has work to do if you talk to him about the world below it is like running your head against a stone wall he loves me he says for the opposites and what that means i dont know i suppose that as a gentleman he could be trusted to behave with decency and kindness to his wife at the same time i have found him more than once of a surprising ill temper moody jealous violent and i think that he is selfish in the cultivated mannerthat is to say selfish with refinement i cannot and will not be guilty of a secret engagement while a secret marriage which he also vehemently urges unknown to his mother or my friends and to be kept in retirement concealed from everybody is a degradation to which i would never submit i cannot understand what my lover means by such a proposal nor why he cannot see that the thing is an insult and an impossibility however i have refused concealment meantime a most romantic and wonderful discovery is going to be disclosed i must not set it down on paper even for your eyes hilarie it is a discovery of which humphrey knows nothing as yet he will learn it i believe in a few days when he does learn it it will necessitate a complete change in all his views of life it will open the world for him it will take him out of his narrow grooves it will try him and prove him now dear hilarie am i right to waitwithout his knowing why if he receives this discovery as he oughtif it brings out in him what is really noble in his character i can trust myself to him at the same time it will deprive him of what first attracted me in him but i must not tell you more lastly my dear old dick has been making love to me just as he did when i was fifteen and he was seventeen going about with my father practising and playing such a conservativeso full of prejudices is dick i confess to you dear hilarie i would rather marry dick than anything else we should never have any moneydick gives away all he gets he will not put by if i am ill he says take me to the hospital if i die he says bury me in the hedge like the gipsy folk he never wants money and i should sometimes go on tramp with him and we should sit in the woods and march along the roads and hear the skylark sing and yearn for the unattainable and go on crying for we know not what like the little children oh delightful and dick is always sweet and always goodexcept perhaps when he speaks of humphrey who has angered him by cold and superior airs dick is a philosopher except on that one side when i think of marrying dick dear hilarie my heart stands still for then i get a most lovely dream i close my eyes to see it better it is a most charming vision there is a long road with a broad strip of turf on either side and a high hedge for shade and flowers goodly trees at intervals a road which runs over the hills and down the valleys and along brooks crosses bridges and has short cuts through fields and meadows overhead the lark sings from the trees the yellowhammer cries a little bit of bread and no cheese clouds fly across the sky all kinds of queer people pass alongvagrants beggars gipsies soldiersjust the common sort on the springy turf at the side i myself walk carrying the fiddlein the middle of the road dick tramps going large and free over his shoulders hangs the bag which contains all we want now and then he bursts out singing as he goes in the coppice we sit down on the trunk of a tree and take lunch out of a paper bag sometimes when we are quite alone in a coppice far away from the world dick takes his fiddle out of the case and plays to me all alone music that lifts me out of myself and carries me away i know not whither who would not marry a great magician and in my dream about dick i am never tired i never regret my loti never want money dick is never savage like humphreyhe despises no one he is loved by everybody oh hilarie i would ask for nothingnothing better than to give myself to dick and to follow him and be his slavehis grateful slave is this love hilarie write to me dear hilarie and tell me what i ought to do hilarie laid down the letter with a sigh strange she said molly sees her own path of happiness quite plainly yet she cannot follow it what she does not know is that she has shattered my own dream she opened another letter in her hand i should have known she said he is base metal through and through i should have known yet what a sonof what a mother who would suspect she read the letter again it has been my dream ever since the fortunate day when i met you in the churchyard to unite our branches of the house you have thought me cold about your very beautiful projects and illusions i am perhaps harder than yourself because i know the world better and because i have always found people extremely amiable while you are giving them thingsand exactly the reverse when you call upon them to give to others however you will never find me opposing the plans suggested by your nobility of character i have spoken to my mother upon this subject she stopped shortshe tore the letter in halves then with another thought put back the torn sheet into its envelope wretch she cried i will keep your letter she sat there alone looking out upon the porch the sun went down and the twilight descended and she sat among the graves thinking presently she got up feeling cold and numbed it was a foolish dream she said i ought to have knowni ought to have known she walked slowly homeward as she came out of the coppice into her own park she saw the old house lit up already and through the windows she saw figures flitting about they were her students and they were gathering for afternoon tea why she said i want to be their leader and i dream an idle dream about a worthless man with firmer step and head erect she entered the porch of her house and found herself in the midst of the girls her dream was shatteredshe let it go there are other things to think about besides a worthless man one knows not what were the actual intentions of this young man fate would not as you will presently discover permit him to carry them out we may however allow that he was really in love with one of the two girlsthe one who attracted all mankind not so much by her beauty as by her manner which was caressing and by her conversation which was sprightly he was in love with her after the manner of his father who felt the necessity for an occasional change in the object of his affections to desert one woman for another was part of his inheritancehad hilarie known it one should find excuses for hereditary tendencies those who knew the truth would recognize in this treatment of women the mark of the changeling as for hilarie she wrote a brief note to molly let us talk over these things she said meantime i implore you not to enter into any engagement open or secret with a man who could venture to propose the latter she folded the note she rose she sighed an idle dream she said about a worthless man chapter xvii the second blow three days after this conversation the amateur detective on his first job arrived in london with the midday train from birmingham he was in a state of happiness and triumph almost superhuman for he brought with him as he believed the conclusion of the matter alone singlehanded he had discovered the plot the proofs were in his hands he was on his way to compel the guilty to submission to subdue the proud to send the rich empty away poetical justice would be done his halfbrother would be restored to his fraternal arms and molly would be free i say there was no happier man than this poor credulous richard to be found anywhere than in that thirdclass carriage he wanted no paper to read he sat in a kind of cloud of glorious congratulations everything was proved there was but one step possiblethat of surrender absolute two letters preceded his arrival one was for molly expect me tomorrow evening he said i bring great news but do not say anything to alice the news should be still greater than what i have to tell you the other was for lady woodroffe madam he wrote i have to inform you that i have made a discovery closely connected with you the discovery is that the only son of the late sir humphrey woodroffe the first baronet died at birmingham on february th and is buried there and that he died at the great midland hotel where your name is entered as being on that day accompanied by an indian ayah and a child there is a note to the effect that the child died the same night the child is entered in the register as born on december the nd i observe in the peerage that the present baronet was born on that day i propose to call upon you tomorrow afternoon at about three oclock in the hope of obtaining an interview with you on this subject i remain madam your obedient servant richard woodroffe now you understand why richard woodroffe came to town in so buoyant and jubilant a mood he saw himself received with shame and confusion by a fallen enemy he saw himself playing for the first time in his life a part requiring great dignitythat of the conqueror he would be chivalrous towards this sinner he would utter no reproach to lay his proofs before her to receive her surrender would be enough richard was not a revengeful person wrongs he forgot injuries he forgave at the same time he would have been more than human if he had not contemplated with some kind of satisfaction the reduction of the second baronet to his true level which would leave him with no more pride and no more superiority alas he was not prepared for what awaited him had he asked himself what kind of woman he should meet he would have imagined a person broken down by the discovery of her guilt throwing herself at his feet ready to confess everythinga woman with whom he would be the conqueror that the tables would be turned upon him he never even thought possible who would he had discovered that the real heir to the name and title of sir humphrey woodroffe had actually died at birmingham twentyfour years ago who then was the present socalled sir humphrey thou art the woman alas alas i am the woman this was the pretty dialogue of conquest and confession which he fondly imagined what happened at the hour of three he called and sent in his card he was taken upstairs to the drawingroom where a lady of august presence and severe aspect who struck an unexpected terror into him at the outset was sitting at a table with a secretary this severe person put up her glasses curiously and icily motioned him to wait while she went on dictating to the secretary when she had finishedwhich took several minutesshe dismissed her assistant and turned to her visitor who was still standing hat in hand already disconcerted by this contemptuous treatment and expectant of unpleasantness she pushed back her chair and took a paper from the table you sent me a letter yesterday mr woodroffe i did he said huskily then with a feeling of being crossexamined he cleared his throat and tried to assume an attitude of dignity this is the letter i believe read it to make sure that is the letter oh and you are come i suppose to talk over the matter to see what you can make out of it well sir i have taken advice upon this letter i was advised to have the door shut in your face i was advised to send you to my lawyers but i am not afraid even of the blackmailer i resolved to see you now sir you may sit down if you like richard sank into a chair his cheeks flaming go on then she added impatiently dont waste my time explain this letter sir instantly she rapped the table sharply with a paperknife the triumphant detective jumped i cani can explain it the poor young man felt all his confidence slipping away from him for it looked as if she was actually going to brazen it outa contingency that had not occurred to him one moment mr woodroffe i am the more inclined to give you an opportunity to explain personally because i hear that my son has already met you i can hardly say made your acquaintancemet youand that you are or pretend to beit matters nothinga distant cousin of his and now sir having said so much i am prepared to listen i can give you the whole story lady woodroffe the whole story a whole story you mean call things by their right names but go on do not occupy my time needlessly and do not be tedious i will do neither i assure you he plucked up some courage thinking of his proofs but not much i even think i shall interest you first of all then my father who was a comedian playing under the name of anthony which was his christian name married as his first wife a london girl my father was not a man of principle i am sorry to say after a time he deserted his wife and left her alone with her child in the streets of birminghambirmingham he repeated lady woodroffe winced it might have been his fancy but she certainly seemed to wince at the mention of that great city she sat upright with hands crossed her face was pale her eyes were hard though she still smiled go on sir she said left his wife in birmingham i dare say i shall understand presently what this means this was twentyfour or twentyfive years ago the deserted wife could not believe that she had lost his affection but she knew that the childs presence annoyed him that fact perhaps influenced her there was also the certainty of the workhouse before her for the child she was therefore easily persuaded to consent to an arrangement by means of some doctor of the place to give her child into the charge of a lady who had lost her own and was willing to adopt another she did this in ignorance of the ladys name did she never learn the ladys name the question was a mistake lady woodroffe perceived her mistake and set her lips tighter never she had no means of finding out she went after her husband and followed him from place to place till she finally caught him in some town of a western state here as soon as she appeared on the scene he divorced her for alleged incompatibility of temper afterwards he married again i am the son of the second marriage yes this is no doubt an interesting story but i am not really interested in youryour pedigree she sighed oh do go on man why do you come here with it it is the beginning of the story which ends with that letter of mine you promised mr woodroffeshe smiled icily and her eyes remained hardthat you would neither bore me nor waste my time are you sure that you are keeping your word quite sure i go back to the story i concluded from the story as it was told me that the ladys child had died in birminghamin some hotel probably one moment may i guess that your object is apparently to find this person who bought or took charge of the child it is on behalf of the mother who is now in england above all things she desires to find her child that is natural is it not perfectly natural let us hope that she may succeed now go on mr woodroffe of course a woman who would sell her child does not deserve to get it back again perhaps the last remark was also a mistake at least it showed temper perhaps not this woman mrs haveril however who is married to an extremely wealthy american haveril can it be the millionaire person whom my son metwith youat sir robert steeles house that is the lady indeed i always tell my son that he should be more careful of his company well go on richard smiled the insolence of the observation did not hurt him in the least it lessened the power of the presence and gave him confidence this lady he continued fancies or discerns an extraordinary resemblance to her husband my fatherand to myselfin your son lady woodroffe the resemblance is very striking he has most undoubtedly my fathers face the same colour of his hairhis figure even more strongly it is said than myself yet i am considered like him and because there is this resemblance she imagined hardly imagined she dreamed dreamed what have i to do with her dreams well she has only to ascertain the real parentage of sir humphreymy son oh i have your letter in my mind sir humphrey you said the second baronet we shall come to your letter presently one would think has she any other reason to go upon besides the resemblance by this time it was evident that she understood exactly what was meant she had until yesterday no other reason yet from one or two simple facts that i have discoveredthey are in my letteri am certain that she is right indeed do you understand mr woodroffe the exact meaning of those words that she is right then what is my son he would be no longer your son he would be her son then what am i that lady woodroffe is not for me to say i promised to give you an audience therefore go on since there was no kind of proof of this imaginingor this dreami thought that i would go down to birmingham to search the registers you are a detective or a private and secret inquirer no i am acting only for this lady she is a millionairess i hope she pays you well but the factsthe facts and you found a great deal more than i hoped the facts which i set forth in my letter an entry in the register purporting to record the death of my son and an entry in a hotelbook giving my namethat is all is it not enough the child was about the same age as the one adopted there are not many children of that age who die every weekeven in birmingham again if the child died in birmingham at all it must have been at a hotel there are not many children of the same age likely to die in the same week in a birmingham hotel i had the register of deaths searched and foundwhat i told you copies have been taken i went to the hotel nearest the station and had the visitors book searched i foundwhat i told you copies have been taken very good what next i sent you that letter and i came to hear what you say about it what should i say about it who is this young man who calls himself the second baronet he is my son then who is the child that died how am i to tell you must ask some one else and who was the lady woodroffe who came to the hotel how do i know you must ask some one else oh he might have considered this attitude as possible at least but he had not his face expressed bewilderment and surprise you actually suggest to meto me of all people in the worldthat i actually i myself a woman of my position bought a child in place of a dead child that is your meaning is it not sir certainly it is he answered with creditable valour i know you did it theres no way out of it but to confess why you miserable little counterjumper dick stepped back in some alarm because it looked as if she were going to box his ears she was quite capable of it indeed and but for the guilty conscience that held her back she would have done it as it was her wrath was not feigned it maddened her to think that this man should so easily discover a whole half of the thing she thought concealed for ever you wretched little counterjumper she repeated with reginal gesture tall and commandingtaller than poor richard and dear me how much more commanding and you pretend a trumpery resemblance why my son is half a foot taller than you my sons father was a gentleman and his face and manners show it yours but your face and manners show what he was leave the house sir dick dropped his hat in his surprise if you think to blackmail me you are mistaken leave the house if you dare to speak of this again it shall be to my lawyers richard picked up his hat the action is a trifle but it completed his discomfiture no stay a moment understand quite clearly that you can make any use of these entries that you please but you may as well understand that i have never been in birmingham in my life that persons in my position act and move among a surrounding troop of servants to speak nothing of friends and relations that the heirs of persons like sir humphrey do not die and get buried unknown to their friendsperhaps you have not thought of all this he heard this statement with open mouth he was struck dumb understand at once make your principalwho is she the rich personunderstand that i have never been in birmingham in my life and that every hour of my life can be accounted for who was that child then find out if you can it has nothing to do with me if twenty years ago some woman chose for purposes of her own to personate the wife of sir humphreywho was then in scotlandwhile sir humphrey was on his way home from india do you think i am going to inquire or trouble my head about her impudence richard murmured something indistinct he did not know what to say how could this majestic woman have done such a thing yet who else could have done it lady woodroffe sat down again i have been wrong she said in getting angry over this matter perhaps you are not after all a blackmailer indeed i am not i have heard my son she said in a softer voice speak of you mr woodroffe but i must warn you that any attempt to bring this charge will be met by my solicitors one word more miss hilarie woodroffe has also i believe taken some interest in you i would suggest mr woodroffe that it would be foolish to throw away the only respectable connections you possess in a wildgoose chase which can lead to nothing except ignoble pay from a woman who by your own confession threw away her own child or sold it to a stranger now you can go sir she did not ring the bell for the servant she pointed and turned back to her desk have the goodness to shut the door behind you it was with greatly lowered spirits that richard walked down those stairs and out of the door chapter xviii a gracious lady once removed from the presence of the great lady and the overwhelming authority of her manner her voice and her face richard began to consider the situation over again the lady denied any knowledge of the fact he might have expected it why how could such a woman in such a position face the world and confess to having committed so great a crime he ought to have known that it was impossible so he cursed himself for an ass steadied his nerves with the reflection that she had done the thing whatever she might say considered that people can always be found to believe great and solid and shameless liars and remarked with humiliation that on the very first occasion in his life when he wanted dignity to meet dignity and authority to meet authority he had come to grief serious comedy howeverby way of consolationis not my line in the evening after dinner he repaired to the hotel but not with the triumphal step which he had promised himself molly was reading a letter aloud to alice dick she cried perhaps you can explain what this means it has just arrived dear madam i have had an interview with a certain mr richard woodroffe who calls himself a distant cousin of my son he brought me a strange story of a strange delusion which he seemed to consider supported by a certain discovery of an entry in a register of births and deaths i cannot believe his allegation without further evidence because it is so extremely improbableon the face of it one would say impossibleand i cannot understand it even if it rests on the strongest evidence i have however forwarded the case to my solicitors who will probably communicate with mr woodroffe with him personally i do not desire any further speech the circumstances of the case as first placed before me naturally awaken a womans sympathies a mother bereaved of her son is at all times an object of pity even when her bereavement is not due to the common cause but to her own conduct and that conduct not such as can be readily excused the story which this person brought me is to the effect that you have seen my son at a theatre that you afterwards met him at the house of sir robert steele that you observed or imagined certain points of resemblance with your own first husband and certain others with the man richard woodroffe it certainly did not occur to me when he called that he could claim the honour of the most distant resemblance to my son however i learned from him that you have jumped to the wonderful conclusion that he is actually none other than your son whom you lost not by death but by salethat you sold your child in fact for what he would fetchas a farmer body sells a pig i do not venture to pronounce any judgment upon you for this act the temptation was doubtless great and your subsequent distress was perhaps greater than if you had lost the child by act of god i write to you only concerning the strange delusion apart from the imaginary resemblance on which this delusion is founded your adviser this mr richard woodroffe has discovered he tells me this entry to which i have already referred in the register of deaths at birmingham it states he says that on a certain day there died in that place one humphrey son of sir humphrey woodroffe on that day as i find by reference to my diary and to certain letters which have been preserved i was staying with my father lord dunedin at his country seat in scotland my child then an infant who was born at poonah in india was with me a few days later i travelled south to london in order to meet sir humphrey who was returning from india and of course the boy came with me it is not my business to inquire or to explain why this entry was made in the register or why it was thought by any one desirable that a dead child should be entered under a false name that the child could have been sir humphreys was unlikely first because he had been in india for ten years before his return and next because he was a man of perfectly blameless life observe if you please that these facts can all be proved my father still lives the dates can be easily established even as regards resemblance it can be shown that the child was and is strikingly like his fatherof the same height the same hair the same eyes when a delusion of this kind seizes the brain it is likely to remain there and to become stronger and deeper and more difficult to remove as the years go on i have therefore thought it best to invite you to meet me we can then talk over the matter quietly and i shall perhaps be able to make you understand the baseless nature of this belief i need hardly say that i should feel it necessary in case of your persisting in this claimthat is if you propose advancing such a claim seriouslyto defend my honour with the utmost vigour and in every court of law that exists you cannot of course be ignorant of the fact that more than the loss of my child is concerned there is the loss of my good name because you would have the world to believe that a woman born of most honourable and godfearing parents married to a man of the highest reputation herself of good reputation should stoop so lowone can hardly write itas to buy a baby of a woman she had never seen of a poor woman of a woman of whom she knew nothing except that she was the deserted wife of a strolling actor and to pass this child off upon her husband and the world as her own i say no more by letter perhaps i have spoken uselessly in that case words must give place to acts however i will confer with you if you wish personally come here tomorrow afternoon about five we will try to discuss the subject calmly and without the prejudice of foregone conclusions in offering you this opportunity i consider your own happiness only for my own part it matters very little what any one chooses to believe as to my son there is always within my reach the law if injurious charges or statements are made against my character or there is the law for your use if you wish to recover what you think is your own i remain dear madam very faithfully yours lilias woodroffe what is the meaning of this letter dick molly repeated what is this entry that she talks about molly i thought i was coming home with a discovery that was a clincher and i believe ive gone and muddled the thing well but tell us he told them but what more do we want asked molly the child that died was hers so i believei am sure i remember how she took itand her lies and her pretences and her rage it wasnt the wrath of an innocent woman molly it was the wrath of a woman found out and driven to bay i am sure of it then what does she mean by this letter its her reply it means defiance ought we to go then i dont know i think that i was wrong to go but that may make it right for alice to go alice did go she took molly with her because she wanted support she went filled with doubt the womans letter was confident and braggart but there was the discovery of the childs death and there was the resemblance she came away as you shall see in certainty yet more in doubt than before they found themselves in a room in which not only the refinement which may be purchased of an artistic decorator is visible but the refinement which can only be acquired by many generations of wealth and position and good breeding books pictures curtains carpets furnitureall bore witness to the fact that the tenant was a gentlewoman the angloamerican born and brought up in the poverty of london clerkery accustomed to the bare surroundings of poverty in the western states able to command after many years and to enjoy the flaunting luxury of a modern hotel felt with a sense of sinking that her sonif this was her sonmust have been brought up with social advantages which she could never have given him on the table lay a small bundle tied up with a towel curiously out of place this simple bundle looked among the things beautiful and precious of this drawingroom you know how a little matter will sometimes revive an old recollection what had this parcel wrapped in a towel to do with that time twentyfour years ago when the mother brokenhearted laid her child in the arms of the doctor who carried it into the railway station yet she was reminded of that momentthat special momentin the history of her bereavement to be sure the mind of the woman was easily turned to this subject it possessed her she could think of nothing else except when molly came to talk and sing to her the door was opened and a lady came in she was not dressed in nearly so costly a manner as her visitor but her appearance impressed she was a great lady in manner and in appearance she was also gracious though a speaker on platforms an advocate of many causes she was still feminine and dignified she produced the effect which she desired without apparent effort she carried in her hand a bundle of letters and papers she bowed to her visitors it is very good of you she said to come if you will excuse me one minute she sat down and touched a handbell it was answered by a young lady these are the letters said lady woodroffe i have indicated the replies you can let me have them at six then she turned to alice again you will forgive a busy woman i am sure she said i am for the moment greatly occupied with rescue work of all kinds it is a beautiful thing to snatch even one poor woman from a life of crime one may observe that she received alice as she had received richardwith a great show of important philanthropic work the effect produced was not quite the same because alice was thinking of something else and to molly it was only good playacting she was not in the least impressed by the presence or the authority she only considered that the business was well done lady woodroffe finished now she said smiling sweetly we will begin to talk i have brought my cousin miss pennefather said alice she knows why i am here oh yes lady woodroffe recognized mollys presence with the inclination which asserts a higher place shall we take some tea first she was disappointed in the appearance of the woman who claimed her son one expects of a woman who would sell her baby a face of brass and eyes of bronze one expects vulgarity in a highly pronounced formperhaps with ostrich feathers she came in expectant of a battle with a redfaced overdressed female she found a woman dressed quietly yet in costly stuffs a pale face delicate features no sign of the commoner forms of vulgarity a woman of apparent refinement of course we all know that a person may be refined yet not a gentlewoman many there are who take comfort in that reflection she rang the bell for tea and began to talk it is very good of you to come she began tell me have you been long in the old country do you find it altered since you left itso long ago i believe you are not an american by birth have you any children do you soon return to the states she went on without paying much attention to mrs haverils replies i hear that your husband is a millionaire we shall soon begin to think that all americans are millionaires it must be strange to have unlimited command of money i am sure you will do a great deal of good with it the sense of responsibility when there is so much waiting to be done must be overwhelming here in this country we are all so poorso very poor we have our country houses you know which are very fine housessome of them and our parks and gardens but then you see the houses and gardens cost so much to keep up and our farms remain unlet however here is the tea then she plunged into the subject my dear lady she began i do assure you that i feel for you it is the most extraordinary case that i have ever heard of i believe if i remember right there is an account of a woman in brangers autobiography who had made her baby a foundling and spent the rest of her life in looking for him and became mad in consequence do let me implore you not to begin looking for your boy the case is hopelessyou will never succeedyou will only make the rest of your life miserable it is quite impossible that you should ever find him and if you did find him it is utterly impossible that you should be able to prove that he is your child you will i assure you heap disappointments and miseries upon your head alice said nothing lady woodroffe glanced at molly she was looking straight before her apparently quite unmoved now let us argue the point calmly and quietly you see a resemblanceyou jump to a conclusion now first as regards the resemblance there is a very remarkable family resemblance among many of the woodroffes three cousins at leastmiss hilarie woodroffe whom you know perhaps my son and this mr richard woodroffe who appears to be a play actor of some kindclaim kinship after five hundred yearsfive hundred years they met by accident in the old church of the familythey made acquaintanceboth young men curiously resemble the young lady it isnt only the face said alice its the voice and the eyes and the manner my husband had most beautiful manners when he chose on the stage i believe they learn to assume some kind of manners supposed to be those of society when they choose my son however always chooses to have beautiful manners but we must i am sure you will admit take into account differences as well as resemblances for instance i gather from the whole history that your husband was in some respects especially those which most touch a wifes sense of wrongawhat we call a wretcha disgraceful person he was he deserted me he divorced me he married an american actress he deserted her richard woodroffe is his second son my son is quite the reverse he is a young man of the highest principle and of perfectly blameless character molly smiled looking straight before her again your husband i believe was a low comediana singer a dancer a buffoonanything he was a general utility actor sometimes he had a variety entertainment humphrey my son has no talent for acting at all like his father he would conceive it beneath the dignity of a gentleman to make merriment for his friends alice sighed molly sat looking straight before her either unmoved or unconcerned another point was your husband a bookish man no he was not he never opened a book my son is essentially studious especially in the history of art molly smiled again but said nothing to call humphrey studious was perhaps stretching the truth but there certainly were the rows of french novels now my dear madam i will ask you to set these points down side by side that is to say on one side resemblance in face real or imaginary on the other side dignity good breedinghereditary breeding a constitutional gravity of carriage studious habits ambition a total absence of the acting faculty i ask you which of these qualities he could inherit from your husband as we are here alone i would ask you which of these qualities he could inherit from you she paused for a reply there was none alice looked at molly and sighed molly smiled and looked straight before her i do not say these things offensively lady woodroffe continued in soft and persuasive accents my sole desire is to send you away convinced that my son cannot possiblycannot under any possibilityunder any imaginable possibilitybe your son to return to the points of difference i will ask you one more question was your husband a man of unselfish habits and even temper he was not lady woodroffe smiled i am sorry to hear it for your sake my son on the other hand is absolutely unselfish and always sweettempered she looked sharply at the girl why did she smile what did she mean what did she know about humphrey however lady woodroffe went on still bland and gracious do not delude yourself any longer madam for the sake of your own peace and quiet put it away from you oh this dreadful delusion will possess you more and more you will yearn more and more for the possession of the son you have lost your mind will become so filled with this delusion that you will be able to think about nothing else it will drive you to some desperate act it will poison your daily life it will turn your wealth into a heavy burden i implore you for the sake of those you love to abandon this baseless belief oh if you only knew if you only knew the tears rose to the eyes of the woman who sought her son after all these years i thought i had found him again i recognized him at the theatre and at the doctors dinner my poor dear ladyagain lady woodroffe took her hands and soothed herit was indeed strange that you should find such a resemblance as i told you see how impossible it is to find anything out nevertheless if i can be of any help to you i will willingly do all i can only my advice is that you let bygones sleep and remain contented with the wonderful gifts that heaven has poured into your lap to desire more is surely a sin i would give them all to the first beggar in the street if i could only get back the boy we will supposelady woodroffe got up and stood before the fireplace looking down upon her visitor who was now trembling and tearfulwe will suppose i say that you take some steps i hardly know what steps you can take would you go to a lawyer perhaps would you go to my son perhaps in either case the evidence will be examined on your side a fancied resemblance whyshe pointed to a portrait on the wallthat is my husband at the age of thirty whose eyes whose face whose hair do you see in that portrait is it or is it not like my son there really was a strong resemblance lady woodroffe however did not explain that she had copied it herself from an early portrait perhaps with additions and slight alterations this portrait alone will meet the case besidesa chance resemblanceagainwhat is it alice shook her head sadly she was shaken in her faith next you find an entry in a register who made that entry you do not know why you cannot tell yet mr woodroffe says never mind mr woodroffe listen to what i say you then come forward yourself and you tell the very disgraceful story of how you sold your own childyour own boy oh a terriblea shameful story who was the child that died molly put a word for the first time who was that child i cannot tell you some one for purposes unknown chose to represent a dead child as my husbands child i say that i do not choose to offer any explanation of this personation i will tell you however how mr woodroffe explains it which you know already she waited for a reply there was none he supposes that the child was my child and he supposes next that the person who bought your child was myself that is what he calls certainty who was the child then molly repeated even supposing that my own child died at birmingham which is absolutely falsehow will you connect the dead childs mother with the transaction which followed i dont know alice looked to molly for support and found none molly sat with cold impassive face when you have made it quite clear that you sold your child you have then to fix your crime upon me as well how will you do it for i have letters showing where i was the dates prove that i could not be in birmingham at the time they prove also that i was at my fathers house in scotland with my boy now what have you got to say i want my son find your son she replied with a touch of temper he will be proud indeed of his mother when you do find him alice shuddered i can do nothing to get that delusion out of your mind then i want my son the womans face was obstinate she had left off crying and shaking her eyes were fierce her pale face was set she meant fighting the interview had been a failure who was the child that died mollys question made all clear and plain again in moments of great and serious importance we think of little things lady woodroffe saw in this set and serious face in the lines of her mouth in the determination of the eyes something that reminded her of humphrey she should have asked the woman what other qualities apart from those she had enumerated he might have inherited from her she was now certain that the interview was a failure no persuasion no soft words could prevail against the certainty in this womans mind i want my son she repeated lady woodroffe turned to molly you have heard everything she said what is your opinion miss i did not catch your name we must find out who that child wasthe dead child molly replied with tenacity then we will talk no more she smiled again but showed her teeth she then did the boldest thing in her power a thing which deliberately confessed the truth and bade them defiance like every bold stroke it was a stroke of genius yet like every stroke of genius perhaps it was a mistake for she had brought down the very clothes in which the child had come to her and now she showed them to the mother and claimed them for her own i am only going to delay you one minute mrs haveril it is a foolish thing perhaps but it is an appeal to sentiment i suppose that there is nothing a woman treasures more than her sons babyclothes i am going to show you a bundle of things that i made with my own hands for my babyminewomando you hearwith the real ring of tempermine these thingsshe untied the towel slowlyare my sons clothes when he was about twelve months of age they are made of quite common materials after the old scotch fashion the very things i made myselfwith my own handsfor the child she laid back the corners of the towel she took up the things one by one his frockhe had gone into short frockshis flannel his shirt his socks his shoes his cap she held them up and she looked at her visitor with mockery in her eyes and defiance in her words my thingsthat i made you would like to have the babyclothes of your own sonwhom you soldwould you not alice started and sprang to her feet gazing upon the babyclothes you see lady woodroffe went on coldly and calmly as if every word was not a lie the work is not very fine there is his name in markingink i did this embroidery i made everything except his socks and his shoes there is his rattle it was a cheap common thing here is his little cap you have made such things mrs haveril i dare say for your childthe child you sold i thought i would show them to you to prove better than any words of mine that my child is my own oh it was the scream of a tigress oh mineminemine mrs haveril threw herself literally over the clothes she clutched and dragged them and with quick fingers huddled them into the towel again and tied the corners mine she repeated standing up again her hand on the bundle mine her voice was like a roar of rage sunk down deep and low and roughnot like her customary voice which was gentle and sweet mine she held the bundle to her heart molly rose at this point and laid her hand on her cousins shoulder keep quiet dearkeep quiet let us leave this house she turned to lady woodroffe it is a house of lies lady woodroffe looked at her as if she were not present and had not spoken the delusion is stronger than i thought she said affecting surprise and wonder alice recovered and stood up still holding the things to her heart oh she cried panting and gasping you are a bad woman a false woman for heavens sake said molly keep quiet you have said enough think of yourself i had better ring the bell i think lady woodroffe laid her finger on the knob but refrained to press it oh what can i say say nothing dear said molly will you give me back those things lady woodroffe moved as if she would take them no then keep them after all i havemy sonminemy son that is the main thing i made these thingsevery onei made them see mollyhere is the very paper i wrote i pinned it to his little frock she kissed the frock his name is humphrey i wrote it his father said there was always a humphrey in the family i wrote that papernow lady woodroffe smiled sadly poor creature but perhaps you had better go at once where is my son i have done my best to relieve you of a most remarkable delusion you reward me by robbing me of my childs things i cannot fight you for them and i do not like to make my servants take them by force keep them she rang the bell they are my things lady woodroffe continued to follow her movements with eyes of compassion it is indeed wonderful she murmured all this great fortune and this most miserable delusion to spoil it alice moved towards the door she was trembling she leaned upon molly she clung to the bundle she turned you have given my son back to me i want no further proof molly bore her down the stairs as she retired with some loss of dignity her face tearful her cheek flushed but clutching the bundle now she knows the whole said lady woodroffe and i defy her to move a step she may look at the boy from afar off she rang her handbell and called her secretary and resumed her struggle against sin chapter xix a cabinet council i dont like it said richard the thing is proved down to the ground but i dont like it on the table lay the bundle of babyclothes recovered by the true mother it was untied the little flannels the little frock the little woollen socks the little capa touching little bundle to one who had memories of the things and near the table as if guarding the spoil she had carried off alice lay upon the sofa slowly recovering from the excitement of the afternoon not like it dick molly asked why alice laid her hand upon the things i want no other proof she said i made these things i made them all what more would you have what more can we desire asked molly i say that i dont like it dick rubbed his chin i dont like it at all it means defiance i was in hopes that she would climb down when she saw the copy of the entry but she didnt i understand now she cant afford to climb down so she must defy us she will fight if we make her she sends for the mother of the child she actually gives her another weapon and she says do your worst i defy you what do you mean by not being able to climb down dick why shes not only a great lady rich and well born and in society she is also a leader in all kinds of religious and philanthropic movements a certain religious paper for instance called her the other day the queen of the white lilies exposure would be a terrible thing for her but if she can make it look as she will try like an attempt on my part to get money out of alice or herself the thing might do her no harm however theres the register they cant say i forged that entry well but dick what do you mean you prove that her son is dead and that he was buried under his own name without any concealment just before the adoption and weve got the babyclothes and we recognize them what more can you want she must climb down as you call it we have got lots more if you come to that we have got the man who found the child i wonder how sir robert would like going into court and deposing that he bought a baby for adoption by an unknown person we have also got the mother of the adopted child unfortunately there is nothing at all to connect lady woodroffe with the adoption without that connection the case breaks down theres the point does humphrey know anything about it i believe not lady woodroffe is not likely to tell him you must not set my son against me said the mother not if we can help it but about the value of this evidence now molly please go into the witnessbox she stood up behind a chair placing her hands on the back i am counsel the jury are sitting over there the judge is on your right keep your eyes on counsel now you are alice firstalice haveril you swear madam that you know these clothes how do you know them because you made them with your own hands are they made of rare or uncommon materials are they not made of stuff commonly used for the garments of infants is there anything distinctive in the materials used they are also made in the fashion commonly used for children are they not nothing distinctive then in the fashion so that for materials or for shape there is nothing to make them different from any other babyclothes nothing then madam how do you know that they were made by your own work because i know said molly because you know but how do you know because i remember but you cannot tell me how you remember themby what mark he took up the frock here is a crest in red silk did you work that no yet it is on the frock well dick said molly you neednt take so much pleasure in knocking the case to pieces i am only showing you what it amounts to now get into the box again you are mr richard woodroffe the expert in sagacity what have you got a certified copy of an entry in the register of births and deaths you place i believe great reliance on that entry it records the death of the child of sir humphrey woodroffe your theory is that the child who died was immediately replaced by the child who was adopted very well but if there was no concealment of the death how could there be substitution theres an answer to that molly replied quickly the woman never thought of hiding her name until after the child was dead and burieduntil she thought of the substitution that is your theory when you come to proofhow do you know that the child whose death is recorded was really the son of sir humphrey was the death announced in the papers they have been searched but there is no mention of the event yet when a man of such great importance as sir humphrey woodroffe loses his only son the announcement of the event would be made in all the papers both here and in india how do you explain that omission it is not for usim on the other side mollyto find out the reason of this lying entry it is sufficient for us to prove the continuous existence of the child from his birth to the present day who made that declaration we do not know we do not care it is sufficient for our purposes to prove that lady woodroffe at the time was with her father in scotland oh dick this is too horrible when such a child dies everybody knows did her ladyships family hear of it it appears not evidence will be brought to show that she set out for london with her boy that she wrote on arrival and that she wrote immediately afterwards announcing the return of her husband when such a child dies the servants all know evidence will be given to show that none of the servants knew or heard about the loss of the heirthe only child we are to prove that so terrible an event was not even announced in the servants hall but you shall hear lady woodroffes own statement molly you are now lady woodroffe but i am speaking for you in the autumn of i was staying at the country seat of my father lord dunedin in scotland i had just returned from india and was waiting for the arrival of my husband who was retiring from indian service early in the month of february i received a telegram from brindisi to the effect that my husband had arrived there and was coming home as fast as he could travel i was to meet him at the house i had taken in london i therefore left my fathers went on to edinburgh stayed the night there and came on next morning to london bringing with me the child and my ayah the next day or the day after my husband arrived i have never been in birmingham in my life my child as an infant never had any serious illness as to the entry in the register i heard of it for the first time from mr richard woodroffe calling himself a distant cousin a vocalist who seems to have conceived and invented some kind of conspiracy for duping mrs haveril who is wealthy and getting money for himself out of her oh dick said molly you havent you ask meyou are still lady woodroffewhat proofs i have of these assertions i have the clearest proofs possiblethe letter of my husband telling me when he would arrive the evidence of my father that i left dunedin castle in time to arrive in london a day or two before my husbandnot more the evidence of an aged whitehaired venerable peer will be conclusive molly i have old servants who can prove that they have known the child from day to day and must have discovered the fact immediately had there been any change do you hear molly an aged father aged servants a lady with a commanding and queenly presence a brow of brass and a voice steady and limpid as that of truth herself poor truth she may get down into her well again well but about the hotel and the register let us ask lady woodroffe she says i know nothing about either i cannot understand or explain who the woman was that personated me and said her child was the son of sir humphrey it has been suggested that she may have been the mistress of my husband i cannot for a moment allow that my husband the most blameless of men whose life was passed with open windows could have carried on an illicit connection it is impossible and absurd i have no theory to offer about the personation i cannot understand it that is all she is the most shameless most abominable creature alive said molly she has her reputation to maintain well what have we got on our side the entry the fact of the adoption and the resemblance put sir humphrey the second baronet in the box you are now that worthy molly look at him gentlemen of the jury look at him well turn him round slowly like a hairdressers waxen effigy observe the fall of his hair and its colour the colour of his eyes the shape of his head here is a portrait of anthony woodroffe who we maintain was his father could there be a more striking resemblance here is the respectable richard woodroffe also a sonan unworthy sonof anthony and who we maintain is the halfbrother of the baronet you observe again a startling resemblance then up jumps the other side with the portrait of sir humphrey same hairsame eyes where is your other resemblance then which of the two is his father he is curiously like them both see resemblance the learned counsel continued is not enough let us hear the evidence of sir robert steele md frs expresident of the college of physicians author of the lord knows how many treatises take the book sir robert we know what he will say about the child and the adoption now listen he goes on the business over i thought no more of the matter nor did i know the name of the lady nor did i inquire it was for me a matter of business partly because i charged a fee and of charity partly because the child would otherwise have gone into the workhouse i should not like to identify the lady after all these years when she must have changed greatly she wore a thick veil while we talked and i remember only a pale face and regular features or stuff like that dick explained yes i am now acquainted with lady woodroffe and i know her son i cannot explain his resemblance to mr richard woodroffe the two young men are said to be distant cousins i never knew mr anthony woodroffe i know nothing more about the case i express no opinion upon the claim the lady in adopting the child did not express her intention of substituting it that is the evidence of the medical man if he would acknowledge that he remembered anything whatever about the transfer dick said molly humphrey must not know anything untilunlessthe case is complete dont make him your enemy my dear child in the event of either success or failure my halfbrother will most certainly regard me with a fraternal feeling compared with which cain was loving and richard the third was loyal molly looked at alice doubtfully she lay back in silence her eyes shut paying very little attention to what was said what molly thought would be humphreys attitude towards his new mother when the truth was disclosed to him with the mother would come the relations molly remembered how her own father the disinherited used to laugh over his own cousins over the family pride how one was parish clerk of st botolphs how one had a select academy at homerton and one had a shop in mare street and one was pewopener and one was a baptist minister in some unknown but privileged corner of the earth and it occurred to her for the first time that the introduction of humphrey to his new relations would be a matter of some difficulty and delicacy i dont want any proof said alice i recognized my child when first i saw him his father was in every feature and every look and these are my thingsmine i made them she laid her hand again on the bundle which brought her so much certainty after so much doubt but it wont do it isnt enough we want proof that will convince a judge and a jury if you havent got it she said i dont mind in the least i shall send for my son and tell him all he may stay where he is if he likes but i shall tell him all i think dick continued without heeding these words that we must continue to advertise and then theni dont know i should like to bring an action i dont know what for we didnt bargain for fraudulent substitution but for open adoption i should think there ought to be grounds for action but of course i dont know they certainly would not court publicityat least i should think not whether they lost the case or won the evidence is so circumstantial that the world would certainly believe in the fraud i cannot believe that even lady woodroffe would care to face the footlights you talk as if you were at the same time perfectly certain and also in great doubt i am both i am perfectly certain not only from the evidence of the register and of these clothes but from the ladys manner how should we hear and receive such a thing on the stage molly consider you are receiving the discovery of a thing you thought hidden away and buried for evera discovery which will blast your whole life molly presented immediately a stage interpretation of the emotion thus rudely awakened she started threw up her left hand pressed her heart with her right hand she opened her lips and panted her eyes dilated that is very good but lady woodroffe didnt do that at all she was much more effective sit bolt upright in your chair stiffen yourself turn your eyes upon me quickly at the mention of the dead child let all the colour go out of your face at the word substitution let your head swim clutch at the arms of your chairsorecover in a moment look at me again with strangely troubled eyessoyou remember you are going to fight harden your face set your lips firm let your eyes be like flints for resolutionso molly my dear if you were to practise for a twelvemonth you couldnt do it half so well as lady woodroffe herself as a study she was most valuable if there had been any doubt before in my mind there would be none now how will humphrey take it are you concerned about him still mollyafter that midnight walk of ours well dick he has not had my answer yet i must consider him a little and he is your halfbrother remember he will become like his halfbrother an outsiderha an outsider a cad a bounder dick snorted forgiveness and tenderness to the man who was trying to take his girl from him could not be expected just then a telegram was brought in it came from a certain firm of solicitors at birmingham and was addressed to richard woodroffe have found the medical man who attended the child he has his notes remembers the case has identified lady from photograph will swear to her good heavens richard waved the telegram over his head we have got the next step we can identify lady woodroffe with the woman whose child died he read the telegram is there anything more wanted at all there is one thing wanted it is the identification of the lady as the adopter of the child and that lies in the hands of sir robert do you think he knows i am certain he knows why did he ask us all to dinner if he does not know i am pretty certain too that he wont let out unless we make him how can we make him dick if he wont there is only one way molly the case is strong circumstantiallythat if we make it public the world will be forced to believe it whatever the lady may say and swear nothing could be stronger i want no proof said alice if you cannot bring my son to me i shall go to him and tell him all the one thing that will weigh with sir robert and the lady is the fear of publicity i will make one more attempt molly i will go to the lady first and to the doctor afterwards if they remain obdurate i will take advice as to the best way of obtaining publicity and that will ruin the one and damage the other there was one other person present at this council it was john haveril he said nothing but he listened with faraway eyes like a gardener over a strawberrybed when dick concluded he took his hands out of his pockets and walked out of the room chapter xx john haveril clears up things john haveril was a man of few words and these came slowly but of ready action he followed the course of the inquiry with doubt at first but as one point after another came to light he began to be interested when the childs clothes were brought home he had no more doubt on this point he became impatient why should there be any more hesitation if the lady persisted in her denial why not go straight to the young man and lead him to his mother as for what might follow after that if he thought about it at all should be left to providence therefore bearing in mind the agitation and anxiety in which his wife was kept by these delays he resolved upon independent action of his own and that was the reason why he took his hands out of his pockets and left the room humphrey woodroffe sat in his study getting through the hour before dinner with the help of a french novel the field of human interest occupied by the kind of french novel which he and his friends chiefly studied is so limited that one is surprised that its readers never seem to tire of it or to ask for more the studywhich was behind the diningroomwas furnished by himself and was an excellent example of the days taste in the higher sthetic circles the members of which are very limited in number the first and most important rule is that true art and with it of course the highest expression of art changes from year to year what was last year the one and eternal treatment is now philistine and contemptible his piano was littered with musicmostly in msshis own weird and wonderful daubs of colour hung upon the wallsthey were the pictures of the new schoolthey called themselves the new schoolthe school of today of whom he was one his table was covered with books bound in dainty white and gold or grey and gold they were chiefly books of poetsold poetsforgotten poets who sang of love it has been reserved for our age to disinter them and to go into raptures over their magnificent and fearless realism poetry like painting music furniture and wallpaper changes its fashions for the young every year in a word the study was a temple for such a temple her worshippers must all be youngunder seven and twenty it is sad to think that they will one day become oldoldoldthirty years old and that new poets will write new musicians compose new painters paint for younger sthetes sad to reflect that they will then be passs their utterances bohemian their views contemptible their standards ignoble john haveril advanced into this shrine of the sthetic muse with more of his later than of his earlier manner the gardener was perhaps below the man of consideration mr john haveril humphrey read the name from the card as if he had never heard it before and received him with the studied chill which most effectually keeps off the outsider i met you i believe at sir robert steeles yes i was there he looked about for a chair that would bear his weight there was one which seemed equal to the task he sat down without being invited humphrey remained standing with his most repellent manner i was there young man i was there john haveril repeated we had not much conversation but i presume if you do meet a man once and you have something to say to that man you may call upon him surely though what mr haveril the man of millionsis it twenty millionsand morei hope much morecan have to say to me i cannot guess briefly sir i have no money i never speculate and i can take none of your shares john haveril opened his mouth twice then he shook his head best not to meet bad manners with worse he replied with dignity quite in his best manner i understand young man that you mean some kind of sneer which let me tell you sir ill becomes your youth in the presence of my age sir humphrey leaned his elbow on the mantelshelf and adjusted his pincenez with his unoccupied hand this took time in fact he was thinking of a repartee when the operation was finished he turned to his visitor a face of deliberate insolence you came to teach me something beside manners i believe not i am sure that one could desire even in manners a more competent instructor i did perhaps it may be worth your while to listen perhaps not if it is you may take your elbow off the shelf and try not to look as if you were gazing at a chipmunk in a cage understand sir that i will receive neither your pity nor your contempt if you do not change your manner i will show you by a highly practical method that you have made a mistake there was something in the mans eyes which compelled obedience besides although he was forty years older than the other there was a toughness about his build which might be formidable humphrey instantly changed both his look and his attitude and took a chair you may go on he said sulkily as soon as you please when i heard about you sir in connection with the little transaction we know of i began to inquire secretly whether we were wise to go on if he turns out unworthy i said wed better stop where we are and take no further steps in the matter i shall probably understand as we go along said humphrey at present you will understand presently i cant say sir that the character i have obtained of you is encouraging kind however of people to give one a character at all he threw back his head into his hands and stretched out his legs and looked up into the ceiling i dont understand john haveril replied the talk that says one thing and means another i like plain and straightforward things however i hear of you that you gamble and drink and that you run after dancinggirls and that you believe like many young englishmen of fortune that you belong to a separate caste and not to the world like common people unfortunately mr haveril we have to belong to the world i assure you that i would much rather not youve got to however we did go on i have not told the person chiefly interested all id heard about you nor the half weve now brought our business to an end that is weve proved up to the hilt what was at first only a suspicion again i dare say i shall understand you presently the question is whether you know the secret if i said he does know the secret and still carries on the pretence the chap isnt worthy of our notice lets wipe our feet on him and go on our way wipeyourfeet you like plain and straightforward things mr haveril surely it is a poetical and an imaginative casewipe your feetuponachap if he carries on the pretence in ignorance i said let us tell him and see how he takes it if he takes it worthily we shall know what to think of him to think of him murmured humphrey yes well the time has come for you to learn the truth if you dont know the truth already humphrey smiled i really cannot read that riddle no i do not know the truth whether i shall take it worthily as you say or whether i shall receive the wiping of muddy feet i cannot foretell you dont know well i dont think its my business to tell you very likely some one will tell you meantime the person principally concerned does know it and you will understand when you do learn the truth how much it has unsettled her also dick knows it who is dick fiddler dick dick the tramp dick who goes out in whitethread gloves like a waiter and molly knows it and i know it very well now i want you to remember very carefully what i say if you dont understand these words now you will later on first of all whatever happens you are no relation of mine thank you thank you humphrey changed his position sat up and clasped his hands thank you so much i began to fear mr haveril that you must be a longlost uncle and no claim can be set up on me you are not my son but hers that is at least true i am hers and i certainly am not yours this grows exciting hers i say not mine humphrey jumped in his chair how the devil man can i be your son what drivel is this john haveril paid no attention to this question he was putting his own case in his own words and not being my son theres no claim he went on slowly but young man as the thing has to come out you will have to behave according behave according come mr haveril i have given you a patient hearing pray what do you mean by behave according but pleaseplease tell me what you mean or go away he spread his hands helplessly i wish some one would come he murmured and carry off this person when you learn the truth remember what i say now i dont like you nor the looks of you nor the language of you nor the ways of you but there you are and im bound to do something for you now sir make your mother happy do what she wants make her love you and well your sort i take it is always wanting money you never make any and you are always spending make her happy and you shall have as much as any young man can want in reason or out of reason i know your manner of life sir and its an expensive manner of life you are in debt again lady woodroffe has already paid your debts once or twice champagne and cards and painted jezebelsyou shall have them allall i dont care what you want you shall have everything if you only behave properly to your mother humphrey heard these words with real and breathless astonishment there had been it is true many expostulations from his mother about extravagance and scandals but could she have complained to this rough coarse creature i cannot for the life of me understand what you mean remember what i say then mr haverilfor once the young man spoke quite plainly and unaffectedlyi assure you although you assume that i know what you meani do not in the least can you explain why you take such an interest in my relations with my mother not to speak of my personal character no sir you will understand very well in a day or two let me conclude sir i intended to explain that i married late in life oh humphrey groaned it is like a bad dream what does it matter to me whether you married late in life or early man alive will you take a drinktwo drinksto go theres whisky in the cabinet i say john haveril repeated slowly that i married late in life over forty i was therefore ive had but small experience of women but of your mother i must say shes the very best woman that livesthe very best humphrey gasped good lord he cried the best and the tenderest and the most pious oh the most pious and the most beautiful pity that she keeps fretting about you well it is a pity do you mean to say that she sent youyouyouto tell mememe that otherwise naturally a happy nature full of sunshine and wellmannered humphrey laughed aloud well she is wellmannered thats a good shot and speaks like a lady yes yes she certainly does well thenjohn haveril rosei believe ive said all i came to say im glad of that perhaps youd like to say it all over again you have told me my character you have assured me that i am not your son you have offered me millions if i behave properly and you have been so good as to praise my mother warmly ive said i think all i came to say he repeated in his slow manner dont tell your motherwhen you know the truthwhat i said nor why i came here best for her to believe that you behave as you are going to behave out of your own good heartyou can pretend a bit i suppose without any thought of the dollars and when you get those dollars you can say to yourself young man that you wouldnt have had them if it hadnt been for your mother with these words john haveril offered his hand humphrey looked straight through him taking no notice of the proffered salute i was once in the service of an english gentleman he saidin his garden but for that i should believe that the english aristocracy was more unmannerly than any new mexican cowboy sir to use what i understand is your favourite expression where manners are concerned you are yourself nothing better than a cad and an outsider but do not tell your mother when you know the truth that i said so let it be a secret between ourselves that i have found you to be a cadan unmannerly cad he then departed with dignity humphrey looked after him with surprise rather than anger to be called an outsider by a beast of a selfmade dives who had formerly been a gardener it was astonishing it was a new experience it was ludicrous he ran upstairs to the drawingroom where his mother was alone writing if i may interrupt he said thank you one moment mother ive had a most remarkable visit who is your visitor i wonder why they ever invented america he said i wonder why we tolerate americansrich americanswho have been english mechanics why do we admit them into our houses it is a mistake but it is useless to protest why do you ask my visitor was a man who came last from america where he has made a great fortunerobbed the people by the thousand i supposea man named haveril haveril i met the man the other night at sir robert steeles vulgar of course not so vulgar as ignorantsay common he told me he was a gardeners boy originally seemed to think it was a meritorious thing it is the mockhumility of the purseproud but what did he want with you he is mighty mysterious about some secret which is going to be sprung upon me it is now he said completely discovered completely discovered you said my son and i am to be told in a day or two after which everything depends upon my behaviour oh of what nature is the wonderful secret i dont know then he went on with a rigmarole about my being no relation of hisas if such a thing were possible and he promises a mountain of dollars if i obey the wishes of my mother have you any special wishes mother noneexcept those which you already know and do not respect i live as other men in my position are expected to live go on about your mysterious visitor he began to talk about you mother spoke of your good manners i ought to have knocked him down for his impudence did he reveal his secret no he gave me a warningas i told youand he went away lady woodroffe looked up with a perfectly calm face i believe i could tell you something about his secret truth was stamped plainly on that marble brow with all the other virtues which belong to the grande dame de par le monde the woman haveril is i believe crazed the man is a fool except in making money where he is i dare say a knave they are aided and abetted by a man of your name a richard woodroffe who is clearly making money by the conspiracyand a girl they call molly something what is molly in it pray are you concerned with that person as well as she is a protge of hilarie it was there i met her as for the fellow richard woodroffe he is just a horrid little cad well that will do you need not worry yourself about it humphrey i am busy now she turned to her work having been interrupted in an essay on the treatment of hardened sinners considered in connection i believe with the case of jane cakebread chapter xxi to be off with the old love once more guest night at the college a good many guest nights had passed since the first the thoughtful and the curious no longer came they were not missed by hilarie and her friends at the place about which there had been at first so much discussion and derision a college which taught nothing and was only a place of culture and consolation and rest and good breedinga mere establishment for reminding women perpetually of their very highest functions and dutieswas sure to excite derision meanwhile it went on doing its own work and nobody derided any longer this is the way of the world and it is like one of the threenay four things which the proverbial philosopher found too wonderful for himthings which he knew not a man proposes to found or establish or create something newsomething which will perhaps cause changes small or great in the current order and the current talk it is immediately fastened upon and he is held up to derision nothing is so truly ridiculous as a thing which is new besides it makes admirable copy if the man kicks out in return he is jumped upon again the world is then called upon to observe how completely the creature is squelched how he lies flat and lifeless on the arid sand presently the world observes that the man so far from being flat and lifeless is going on just as if there had been no jumping at all he bears no apparent mark of bruises no bones are broken there are no patches of diachylum on his head he just proceeds quietly with his plan then comes another but a fainter sound of derision because when people do get hold of a good thing to worry they like to keep at it but the dead man twice killed goes on without paying any attention then silence falls it is unwise to let the world understand that the man you have just killed is going about alive and quite unhurt and that the theory you have covered with contempt is flourishing like a vigorous vine already bearing blossoms and rich with promise of purple clusters yes said hilarie my simple college is going on we are quite full we teach nothing except the true functions of woman and her place in the human comedy we admit all those who have to work here they learn that work for money and a livelihood is a kind of accident for woman for man it is necessary his nature makes him crave for activity for woman it is an accident which belongs to our imperfect social system she ought not to work for pay and in the case of many women perhaps most it degrades and lowers them because it turns them from what should be the main object of their lives in this place we warn and here we daily strive to hold before them the necessity of keeping before themselves a standard they must never lose sight of the fact that woman is the priestess of civilization we do our best to prevent our girls from being degraded by the unhappy accident of having to work for wages all womens work should be work for love but it is said that you pauperize them by taking them in for nothing hilarie laughed if the gift is a gift of love repaid by love what harm but there is a rule about payment and nobody knows except myself who pays and who does not they come when they like they go when they like it is a college in the old sense of the word not the newa place of residence she left her guests and spoke to molly i have asked my cousin humphrey to come she said will you give him an answer tonight i thought i would wait to see how he would receive yes you told me it is a most wonderful story molly but i do not believe that it will be allowed to go beyond those who know it at present i do not believe that he will ever be told this story at all if he were i know very well how he would behave there is another reason molly dear you will understand presently when i show you a letter take him into the library when the people are going away do not answer him until i come to you i promise you molly that after i have shown you a certain paper you will thank god that your doubts and your temptations were all removed but if he were to go through this ordeal it is a trial that would prove the noblest nature it is but there is another ordeal will you trust me why hilarie if i am to begin by distrusting you dick was present and had brought his fiddle on which he presently discoursed to the joy of everybody except his distant cousin later on molly led humphrey to sit out in the library where two or three other couples were already occupied in the same selfish evasion of duty the young man was in a most ill temperperhaps on account of dicks presence he made no pretence at concealing this ill temper i have every reason to complain he said you avoid me you will not answer my letters i am waiting to give you your final answer you gave that long ago i did not i have told you all along that i was not certain whether the thing would tend to your happiness or my own above all i refused to have any concealments this objection to concealment is a new thing before you consented no i never did consent i have always told you that i would not be hidden away like a thing to be ashamed of and i have always told you that my only reason was respect for my mothers prejudices let me have my own prejudices too and i mean to have them respected you know that i love you molly that is no reason why you should insult me if i am ever married it must be openly and in the sight of the world i think i should ask my relations to be present you would like to meet the parish clerk and the pewopener and the ragged bankrupt dont use bad language sir humphrey poor and lowly they may be but perhapsim sure i dont knowthey are virtuous as well i dont mind what you say molly then there are the haverils the rich people the man called upon me the other day and talked conundrums what have you got to do with them they are my cousins i am a great deal with them just now oh is that what makes you so infernally independent shall i become the heiress of millions or shall i be hidden away in a box by a husband who is ashamed of his wife i have this choice oh their heiress if they will do that but have you told them of your engagement i am not engaged dont be silly molly how can you refuse what i offer you why did the man call on me then did he call what did he tell you he talked about some tremendous secrettalked about my mother i thought he meant you and the engagement then he told mewhich was a most curious thingthat if i followed the wishes of my mother i should have as much money as i want wishes of my mother why if i told her that i was engaged to a lady named pennefather she would ask what your county was and with whom you were connected and where your peoples property might lie and if i saidyou knowwhy it would be a case of cutting me off with a shilling yet that respectable dives went on talking about my mothers wishes perhaps you did not understand him at all events he could not mean my engagement because i am not engaged this is the tenth time that i have reminded you of that fact sir humphrey my mother would certainly like me to back outi mean not to go on pray do back out i believe you want to take up with that detestable cadthe man you call dickloathsome worm you are doing your very best to be pleasant this evening and to ingratiate yourself all the world are cads are they not except a small class but it is quite true dick wants me to marry him youd better then and go off on the tramp with him perhaps i shall but now humphrey just to come back to ourselves you continually insult my peoplethe class to which i belongwhenever you open your lips to speak you have nothing but contempt for the people who work for their living to whom i belong and the people outside your own little circle what do you want to marry me for to make me happy by having to listen to this continual flood of contempt because mollythe young mans artificial smile vanished and his pincenez droppedbecause you are unlike everybody i know none of the girls that i know are in the least like you it pleases me to see you get indignant in defence of cads it is like coming into a different atmosphere i like to feel like coming down into another class when we are married i mean to go on living with my mother and her set and to keep you apartdont call it concealmentin some cottage away from the west end and my own people well of course you wont have them to your house i suppose you can go and see some of them if you like you cant possibly want to see all and my old friend dick humphrey turned red he lost his repose he flushed a vulgar red you shall not associate with that abominable cad molly i shall forbid it altogether you must promise when i promise anythingperhaps then you know molly you are soothing to the nerves after seeing a bad picture or hearing a bad piece of music or listening to the cheerfulness of thatthat beast they call dick only to watch you consoles and to talk with you restores i am glad to have some qualities in spite of my birth you have risen above that misfortune molly if you would only refuse to know these people certainly not give me your promise molly she rose well at all events i understand exactly what you mean if you are so good as to marry me i am to be hidden away i am to serve as a soothing syrup for shattered nerves i am to be an antidote to bad music i am to be ashamed of my own people and to give up my old friends that is understood is it not we exchange sacrificesmine the sacrifice of marrying beneath me yours that of giving up an ignoble troop of relations to plain persons every word that this girl had spoken would have been a clear announcement of her decision to this young man no such intention was conveyed still in the fulness of his selfconceit the sacrifice he himself proposed in actually marrying a girl with such family connections seemed so enormous while the prospect of becoming his wife seemed to him so dazzling that he was totally unable to understand any hesitation molly was whimsical she did not like to surrender her independence he liked her the better for it no meek submissive maiden however lovely would be able to command that sacrifice and besides there was that strange magic about the girls face and eyes and voice that in her presence as has been explained already the young mans mind was full of yearnings after transports unspeakableafter the flowery way where the dancers are with the castanets and the champagne and raptures that even the newest art cannot bestow humphrey she said suppose that in a momentall in a momentthe things you value most in the world should vanish my art my genius no not such genius as you may possess that is not what you value most i mean your birth and rank and position in the world suppose that were to vanish suddenly away you talk nonsense i say suppose it were to vanish suddenly awaysuppose you were to becomesayone of my cousinsborn like them molly dont waste time in talking nonsense well perhaps oh here is hilarie the library was now deserted save for these two when hilarie appeared at the door her face always grave was now stern humphrey saw the look on her face and coloured consciencestricken with her came his other cousin also looking grave molly dear said hilarie has sir humphrey been pressing you the young man became confused and agitated he understood he has he wants me to promise to go into hiding with a secret marriage he is unable to understand that the sacrifice could not be compensated even by his society hilarie turned to sir humphrey i asked you here tonight she said in order to arrange this little scene molly you can read this letter molly read it and looked up from the page into the shamefaced cheeks of humphrey iii must go said the double lover good night molly no sir not before molly has read the letter richard moved a step towards the door molly read it and looked up amazed she read it again and her cheek flamed and a third time then she returned the letter to hilarie wretch she said since hilarie used the same word to express the same idea there is no doubt that the dictionary ought to have a special line on this meaning of the word wretch do you understand it molly there can be no doubt about it hilarie wont you make him go hilarie pointed to the door contemptuously as one dismisses a messenger or a boy not in the tragic vein at all but by a little gesture of her forefinger dick threw the door open with a gesture of command humphrey obeyed with an effort at preserving some appearance of dignity to be found out under such circumstances to be exposed in such a manner to be ordered off the premises so contemptuously would make the proudest of men leave the room with the appearance of ignominy molly my dear said hilarie when you think of the man and what he is you will never regret him she laid her head upon hilaries shoulder with a deep deep sigh one doesnt like a man making love to somebody else at the same time but i dare say i shall get over that and thenoh my dear hilarie it is such a relief i cannot tell you what a relief for you know sometimes i seem to think that i did consent and as for my other cousin here dick said molly the fiddle is very light to carry i shant feel the weight of itnot a bit are you satisfied dick chapter xxii the clan again once more the relations met together this time by invitation they would have preferred separate and individual treatment each one received a letter inviting him or her to the hotel on the afternoon of such a day each came expectant hopeful confident and their faces dropped when they found each in turn that all had been invited together they mounted the stairs they entered the room they stood about or they sat down in silence if they spoke it was to remark in murmurs on the interesting motives of certain persons in connection with rich cousins the broken one shabbier than ever sat hanging his head i wouldnt ha come he said aloud if id expected a crowd like this but the draper of mare street hackney stood erect his hand thrust into his bosom as one who is gently rocked and lulled upon his own motives as upon the cradle of the deep presently john haveril came in accompanied by dick who attended as a kind of private secretary and took no part in the proceedings until the end john carried in his hand a bundle of papers well he said youre all come i thinkall come he turned over the papers and nodded to the writer of each letter in turn all come i invited you all to come he spoke gravely and with dignityin his most dignified manner first sirthe selfconstituted spokesman offered his handwe trust that you continue in good health in the midst of your truly colossal responsibilities yes sir yesi continue pretty well again he looked round perhaps you will all sit down i for one should be ashamed to sit the draper spoke with reproach in his voice for the rest had taken chairs ashamed sir while you are standing it was something like the oldfashioned reading of the will but before the funeral instead of after they sat expectant hungrily expectant out of so many millions surely surely something would come to every one would it take the form of hundreds alma said the pewopener coming along in the omnibus hes got a good heart you can see it in his deep blue eye hes bound to give us what we askand alice my own first cousin and all and you but one removed perhaps cousin charles has been at him behind our backs it is disheartening to observe the readiness with which young ladies on a certain social level ascribe and suspect the baser springs of action trust him the lady of the pews should have learned more christian charity but i hope he wont be able to poison cousin johns mind against honest people i call him cousinjohnbymarriage not mr haveril and i say he took us over with alice when he married her a man marries my dear into his wifes family alma what is it mother theyve got no children somebody must have it when they go why not you and me why not mother we could make a good use of it we could ah she closed her eyes for the space of a furlong mother how much did you ask for a hundred and twenty pounds i could do it for less perhaps because theres my own furniture he must give it he cant refuseand me alices first cousin and you but one removed my dear ive always longed to have a margate lodginghouse since i stood upon margate jetty as a girl and paid a margate bill as a grown woman before you were born ive asked for seventy pounds i believe i could start respectably for less but seventy would be plenty and oh to sit behind your own counter covered with dolls and fancywork and pretty things and have no work to do oh she clasped her hands in ecstasy yes alma its all very well if the people come in to buy your things but what do you know about shops and what to charge come to that mother what do you know about keeping lodgings it was with speculations such as these with castles in the air or in spain that the cousins beguiled their way towards the htel mtropole the fancy of the broken one dwelt upon the tobaccoshop it seems that this kind of shop attracts many of the best and brightest there is so little to do the money drops in all day long you can smoke your own tobacco morning noon and night while the laughing hours dance along and strew the way with roses the bankrupt looked indeed as if roses would be a change for him after his long staying among the flagons and the apples i asked you when you were here lastjohn haveril remained standingto send me letters if you wanted me to do anything i wanted to know quite clearly what you wanted you have done so i find as i expected that you all want me to give you money excuse me sir said the spokesman we distinguish between begging and borrowing to giveto bestow almsupon unworthy personshe looked severely at the bankrupt who paid no heedor upon persons who are best left in their own humble station in lifehe waved an insulting hand towards the pewopeneris one thing to advance capital which will be regarded as a loan to be repaid with interest is quite another thing to solicit alms as has been done i fear by some in this room is one thing to offer an investment on the solid security of a sterling and established place of business is quite another thing very true said john haveril very true where the security is a concerna concern sir improving every day with four and twenty young ladies as shopassistants fed on scrag of mutton and margarine observed the pewopener aloud in a promising suburb and in a crowded highway with the electric light a carriage often at the door and the proprietor a churchwardena very different thing he concluded running down and forgetting the construction of his sentence the others said nothing but the board school teacher examined the pictures on the wall and was absorbed for the moment in art criticism you all want money john haveril repeated that is the reason why i invited you here today why shouldnt we asked the broken one you are the only one of the family who has got any money as for this fellowhe indicated the draperhollow hollow theres no stability in him i know where i am there he ought to bedown among the dead men where a few pounds would be the making of us and them not so much as missed said the pewopener why not i dont know continued the capitalist that youve got any claim on me you cut your cousin alice offout of the familyfor her first marriage what else asked the spokesman could we do she married an actor sira common actor no doubt she has long since repented her early choice how different from her second ventureher second prize ah a prize indeed some of us were not born then said the board school teacher id as soon marry an actor as a drapersooner too she was a sharpfaced girl quick and readyperhaps too quickwith womans most formidable weapon actors dont sweat shopgirls alice tells me john haveril went on slowly that none of you ever made any kind of inquiry after her or answered her lettersexcept onewillalso an actor who is now deceased how could we when some of us hadnt even got into the cradle asked the teacher i didnt quarrel with alice said the bankrupt i never saw her nor heard of her and i didnt quarrel with cousin will why he added conclusively i borrowed money of him if she had been in want john haveril added would you have helped her because she was your cousin since i for one never heard that she was in wantagain the teacherhow can i tell what i should have done its like this mr haverilyou must know it yourself it isnt respectable to have cousins ragged and in want if i could afford it i would give them money to go away look at that objectshe pointed to the bankrupt object i call him object yourself retorted the broken one is he a credit to the family no ive got no money to spare or id pay him to go right away same with cousin alice dont talk to us about cousinly love we like respectability very good said john haveril cousin alice has brought you a lot of relations alma continued emboldened here we are fawning like cousin charles begging like cousin alfred and telling you the truth like me one sir one at leastthis was of course the draperhas ever been ready to acknowledge the tie of blood im sure said the pewopener if alice had come to my humble place which she never did never her daughter added thered have been a cup of tea made in no time and a chair by the fire you have among youjohn haveril pointed to the bankrupta cousin who is poor and distressed what have you done for him which of you has helped this unfortunate man not one the unfortunate replied for all while charles regarded his fallen relation vindictively not one the bankrupt continued and now your guilty hearts are exposed and your greedy natures brought to light grabbers and grubbersevery one and this to meto memr haveril the only gentleman of the lot what do they care about gentlemen you ask me all of you to help you with gifts or loans of money on what pretence because i am your cousins husband cousinjohnbymarriage said the pewopener you took us over as your own when you married alice you married into the family that you cant deny if that is the reason why i am to help you why dont you help this cousin hear hear from the cousin indicated he is in the last stage of poverty and misery because it serves him right the draper once more stepped forward while the rest of the family murmured assent outside said john it is raining with a cold wind he has no greatcoatnothing but a thin jacket the soles of his boots are parting help him hes always been a disgrace to the family said the pewopener you ask me however to help you and you offer no reference as to character reference what reference do you want asked the board school teacher havent i got a responsible situation isnt mother in a responsible situation mr haveril i wouldnt talk about this poor ragamuffin if i were you its beneath you give him a greatcoat yourself and in ten minutes it will be five shillings and in an hour it will be drunk help him i wouldnt help cousin alfred if i had hundredsnor cousin charles if i had millions you wouldnt said the bankrupt if it was an angel from heaven youd see him starve first some of us my dear sir the draper explained sadly have to draw the line at disgrace character in business goes a long way bankruptcy brings disgrace even upon those members of the family who are otherwise regarded with respect you think it is a mistake to give money cousin charles retracted we must distinguish between giving and advancing i would recommend the advancethe advance onlyof capital to those who can help themselves my friend if you can help yourself you want no help in a sense most true in fact profoundly true cousin charles replied i will make a note of those words they shall become my motto those who can help themselves want no help so truly wise and if so john continued to help those who cannot help themselves is throwing money away it isit is he pointed to the bankrupt why help him he cannot help himself i have always felt that to help my cousin alfred is a sinif waste of money is sinful he failed sir he became a bankrupt in mare street only five doors from my place of business with my surname over his door i wonder i survived it youll survive your own failure next said the bankrupt come back to your own case mister you agree that one should not help those who can help themselves let us lay hold on that if you can help yourself why do you want help youve helped yourself i understand to a flourishing business you are evidently therefore beyond the necessity of further help you want me to advance you a large sum of money why you have shown that you can help yourself very well the best thing you can do is to go on helping yourself cousin charles changed colour his face dropped to use the familiar expression sweating four and twenty girls in black with white cuffs murmured the teacher this john continued slowly and with weight is my answer to your letter go on as you have already begun trusting to yourself alone it is best for you if you are on the downward grade you would only be saved for a time if you are going up the advance you ask would not help you that is my answer mister to your letter the draper grew very red in the face then he asked youyouyou refuseyou actually refuse this trifling assistance actually you hear charles said the bankrupt am i in my senses he looked round him the husband of my cousin alice much lovedsweet alice ben bolta man of millions refuses me an advance upon undeniable security of a simple thousand pounds why the bank will do it for me with alacrity then go to the bank the poor man changed from red to white his cheeks became flabby his arms which had been folded dropped he suddenly grew limp it is rather terrible to see a confident aggressive man become suddenly limp perhaps he had built confidently on this advance perhaps he was not quite so substantial as he boasted and as he seemed perhaps that great shop with four and twenty girls in black with white cuffs all in a row was haunted by the spectre of which nobody talks though it is seen daily by so manythe grisly threatening lean gaunt fierceeyed ghost called bankruptcy he clapped his hat on his head he recovered a little he tried to smile he assumed some show of dignity he even laughed then he replied with genuine heartfelt emotion the lord forgive you and walked out of the room john haveril turned to the pewopener here is your letter he said i return it to you why should i give you anything you are fifty years of age you say you have a son in good employ you have a daughterthis girl i supposein the school board service you have a reasonably good situation the ladys face dropped and lengthened oh she cried dont refuse dont refuse its such a trifle to you you would never miss it and never feel it and it would be the making of meit would indeed john haveril shook his head with the deliberation and the expression of a bear his mind was made up the woman went on but feebly you cant like to ownyou so rich and allthat youve got a cousin in such a humble place as mine you might help her to be respectable her daughter put in you can be respectable in any situation i am quite as proud of you in your present situation as if you were what you want to bea lodginghouse keeper at margate he turned to her daughter my dear he said kindly you are a little fool why oh whyand her heart sank because you want to give up the best work that a woman can do where theres pay enough and holidays and respect the girl shook her head you dont know she moaned the work and the drudgery and to change it for the worst work in the world my dear you should be proud of being what you are if you were in the states you would feel proud of your work what give up that work for a miserable little shop where you must cheat to make both ends meet dont be silly go back and thank god my dear that he has put you where you can do some good she sat down and pulled out her pockethandkerchief her mother stood beside her her lips moving her cheek flaming shall i give you back your letter john haveril asked she took it tore it up threw the fragments on the floor seized her mother by the arm and dragged her out whether in repentance or in anger the bystanders could not know they were all gone now except the bankrupt youve got my letter too he said what are you going to do for me the kindest thing would be to drop you in the river alice has left it to me well you are a hopeless creature whatever is done for you will be money thrown away i did think of asking your cousin the draper to give you a place in his shop you might sweep it out and water the floor and carry out the parcelsor you might walk up and down outside in uniform and a gold band to your cap mr haverilsiri am a gentleman dont insult a fallen gentleman sir ive employed my own shopassistants but i fear he would do nothing for you i came hereone day three weeks agoyou were awayi knew that i gave alice some secret information just for her own ear not the kind of thing she would tell you get on man i told heryou dont know of course i told her you ought to knowyou suppose hes dead man man said john alices first husbandanthony woodroffe you think hes dead i told her where he was where dick sat up suddenly anthony woodroffe why should i ask whether hes dead or alive thats what alice said as for me i told her i was astonished alice i said i did think you were respectable what does this man mean asked dick anthony woodroffe well boy said john this chap brought us the news where he was we thought on the whole there was no need to tell youso we didnt tell you ive been to see him hes pretty comfortable he is pretty comfortable said anthonys late companion between the boards if abrahams bosom is better than the cold kerb and softer than the dosshouse he is quite comfortablefor he died this morning where did he die asked dick in the marylebone workhouse infirmary the man got up and shuffled away as he went out of the room he held out his hand and there was the chink of coin my father dead ay lad hes dead what better for you and everybody ive seen him on and off most days he was a hardened sinner if ever there was one dead i have been taught to regard him with a kind of loathing butwe can only have one father dead in a workhouse infirmary he has left two sons you are not the only one two sons yesconcerning his halfbrother dick could not choose but speak vindictivelythe other will hear tomorrow who his father was he shall hear also that his father is dead he and i will be the mourners at the paupers funeral chapter xxiii one more attempt that man again lady woodroffe threw the card into the fire tell him i will not see him no let him come up it was richard woodroffe proposing to make his last attempt before doing so he had run down to birmingham and seen the newlyfound witness he was a most trustworthy person he picked out the photograph of lady woodroffe from a bundle of photographs he remembered the case and the lady perfectly well there was therefore no doubt possible that she had been in birmingham at that time and that she had lost her own son sirshe sat up in her chair with angry eyesthis is persecution i have already given a patient hearing to your most impudent story you have lady woodroffe neither her angry looks nor her presence disconcerted him now he was so perfectly certain of his cause and of her shameless falsehood that he stood before her at ease and even with some appearance of dignity i even took the trouble to invite your friend the person for whom you profess to act the woman with the delusion you did he did not wait to be invited he took a chair and sat down in it in order to convince her of her absurdity in which you failed because after all your talk there remained the solid factthe death of sir humphreys son sir humphrey had one son only who is still living i was wrong in thinking that a plain statement of facts could move the poor mad woman she brought with her a young person who encouraged her to insult me they even attempted to assault me i believe after the grossest abuse they carried off a bundle of babylinen and things that i had treasured for reasons which i fear you are incapable of understanding no lady woodroffe on the contrary i understand them very well you brought them out on this occasion with the intention of showing this poor lady what i must venture to call your defiance my defiance certainly i accept the word my defiance you appear to be almost as polite as your friends mr woodroffe you could not have chosen a more effective manner of announcing your intentions there you said these clothes which you made with your own fingers show that it is your boy yet you shall not have him and i defy you to prove that he is yours you are correct on one point i do defy you to prove that fact very well i am here today to tell you that i have advanced one more step and a very important step it is important or not i defy you to prove the fact this is not however exactly an acknowledgment but i shall not argue with you i believe i ought to hand you over at once to my lawyers to be dealt with for conspiracy richard woodroffe smiled i wish you would he said i should like nothing better than the publicity of an action oh she groaned the pertinacity of the blackmailer i shall not be insulted whatever you say i am here to tell you that the proofs have now closed round you so completely that there is not left i verily believe a single loophole of escape lady woodroffe rose with dignity you talk to me sirto meof escape and loophole go sirgo to my solicitors certainly richard continued however to occupy his chair i will go to your solicitors whenever you please i would rather go to them than come here but for the sake of others i would prefer that you should acknowledge the fact and let the son go back to his mother he is my own halfbrother but it is not fraternal affection that prompts me in this research i assure you if you refuse to hear me i shall have to go to your solicitors through mrs haverils solicitors oh go on then she sat down again and crossed her hands in her lap assuming something of the expression of a person bored to death by a very bad sermon i have certain evidence in my hands thenhe could not avoid a smile of satisfactionwhich connects you with the dead childyour child lady woodroffe caught her breath and started as if in sudden pain go on sir i will tell you what it is you arrived one evening at the great midland hotel birmingham with an indian ayah and a child you engaged three roomsa sittingroom and two bedrooms you explained that the child had been taken suddenly and alarmingly ill in the train you sent out for a medical man he came he kept the maids running about with hot water and the boys going out for remedies and prescriptions he stayed with you all night watching the case in the morning your child was dead three days afterwards you buried him there is no monument over the childs grave because you made an arrangement with the help of dr robert steele and substituted another child for him and you went away two or three days after the funeral and disappeared the rooms were taken in your name the books of the hotel prove so much oh this man is tedioustediouswith his repetitions i have been down to birmingham again i have now found an old waiter who remembers the circumstance perfectly wellindian ayah and sick baby and funeral he says he remembers you but that i doubt i have also found the medical man who was called in he not only remembers the case which he entered at the time in his notebook but he also remembers you after four and twenty years and picked you out of a bundle of photographs i think you will admit that this is an important step she made no reply her face was drawn and twisted with the pain of listening what is wanted now richard added is the connection of yourself and the child if we fail there you will fail we shall ask sir robert you will fail then we shall give publicity to the casei dont quite know how all the world shall understand you will have to explain all the world it is the high court of justice that you must address i shall look to the judge to protect me remember it is in my power to prove that i was in scotland at that very time on that very day when the child died on that very day she replied firmly and without hesitation lady woodroffe i cannot believe what you say you can prove what you like she repeated but you cannot prove that i bought the child to speak plainly i dont believe one word about your proving an alibi lady woodroffe any more than i believe that remarkably bold falsehood about the childs clothes we shall prove the death of the child beyond a doubt you can then if you please find out something that will amuse the world about humphrey as for the publicity since you will only prove that a woman took my name i care nothing my reputation is not likely to be injured by such a story who will believe against my wordthat ilady woodroffea leader sir in a world of which you and your like know nothingthe world which advances humanitythe world of religion and of charitythe world which combats vice unceasinglyshould condescend to a crime so ignoble and so purposeless i am not concerned with your credibilities lady woodroffe i learn that you made a large use of them with mrs haveril and only desisted when they proved a failure then you took to defiance the publicity will fall upon the fashionable physician the great man of science the head of his profession who will have to acknowledge that he found a child and bought it for a certain unknown persona noble way for a young physician to earn a fee the publicity will also fall upon the now notorious lady who has got up in the world since she sold her only child for fifty pounds to keep it and herself out of the workhouse no injurious publicity will fall upon me other than the discovery of some woman who once took my name you are identified by your photograph you forget that can i after four and twenty years can any woman of my agefortyninebe identified by a stranger with another woman of twentyfive or thereabouts now mr richard woodroffe what else have you got to say i have only this to say i came here today lady woodroffe in the hope that what i have told you would show you the danger of your position for the sake of this lady who is worn almost to death by the anxiety of her situation i hoped that you would confess confess i to confess you speak as if i were a common criminal no said richard not common by any means lady woodroffe left her chair and stepped over to the fireplace she looked older and the authority went out of her very strangely she laid her hand on the shelf as if for support and she spoke slowlywith no show of angerslowly and with sadness i think sir i do think that if you could consider the meaning of this charge to a person in my position the suffering you inflict upon me the mischief you may do to me and i know not how many more by persisting in this charge you would abandon it i cannot i am acting for another you are playing a game to win i dont accuse you of sordid motives you want to win perhaps i do have you asked yourself the simple question whether it is possible for me to commit such a crime and then to confess i have to win this game lady woodroffe i think i have won it it is not won yet and believe me sir it will not be won unless i choose we can place you in a very awkward position anyhow mr richard woodroffe you came here to make a final appeal to me it is my turn to make a final appeal to you i am a woman as perhaps you know of very considerable importance in the world such a charge as you bring against me would not only crush me if it were proved but it would dislocate or ruin a great many associations and institutions of which i am the very soul thousands of orphans working girls magdalens and sinners would lose their best friend i am their best friend my tongue and my pen keep up the stream which flows in to their relief is it not possible for that woman to think of these things or there is the boy he is partly i suppose what he is by education partly by his nature take away from him his position as a gentleman of rank and family send him out disgraced to make his own way in the world and he will sink like lead you call him your halfbrother well mr woodroffe he is not a young man of many virtues in fact he has many vices that i can well believe if he has seven devils now after this disclosure he will have seventyseven devils that also i can well believe but of course i do not think about him then mr woodroffe can you not persuade that poor woman to go home to be content with what she has seen and you have proved no i cannot can you not remind her that she sold the child on the condition that she would never trouble about him or seek to know where he might be living no i cannot she has seen her son she knows who he is she wants your acknowledgment give her that and i dont know in fact what will happen afterwards lady woodroffe sat down and sighed heavily be it so she said you will go on you will do your worst richard woodroffe regarded her with a sense of pity and even of respect the woman had supported her position by a succession of shameless lies she was now virtually confessing to him that they were lies but she had so much to loseher great position among religious and charitable people her reputation the respect which her blameless life and her great abilities had won for her all these things were threatened madam he said his face full of emotion if it were only your son to be thought of i would retire but there is this poor lady who is only kept alive i believe by the hope and belief that her son will be restored to her believe me if i may speak of pity for you pity she sprang to her feet with fire and fury in her cheeks and eyes it is happily the rarest thing in the world to see a womani mean a woman of cultureovermastered by passion yet it lies there it is always possible in the heart of the meekest maiden the most selfgoverned and most highly bred woman there lies hidden the tigress the fishwife the scold the shrew formerly whenever women were gathered together they quarrelled whenever they quarrelled they foughtsometimes with fists cudgels brooms chairs sometimes with tongues men were so horribly frightened by the scolding wife that they ducked her put her in a cage carried her round in a cart the little word pity was the last drop in the cup lady woodroffe raged and stormed at the unfortunate richard for the time her mind was beyond control afterwards he remembered that such a fit of passion showed the tension of her mind he made no reply when her torrent of words and threats was exhausted she threw herself into her chair and buried her face in her hands then richard quietly withdrew chapter xxiv a horrid night richard woodroffe walked away with hanging head a second time he had learned that his proofs might not be so convincing after all the defence set up by a woman of the highest social position character and personal influence that she had never been in birmingham in her life that on the day of the alleged death of her child she was in scotland that she knew nothing of the person who was said to have assumed her name could only be met by evidence concerning that person by an identification of that person with lady woodroffe by an old man speaking of an event of four and twenty years ago and by an alleged resemblance as to the packet of clothes that would certainly be no evidence at all he himself was perfectly certain of the fact there was no doubt left in his own mind but would his proofs be accepted in a court of justice as he walked along with these heavy reflections he was startled by a hand upon his shouldera thing which in former times caused the sufferer to swoon with terror because it was the familiar greeting of the sheriffs officer the man with a writ that part of the officers duty is now however gone it was in fact the hand of sir robert steele who his days work finished was taking the air dick he cried i havent seen you sincesincewhen since the day when you made a study of heredity oh you mean when you dined with me yes dick my boy i have heard things about youthe strange adventures of a singer of course you have lady woodroffe has told you how you are fishing in troubled waters and catching nothing yes i have seen mrs haverila most interesting woman but she ought to go home and keep quiet keep her quiet dick put down your fishingrod and make that good lady sit down and keep that good lady quiet i will as soon as i have restored her son to her we have found him you know you tell me so you think it is sir humphrey woodroffe is it not we are perfectly certain it is lady woodroffe has told you i dare say what we have done somethingsomething you are working no doubt in the interests of the second baronet yes oh yes dick grinned he is my halfbrother you know i am anxious to restore him to his real rank which is mine he shall become what he is pleased to describe mean outsider and a cad two cains and no abel a slaughterous pair well have you proved your case yet to our own satisfaction perfectly to the complete satisfaction of the world as soon as the story is told for lawyerswellthere is one point lacking that one point that one point always that one point it is like connecting your family with illustrious ancestryalways the one point wanting i need not ask what that point is no because you are the person who can supply the link is that so asked the doctor dryly then while you are waiting for that link my dear richard i advise you to tie up your papers and go back to legitimate business he stopped because they were arrived at his own door come in he said now then my dear boy sit down and let us have it out first of all however understand that you cannot establish that link you say that i am the only person who can supply it well if that is so remember that i shall not you mean will not just as you like the distinction between will and shall is sometimes too subtle for the rules of syntax but my dear sir robert just consider what a lot i can prove lady woodroffe goes to a hotel in birmingham she drives in hurriedly her child is ill she sends for a medical man she takes two bedrooms and a sittingroom she has an ayah the medical man stays with her the whole night in the morning the child dies how do you know all these things by the notebook of the man who was called in by the books of the hotel by the evidence of the medical man himself by the evidence of a waiter who remembers the case by the register of deaths all this looks strong i admit so that we can actually prove the death of sir humphreys only son and we can call upon lady woodroffe to inform us who is the man calling himself sir humphreys only son you prove that a woman calling herself lady woodroffe did all these things and we can produce a witness who will swear to her identity after all these years i doubt if you couldif that evidence would be received i admit that you have a case as it is you could make a cause clbre you are able to make things horribly uncomfortable for lady woodroffe and you are able to inspire the young man her son with a lively animosity against yourself i dont mind that in the least i shall go and see him i shall say you are my halfbrother you are first cousin to a collection of common folk whose commonness will rejoice your heart i will introduce you to them you shall take tea with themthe tea of shrimps periwinkles and watercress that you have yet to learnand to love i shall exhaust myself in congratulations with the domestic affections i never interfere here however is a difficulty you say we will do this and that who is we you yourself suppose you spring all this upon the world and suppose nobody takes any notice i may advertise the whole history and offer a reward for the discovery of the identification of the woman but nobody can identify lady woodroffe my old doctor your old doctor would break down lady woodroffe has only to deny absolutely that she is the woman counsel can always suggestman in indiaanother womanassumption of namereal wife with her father lord dunedinletters to prove itold nobleman swears it venerable old noblemanever seen himrather like abraham well we shall find some way of forcing the history upon the public and a certain event has just happened which may give me an opportunity what is that my father is dead he died yesterday he was also humphreys father oh i am sorry no one need express any sorrow on that account as he left my mother when i was a baby i have never seen him i did not know that he was in england it appears that he has been a sandwichman for some time and he died in a pauper infirmary as for myself i feel neither shame nor grief he was to me as to you a stranger but perhaps i can use the event in order to give publicity to our story if we must court publicity well let us hope but go on as for lady woodroffe she has actually confessed the thing he then proceeded to tell the story of the childs clothes the doctor became thoughtful the audacity of showing and claiming the clothes astonished him it isnt evidence dick he said no but its complete proof to the true mother perhapsto her sir robert in fact admitted everything but at this stage a mere admission of the kind meant nothing it was a strange thing to do said the doctor there is the audacity of despair about it she had quite forgotten the fact that the register of deaths contained the name of the boy if it had been a common name it would have mattered little she did not tell me that the child died in birmingham that doctorwhat is his name ah i dont know him does he know the meaning and bearing of his evidence i believe not he will not talk however he has undertaken to preserve absolute silence until he is called upon to speak keep the power of disclosure in your own hands dick above all things do that why did she produce the childs clothes womans wit is hard to follow my word against all the world she meant i believe as if she must be believed on her bare assertion against all the facts that could be brought against her it was her pride like all female leaders she is incredibly proud she means to stand up and deny on the other hand the situation is harassing there are points in the case which make it almost impossible the goingson of my illconditioned brother i suppose perhapsperhaps i wish she had told me when and how the child died they dined together over an excellent bottle of chateau mouton they exchanged further confidences my dear dick said the doctor its a serious situation you propose to cover a woman of the highest reputation with infamy she says in effect you are quite right i am that infamous person but prove it you want to restore to another most amiable and honourable woman her son and he would break her heart in a year you want me to identify the lady and thereby to confess my share in a transaction which might be made to look like complicity in a fraud and a conspiracy i told her at the time that it looked like substitution though she called it adoption well i can imitate the ladys frankness that is to say i do not in so many words confess the truth but i show it i allow you to conclude that the thing is true and like the lady i defy you you will find out nothing more and if you were to put me in the boxif you were to make me tell the truth about that infernal babenever never would i confess to knowing the name of the lady and without that evidence you can never prove your case as a rule the doctor was the last man in the world either to dream or to trouble himself with dreams nevertheless there fell upon him an incubus of the night which was so persistent that though he waked a dozen times and shook off the thing a dozen times it came again and so vivid was it that he saw it still when he awoke in the morning and heard it and remembered it and felt it for in this dream he saw himself giving evidence in a court of law as to his own share in the substitution of another child for the dead child and in the dream he saw himself losing reputation character practice everything as the evidence was reluctantly given he saw the face of the judge growing more and more severe the faces of the jury harder the faces in the court more hostile he read in all his own condemnation this is what he had to say in the years i was carrying on a general practice in a quarter of birmingham i was in fact a sixpenny doctor charging that sum for advice and medicine and having a fairly good reputation among the poorer class of that quarter on a certain afternoon in february here the witness referred to his booksa lady entered the surgery she was deeply veiled and in much trouble she told me that she wanted to adopt a child in the place of her own whom she had just lost by death she asked me further if i knew of any poor woman who would give up her child it was to be about fifteen months old she gave the date of her dead childs birth as december the nd and it must have light hair and blue eyes among my patients was a woman left penniless by her husband who had deserted her she wanted above all things money to go in search of him as he was an actor in a small way she thought it would be easy to find him if she had money to travel with the woman was mad with grief she was ready to give up the child in return for the money she wanted at the time she would have given up her own soul for the money the child was somewhere about the required agea month more or less mattered little it had blue eyes and light hair i made the arrangement with her i took the child also by arrangement to the great western railway station and gave it to an indian ayah who carried it into a firstclass carriage where the lady sat then the train went off and i saw nothing more of the lady or the child for twentyfour years i did not know nor did i ask the ladys name or address only on a halftorn envelope in which she had placed the notesten fivepound notesfor the mother of the child was the word lady w as part of an address i did not know nor did i ask the ladys intentions she said she wanted to adopt a child i arranged this for her i took the mother the sum of fifty pounds and i charged the lady a fee of three guineas the only question we discussed was that of heredity and especially the danger of the child inheriting criminal tendencies four and twenty years later i received a visitbeing then a physician practising in londonfrom the mother of the child who had remembered my name she was anxious to learn if possible what had become of her son she had become rich and would willingly claim the child upon her departure i began to think over the case which i had almost forgotten i remembered first the halftorn envelope and then looking at my notebook i remembered the date of the dead childs birthdecember i took down a peerage and looked through the pages presently i discovered what i wanted under the name of woodroffe the present baronet the second is there described as born on december now the son of the first baronet the late sir humphrey woodroffe who died early in was born on that day it was so extremely unlikely that two women enjoying the title of lady w should have a son born on the same day that i naturally concluded the second baronet and the adopted child were one and the same person so convinced was i of this fact that i ventured to call upon lady woodroffe and satisfied myself that it was so as however i had ascertained the truth in this unexpected manner i assured lady woodroffe that the secret should remain with me until she herself should give me permission to reveal it meantime one of mrs haverils friends began to make inquiries into the case he ascertained that the son of sir humphrey woodroffe died a child of fifteen months old at birmingham early in he further learned that the socalled son in person figure and face closely resembled the father of the adopted child and he learned also that the medical man who attended the dead child knew its name and could absolutely identify the mother as the present lady woodroffe in fact the case was so far capable of proof that no reasonable person could entertain the slightest doubt on the subject it was certainly open to lady woodroffe to perjure herself by denying that she had ever been in birmingham this she was going to do i took no steps to dissuade her nor did i take any steps to put an end to the fraudulent representation of this young man as sir humphreys son in fact i became a party to the conspiracy he looked round the court in his dream and read his own condemnation in all the faces when he awoke in the morning the scene began all over again confound the baby he groaned am i never to get to the end of it he went down to breakfast trying to shake off the feeling of disquiet that possessed him just as he sat down richard woodroffe called i am sorry to disturb you he said but i have just been called to the htel mtropole mrs haveril has had a miserable night molly sat up with her she was weeping and crying all the night this morning she is a wreck there is perhaps no time to be lost i knew something was going to happen if she is to get her son back it must be soon or that dream of hers will not come true sit down dick ive had a horrid night too we will consider directly what is best to be done while he spoke there came a letterby hand sir robert steele bearer waits dear sir robert come to see me as soon as you can i have had the most terrible night yours l w again three terrible nights for the three principal conspirators the devil is in the business i believe now dick i have to call on lady woodroffe before i go to see this lady i sincerely hope she will treat you as she did me the manners of the aristocracy never showed to such advantage in my experience before i go to see this lady sir robert repeated again richard interrupted him we cannot afford to wait any longer mrs haverils condition forbids it i have determined to write to humphrey i shall begin by informing him of his fathers death i shall invite him to join me in paying his fathers debts i shall then advertise the death of anthony woodroffe in the marylebone infirmary as the father of sir humphrey woodroffe that will make him do something if he likes to go to law we will meet him if he wishes to see me i will tell him everything why not go to him at once without any letter because he will thus learn in the most dramatic way possible the name and the social position of his real father dick you make this a personal matter yes i do he became suddenly vindictive the scoundrel wanted molly to marry him secretly and live secretly with himyou understand thatwhile he was making love to hilarie woodroffe it is steep certainly steep but perhaps he did not mean doctor you know the kind of men they arethis johnnie and his friends they have no honour as they have no heart they are rotten through and throughrotten and corrupt dick there are others to be considered i will make the whole story publici will write a play on it is this revenge or justice dick i dont care which revenge is wild justice when are these letters to be written todaythis morning dickthe doctor laid a persuasive hand upon his armyou dont understand what it is you are doing wait till this evening give me say eightten hours let me beg you to wait till this evening if i can effect nothing in twelve hourswith the principalsthe twothe three principals concernedyou shall then do as you please well if i must if you really think well i will wait but i will have no compromise i could forgive him anythinghis insolence and his contempt but not love has many shapes my richard he may become a soldierbut a hangman an executioner he who brandishes the catoninetailsno dick nothat rle does not suit love stay thy hand dick turned away take your twelve hours i am going then at onceto lady woodroffe chapter xxv the first mother there were once two women who claimed the same child the case was referred to the king who in that country was also lord chief justice it is clear to me said the king after hearing the evidence on both sides that the case cannot be decided one way or the other therefore bring me the child so they laid the child before him he called his executioner take thy sword he said and cut the child into two equal portions the executioner drew his sword then said the king give one half to each of the two women they can then go away content and the woman who was not the mother of the child said great is the wisdom of the king o king live for ever but the other woman with tears and sobs threw herself over the child saying that she could not endure that the child should be killed and she would give it up to save its life parables like fables belong to all time this parable applies to the conclusion of the story sir robert found the lady in a condition closely resembling hysteria she had sent away her secretaries her letters lay piled on the table she herself paced the room in an agony i cannot bear it she cried i cannot bear it any longer they persecute me help me to kill myself i shall help you to live rather i have resolved what to do i will struggle no longer above all do not struggle you have deceived me you told me that without your evidence they can prove nothing that is quite true without my evidence they can prove nothing they have found proof that i was in birmingham at the time yes yes i know what they have found they have found enough to establish a suspiciona strong suspicion difficult to dissipatewhich would cling to us all cling cling what would that meanto me we must therefore avoid publicity if we can we are threatened with public exposure that if possible i say must be avoided are you listening if there is still time we must prevent scandal i can no longer bear it i say she pressed her hand to her forehead it drives me mad i thought last night i was mad she threw herself on a sofa and buried her head in her hands doctorshe started up againthat man has been here again he has found some onei dont knowi forgetsome one who remembers mewho recognizes me so i believeand then day and night the thought is always with me how can i bear the disclosure the papers will ring with it i hope there will be no disclosure believe me lady woodroffe no one can be more anxious than myself to avoid disclosures and scandals lady woodroffe this calm cold austere person whose spoken words moved the conscience of her audience if not their hearts whose printed papers carried conviction if not enthusiasm gave way altogether and sobbed and cried like a young girl it is all lost she moaned all that i have worked formy position in the world my leadership my careereverything is lost i shall have shame and disgrace instead of honour and respect oh i am punishedi am punished no woman has ever been more punished perhaps said the physician your punishment is finished four and twenty years is a long time i have written out a confession of the whole business she said wearily i had to i got up in the middle of the night my husband stood beside me oh i saw him and i heard him lilias he said what you did was in pity and in tenderness to me i forgive you all shall be forgiven you if you will confess so i sat down and wrote and here it is she gave him a paper which he placed in his inner pocket you know what i had to say doctor i was young and i was in agony my child was deadoh my child was dead no one knowsno man can tellwhat it is to lose your only child all the time i wrote my husband stood over me his noble face stern and serious as when he was lieutenantgovernor when i finished he laid his hand upon my headi felt it doctor i tell you i felt itand he said lilias it is forgiven and so he vanished and now you have got my confession yes i have it give mei ask your leavepermission to speak oh speak cry aloud go to the housetop and call it out sing it in the streets i shall become a byword and a mockery she walked about twisting a handkerchief in her hands my friends will have no more to do with me i have brought shame on my own people she panted and gasped her words came in jerks doctor i am resolved i will turn roman catholic and enter a convent it is for such women as myself that they make convents there i shall live out the rest of my life hearing nothing and knowing nothing and none of the scorn and shame that they will heap upon my name will reach the walls of my retreat you must not think only of yourself my dear madam what about humphrey he must do what he pleaseswhat he can what does it matter what he does sir robert i assure you that he is a selfish wretch the most hardened the most heartless he thinks about nothing but his own pleasure under the guise of following art he is a cold sensualist i have never detected in him one single generous thought or word i have never known him do one single unselfish action i have never cared for himnow i declare that it costs me not one single pang to think that he will lose everything let the wretch who has made me suffer so much go back to the gutterhis native slime stop stop my dear madam remember in adopting the boy you undertook to look after him every year that you have had him has increased your responsibilities you owe it to him that since he was brought up as sir humphreys son you must make him sir humphreys heir in other words whatever happens you must not let him suffer in fortune lady woodroffe was silent do you understand what i mean you adopted him he is yours it is not his fault that he is yours he may be robbed of his father by this discovery he cannot be robbed of his education and of the ideas which belong to your position he may have to recognize for his father a most unworthy shameful man instead of a most honourable man selfishcallousas he may be that will surely be misery enough he must not at the same time be deserted by the woman who adopted him i dont care i tell you what becomes of him she replied sullenly then madam i retire he rose as if about to carry the threat into execution here is your confession he threw it on the table use it as you please i am free to speak as i please and things must take their own course he moved towards the door ohshe flung out her armsdo what you pleasesay what you please the one thing that remains is to soften the blow if that is possible do you wish me to attempt that task soft or hard i care nothing only for heavens sake take away that wretched boythat living fraudthat impostor who made him an impostor it is not humphrey that is a living fraud it is yourselfyourself lady woodroffe he repeated sternly and i am your accomplice well take him out of my sight his footstep is like a knife in my side i could shriek even to hear his voice oh doctor doctorher own voice sank to a moanif i could tell youoh if i could only tell youhow i have always hated the boy take him backthe gutter brattake him back to that creature his mother he is worthy of her sir robert sat down again and took her hand in his dear ladyhis voice was soft and soothing and yet commanding his hand was large and comforting yet strong his eyes were kindly yet masterfulyour position is very trying you want rest in an hour or two i hope we shall settle this business then you will be easy in your mind again come i shall send you news that will be worth the whole pharmacopoeia if i know the heart of woman she burst again into sobs and tears oh if you knewif you knew yes i know now i am going you will be better when i am gone once there were two mothers he murmured in the parable he looked down upon her bowed head one thought of herselfthe other i go to see the other on the stairs he met humphrey sir robert been to see my mother shes not ill i hope best not go to her just now she is a little troubled about herself nothing serious i hope he spoke with the cold show of interest in which one might speak of a servant anything may become serious but we will hope that in this case come into my room for a moment if you can spare the time he led the way to his study i want to ask you about a man i met at your housethat fellow with the money who says he was a gardener once and looks it still what about him hes been here he called here the other day sat half an hoursaid he wasnt used to my kind of conversation well he isntis he i dare say not but as we dont regulate our discourse by the acquirements of gardeners it doesnt matter however i asked him what he came for and hinted that i wasnt going to take any shares if that was what he wanted then he began to talk conundrums what did he tell you told me nothing hinted that there was a lot that i ought to know he didnt give you any hint of what that was no why i thought that you who know everything might know what he meant my young friend i learn a good deal about the private affairs of many people they remain private affairs very good this fellow seemed mad he informed me among other things that he was no relation of mine unnecessary quite so then he began to speak in high terms of my mother for which i ought to have kicked him of your mother then he said that if i followed the wishes of my mother there would be any amount of money for me that was to come after i learned the truth what is the truth how am i to know what he meant perhaps he called on the wrong woodroffe theres another man of your name you knowrichard woodroffe i know little cad perhaps that may explain the whole thing it never does to treat those outsiders as if they were gentlemen born does it once in the gutter always in the gutter eh i dont know look here sir robert you come here a good deal my mother says she knew you years ago very slightly well theres something going on shes miserable i had hints from mollyfrom a girlas well as this gardener fellowthat theres something going on is it a smash has my mother chucked her fortune the girl said something about losing everything i cant get my mother to attend to business and i must have some money soon youre a man of the world sir robert theres a row on you know another why man i hear you were engaged to miss woodroffe and to miss pennefather at the same time there are the materials for a pretty row is there another well if my mother has got into a mess i was thinking that it might be as well to make it up with molly and stand in with the gardener and get as much as i can out of him perhapsperhaps he considered a little look here sir humphrey i am on my way to see mrs haveril be heredont go awayi shall come back in an hour or two with something to tell you chapter xxvi the second mother when we are waiting for the call to do somethingto say somethingof cardinal importance something that will affect the whole of our life all that remains of it when we are uncertain what will happen after or before we have said or done that something then the very air round us is charged with the uncertainty of the time even the hall and the staircase of the htel mtropole when molly entered that humble guesthouse seemed trembling with anxiety her cousins rooms were laden with anxiety as with electricity come in molly said alice no i am not any better i try to rest but i cannot i keep saying to myself i shall get my son back i shall get my son back how long shall i have to wait i hopetomorrow dick has prepared a way to tell him will he be ready to go away with his own mother to america do you think molly dear perhaps but you must remember he has his own friends and his own occupations and we dont know yet he will be gladoh how gladto get his true mother back hes a handsome boy isnt he molly as tall as his fatherdick isnt nearly so talland stout and strong like my family hes like cousin charles dont tell him so alice why not his face is his fathersand his voice oh molly will he come tomorrow dick was going to send his letter tomorrow her heart sank as she thought of the contents of that letter which would reach its destination not as a peaceoffering or a message of love at all the poor mother would her son fly to her arms on the wings of affection their discourse was interrupted or divertedthere was but one topic possible that dayby the arrival of sir robert steele as a skilful diplomatist he began with the second of the two mothers where the first ended that is to say he sat down beside her took her hand in his and held it talking in a soft persuasive voice we are such oldold friends dear lady he beganfriends of four and twenty yearsthat i have taken a great liberty that isi am sure you will forgive mei have consented to act as ambassador on a delicate mission he comes from lady woodroffe thought molly or perhaps from humphrey yes the doctor went on his voice being like the melodious cooing of the stockdoveyes as a friend of the past i thought you would forgive this interference things have changed with both of us since that time have they not i was then at the bottom of the professioni am now at the top i was then a sixpenny doctorfill your own bottle with physic you know with a red lamp and a dispensary open from six to ten every evening now i am what you know you are a great ladyricha leader i am sure you sometimes think that not more than others we deserve i do doctor constantly but the loss of my boy has poisoned everything yet now i hope now i promise and assure you this daythis evening she fell back on her pillow i will not let you see him he said unless you keep calm dont agitate yourself shall i go on will you keep as quiet as possible now ive got a great deal to say lie downso we must remember our present position and what we owe to ourselves think of that there are three of us concerned oh cried molly then you own it at last first there is lady woodroffe exposure of this business will ruin that lady she deserves to be ruined said molly because she has taken a poor child and brought it up in luxury let us not inflame the situation by hard words i dont wish to be hard on her said alice but she said my babyclothes were hers forgive her mrs haveril we must all forgive before i leave you today i must take your forgiveness with me oh sir robert said molly she will forgive you too if you restore her son as for myself the second of the three it will be a pleasing thing for the world to read and for me to confess that i was the person who found the child and arranged the bargain and that afterwards when i discovered that for adoption i must read substitution i held my tongue until proofs had been discovered which rendered further silence impossible i am an expresident of the college of physicians i am a fellow of the royal society i have written learned works on points of pathology i am a leader in practice i am a kcb it will be a very delightful exposure for me will it not well said molly but you might have told us when you found it out as for yourself my dear madam i believe that in the states they are curious about rich people they just want to know even what you eat and drink then consideryou mustthe effect upon your own reputation which will be produced when you have to confess that you sold your childsold it is an ugly word is it notsold your child for fifty pounds why should the story come to light at all asked molly there are secrets in most families in my position i learn many i certainly considered this as one of them the only reason why this must come to light is that the young man must lay down his title his name fortunately remains unchanged who cares for a title asked molly you would young lady if you had one an hereditary title however cannot be laid down at will it belongs to a manto his father to his eldest son to lay it down would require explanation and there is no other explanation possible except onethat the man is not the son of his putative father doctor said alice i dont care what the world says i shall not listen to what the world says i want my boy very well you shall have your boy if you like but we must have a little talk first about himabout your son ah my son now dear lady i want all your sympathy he pressed her hand again your sympathy and your affection and your selfdenial even your selfeffacement i have to call upon all these estimable qualities i have to ask of your most sacred affectionyour maternal affectiona selfsacrifice of the highest the most noble the most generous kind he looked into his patients eyes as yet there was no mesmeric response alice was only wondering what all this talk meant if there was any other expression in her eyes it was the hungry look of a mother bereft of her children the doctor let her hand drop i shall succeed he said of that i have no doubt but i fear my own power of presenting the case with the force which it demands he then with as much emphasis as if he were on the stage produced a manuscript from his pocket and unfolded it with an eye to effect i received this he said half an hour ago it is lady woodroffes confession it was written in the dead of nightlast night if the imagination of the writer can be trusted it was written by order of her dead husband who stood beside her while she wrote the intensity of feeling with which it was written is proved by that belief ghosts said molly contemptuously stuff with her ghosts my dear young ladythe doctor felt that his ghostly machinery had failedwill you kindly not interrupt i am speaking with mrs haveril on a subject which is more important to all concerned than you can understand pray do not interrupt but the impression which might have been produced by the vision of the dead husband was ruined by that interruption if a ghost does not produce his impression at the outset he never does alice received the confession coldly am i to read it she asked she opened it and read it through what it contained we know very well it was written quite simply stating the plain facts without comment the concluding words were as follows my husband never had the least suspicion the boys real nature which is selfish and callous and heartless did not reveal itself to him to me it was almost from the outset painfully apparent he is so entirely in every respect the opposite of his supposed father that i have sometimes trembled lest a suspicion should arise for my own part i confess that i have never felt the least tenderness or affection for the boy it has been a continual pain to me that i had to pretend any so far as that is concerned i shall be much relieved when i have to pretend no more whatever steps may be taken by his real mother they will at least rid me of a continual and living reproach i do not know how much affection and gratitude his real mother may expect from such a son in return for depriving him of his family and his position and exchanging his cousins in the house of lords for relations with the gutter i wish her however joy and happiness from his love and gratitude molly dear said alice the woman confesses she took the child and passed it off upon the world for her own what do you say now doctor if necessary i am ready to acknowledge publicly that lady woodroffe is the person who bought your child however when you came to me about it i did not know that fact i found it out afterwards by a remarkable chance but she confesses which is all that you desire she confesses nowat last oh molly i shall get back the boy he will be my own son againnot that horrible womans son any more oh my own son my own son the other mother the doctor murmured molly heard him but understood not what he meant will you dear madam read the latter part of the document once more that part of it beginning my husband never had any suspicion perhaps miss molly will read it aloud molly did so as she read it she understood the meaning of these words the other mother she thought of humphrey with his cold disdainful eyes his shrinking from display his pride of birth his contempt of the common herd and of this warm motherly heart natural and spontaneous careless of form and reticence which was waiting for him and her heart sank for pity the sham mother glad at last to get rid of the pretence her own lover dick eager to pull down the pretender and full of revenge the pretender himself maddened with rage and shame and the poor mother longing in vain for one word of tenderness and kindness mollys heart sank low with pity what tenderness what kindness would humphrey have for the mother who had come to deprive him of everything that he valued i have come here this afternoon the doctor went on as a friend of both mothers on the part of lady woodroffe i have absolutely nothing to propose she puts the case unreservedly in your hands whatever steps you take she will accept it remains therefore for you madam to do what you think best i want my boy she repeated doggedly so long as i get him i dont care what happens that is of course the one feeling which underlies everything i will if you like see him in your name dick was going to write to him as the son of anthony woodroffe said molly i know his proposals we have to consider however the possible effect which the discovery of the truth will produce upon this unfortunatemost unfortunateyoung man why is he unfortunate asked his mother jealously he will be restored to his own mother i am going to tell you why meantime you will agree with me that it is most important that the communication of the truth must not embitter this young man at the outset against his mother no no he must not be set against me quite so dick proposes i understand to address a letter to him as the son of the late mr anthony woodroffebetter known as john anthonyand inviting him to pay certain liabilities as to the wisdom of that step i have no doubt it can produce no other effect than to fill him with rage and bitterness against all concerned allevery onewithout exception he shook a warning finger at one after the other but he must know said molly perhaps in that case the subject must be approached with the greatest delicacy dicks method is to begin with a bludgeon we must think of his mother first said molly we have been working all along for his mother my dear young lady you do not understand the situation because we must think first of his mother and for no other reason we must advance with caution had we not to consider the mother there would be no reason for delicacy at all and now if you will not interrupt i will go on the warning was now necessary because the time had arrived for the final appeal if that failed anything might happen we must consider dear madam the character in the first place of your son and in the next place the conditions of his education and position as regards his character he has inherited the artistic nature of his father to begin with that is shown in everything he does in his music and musical composition i have heard him sing a song of his own composition said molly it had neither meaning nor melody he said that it only appealed to the higher culture once morebut he spoke in vaini say then that he has inherited his fathers artistic nature he sings and plays he paints landscapes of impossible colour said molly and writes verses he has a fine taste in the newer arts such as decoration bookbinding furniture and champagne all these qualities he inherits from his father with i imagine a certain impatience which when opinions differ also i expect distinguished his father from his mother he seems to inherit if i may say so in her presence tenacity which may become obstinacy and strong convictions or feelings which may possibly degenerate into prejudice his mothers softer qualitiesher depth of affection her warm sympathieswill doubtless come to the front when his nature still partly undeveloped receives its final moulding under the hands of love all this was very prettily put and presented the subject in an engaging light molly however shook her head incredulous as one who ought to know if any one could know what had been the outcome of that final moulding under the hands of love this is his character the doctor went on blandly this is the present character as it has been developed from the raw material which we handed over to lady woodroffe four and twenty years ago next consider his education why asked his mother hasnt he had his schooling more schooling than you think he has been taught that his father was a most distinguished indian officer in whom his son could take the greatest pride that his mother belonged to an ancient scotch family his grandfather being the thirteenth baron and his uncle the fourteenth he was taught that there is no inheritance so valuable as that of ancient family as a child he imbibed a pride of birth which is almost a religion indeed i doubt if he has any other his school education and his associates helped him to consider himself as belonging to a superior caste and the rest of the world as outsiders this prejudice is now rooted in him if he had to abandon this belief but he must abandon it said molly tomorrow he becomes an outsider when you parted with your boy you gave him without knowing what you were doing statesmen and captains great lords and barons that belong to history even kings and queens for ancestors now without warninghow could one warn a young man of such a thingyou suddenly rob him of all these possessions you give him for a father a worthless scoundrel to use plain languagea man whose record is horrible and shameful a deceiver and deserter of women a lowclass buffoon a fellow who met with the end which he deserved in a workhouse after a final exhibition of himself as a sandwichman at one and twopence a day the mere thought of such a father is enough to reduce this unfortunate young man to madness and for other relations i repeat you offer him in place of his present cousins who are gentlefolk of ancient birth with all that belongs to that possession such humbleperhaps such unworthypeople as dick sums up under such titles as the pewopener the small draper and the mendicant bankrupt can you imagine humphrey with his pride of birth calling upon the hackney draper and taking tea with the pewopener they are my cousins too sir robert said molly and i get along without much trouble about them yours very likely why not he replied impatiently you are used to them you were born to them sir humphrey was not he turned again to alice have you considered these things you must consider themin pity to your sonin pity to yourself alice made no reply your son will be crushed beaten down humiliated to the lowest by this revelation ask yourself how he will reward the people who have caused the discovery will he reward the hand which inflicts this lifelong shameit can be nothing less to himwith affection and gratitudeor finish the question for yourself alice clasped her hands then she rose and bowed her head lord have mercy upon me miserable sinner she murmured molly laid her arm round her waist take me to my room she murmured her room opened out of the sittingroom through the open door sir robert saw her lying rather than kneeling at the bedside her arms thrown upon the counterpane molly stood over her the tears streaming down her cheeks the doctor beckoned the girl to leave her my dearhis own eyes were dim with an unaccustomed blurr he could walk without emotion through a hundred wards filled with suffering bodies but he had never walked the ward of suffering soulsmy dear leave her for a while we are all miserable sinners you and dick with your revengeful thoughts and i and everybody and the greatest sinner is the young man himself i did not think molly sobbed i only thoughtwe only wanted to prove the case it is the old old parable the false mother thinks only of herself the true mother thinks of her son solomon i thank thee the true mother came back doctor do what you willwhat you cani will spare him let things remain exactly as they are he made no answer he gazed upon her with troubled eyes tell me doctor she said what i must do will you do then what i advise if you will only save my son from his mother its a dreadful thing to say doctor i would rather lose the boy altogether than think that he hates and despises his mother when you put the child into my hands when you undertook to make no inquiry after him in the futurethen you lost your child i told you so two months ago when this inquiry began nothing but mischief could come of itmischief and misery and hatred and shame and disappointment this you could not understand now you do she sighed yes i understand our duty is plainto hold our tongues humphrey will remain where he is it is a family secret which will die with us and is hedicks brotherto go on holding the place to which he has no right asked molly there will be no change it is a family secret he repeated a close family secret never to be whispered even among yourselves he must never know said alice yet i must speak to him once i must hold his hand in mine once if you can trust yourself if you can only keep calm then i will bring himthis very afternoon i will go to him you shall tell him briefly that he is like your sonthat is allyour son which was lost you know and remember there will not be the least show of affection from him let sir humphreysir humphrey he must beleave you as he camea changelingwith no suspicion of the fact chapter the last forgiveness alice lay patiently it was done then her punishment was ended she was to see her son for onceonly for once my dear she said my dream will come true i shall see my sonto call him my sonfor onceonly for once and then but there will be nothing left dick came bursting in ive drawn up the case and ive got the advertisements ready if by this time tomorrow the doctor makes no sign i shall act heres the case he drew out a document in foolscap tied with red tapea most imposing document and here are the letters siri beg to inform you that the funeral of your father the late john anthony woodroffe who died yesterday tuesday october th will take place from that institution at twelve oclock on friday your halfbrother mr richard woodroffe has ordered me to convey to you this information i hope hell like that said dick rubbing his hands and here is the second letter siri am requested by mr richard woodroffe to inform you that your father mr john anthony woodroffe has died in debt to a certain mrs welwood widow of a grocer of lisson grove the amount is about he wishes to know whether you are prepared to join him in paying off the liability your obedient servants i hope he will like that said dick and here is the advertisement died on tuesday the th at the marylebone workhouse infirmary john anthony woodroffe father of sir humphrey woodroffe baronet aged i hope he will like that there is something more for you said molly lady woodroffe confesses there is the paper confesses dick snatched the paper and read it through with a hunters sense of disappointment well he said i thought better of her i thought she would die game never trust appearances well this changes these matters instead of sending the letters and the advertisement i shall now go myself with the case and the confession and bring him to his no dick said molly there is to be no shame for him and no humiliation what no shame for him at all he is to be left in ignorance unless he has guessed anything we shall tell him nothing all will go on as before oh molly have we given in with victory assured dont say that you dont understand dick everything is changed it is now lady woodroffe who would spare him nothing it is his mother who would save him from everything dick looked at the pale woman lying on the sofa then he understood and a tear stood in his eye twas a tender heart he went over to the sofa and kissed her forehead forgive me he said oh dick she murmured would to god you were my son as for him he is what they have made him they had made him grumpy and obstinate at that moment the doctor was urging upon him compliance with a simple thing you want me to go to the rooms of the gardener man who insulted me i am to listen to some rubbish about his wife what do i care about his wife i tell you sir robert this is trifling i wont go there tell them so i wont go then sir humphrey i tell you plainly ruin stares you in the face yes the loss of everything in this world that you valueeverything you will lose all i cannot explain what this means but you will have letters tomorrow which will change your whole lifeand all your thoughts they mean i say the loss of everything that you value i dont believe a word you wanted to know what mr haveril meant what your mother meant what miss molly pennefather meant they meant ruinruin and loss of everything sir humphreythat and nothing else tell me more tell me why i shall tell you no more i shall leave it to yourto richard woodroffe whom you love so well he will tell you the young man hesitated what do you want me to do you are to come with me to mrs haverils rooms she will receive you she will make a communication to you whatever she says you are to receive with courtesywith courtesy mind that done you may return and everything will go on as usual you can then forget what you heard are you ready very well if that cad the fiddler is there hark ye sir humphrey if you behave or speak like a cub and a cur i throw you over by the lord i will have no mercy upon you i will tell you myself what it all means now molly waited sitting beside alice who lay with closed eyes perhaps she slept presently john haveril came home molly told him what had happened ay ay he said let him come let alice have her say theyve made a cur of him between them let him come he sat down beside his wife and whispered words of consolation and of soothing they would go home againout of the atmosphere of deception they would be happy once more in their own home on the pacific slope john said alice it was good of you to bring me over on the strength of a dream and a promise of a dreamto give over all your work nay nay lass what is work compared with thee i shall see my son again i have prayed for that i did not pray johni could notfor his lovethat was gone yet i hoped now i must be satisfied only to take his hands in mine we will go home againwe will go home again my dream said nothing about going home again she was silent for a while john she said what was it you were going to tell molly and dick they were all three standing over her why said john alice had a fancybecause she loves you bothto see you join handsso alice laid her thin hands across their joined hands and her lips moved and i was to tell you both that i would not give you a single dollar out of all the pile you are happier without she says and so do i he added it was a strange betrothal with tears in the eyes of both at that moment arrived the doctor with humphrey the young man looked dark and lowering his cheek was flushed he glanced round the room bowed low to alice recognized molly by a cold inclination mr haveril by a nod and dick by a blank stare which did not recognize even his existencethe frequent employment of this mode of salutation had made him greatly beloved by all outsiders ah thought dick if you knew what ive got in my pocket youd change that look mrs haveril said sir robert i have brought you sir humphrey woodroffe at your request i believe you have something to say to him molly dear give sir humphrey a chair near meso i want to tell you sir humphrey of a very strange dream if i may call ita hallucination you may madam said the doctor for the young man sat down in silence which has i fear given your mother a great deal of annoyance i am unfortunately too weak at present to call upon her or to explain to her therefore i have ventured to ask you to be so very kind as to come here so that i may send a message to lady woodroffe i am here said sir humphrey ungraciously i will not take up much of your time i had an illness in america which touched my brain i believe i imagined that a child which i lost twentyfour years ago was still living he was the son of my first husband whose name was woodroffe he was also the father of richard woodroffe here more than that i fancied that one person was that child that person was yourself i fancied that you were the child i had not lost it by death i surrendered it to a lady by adoption humphrey started he changed colour he sat up in his chair he listened eagerly his lip trembled he understands molly whispered no he begins to understand what was meant dick returned he cannot guess the whole yes he understood now that he was face to face with a great danger many things became plain to himmollys words john haverils words sir roberts words he understood the nature of the danger he listened while a horrible terror seized him at the mere prospect of that danger he heard the rest with a sense of relief equalled only by his sense of the danger alice went on i first saw you at the theatre one night you were so much like my husband that i concluded that you must be my son i met you at sir roberts i became certain that you were my son we made inquiries please tell him sir robert these inquiries said the doctor proved certain things which were curious and interesting i may confess that they seemed to point in your direction this lady became too hastily convinced that they did so she is now as firmly convinced that they did not humphrey sighed deeply it was an awkward case sir robert went onone that required tact i gave a great deal of troublealice took up the wondrous tale again but it is all over now the doctor added do not talk too much yes all over my bodily frame is weak but my mind is clear again now sir humphrey i wish you if you will be so kind to go to lady woodroffe and tell her from me that the hallucination has passed away and give her my regrets that i disturbed her sir robert will perhaps go with you to make the explanation clearer because he knows all the details i will certainly call upon lady woodroffe this evening said the doctor indeed sir humphrey is ignorant of certain facts connected with the case which will probably incline lady woodroffe to forgive and excuse the more readily will you do this sir humphrey asked mrs haveril yes if thats all he replied hoarsely is that all was it as you say hallucination are you quite certain the doctor felt his patients pulse all hallucination he replied now please finish this interview as soon as you can i want sir humphrey to give me his own forgiveness if there were anything to forgive since there is nothing said the doctor sternly you can even more readily go through the form well if you wish it humphrey held out his hand tell her man said the doctor impatientlytell her what she wants since you desire ithumphrey obeyed coldly and reluctantlyi forgive you will that do alice raised her head she pushed back her hair with her left hand molly held her up she gazed upon her sons face it was cold and hard and pitiless she stooped over her sons hand it was cold and hard and seemed as pitiless as his facethere was no warmth nor impression in the hand she bent her head and kissed it her tears fell upon ither silent tears humphrey withdrew his hand he looked round as if asking what next dick went to the door and pointed to the stairs holding the door open alice lay back on the pillow the doctor took her wrist again doctor she whispered i have never wholly lost my boy till now her eyes closed her cheek grew white the doctor laid down her hand never he said till now the end printed by william clowes and sons limited london and beccles
