and the online distributed proofreading team at httpswwwpgdpnet in luck at last by walter besant new york george munros sons publishers to vandewater street chapter i within three weeks if everyone were allowed beforehand to choose and select for himself the most pleasant method of performing this earthly pilgrimage there would be i have always thought an immediate run upon that way of getting to the delectable mountains which is known as the craft and mystery of secondhand bookselling if further one were allowed to select and arrange the minor detailssuch for instance as the pitch and the character of the shop it would seem desirable that as regards the latter the kind of bookselling should be neither too lofty nor too meanthat is to say that ones ambition would not aspire to a great collectors establishment such as one or two we might name in piccadilly the haymarket or new bond street these should be left to those who greatly dare and are prepared to play the games of speculation and of patience nor on the other hand would one choose an open cart at the beginning of the whitechapel road or one of the shops in seven dials whose stockintrade consists wholly of three or four boxes outside the door filled with odd volumes at twopence apiece as for pitch or situation one would wish it to be somewhat retired but not too much one would not for instance willingly be thrown away in hoxton nor would one languish in the obscurity of kentish town a secondhand bookseller must not be so far removed from the haunts of men as to place him practically beyond the reach of the collector nor on the other hand should he be planted in a busy thoroughfarethe noise of many vehicles the hurry of quick footsteps the swift current of anxious humanity are out of harmony with the atmosphere of a secondhand bookshop some suggestion of external repose is absolutely necessary there must be some stillness in the air yet the thing itself belongs essentially to the cityno one can imagine a secondhand bookshop beside green fieldsso that there should be some murmur and perceptible hum of mankind always present in the ear thus there are halfadozen bookshops in king william street strand which seem to enjoy every possible advantage of position for they are in the very heart of london but yet are not exposed to the full noise and tumult of that overflowing tide which surges round charing cross again there are streets north of holborn and oxford street most pleasantly situated for the secondhand bookseller and there are streets where he ought not to be where he has no business and where his presence jars could we for instance endure to see the shop of a secondhand bookseller established in cheapside perhaps however the most delightful spot in all london for a secondhand bookshop is that occupied by emblems in the kings road chelsea it stands at the lower end of the road where one begins to realize and thoroughly feel the influences of that ancient and lordly suburb at this end of the road there are rows of houses with oldfashioned balconies right and left of it there are streets which in the summer and early autumn are green yellow red and golden with their masses of creepers squares which look as if with the people living in them they must belong to the year eighteen hundred neither a day before nor a day after they lie open to the road with their gardens full of trees cheyne walk and the old church with its redbrick tower and the new embankment are all so close that they seem part and parcel of the kings road the great hospital is within five minutes walk and sometimes the honest veterans themselves may be seen wandering in the road the air is heavy with associations and memories you can actually smell the fragrance of the newmade chelsea buns fresh from the oven just as you would a hundred years ago you may sit with dainty damsels all hoops and furbelows eating custards at the bunhouse you may wander among the rare plants of the botanic gardens the old great houses rise shadowy and magnificent above the modern terraces don salteros coffeehouse yet opens its hospitable doors sir thomas more meditates again on cheyne walk at dead of night the ghosts of ancient minuet tunes may be heard from the rotunda of ranelagh gardens though the new barracks stand upon its site and along the modern streets you may fancy that if you saw the ladies with their hoop petticoats and the gentlemen with their wigs and their threecornered hats and swords you would not be in the least astonished emblems is one of two or three shops which stand together but it differs from its neighbors in many important particulars for it has no plateglass as the others have nor does it stand like them with open doors nor does it flare away gas at night nor is it bright with gilding and fresh paint nor does it seek to attract notice by posters and bills on the contrary it retains the old small and unpretending panes of glass which it has always had in the evening it is dimly lighted and it closes early its door is always shut and although the name over the shop is dingy one feels that a coat of paint while it would certainly freshen up the place would take something from its character for a secondhand bookseller who respects himself must present an exterior which has something of faded splendor of worn paint and shabbiness within the shop books line the walls and cumber the floor there are an outer and an inner shop in the former a small table stands among the books at which mr james the assistant is always at work cataloguing when he is not tying up parcels sometimes even with gum and paste repairing the slighter ravages of timefoxed bindings and closecut margins no man can repair in the latter which is mr emblems sanctum there are chairs and a table also covered with books a writingdesk a small safe and a glass case wherein are secured the more costly books in stock emblems as must be confessed is no longer quite what it was in former days twenty thirty or forty years ago that glass case was filled with precious treasures in those days if a man wanted a book of county history or of genealogy or of heraldry he knew where was his best chance of finding it for emblems in its prime and heyday had its specialty other books treating on more frivolous subjects such as science belles lettres art or politics he would consider buy and sell again but he took little pride in them collectors of county histories however and genealogyhunters and their kind knew that at emblems where they would be most likely to get what they wanted they would have to pay the market price for it there is no patience like the patience of a bookcollector there is no such industry given to any work comparable with the thoughtful and anxious industry with which he peruses the latest catalogues there is no care like unto that which rends his mind before the day of auction or while he is still trying to pick up a bargain there are no eyes so sharp as those which pry into the contents of a box full of old books tumbled together at sixpence apiece the bookseller himself partakes of the noble enthusiasm of the collector though he sells his collection like the amateur the professional moves heaven and earth to get a bargain like him he rejoices as much over a book which has been picked up below its price as over a lost sheep which has returned into the fold but emblem is now old and emblems shop is no longer what it was to the collector of the last generation it was an afternoon in late september and in this very year of grace eighteen hundred and eightyfour the day was as sunny and warm as any of the days of its predecessor augustus the gorgeous but yet there was an autumnal feeling in the air which made itself felt even in streets where there were no red and yellow virginia creepers no square gardens with long trails of mignonette and banks of flowering nasturtiums in fact you cannot anywhere escape the autumnal feeling which begins about the middle of september it makes old people think with sadness that the grasshopper is a burden in the land and that the almondtree is about to flourish but the young it fills with a vinous and intoxicated rejoicing as if the time of feasting fruits harvests and young wine strong and fruity was upon the world it made mr jameshis surname has never been ascertained but man and boy mr james has been at emblems for twentyfive years and moreleave his table where he was preparing the forthcoming catalogue and go to the open door where he wasted a good minute and a half in gazing up at the clear sky and down the sunny street then he stretched his arms and returned to his work impelled by the sense of duty rather than by the scourge of necessity because there was no hurry about the catalogue and most of the books in it were rubbish and at that season of the year few customers could be expected and there were no parcels to tie up and send out he went back to his work therefore but he left the door partly open in order to enjoy the sight of the warm sunshine now for emblems to have its door open was much as if mr emblem himself should so far forget his selfrespect as to sit in his shirtsleeves the shop had been rather dark the window being full of books but now through the open door there poured a little stream of sunshine reflected from some far off window it fell upon a row of old eighteenth century volumes bound in dark and rusty leather and did so light up and glorify the dingy bindings and faded gold that they seemed fresh from the binders hands and just ready for the noble purchaser long since dead and gone whose book plate they bore some of this golden stream fell also upon the head of the assistantit was a red head with fiery red eyes red eyebrows bristly and thick and sharp thin features to matchand it gave him the look of one who is dragged unwillingly into the sunlight however mr james took no notice of the sunshine and went on with his cataloguing almost as if he liked that kind of work there are many people who seem to like dull work and they would not be a bit more unhappy if they were made to take the place of sisyphus or transformed into the damsels who are condemned to toil continually at the weary work of pouring water into a sieve perhaps sisyphus does not so much mind the continual going up and down hill after all he might say this is better than the lot of poor ixion at all events i have got my limbs free ixion on the other hand no doubt is full of pity for his poor friend sisyphus i at least he says have no work to do and the rapid motion of the wheel is in sultry weather sometimes pleasant behind the shop where had been originally the back parlor in the days when every genteel house in chelsea had both its front and back parlorthe latter for sitting and living in the former for the reception of companysat this afternoon the proprietor the man whose name had stood above the shop for fifty years the original and only emblem he wasnay he isfor you may still find him in his place and may make his acquaintance over a county history any day in the kings roadhe is an old man now advanced in the seventies who was born before the battle of waterloo was fought and can remember chelsea when it was full of veterans wounded in battles fought long before the corsican attila was let loose upon the world his face wears the peaceful and wise expression which belongs peculiarly to his profession other callings make a man look peaceful but not all other callings make him look wise mr emblem was born by nature of a calm temperamentotherwise he would not have been happy in his business a smile lies generally upon his lips and his eyes are soft and benign his hair is white and his face once ruddy is pale yet not shrunk and seamed with furrows as happens to so many old men but round and firm like his chin and lips it is clean shaven he wears a black coat extraordinarily shiny in the sleeve and a black silk stock just as he used to wear in the thirties when he was young and something of a dandy and would show himself on a saturday evening in the pit of drury lane and the stock is fastened behind with a silver buckle he is in fact a delightful old gentleman to look at and pleasant to converse with and on his brow every one who can read may see visibly stamped the seal of a harmless and honest life at the contemplation of such a man ones opinion of humanity is sensibly raised and even houseagents plumbers and suburban builders feel that after all virtue may bring with it some reward the quiet and warmth of the afternoon unbroken to his accustomed ear as it would be to a stranger by the murmurous roll of london made him sleepy in his hand he held a letter which he had been reading for the hundredth time and of which he knew by heart every word and as his eyes closed he went back in imagination to a passage in the past which it recalled he stood in imagination upon the deck of a sailingshipan emigrant ship the year was eighteen hundred and sixtyfour a year when very few were tempted to try their fortunes in a country torn by civil war with him were his daughter and his soninlaw and they were come to bid the latter farewell my dearmy dear cried the wife in her husbands arms come what may i will join you in a year her husband shook his head sadly they do not want me here he said the work goes into stronger and rougher hands perhaps over there we may get on better and besides it seems an opening if the kind of work which he wanted was given to stronger and rougher hands than his in england far more would it be the case in young and rough america it was journalistic workwriting workthat he wanted and he was a gentleman a scholar and a creature of retired and refined tastes and manners there are perhaps some still living who have survived the tempestuous life of the ordinary fleet street newspaper man of twenty or thirty years ago perhaps one or two among these remember claude aglenbut he was so short a time with them that it is not likely those who do remember him will understand that the way to success rough and thorny for all for such as aglen was impossible but you will think every day of little iris said his wife oh my dear if i were only going with you and but for me you would be at home with your father well and happy then in his dream which was also a memory the old man saw how the young husband kissed and comforted his wife my dear said claude if it were not for you what happiness could i have in the world courage my wife courage and hope i shall think of you and iris all day and all night until we meet again and so they parted and the ship sailed away the old man opened his eyes and looked about him it was a dream it was twenty years ago he said and iris was a baby in arms twenty years ago and he never saw his wife again never again because she died he added after a pause my alice died he shed no tears being so old that the time of tears was wellnigh pastat seventyfive the eyes are drier than at forty and one is no longer surprised or disappointed and seldom even angry whatever happens but he opened the letter in his hand and read it again mechanically it was written on thin foreign paper and the creases of the folds had become gaping rents it was dated september just eighteen years back when you read these lines the letter said i shall be in the silent land whither alice my wife has gone before me it would be a strange thing only to think upon this journey which lies before me and which i must take alone had i time left for thinking but i have not i may last a week or i may die in a few hours therefore to the point in one small thing we deceived you alice and imy name is not aglen at all we took that name for certain reasons perhaps we were wrong but we thought that as we were quite poor and likely to remain poor it would be well to keep our secret to ourselves forgive us both this suppression of the truth we were made poor by our own voluntary act and deed and because i married the only woman i loved i was engaged to a girl whom i did not love we had been brought up like brother and sister together but i did not love her though i was engaged to her in breaking this engagement i angered my father in marrying alice i angered him still more i now know that he has forgiven me he forgave me on his deathbed he revoked his former will and made me his sole heirjust as if nothing had happened to destroy his old affectionsubject to one conditionviz that the girl to whom i was first engaged should receive the whole income until i or my heirs should return to england in order to claim the inheritance it is strange i die in a wooden shanty in a little western town the editor of a miserable little country paper i have not money enough even to bury me and yet if i were at home i might be called a rich man as men go my little iris will be an heiress at the very moment when i learn that i am my fathers heir i am struck down by fever and now i know that i shall never get up again it is strange yet my father sent me his forgiveness and my wife is dead and the wealth that has come is useless to me wherefore nothing now matters much to me and i know that you will hold my last wishes sacred i desire that iris shall be educated as well and thoroughly as you can afford keep her free from rough and rude companions make her understand that her father was a gentleman of ancient family this knowledge will perhaps help to give her selfrespect if any misfortune should fall upon you such as the loss of health or wealth give the papers inclosed to a trustworthy solicitor and bid him act as is best in the interests of iris if as i hope all will go well with you do not open the papers until my childs twentyfirst birthday do not let her know until then that she is going to be rich on her twentyfirst birthday open the papers and bid her claim her own to the woman i wrongedi know not whether she has married or notbid iris carry my last message of sorrow at what has happened i do not regret and i have never regretted that i married alice but i gave her pain for which i have never ceased to grieve i have been punished for this breach of faith you will find among the papers an account of all the circumstances connected with this engagement there is also in the packet my portrait taken when i was a lad of sixteen give her that as well there is the certificate of my marriage my register of baptism that of iriss baptism my signet ring his armsthe old man interrupted his readinghis arms were quarterly first and fourth two roses and a boars head erect second and third gules and fesse betweenbetweenbut i cannot remember what it was between he went on reading my fathers last letter to me alices letters and one or two from yourself if iris should unhappily die before her twentyfirst birthday open these papers find out from them the owners name and address seek her out and tell her that she will never now be disturbed by any claimants to the estate the letter ended here abruptly as if the writer had designed to add more but was prevented by death for there was a postscript in another hand which stated mr aglen died november th and is buried in the cemetery of johnson city ill the old man folded the letter carefully and laid it on the table then he rose and walked across the room to the safe which stood with open door in the corner furthest from the fireplace among its contents was a packet sealed and tied up in red tape endorsed for iris to be given to her on her twentyfirst birthday from her father it will be her twentyfirst birthday he said in three weeks then i must give her the packet sosowith the portrait of her father and his marriagecertificate he fell into a fit of musing with the papers in his hand she will be safe whatever happens to me and as for me if i lose herof course i shall lose her why what will it matter have i not lost all except iris one must not be selfish oh iris what a surprisewhat a surprise i have in store for you he placed the letter he had been reading within the tape which fastened the bundle so that it should form a part of the communication to be made on iriss birthday there he said now i shall read this letter no more i wonder how many times i have read it in the last eighteen years and how often i have wondered what the childs fortune would be in three weeksin three short weeks oh iris if you only knew he put back the letters and the packet locked the safe and resumed his seat the redeyed assistant still gumming and pasting his slips with punctilious regard to duty had been following his masters movements with curiosity counting his investments again as usual mr james murmured ah and adding em up always at it oh what a trade it must have been once just then there appeared in the door a gentleman he was quite shabby and even ragged in his dress but he was clearly a gentleman he was no longer young his shoulders were bent and he had the unmistakable stamp and carriage of a student guvnors at home said the assistant briefly the visitor walked into the sanctum he had under his arm halfadozen volumes which without a word he laid before mr emblem and untied the string you ought to know this book he said without further introduction mr emblem looked doubtfully at the visitor you sold it to me twentyfive years ago he went on for five pounds i did and i remember now you are mr frank farrar why it is twentyfive years ago i have bought no more books for twenty years and more he replied sadsad dear metut tutbought no books and you mr farrar once my best customer and nowyou do not mean to say that you are going to sellthat you actually want to sellthis precious book i am selling one by one all my books replied the other with a sigh i am going down hill emblem fast oh dear dear replied the bookseller this is very sad one cannot bear to think of the libraries being dispersed and sold off and now yours mr farrar really yours must it be needs must mr farrar said with a sickly smile needs must when the devil drives i have parted with half my books already but i thought you might like to have this set because they were once your own so i shouldmr emblem laid a loving hand upon the volumesso i should mr farrar but not from you not from you sir why you were almost my best customeri think almost my very bestthirty years ago when my trade was better than it is now yes you gave me five poundsor was it five pounds tenfor this very work and it is worth twelve pounds nowi assure you it is worth twelve pounds if it is worth a penny will you give me ten pounds for it then cried the other eagerly i want the money badly no i cant but i will send you to a man who can and will i do not speculate now i never go to auctions i am old you see besides i am poor i will not buy your book but i will send you to a man who will give you ten pounds for it i am sure and then he will sell it for fifteen he wrote the address on a slip of paper why mr farrar if an old friend so to speak can put the question why in the world the most natural thing replied mr farrar with a cold laugh i am old as i told you and the younger men get all the work that is all nobody wants a genealogist and antiquary dear me dear me why mr farrar i remember now you used to know my poor soninlaw who is dead eighteen years since i was just reading the last letter he ever wrote to me just before he died you used to come here and sit with him in the evening i remember now so you did thank you for your good will said mr farrar yes i remember your soninlaw i knew him before his marriage did you before his marriage then he was going to add then you can tell me his real name but he paused because it is a pity ever to acknowledge ignorance and especially ignorance in such elementary matters as your soninlaws name so mr emblem checked himself he ought to have been a rich man mr farrar continued but he quarreled with his father who cut him off with a shilling i suppose then the poor scholar who could find no market for his learned papers tied up his books again and went away with hanging head ugh mr james who had been listening groaned as mr farrar passed through the door ugh call that a way of doing business why if it had been me id have bought the book off of that old chap for a couple o pounds i would ay or a sov so seedy he is and wants money so bad and i know whod have given twelve pound for it in the trade too call that carrying on business he may well add up his investments every day it he can afford to chuck such chances ah but hell retire soon his fiery eyes brightened and his face glowed with the joy of anticipation he must retire before long there came another visitor this time it was a lanky boy with a blue bag over his shoulder and a notebook and pencilstump in his hand he nodded to the assistant as to an old friend with whom one may be at ease set down his bag opened his notebook and nibbled his stump then he read aloud with a comma or semicolon between each a dozen or twenty titles they were the names of the books which his employer wished to pick up the redeyed assistant listened and shook his head then the boy without another word shouldered his bag and departed on his way to the next secondhand bookshop he was followed at a decent interval by another caller this time it was an old gentleman who opened the door put in his head and looked about him with a quick and suspicious glance at sight of the assistant he nodded and smiled in the most friendly way possible and came in goodmorning mr james goodmorning my friend splendid weather pray dont disturb yourself i am just having a look roundonly a look round you know dont move mr james he addressed mr james but he was looking at the shelves as he spoke and with the habit of a bookhunter taking down the volumes looking at the titlepages and replacing them under his arm he carried a single volume in old leather binding mr james nodded his head but did disturb himself in fact he rose with a scowl upon his face and followed this polite old gentlemen all round the shop placing himself close to his elbow one might almost suppose that he suspected him so close and assiduous was his assistance but the visitor accepting these attentions as if they were customary and the result of high breeding went slowly round the shelves taking down book after book but buying none presently he smiled again and said that he must be moving on and very politely thanked mr james for his kindness nowhere he was so good as to say does one get so much personal kindness and attention as at emblems goodmorning mr james goodmorning my friend mr james grunted and closed the door after him ugh he said with disgust i know you i know your likes want to make your set completeeh want to sneak one of our books to do it with dont you ah he looked into the back shop before he returned to his paste and his slips that was mr potts the great queen anne collector sir most notorious booksnatcher in all london and the most barefaced wanted our fourth volume of the athenian oracle i saw his eyes reached out this way and that way and always resting on that volume i saw him edging along to the shelf got another odd volume just like it in his wicked old hand ready to change it when i wasnt looking ah said mr emblem waking up from his dream of iris and her fathers letter ah they will try it on keep your eyes open james no thanks as usual grumbled mr james as he returned to his gum and his scissors might as well have left him to snatch the book here however james was wrong because it is the first duty of an assistant to hinder and obstruct the booksnatcher who carries on his work by methods of crafty and fraudulent exchange rather than by plain theft which is a mere brutal way for first the booksnatcher marks his prey he finds the shop which has a set containing the volume which is missing in his own set next he arms himself with a volume which closely resembles the one he covets and then on pretense of turning over the leaves he watches his opportunity to effect an exchange and goes away rejoicing his set complete no collector as is very well known whether of books coins pictures medals fans scarabs bookplates autographs stamps or anything else has any conscience at all anybody can cut out slips and make a catalogue but it requires a sharp assistant with eyes all over his head like a spider to be always on guard against this felonious and unscrupulous collector next there came two schoolboys together who asked for and bought a crib to virgil and then a girl who wanted some cheap french readingbook just as the clock began to strike five mr emblem lifted his head and looked up the shopdoor opened and there stepped in rubbing his shoes on the mat as if he belonged to the house an elderly gentleman of somewhat singular appearance he wore a fez cap but was otherwise dressed as an englishmanin black frock coat that is buttoned upexcept that his feet were incased in black cloth shoes so that he went noiselessly his hair was short and white and he wore a small white beard his skin was a rather dark brown he was in fact a hindoo and his name was lala roy he nodded gravely to mr james and walked into the back shop it goes well he asked with the buying and the selling surely lala surely a quiet way of buying and selling a way fit for one who meditates said the hindoo looking round tell me my friend what ails the child is she sick the child is well lala her mind wandered this morning she failed to perceive a simple method which i tried to teach her i feared she might be ill she is not ill my friend but i think her mind is troubled she is a woman we are men there is nothing in the world that is able to trouble the mind of the philosopher nothing said mr emblem manfully as if he too was a disciple nothing is there now the stoutness of the assertion was sensibly impaired by the question not poverty which is a shadow nor pain which passes nor the loss of womans love which is a gain nor fall from greatnessnothing nevertheless his eyes did look anxious in spite of his philosophy this trouble of the childwill it soon be over i hope this evening said mr emblem indeed i am sure that it will be finished this evening if the child had a mother or a brother or any protectors but ourselves my friend we might leave her to them but she has nobody except you and me i am glad that she is not ill he left mr emblem and passing through the door of communication between house and shop went noiselessly up the stairs one more visitorunusual for so many to call on a september afternoon this time it was a youngish man of thirty or so who stepped into the shop with an air of business and taking no notice at all of the assistant walked swiftly into the back shop and shut the door behind him i thought so murmured mr james after hes been counting up his investments his lawyer calls more investments mr david chalker was a solicitor and according to his friends who were proud of him a sharp practitioner he was in fact one of those members of the profession who starting with no connection have to make business for themselves this in london they do by encouraging the county court setting neighbors by the ears lending money in small sums fomenting quarrels charging commissions and generally making themselves a blessing and a boon to the district where they reside but chiefly mr chalker occupied himself with lending money now mr emblem he said not in a menacing tone but as one who warns now mr emblem now mr chalker the bookseller repeated mildly what are you going to do for me i got your usual notice the old bookseller began hesitating six months ago of course you did three fifty is the amount three fifty exactly just so but i am afraid i am not prepared to pay off the bill of sale the interest as usual will be ready of course it will but this time the principal must be ready too cant you get another client to find the money no i cant money is tight and your security mr emblem isnt so good as it was the furniture is there and so is the stock furniture wears out as for the stockwho knows what that is worth all your books together may not be worth fifty pounds for what i know then what am i to do find the money yourself come mr emblem everybody knowsyour grandson himself told meall the world knowsyouve been for years saving up for your granddaughter you told joe only six months agoyou cant deny itthat whatever happened to you she would be well off mr emblem did not deny the charge but he ought not to have told this to his grandson of all people in the world as for joe mr chalker went on you are going to do nothing for him i know that but is it business like mr emblem to waste good money which you might have invested for your granddaughter you do not understand mr chalker you really do not and i cannot explain but about this bill of salenever mind my granddaughter you the aforesaid richard emblemmr chalker began to recite without commashave assigned to me david chalker aforesaid his executors administrators and assigns all and singular the several chattels and things specifically described in the schedule hereto annexed by way of security for the payment of the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds and interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum thank you mr chalker i know all that you cant complain im sure it is five years since you borrowed the money it was fifty pounds and a box of old law books out of your office and i signed a bill for a hundred you forget the circumstances no i do not my grandson was a rogue one does not readily forget that circumstance he was also your friend i remember and i held my tongue i have had no more money from you and the sum has become three hundred and fifty of course you dont understand law mr emblem how should you but we lawyers dont work for nothing however it isnt what you got but what i am to get come my good sir its cutting off your nose to spite your face

shilling why i honor you for itthere though he was my friend for joe deserves it thoroughly ive told him so mind you ask him ive told him so a dozen times ive said the old mans right joe ask him if i

whybut of course you willbut if you do noti suppose there will be only one thing left to dorealize the security sell upsticks and books and all thank you mr chalker i will look round me andanddo my best good day mr chalker the best you can do mr emblem returned the solicitor is to take me as your adviser you trust david chalker thank you goodday mr chalker on his way out mr chalker stopped for a moment and looked round the shop hows business he asked the assistant dull sir replied mr james he throws it all away and neglects his chances naturally being so rich so rich indeed the solicitor echoed it will be bad for his successor mr james went on thinking how much he should himself like to be that successor the goodwill wont be worth half what it ought to be and the stock is just falling to pieces mr chalker looked about him again thoughtfully and opened his mouth as if about to ask a question but said nothing he remembered in time that the shopman was not likely to know the amount of his masters capital or investments there isnt a book even in the glasscase thats worth a fivepound note continued mr james whispering and he dont look about for purchases any more seems to have lost his pluck mr chalker returned to the backshop within three weeks mr emblem he repeated and then departed mr emblem sat in his chair he had to find three hundred and fifty pounds in three weeks no one knew better than himself that this was impossible within three weeks but in three weeks he would open the packet of letters and give iris her inheritance at least she would not suffer as for himselfhe looked round the little back shop and tried to recall the fifty years he had spent there the books he had bought and sold the money which had slipped through his fingers the friends who had come and gone why as for the books he seemed to remember them every onehis joy in the purchase his pride in possession and his grief at letting them go all the friends gone before him his trade sunk to nothing yet he murmured i thought it would last my time but the clock struck six it was his teatime he rose mechanically and went upstairs to iris chapter ii fox and wolf mr james left to himself attempted in accordance with his daily custom to commit a dishonorable action that is to say he first listened carefully to the retreating footsteps of his master as he went up the stairs then he left his table crept stealthily into the back shop and began to pull the drawers turn the handle of the safe and try the desk everything was carefully locked then he turned over all the papers on the table but found nothing that contained the information he looked for it was his daily practice thus to try the locks in hope that some day the safe or the drawers or the desk would be left open by accident when he might be able to solve a certain problem the doubt and difficulty of which sore let and hindered himnamely of what extent and where placed were those great treasures savings and investments which enabled his master to be careless over his business it was further customary with him to be thus frustrated and disappointed having briefly therefore also in accordance with his usual custom expressed his disgust at this want of confidence between master and man mr james returned to his paste and scissors about a quarter past six the shop door was cautiously opened and a head appeared which looked round stealthily seeing nobody about except mr james the head nodded and presently followed by its body stepped into the shop wheres the admiral foxy asked the caller guvnors upstairs mr joseph taking of his tea with miss iris replied mr james not at all offended by the allusion to his craftiness who should resemble the fox if not the secondhand bookseller in no trade perhaps can the truly admirable qualities of that animalhis patience his subtlety and craft his pertinacity his sagacitybe illustrated more to advantage mr james felt a glow of virtuewould that he could grow daily and hourly and more and more toward the perfect fox then indeed and not till then would he be able to live truly up to his secondhand books having tea with iris well the speaker looked as if it required some effort to receive this statement with resignation he always does at six oclock why shouldnt he asked mr james because james he spends the time in cockering up that gal whom hes ruined and spoiledhim and the old nigger between themso that her mind is poisoned against her lawful relations and nothing will content her but coming into all the old mans money instead of going share and share alike as a cousin should and especially a shecousin while theres a biscuit left in the locker and a drop of rum in the cask ah said mr james with a touch of sympathy called forth perhaps by mention of the rum which is a favorite drink with secondhand booksellers assistants nothing too good for her the other went on the best of education pianos to play upon and nobody good enough for her to know not on visiting terms if you please with her neighbors waiting for duchesses to call upon her and what is she after all a miserable teacher mr joseph gallop was a young man somewhere between twenty and thirty tall largelimbed well setup and broadshouldered a young man who at first sight would seem eminently fitted to push his own fortunes also at first sight a remarkably handsome fellow with straight clearcut features and light curly hair when he swung along the street his round hat carelessly thrown back and his handsome face lit up by the sun the old women murmured a blessing upon his comely headas they used to do a long time ago upon the comely and curly head of absalomand the young women looked meaningly at one anotheras was also done in the case of absalomand the object of their admiration knew that they were saying to each other in the feminine way where a look is as good as a whisper there goes a handsome fellow those who knew him better and had looked more closely into his face said that his mouth was bad and his eyes shifty the same opinion was held by the wiser sort as regards his character for on the one hand some averred that to their certain knowledge joe gallop had shown himself a monster of ingratitude toward his grandfather who had paid his debts and done all kinds of things for him on the other hand there were some who thought he had been badly treated and some said that no good would ever come of a young fellow who was never able to remain in the same situation more than a month or so and others said that he had certainly been unfortunate but that he was a quick and clever young man who would some day find the kind of work that suited him and then he would show everybody of what stuff he was composed as for us we have only to judge of him by his actions perhaps mr joseph said mr james perhaps miss iris wont have all bequeathed to her do you know anything joe asked quickly has he made a new will lately not that i know of but mr chalker has been here off and on a good bit now ah chalkers a close one too else hed tell me his old friend look here foxy he turned a beaming and smiling face upon the assistant if you should see anything or find anything out tell me mind and remember ill make it worth your while mr james looked as it he was asking himself how joseph could make it worth his while seeing that he got nothing more from his grandfather and by his own showing never would have anything more its only his will im anxious to know about that and where hes put away all his money think what a dreadful thing it would be for his heirs if he were to go and die suddenly and none of us to know where his investments are as for the shop that is already disposed of as i dare say you know disposed of the shop disposed of oh lord the assistant turned pale oh mr joseph he asked earnestly what will become of the shop and who is to have it i am to have it mr joseph replied calmly this was the lie absolute and he invented it very cleverly and at the right momenta thing which gives strength and life to a lie because he already suspected the truth and guessed the secret hope and ambition which possesses every ambitious assistant in this tradenamely to get the succession mr james looked upon himself as the lawful and rightful heir to the business but sometimes he entertained grievous doubts and now indeed his heart sunk into his boots i am to have it joe repeated oh i didnt know you are to have it then oh if mr james had been ten years younger i think he would have burst into tears but at the age of forty weeping no longer presents itself as a form of relief it is more usual to seek consolation in a swear he stammered however while he turned pale and then red and then pale again yes quite proper mr joseph im sure and a most beautiful business may be made again here by one who understands the way oh you are a lucky man mr joseph you are indeed sir to get such a noble chance the shop joe went on was settledsettled upon me long ago the verb to settle is capable of conveying large and vague impressions but after all whats the good of this place to a sailor the goodthe good of this place mr jamess cheek flushed why to make money to be sureto coin money in if i had this place to myselfwhywhy in two years i would be making as much as two hundred a year i would indeed you want to make money bah thats all you fellows think of to sit in the back shop all day long and to sell moldy books we jolly sailor boys know better than that my lad there really was something nautical about the look of the man he wore a blacksilk tie in a sailors runningknot the ends loose his waistcoat was unbuttoned and his coat was a kind of jacket not to speak of his swinging walk and careless pose in fact he had been a sailor he had made two voyages to india and back as assistantpurser or pursers clerk on board a p and o boat but some disagreement with his commanding officer concerning negligence or impudence or drink or lazinesshe had been charged in different situations and at different times with all these vices either together or separatelycaused him to lose his rating on the ships books however he brought away from his short nautical experience and preserved a certain nautical swagger which accorded well with his appearance and gave him a swashbuckler air which made those who knew him well lament that he had not graced the elizabethan era when he might have become a gallant buccaneer and so got himself shot through the head or that he had not flourished under the reign of good queen anne when he would probably have turned pirate and been hanged or that being born in the victorian age he had not gone to the far west where he would at least have had the chance of getting shot in a gamblingsaloon as for me when i get the business he continued i shall look about for some one to carry it on until i am able to sell it for what it will fetch books at a penny apiece all round i supposejames gaspedshop furniture thrown injames pantedand the goodwill for a small lump sum james wondered how far his own savings and what he could borrow might go toward that lump sum and how much might remain my grandfather as you know of course is soon going to retire from business altogether this was another lie absolute as mr emblem had no intention whatever of retiring soon mr joseph he has never said a word to me about it very soon nowsooner than you expect at seventyfive and with all his money why should he go on slaving any longer very soon indeed any day mr joseph the assistant positively trembled with eagerness and apprehension what is it james did you really think that a man like me was going to sit in a back shop among these moldy volumes all day come thats too good you might have given me credit for being one cut above a counter too i am a gentleman james if you please i am an officer and a gentleman he then proceeded to explain in language that smacked something of the sea that his ideas soared far above trade which was at best a contemptible occupation and quite unworthy of a gentleman particularly an officer and a gentleman and that his personal friends would never condescend even to formal acquaintance not to speak of friendship with trade this discourse may be omitted when one reads about such a man as joe gallop when we are told how he looked and what he said and how he said it with what gestures and in what tone we feel as if it would be impossible for the simplest person in the world to be mistaken as to his real character my friends especially my young friends so far from the discernment of character being easy it is on the contrary an art most difficult and very rarely attained natures indications are a kind of handwriting the characters in which are known to few so that for instance the quick enquiring glance of an eye in which one may easily readwho knows the charactertreachery lying and deception just as in the letter beth was originally easily discerned the effigies of a house may very easily pass unread by the multitude the language or rather the alphabet is much less complicated than the cuneiform of the medes and persians yet no one studies it except women most of whom are profoundly skilled in this lore which makes them so fearfully and wonderfully wise thus it is easy for man to deceive his brother man but not his sister woman again most of us are glad to take everybody on his own statements there are or may be we are all ready to acknowledge with sorrow for erring humanity somewhere else in the world such things as pretending swindling acting a part and cheating but they do not and cannot belong to our own world mr james the assistant very well knew that mr emblems grandson had already though still young as bad a record as could be desired by any that he had been turned out of one situation after another that his grandfather had long since refused to help him any more that he was always to be found in the broad path which leadeth to destruction when he had money he ran down that path as fast as his legs could carry him when he had none he only walked and wished he could run but he never left it and never wished to leave it knowing all this the man accepted and believed every word of joes story james believed it because he hoped it he listened respectfully to joes declamation on the meanness of trade and then he rubbed his hands and said humbly that he ventured to hope when the sale of the business came on mr joseph would let him have a chance you asked joe i never thought of you but why not why not i say why not you as well as anybody else nobody but me mr joseph knows what the business is and how it might be improved and i could make arrangements for paying by regular instalments well well talk about it when the time comes i wont forget sailors you know cant be expected to understand the value of shops say james what does the commodore do all day sits in there and adds up his investments always doing thateh always adding em up ah and youve never got a chance of looking over his shoulder i suppose never you may find that chance one of these days i should like to know if only for curiosity what they are and where they are he sits in there and adds em up yesive seen him at it there must be thousands by this time thousands said the assistant in the belief that the more you add up a sum the larger it grows joe walked into the back shop and tried the safe where are the keys he asked always in his pocket or on the table before him he dont leave them about or youd ha known pretty sharp all there is to knoweh my lad well youre a foxy one you are if ever there was one lets be pals you and me when the old man goes you want the shopwell i dont see why you shouldnt have the shop somebody must have the shop and it will be mine to do what i please with as for his savings he says they are all for iriswell wills have been set aside before this do you think now seriously do you think james that the old man is quite righteh dont answer in a hurry do you think now that he is quite right in his chump james laughed hes right enough though he throws away his chances throws away his chances how the deuce can he be all right then did you ever hear of a bookseller in his right mind throwing away his chances whynofor that matter very well then for that matter dont forget that youve seen him throw away all his chancesall his chances you said you are ready to swear to that most important evidence that james james had not said all but he grunted and the other man went on it may come in useful this recollection keep your eyes wideopen my red haired pirate as for the moldy old shop you may consider it as good as your own why i suppose youll get somebody else to handle the pastebrush and the scissors and tie up the parcels and water the shopeh youll be too proud to do that for yourself you will mr james grinned and rubbed his hands all your owneh well youll wake em up a bit wont you mr james grinned againhe continued grinning go on mr joseph he said go oni like it consider the job as settled then as for terms they shall be easy im not a hard man andi say foxy about that safe mr james suddenly ceased grinning because he observed a look in his patrons eyes which alarmed him about that safe you must find out for me where the old man has put his money and what it is worth do you hear or else how can i find out he wont tell me any more than you or else you must put me in the way of finding out mr joseph lowered his voice to a whisper he keeps the keys on the table before him when a customer takes him out here he leaves the keys behind him do you know the key of the safe yes i know it what is to prevent a clever quickeyed fellow like you mate stepping in with a bit of waxeh while he is talking you know you could rush it in a moment itsits dangerous mr joseph so it israther dangerousnot much what of that i would do anything i could to be of service to you mr joseph but thats not honest and its dangerous dangerous theres danger in the briny deep and shipwreck on the blast if you come to danger do we therefore jolly mariners afloat ever think of that never as to honesty dont make a man sick look here mr joseph if youll give me a promise in writing that im to have the shop as soon as you get it at a fair valuation and easy termssay ten per cent down and stow it mate write what you like and ill sign it now about that key supposing you was to get a duplicate key and supposing you was to get into trouble about it mr joseph should youshould youi only put it to youshould you up and round upon the man as got you that key foxy you are as suspicious as a chinaman well then do it this way send it me in a letter and then who is to know where the letter came from the assistant nodded then i think i can do the job though not perhaps your way but i think i can do it i wont promise for a day or two there you spoke like an honest pal and a friendly shipmate dangerous of course it is when the roaring winds do blowhands upon it brother foxy youve never done a better days work you are too crafty for any sailoryou are indeed here just for a little key hush mr joseph oh praypray dont talk so loud you dont know who may be listening theres mr lala roy you never hear him coming just for a trifle of a key you are going to get possession of the best bookshop in all chelsea well keep your eyes skinned and the wax ready will you and now james ill be off oh i say mr joseph wait a moment james was beginning to realize what he had promised if anything dreadful should come of this i dont know what is in the safe there may be money as well as papers james do you think i would steal do you mean to insinuate that i am a thief sir do you dare to suspect that i would take money james certainly looked as if he had thought even that possible i shall open the safe take out the papers read them and put them back just as i found them will that do for you he shook hands again and took himself off at seven oclock mr emblem came downstairs again has any one been he asked as usual only mr joseph what might mr joseph want nothing at all then said his grandfather mr joseph might just as well have kept away let us anticipate a little james spent the next day hovering about in the hope that an opportunity would offer of getting the key in his possession for a few moments there was no opportunity the bunch of keys lay on the table under the old mans eyes all day and when he left the table he carried them with him but the day afterward he got his chance one of the old customers called to talk over past bargains and former prizes mr emblem came out of the back shop with his visitor and continued talking with him as far as the door as he passed the tablejamess tablehe rested the hand which carried the keys on it and left them there james pounced upon them and slipped them into his pocket noiselessly mr emblem returned to his own chair and thought nothing of the keys for an hour and a half by the clock and during this period james was out on business when mr emblem remembered his keys he felt for them in their usual place and missed them and then began searching about and cried out to james that he had lost his bunch of keys why sir said james bringing them to him after a little search and with a very red face here they are you must have left them on my table and in this way the job was done chapter iii iris the herald by a somewhat remarkable coincidence it was on this very evening that iris first made the acquaintance of her pupil mr arnold arbuthnot these coincidences i believe happen oftener in real life than they do even on the stage where people are always turning up at the very nick of time and the critical moment i need little persuasion to make me believe that the first meeting of arnold arbuthnot and iris on the very evening when her cousin was opening matters with the foxy one was nothing short of providential you shall see presently what things might have happened if they had not met the meeting was in fact the second of the three really important events in the life of a girl the first which is seldom remembered with the gratitude which it deserves is her birth the second the first meeting with her future lover the third her weddingday the other events of a womans life are interesting perhaps but not important certain circumstances which will be immediately explained connected with this meeting made it an event of very considerable interest to iris even though she did not suspect its immense importance so much interest that she thought of nothing else for a week beforehand that as the appointed hour drew near she trembled and grew pale that when her grandfather came up for his tea she who was usually so quick to discern the least sign of care or anxiety in his face actually did not observe the trouble plainly written in his drooping head and anxious eyes which was due to his interview with mr david chalker she poured out the tea therefore without one word of sympathy this would have seemed hard if her grandfather had expected any he did not however because he did not know that the trouble showed in his face and was trying to look as if nothing had happened yet in his brain were ringing and resounding the words within three weekswithin three weeks with the regularity of a horrid clock at midnight when one wants to go to sleep oh cried iris forced as young people always are to speak of her own trouble oh grandfather he is coming tonight who is coming tonight my dear and then he listened again for the ticking of the clock within three weekswithin three weeks who is coming tonight my dear he took the cup of tea from her and sat down with an old mans deliberation which springs less from wisdom and the fullness of thought that from respect to rheumatism the iteration of that refrain within three weeks made him forget everything even the trouble of his granddaughters mind oh grandfather you cannot have forgotten she spoke with the least possible touch of irritation because she had been thinking of this thing for a week past day and night and it was a thing of such stupendous interest to her that it seemed impossible that anyone who knew of it could forget what was coming no no the old man was stimulated into immediate recollection by the disappointment in her eyes no no my dear i have not forgotten your pupil is coming mr arbuthnot is coming but iris child dont let that worry you i will see him for you if you like no i must see him myself you see dear there is the awful deception oh how shall i tell him no deception at all he said stoutly you advertised in your own initials he never asked if the initials belonged to a man or to a woman the other pupils do not know why should this one what does it matter to him if you have done the work for which he engaged your services but oh he is so different and the others you know keep to the subject so should he then why didnt he but he hasnt and i have been answering him and he must think that i was drawing him on to tell me more about himself and nowoh what will he think i drew him on and onyet i didnt mean totill at last he writes to say that he regards me as the best friend and the wisest adviser he has ever had what will he think and say grandfather it is dreadful what did you tell him for iris my dear why couldnt you let things go on and by telling him you will lose your pupil yes of course and worse still i shall lose his letters we live so quietly here that his letters have come to me like news of another world how many different worlds are there all round one in london it has been pleasant to read of that one in which ladies go about beautifully dressed always and where the people have nothing to do but to amuse themselves he has told me about this world in which he lives and about his own life so that i know everything he does and where he goes andhere she sighed heavilyof course it could not go on forever and i should not mind so much if it had not been carried on under false pretenses no false pretenses at all my dear dont think it i sent back his last check she said trying to find a little consolation for herself but yet well iris said her grandfather he wanted to learn heraldry and you have taught him for the last three monthsthe girl blushed as if she was confessing her sinsfor the last three months there has not been a single word in his letters about heraldry he tells me that he writes because he is idle or because he wants to talk or because he is alone in his studio or because he wants his unknown friends advice i am his unknown friend and i have been giving him advice and very good advice too said her grandfather benevolently who is so wise as my iris i have answered all his letters and never once told him that i am only a girl i am glad you did not tell him iris said her grandfather but he did not say why he was glad and why cant he go on writing his letters without making any fuss because he says he must make the acquaintance of the manthe man he sayswith whom he has been in correspondence so long this is what he says she opened a letter which lay upon a table covered with papers but her grandfather stopped her well my dear i do not want to know what he says he wishes to make your acquaintance very good then you are going to see him and to tell him who you are that is enough but as for deceivinghe paused trying to understand this extreme scrupulosity of conscienceif you come to deceivingwell in a kind sort of a way you did allow him to think his correspondent a man i admit that what harm is done to him none he wont be so mean i suppose as to ask for his money back again i think he ought to have it all back said iris yes all from the very beginning i am ashamed that i ever took any money from him my face burns when i think of it to this her grandfather made no reply the returning of money paid for services rendered was to his commercial mind too foolish a thing to be even talked about at the same time iris was quite free to manage her own affairs and then there was that roll of papers in the safe why what matter if she sent away all her pupils he changed the subject iris my dear he said about this other world where the people amuse themselves the world which lives in the squares and in the big houses on the chelsea embankment here you knowhow should you like just for a change to belong to that world and have no work to do i dont know she replied carelessly because the question did not interest her you would have to leave me of course you would sever your connection as they say with the shop please dont let us talk nonsense grandfather you would have to be ashamed perhaps of ever having taught for your living now that i never should benever not if they made me a duchess you would go dressed in silk and velvet my dear i should like to see you dressed up just for once as we have seen them at the theater well i should like one velvet dress in my life only one and it should be crimsona beautiful deep dark crimson very good and you would drive in a carriage instead of an omnibus you would sit in the stalls instead of the upper circle you would give quantities of money to poor people and you would buy as many second hand books as you pleased there are rich people i believe ostentatious people who buy new books but you my dear have been better brought up no books are worth buying till they have stood the criticism of a whole generation at least never buy new books my dear i wont said iris but you dear old man what have you got in your head tonight why in the world should we talk about getting rich i was only thinking he said that perhaps you might be so much happier happier nonsense i am as happy as i can be six pupils already to be sure i have lost one she sighed and the best among them all when her grandfather left her iris placed candles on the writingtable but did not light them though it was already pretty dark she had half an hour to wait and she wanted to think and candles are not necessary for meditation she sat at the open window and suffered her thoughts to ramble where they pleased this is a restful thing to do especially if your windows look upon a tolerably busy but not noisy london road for then it is almost as good as sitting beside a swiftlyrunning stream the movement of the people below is like the unceasing flow of the current the sound of the footsteps is like the whisper of the water along the bank the echo of the half heard talk strikes your ear like the mysterious voices wafted to the banks from the boats as they go by and the lights of the shops and the street presently become spectral and unreal like lights seen upon the river in the evening iris had a good many pupilssix in fact as she had boasted why then was she so strangely disturbed on account of one an old tutor by correspondence may be and very likely is indifferent about his pupils because he has had so many but iris was a young tutor and had as yet known few one of her pupils for instance was a gentleman in the fruit and potato line in the borough by reason of his early education which had not been neglected so much as entirely omitted he was unable to personally conduct his accounts now a merchant without his accounts is as helpless as a tourist without his cook so that he desired in his mature age to learn book keeping compound addition subtraction and multiplication he had no partners so that he did not want division but it is difficultsay wellnigh impossiblefor a middleaged merchant not trained in the graces of letterwriting to inspire a young lady with personal regard even though she is privileged to follow the current of his thoughts day by day and to set him his sums next there was a young fellow of nineteen or twenty who was beginning life as an assistantteacher in a commercial school at lower clapton this way is a stony and a thorny path to tread no one walks upon it willingly those who are compelled to enter upon it speedily either run away and enlist or they go and find a secluded spot in which to hang themselves the smoother ways of the profession are only to be entered by one who is the possessor of a degree and it was the determination of this young man to pass the london university examinations and to obtain the degree of bachelor in this way his value in the educational market would be at once doubled and he could command a better place and lighter work he showed himself in his letters to be an eminently practical shrewd selfish and thickskinned young man who would quite certainly get on in the world and was resolved to lose no opportunities and with that view he took as much work out of his tutor as he could get for the money had he known that the ia who took such a wonderful amount of trouble with his papers was only a woman he would certainly have extorted a great deal more work for his money all this iris read in his letters and understood there is no way in which a man more surely and more naturally reveals his true character than in his correspondence so that after awhile even though the subject of the letters be nothing more interesting than the studies in hand those who write the letters may learn to know each other if they have but the mother wit to read between the lines certainly this young schoolmaster did not know iris nor did he desire to discover what she was like being wholly occupied with the study of himself strange and kindly provision of nature the less desirable a man actually appears to others the more fondly he loves and believes in himself i have heard it whispered that narcissus was a hunchback then there was another pupil a girl who was working her very hardest in order to become as she hoped a firstclass governess and who poor thing by reason of her natural thickness would never reach even the third rank iris would have been sorry for her because she worked so fiercely and was so stupid but there was something hard and unsympathetic in her nature which forbade pity she was miserably poor too and had an unsuccessful father no doubt as stupid as herself and made pitiful excuses for not forwarding the slender fees with regularity everybody who is poor should be on that ground alone worthy of pity and sympathy but the hardness and stupidity and the illtemper all combined and clearly shown in her letters repelled her tutor iris who drew imaginary portraits of her pupils pictured the girl as plain to look upon with a dull eye a leathery pallid cheek a forehead without sunshine upon it and lips which seldom parted with a smile then there was besides a cambridge undergraduate he was neither clever nor industrious nor very ambitious he thought that a moderate place was quite good enough for him to aim at and he found that his unknown and obscure tutor by correspondence was cheap and obliging and willing to take trouble and quite as efficacious for his purposes as the most expensive cambridge coach iris presently discovered that he was lazy and luxurious a deceiver of himself a dweller in fools paradise and a constant shirker of work therefore she disliked him had she actually known him and talked with him she might have liked him better in spite of these faults and shortcomings for he was really a pleasant easygoing youth who wallowed in intellectual sloth but loved physical activity who will presently drop easily and comfortably and without an effort or a doubt into the bosom of the church and will develop later on into an admirable country parson unless they disestablish the establishment in which case i do not know what he will do but this other man this man who was coming for an explanation this mr arnold arbuthnot was if you please a very different kind of pupil in the first place he was a gentleman a fact which he displayed not ostentatiously in every line of his letters next he had come to her for instructionthe only pupil she had in that science in heraldry which she loved it is far more pleasant to be describing a shield and settling questions in the queer old language of this queer old science than in solving and propounding problems in trigonometry and conic sections and thenhow if your pupil begins to talk round the subject and to wander into other things you cannot very well talk round a branch of mathematics but heraldry is a subject surrounded by fields meadows and lawns so to speak all covered with beautiful flowers into these the pupil wandered and iris not unwillingly followed thus the teaching of heraldry by correspondence became the most delightful interchange of letters imaginable set off and enriched with a curious and strange piquancy derived from the fact that one of them supposed to be an elderly man was a young girl ignorant of the world except from books and the advice given her by two old men who formed all her society then as was natural what was at first a kind of play became before long a serious and earnest confidence on the one side and a hesitating reception on the other latterly he more than once amused himself by drawing an imaginary portrait of her it was a pleasing portrait but it made her feel uneasy i know you he said from your letters but yet i want to know you in person i think you are a man advanced in years poor iris and she not yet twentyone you sit in your study and read you wear glasses and your hair is gray you have a kind heart and a cheerful voice you are not richyou have never tried to make yourself rich you are therefore little versed in the ways of mankind you take your ideas chiefly from books the few friends you have chosen are true and loyal you are full of sympathy and quick to read the thoughts of those in whom you take an interest a very fine character but it made iriss cheek to burn and her eyes to drop to be sure she was not rich nor did she know the world so far her pupil was right but yet she was not gray nor old and again she was not as he thought a man letterwriting is not extinct as it is a commonplace to affirm and as people would have us believe letters are written stillthe most delightful lettersletters as copious as charming as any of the last century but men and women no longer write their letters as carefully as they used to do in the old days because they were then shown about and very likely read aloud our letters therefore though their sentences are not so balanced nor their periods so rounded are more real more truthful more spontaneous and more delightful than the laborious productions of our ancestors who had to weigh every phrase and to think out their bon mots epigrams and smart things for weeks beforehand so that the letter might appear full of impromptu wit i should like for instance just for once to rob the outward or the homeward mail in order to read all the delightful letters which go every week backward and forward between the folk in india and the folk at home i shall lose my letters iris recollected and her heart sunk not only did her correspondent begin to draw these imaginary portraits of her but he proceeded to urge upon her to come out of her concealment and to grant him an interview this she might have refused in her desire to continue a correspondence which brightened her monotonous life but there came another thing and this decided her he began to give and to ask opinions concerning love marriage and such topicsand then she perceived it could not possibly be discussed with him even in domino and male disguise as for love her pupil wrote i suppose it is a real and not a fancied necessity of life a man i mean may go on a long time without it but there will come a timedo not you think sowhen he is bound to feel the incompleteness of life without a woman to love we ought to train our boys and girls from the very beginning to regard love and marriage as the only things really worth having because without them there is no happiness give me your own experience i am sure you must have been in love at some time or other in your life anybody will understand that iris could not possibly give her own experience in lovematters nor could she plunge into speculative philosophy of this kind with her pupil obviously the thing must come to an end therefore she wrote a letter to him telling him that ia would meet him if he pleased that very evening at the hour of eight it is by this time sufficiently understood that iris aglen professed to teachit is an unusual combinationmathematics and heraldry she might also have taught equally well had she chosen sweetness of disposition goodness of heart the benefits conferred by pure and lofty thoughts on the expression of a girls face and the way to acquire all the other gracious maidenly virtues but either there is too limited a market for these branches of culture orwhich is perhaps the truer reasonthere are so many english girls not to speak of americans who are ready and competent to teach them and do teach them to their brothers and their lovers and to each other and to their younger sisters all day long as for her heraldry it was natural that she should acquire that science because her grandfather knew as much as any pursuivant or kingatarms and thought that by teaching the child a science which is nowadays cultivated by so few he was going to make her fortune besides ever mindful of the secret packet he thought that an heiress ought to understand heraldry it was indeed as you shall see in this way that her fortune was made but yet not quite in the way he proposed to make it nobody ever makes a fortune quite in the way at first intended for him as for her mathematics it is no wonder that she was good in this science because she was a pupil of lala roy this learned bengalee condescended to acknowledge the study of mathematics as worthy even of the indian intellect and amused himself with them when he was not more usefully engaged in chess he it was who being a lodger in the house taught iris almost as soon as she could read how letters placed side by side may be made to signify and accomplish stupendous things and how they may disguise the most graceful and beautiful curves and how they may even open a way into boundless space and there disclose marvels this wondrous world did the philosopher open to the ready and quickwitted girl nor did he ever lead her to believe that it was at all an unusual or an extraordinary thing for a girl to be so quick and apt for science as herself nor did he tell her that if she went to newnham or to girton extraordinary glories would await her with the acclamations of the multitude in the senate house and the praise of the moderators iris therefore was not proud of her mathematics which seemed part of her very nature but of her heraldry she was i fear extremely proudproud even to sinfulness no doubt this was the reason why through her heraldry the humiliation of this evening fell upon her if he is young she thought if he is youngand he is sure to be younghe will be very angry at having opened his mind to a girlit will be perceived that although she knew so much mathematics she was really very ignorant of the opposite sex not to know that a young man likes nothing so much as the opening of his mind to a young lady if he is old he will be more humiliated stillas if any man at any age was ever humiliated by confessing himself to a woman if he is a proud man he will never forgive me indeed i am sure that he can never forgive me whatever kind of man he is but i can do no more than tell him i am sorry if he will not forgive me then what more can i say oh if he should be vindictive when the clock began to strike the hour of eight iris lighted her candles and before the pulsation of the last stroke had died away she heard the ringing of the housebell the door was opened by her grandfather himself and she heard his voice yes he said you will find your tutor in the first floor front alone if you are inclined to be vindictive when you hear all please ring the bell for me the visitor mounted the stairs and iris hearing his step began to tremble and to shake for fear when the door opened she did not at first look up but she knew that her pupil was there and that he was looking for his tutor pardon methe voice was not unpleasantpardon me i was directed to this room i have an appointment with my tutor if said iris rising for the time for confession had at length arrived if you are mr arnold arbuthnot your appointment is i believe with me it is with my tutor he said i am your tutor my initials are ia the room was only lighted by two candles but they showed him the hanging head and the form of a woman and he thought she looked young judging by the outline her voice was sweet and clear my tutor you if you really are mr arnold arbuthnot the gentleman who has corresponded with ia for the last two years on heraldry andand other things i am your tutor she had made the dreaded confession the rest would be easy she even ventured to raise her eyes and she perceived with a sinking of the heart that her estimate of her pupils age was tolerably correct he was a young man apparently not more than five or six and twenty it now remained to be seen if he was vindictive as for the pupil when he recovered a little from the blow of this announcement he saw before him a girl quite young dressed in a simple gray or drab colored stuff which i have reason to believe is called carmelite the dress had a crimson kerchief arranged in folds over the front and a lace collar and at first sight it made the beholder feel that considered merely as a setting of face and figure it was remarkably effective surely this is the true end and aim of all feminine adornment apart from the elementary object of keeping one warm ii did not know the young man said after a pause i did not know at all that i was corresponding with a lady here she raised her eyes again and he observed that the eyes were very large and full of lighteyes like the fishpools of heshbondoves eyes i am very sorry she said meekly it was my fault he observed other things now having regained the use of his senses thus he saw that she wore her hair which was of a wonderful chestnut brown color parted at the side like a boys and that she had not committed the horrible enormity of cutting it short he observed too that while her lips were quivering and her cheek was blushing her look was steadfast are doves eyes he asked himself always steadfast i ought to have told you long ago when you began to write aboutabout yourself and other things when i understood that you thought i was a manoh long ago i ought to have told you the truth it is wonderful said the young man it is truly wonderful he was thinking of the letterslong letters full of sympathy and a curious unworldly wisdom which she had sent him in reply to his own and he was comparing them with her youthful face as one involuntarily compares a poets appearance with his poetrygenerally a disappointing thing to do and always a foolish thing i am very sorry she repeated have you many pupils like myself i have several pupils in mathematics it does not matter to them whether they are taught by a man or a woman in heraldry i had only oneyou he looked round the room one end was occupied by shelves filled with books in one of the windows was a table covered with papers and adorned with a typewriter by means of which iris carried on her correspondence for a moment the unworthy thought crossed his mind that he had been perhaps artfully lured on by a siren for his destruction only for a moment however because she raised her face and met his gaze again with eyes so frank and innocent that he could not doubt them besides there was the clear outline of her face so truthful and so honest the young man was an artist and therefore believed in outline could any sane and intelligent creature doubt those curves of cheek and chin i have put together she said all your letters for you here they are will you please take them back i must not keep them any longer he took them and bowed i made this appointment as you desired to tell you the truth because i have deceived you too long and to beg you to forgive me and to say that of course there is an end to our correspondence thank you it shall be as you desire exactly he repeated as you desire he ought to have gone at once there was nothing more to say yet he lingered holding the letters in his hand to write these letters he said has been for a long time one of my greatest pleasures partly because i felt that i was writing to a friend and so wrote in full trust and confidence partly because they procured me a replyin the shape of your letters must i take back these letters of mine she made no answer it is hard is it not to lose a friend so slowly acquired thus suddenly and unexpectedly yes she said it is hard i am very sorry it was my fault perhaps i have said something in my ignorancesomething which ought not to have been said or writtensomething carelesssomething which has lowered me in your esteem oh nono said iris quickly you have never said anything that a gentleman should not have said and if you yourself found any pleasure in answering my letters yes said iris with frankness it gave me great pleasure to read and to answer your letters as well as i could i have not brought back your letters i hope you will allow me to keep them and if you will why should we not continue our correspondence as before but he did not ask the question confidently no said iris decidedly it can never be continued as before how could it when once we have met and you have learned the truth then he continued if we cannot write to each other any more can we not talk she ought to have informed him on the spot that the thing was quite impossible and not to be thought of for one moment she should have said coldly but firmlyevery rightminded and wellbehaved girl would have saidsir it is not right that you should come alone to a young ladys study such things are not to be permitted it we meet in society we may perhaps renew our acquaintance but girls do go on sometimes as if there was no such thing as propriety at all and such cases are said to be growing more frequent besides iris was not a girl who was conversant with social convenances she looked at her pupil thoughtfully and frankly can we she asked she who hesitates is lost a maxim which cannot be too often read said and studied it is one of the very few golden rules omitted from solomons proverbs can we it would be pleasant it you will permit me he blushed and stammered wondering at her ready acquiescence if you will permit me to call upon you sometimeshere if you will allow me or anywhere else you know my name i am by profession an artist and i have a studio close at hand in tite street to call upon me here she repeated now when one is a tutor and has been reading with a pupil for two years one regards that pupil with a feeling which may not be exactly parental but which is unconventional if arnold had said behold me may i being a young man call upon you a young woman she would have replied no young man that can never be but when he said may i your pupil call sometimes upon you my tutor a distinction was at once established by which the impossible became possible yes she said i think you may call my grandfather has his tea with me every evening at six you may call then if it will give you any pleasure you really will let me come here the young man looked as if the permission was likely to give him the greatest pleasure yes if you wish it she spoke just exactly like an oxford don giving an undergraduate permission to take an occasional walk with him or to call for conversation and advice at certain times in his rooms arnold noticed the manner and smiled still he said as your pupil he meant to set her at her ease concerning the propriety of these visits she thought he meant a continuation of a certain little arrangement as to fees and blushed no she said i must not consider you as a pupil any longer you have put an end to that yourself i do not mind if only i continue your friend oh she said but we must not pledge ourselves rashly to friendship perhaps you will not like me when you once come to know me then i remain your disciple oh no she flushed again you must already think me presumptuous enough in venturing to give you advice i have written so many foolish things indeed no he interrupted a thousand times no let me tell you once for all if i may that you have taught me a great dealfar more than you can ever understand or than i can explain where did you get your wisdom not from the book of human life of that you cannot know much as yet the wisdom is in your imagination i think you shall not be my pupil nor my disciple butwellbecause you have told me so much and i seem to have known you so long and besides because you must never feel ashamed of having told me so much you shall come if you please as my brother it was not till afterward that she reflected on the vast responsibilities she incurred in making this proposal and on the eagerness with which her pupil accepted it as your brother he cried offering her his hand why it is farfar more than i could have ventured to hope yes i will come as your brother and now although you know so much about me you have told me nothing about yourselfnot even your name my name is iris aglen iris it is a pretty name it was i believe my grandmothers but i never saw her and i do not know who or what my fathers relations are iris aglen he repeated iris was the herald of the gods and the rainbow was constructed on purpose to serve her for a way from heaven to the earth mathematicians do not allow that said the girl smiling i dont know any mathematics but now i understand in what school you learned your heraldry you are queenatarms at least and herald to the gods of olympus he wished to add something about the loveliness of aphrodite and the wisdom of athene but he refrained which was in good taste thank you mr arbuthnot iris replied i learned my heraldry of my grandfather who taught himself from the books he sells and my mathematics i learned of lala roy who is our lodger and a learned hindoo gentleman my father is deadand my mother as welland i have no friends in the world except these two old men who love me and have done their best to spoil me her eyes grew humid and her voice trembled no other friends in the world strange to say this young man felt a little sense of relief no other friends he ought to have sympathized with the girls loneliness he might have asked her how she could possibly endure life without companionship but he did not he only felt that other friends might have been rough and illbred this girl derived her refinement not only from nature but also from separation from the other girls who might in the ordinary course have been her friends and associates and if no other friends then no lover arnold was only going to visit the young lady as her brother but lovers do not generally approve the introduction of such novel effects as that caused by the appearance of a brandnew and previously unsuspected brother he was glad on the whole that there was no lover then he left her and went home to his studio where he sat till midnight sketching a thousand heads one after the other with rapid pencil they were all girls heads and they all had hair parted on the left side with a broad square forehead full eyes and straight clearcut features no he said it is no good i cannot catch the curve of her mouthnobody could what a pretty girl and i am to be her brother what will clara say and howoh how in the world can she be all at the same time so young so pretty so learned so quick so sympathetic and so wise chapter iv the wolf at home there is a certain musichall in a certain street leading out of a certain road and this is quite clear and definite enough its distinctive characteristics above any of its fellows is a vulgarity so profound that the connoisseur or student in that branch of mental culture thinks that here at last he has reached the lowest depths for this reason one shrinks from actually naming it because it might become fashionable and then if it fondly tried to change its character to suit its changed audience it might entirely lose its present charm and become simply commonplace joe gallop stood in the doorway of this hall a few days after the tempting of mr james it was about ten oclock when the entertainments were in full blast he had a cigarette between his lips as becomes a young man of fashion but it had gone out and he was thinking of something to judge from the cunning look in his eyes it was something not immediately connected with the good of his fellowcreatures presently the music of the orchestra ceased and certain female acrobats who had been contorting themselves fearfully and horribly for a quarter of an hour upon the stage kissed their hands which were as hard as ropes from the nature of their profession and smiled a fond farewell there was some applause but not much because neither man nor woman cares greatly for female acrobats and the performers themselves are with difficulty persuaded to learn their art and generally make haste to go in again as soon as they can and try henceforward to forget that they have ever done things with ropes and bars joe when they left the stage ceased his meditations whatever may have been their subject lit a fresh cigarette and assumed an air of great expectation as if something really worth seeing and hearing were now about to appear and when the chairman brought down the hammer with the announcement that miss carlotta claradine the peoples favorite would now oblige it was joe who loudly led the way for a tumultuous burst of applause then the band which at this establishment and others like unto it only plays two tunes one for acrobats and one for singers struck up the second air and the peoples favorite appeared she may have had by nature a sweet and tuneful voice perhaps it was in order to please her friends the people that she converted it into a harsh and rasping voice that she delivered her words with even too much gesture and that she uttered a kind of shriek at the beginning of every verse which was not in the composers original music but was thrown in to compel attention she was dressed with great simplicity in plain frock apron and white cap to represent a fair young quakeress and she sung a song about her lover with much archnessa delightful quality in woman splendid splendid bravo shouted joseph at the end of the first verse that fetches em dont it sir positively drags em in sir he addressed his words without turning his head to a man who had just come in and was gazing at him with unbounded astonishment you here joe he said joe started why chalker whod have thought to meet you in this musichall its a good step isnt it and what are you doing joe i heard youd left the p and o company had to said joe a gentleman has no choice but to resign ought never to have gone there theres no position chalkerno position at all in the service that is what i felt besides the uniform for a man of my style is unbecoming and the captain was a cad humph and what are you doing then living on the old man again never you mind david chalker replied joe with dignity i am not likely to trouble you any more after the last time i called upon you well joe said the other without taking offense it is not my business to lend money without a security and all you had to offer was your chance of what your grandfather might leave youor might not and a very good security too if he does justice to his relations yes but how did i know whether he was going to do justice come joe dont be shirty with an old friend there was a cordiality in the solicitors manner which boded well joe was pretty certain that mr chalker was not a man to cultivate friendship unless something was to be got out of it it is only the idle and careless who can waste time over unprofitable friendships with most men friendship means assisting in each others little games so that every man must become on occasion bonnet confederate and pal for his friend and may expect the same kindly office for himself if chalker wished to keep up his old acquaintance with joe gallop there must be some good reason now the only reason which suggested itself to joe at that moment was that chalker had lately drawn a new will for the old man and that he himself might be in it here he was wrong the only reason of mr chalkers friendly attitude was curiosity to know what joe was doing and how he was living look here chalker joe whispered you used to pretend to be a pal whats the good of being a pal if you wont help a fellow you see my grandfather once a week or so you shut the door and have long talks with him if you know what hes going to do with his money why not tell a fellow lets make a business matter of it how much do you know joe and what is your business proposal worth nothing at all thats the honest truthi know nothing the old mans as tight as wax but theres other business in the world besides his suppose i know of something a precious sight better than his investments and supposejust supposethat i wanted a lawyer to manage it for me well joe encore bravo encore bravo joe banged his stick on the floor and shouted because the singer ended her first song he looked so fierce and big that all the bystanders made haste to follow his example splendid isnt she he said hang the singer what do you mean by other business perhaps its nothing perhaps there will be thousands in it and perhaps i can get on without you after all very well joe get on without me if you like look here chalker joe laid a persuasive hand on the others arm cant we two be friendly why dont you give a fellow a lift all i want to know is where the old mans put his money and how hes left it suppose i do know mr chalker replied wishing ardently that he did do you think i am going to betray trusta solicitor betray trustand for nothing but if you want to talk real business joe come to my office you know where that is joe knew very well in fact there had been more than one difficulty which had been adjusted through mr chalkers not wholly disinterested aid then the singer appeared again attired in a new and startling dress and joe began once more to applaud again with voice and stick mr chalker surprised at this newlydeveloped enthusiasm for art left him and walked up the hall and sat down beside the chairman whom he seemed to know in fact the chairman was also the proprietor of the show and mr chalker was acting for him in his professional capacity much as he had acted for mr emblem who is your new singer he asked she calls herself miss carlotta claradine shes a woman let me tell you mr chalker who will get along fine figure plenty of cheek loud voice flings herself about and dont mind a bit when the words are a leetle strong thats the kind of singer the people like thats her husband at the far end of the roomthe big goodlooking chap with the light mustache and the cigarette in his mouth whew mr chalker whistled the low note which indicates surprise thats her husband is it the husband of miss carlotta claradine is it oho oho her husband are you sure he is her husband do you know him then yes i know him what was the real name of the girl charlotte smithers this is her first appearance on any stageand we made up the name for her when we first put her on the posters i made it myselfout of chlorodyne you know which is in the advertisements sounds well dont it carlotta claradine very well indeed by jove her husband is he and i suppose said the chairman lives on his wifes salary bless you mr chalker theres a whole gang about every theater and music hall trying to get hold of the promising girls its a regular profession them as have nothing but their good looks may do for the mashers but these chaps look out for the girls wholl bring in the money whats a pretty face to them compared with the handling of a big salary every week thats the sort carlottas husband belongs to well the life will suit him down to the ground and jealous with it if you please he comes here every night to applaud and takes her home himself keeps himself sober on purpose and then the lady appeared again in a wonderful costume of blue silk and tights personating the lion masher it was her third and last song in the applause which followed mr chalker could discern plainly the stick as well as the voice of his old friend and he thought how beautiful is the love of husband unto wife and he smiled thinking that when joe came next to see him he might perhaps hear truths which he had thought unknown and for certain reasons wished to remain unknown presently he saw the singer pass down the hall and join her husband who now his labors ended was seeking refreshment at the bar she was a goodlooking girlstill only a girl and apparently under twentyquietly dressed yet looking anything but quiet but that might have been due to her fringe which was so to speak a prominentfeature in her face she was tall and wellmade with large features an ample cheek a full eye and a wide mouth a goodnaturedlooking girl and though her mouth was wide it suggested smiles the husband was exchanging a little graceful badinage with the barmaid when she joined him and perhaps this made her look a little cross shes jealous too said mr chalker observant all the better yet a face which on the whole was prepossessing and good natured and betokened a disposition to make the best of the world how long has she been married mr chalker asked the proprietor only about a month or so ah mr chalker proceeded to talk business and gave no further hint of any interest in the newlymarried pair now joe said the singer with a freezing glance at the barmaid are you going to stand here all night joe drank off his glass and followed his wife into the street they walked side by side in silence until they reached their lodgings then she threw off her hat and jacket and sat down on the horsehair sofa and said abruptly i cant do it joe and i wont so dont ask me wait a bitwait a bit lotty my love dont be in a hurry now dont say rash things theres a good girl joe spoke quite softly as if he were not the least angry but perhaps a little hurt theres not a bit of a hurry you neednt decide today nor yet tomorrow i couldnt do it she said oh its a dreadful wicked thing even to ask me and only five weeks tomorrow since we married lotty my dear let us be reasonable he still spoke quite softly if we are not to go on like other people if we are to be continually bothering our heads about honesty and that rubbish we shall be always down in the world how do other people make money and get on by humbug my dear by humbug as for you a little playacting is nothing but i am not the mans daughter and my own fathers alive and well look here lotty you are always grumbling about the musichalls well and good reason to grumble if you heard those ballet girls talk and see how they go on at the back youd grumble as for the music she laughed as if against her will if anybody had told me six months agome that used to go to the cathedral service every afternoonthat i should be a lion masher at a musichall and go on dressed in tights i should have boxed his ears for impudence why you dont mean to tell me lotty that you wish you had stuck to the moldy old place and gone on selling music over the counter well then perhaps i do no no lotty your husband cannot let you say that my husband can laugh and talk with barmaids that makes him happy lotty he said you are a little fool and think of the glory posters with your name in letters a foot and a half longthe peoples favorite why dont they applaud you till their hands drop off she melted a little applaud as if that did any good and me in tights as for the tights joe replied with dignity the only person whom you need consult on that subject is your husband and since i do not object i should like to see the man who does show me that man lotty and ill straighten him out for you you have my perfect approval my dear i honor you for the tights my husbands approval she repeated his words again in a manner which had been on other occasions most irritating to him but tonight he refused to be offended of course he went on as soon as i get a berth on another ship i shall take you off the boards it is the husbands greatest delight especially if he is a jolly sailor to brave all dangers for his wife think lotty how pleasant it would be not to do any more work i should like to sing sometimes to sing good music at the great concerts thats what i thought i was going to do you shall you shall sing as little or as often as you like a sailors wife a sailors star should be you shall be a great lady lotty and you shall just command your own line wait a bit and you shall have your own carriage and your own beautiful house and go to as many balls as you like among the countesses and the swells oh joe she laughed why if we were as rich as anything i should never get ladies to call upon me and as for you no one would ever take you to be a gentleman you know why what do you call me now he laughed but without much enjoyment no one likes to be told that he is not a gentleman whatever his own suspicions on the subject may be never mind i know a gentleman when i see one go on with your nonsense about being rich i shall make you rich lotty whether you like it or not he said still with unwonted sweetness she shook her head not by wickedness she said stoutly ive got there he pulled a bundle of papers out of his pockets all the documents wanted to complete the case all i want now is for the rightful heiress to step forward im not the rightful heiress and im not the woman to step forward joe so dont you think it ive been today joe continued to doctors commons and ive seen the will theres no manner of doubt about it and the moneyoh lord lotty if you only knew how much it is what does it matter joe how much it is if it is neither yours nor mine it matters this that it ought all to be mine how can that be if it was not left to you joe was nothing if not a man of resource he therefore replied without hesitation or confusion the money was left to a certain man and to his heirs that man is dead his heiress should have succeeded but she was kept out of her rights she is dead and i am her cousin and entitled to all her property because she made no will is that gospel truth joe is she dead are you sure quite sure he replied dead as a doornail is that the way you got the papers thats the way lotty then why not go to a lawyer and make him take up the case for you and honestly get your own you dont know law my dear or you wouldnt talk nonsense about lawyers there are two ways one is to go myself to the present unlawful possessor and claim the whole its a woman she would be certain to refuse and then we should go to law and very likely lose it all although the right is on our side the other way is for some onesay youto go to her and say i am that mans daughter here are my proofs here are all his papers give me back my own that you could do in the interests of justice though i own it is not the exact truth and if she refuses then she cant refuse with the mans daughter actually standing before her she might make a fuss for a bit but she would have to give in at last joe consider you have got some papers whatever they may contain suppose that it is all true that you have told me lotty my dear when did i ever tell you an untruth when did you ever tell me the truth my dear dont talk wild suppose it is all true how are you going to make out where your heiress has been all this time and what she has been doing trust me for that i trust you for making up something or other butoh joe you little think you clever people how seldom you succeed in deceiving any one ive got such a story for you lotty as would deceive anybody listen now its part truth and partthe other thing your father my father poor dear man lotty interrupted is minding his musicshop in gloucester and little thinking what wickedness his daughter is being asked to do hang it the girls father then he died in america where he went under another name and you were picked up by strangers and reared under that name in complete ignorance of your own family all which is true and can be proved who brought her up people in america im one of em who is to prove that i am i am come to england on purpose i am her guardian who is to prove that you are the girls guardian i shall find somebody to prove that his thoughts turned to mr chalker a gentleman whom he judged capable of proving anything he was paid for and suppose they ask me questions dont answer em you know very little the papers were only found the other day you are not expected to know anything where was the real girl with her grandfather where was the grandfather what does that matter he replied i will tell you afterward when did the real girl die that too i will tell you afterward lotty leaned her cheek upon her hand and looked at her husband thoughtfully let us be plain joe you can never be plain my dear he replied with the smile of a lover not a husband never in your husbands eyes not even in tights but she was not to be won by flattery fine words she said fine words what do they amount to oh joe little i thought when you came along with your beautiful promises what sort of a man i was going to marry a very good sort of a man he said youve got a jolly sailoran officer and a gentleman come now what have you got to say to this cant you be satisfied with an officer and a gentleman he drew himself up to his full height well he was a handsome fellow there was no denying it good looks and fine words his wife went on well and now ive got to keep you and if you could make me sing in a dozen halls every night you would and spend the money on yourselfjoyfully you would we would spend it together my dear dont turn rusty lotty he was not a badtempered man and this kind of talk did not anger him at all so long as his wife worked hard and brought in the coin for him to spend what mattered for a few words now and then besides he wanted her assistance what are you driving at he went on i show you a bit of my hand and you begin talking round and round look here lotty heres a splendid chance for us i must have a womans help i would rather have your help than any other womansyes than any other womans in the world i would indeed if you wont help me why then of course i must go to some other woman his wife gasped and choked she knew already after only five weeks experience how bad a man he washow unscrupulous false and treacherous how lazy and selfish but after a fashion she loved him after a womans fashion she was madly jealous of him another woman and only the other night she had seen him giving brandyandsoda to one of the musichall balletgirls another woman if you do joe she said oh if you doi will kill her and you too he laughed if i do my dear you dont think i shall be such a fool as to tell you who she is do you suppose that no woman has ever fallen in love with me before you but then my pretty you see i dont talk about them and do you supposeoh lotty are you such a fool as to suppose that you are the first girl i ever fell in love with what do you want me to do tell me again i have told you already i want you to become for the time the daughter of the man who died in america you will claim your inheritance i will provide you with all the papers i will stand by you i will back you up with such a story as will disarm all suspicion that is all yes i understand havent people been sent to prison for less joe foolish people have not people who are well advised and under good management mind you this business is under my direction i am boss she made no reply but took her candle and went off to bed in the dead of night she awakened her husband joe she said is it true that you know another girl who would do this for you more than one lotty he replied this man of resource although he was only half awake more than one a great many more halfadozen i know at least she was silent half an hour afterward she woke him up again joe she said ive made up my mind you shant say that i refused to do for you what any other girl in the world would have done as a tempter it will be seen that joe was unsurpassed it was now a week since he had received carefully wrapped in wool and deposited in a wooden box dispatched by post a key newly made it was also very nearly a week since he had used that key it was used during mr emblems hour for tea while james waited and watched outside in an agony of terror but joe did not find what he wanted there were in the safe one or two ledgers a bankers book a checkbook and a small quantity of money but there were not any records at all of monies invested there were no railway certificates waterwork shares transfers or notes of stock mortgages loans or anything at all the only thing that he saw was a roll of papers tied up with red tape on the roll was written for iris to be given to her on her twentyfirst birthday what the deuce is this i wonder joe took this out and looked at it suspiciously can he be going to give her all his money before he dies is he going to make her inherit it at once the thought was so exasperating that he slipped the roll into his pocket at all events he said she shant have them until i have read them first i dare say they wont be missed for a day or two he calculated that he could read and master the contents that night and put back the papers in the safe in the morning while james was opening the shop theres nothing james he whispered as he went out the safe being locked again there is nothing at all look here my lad you must try another way of finding out where the money is i wish i was sure that he hasnt carried off something in his pocket james murmured joe spent the whole evening alone contrary to his usual practice which was as we have seen to spend it at a certain musichall he read the papers over and over again i wish he said at length i wish i had known this only two months ago i wish i had paid more attention to iris what a dreadful thing it is to have a grandfather who keeps secrets from his grandson what a game we might have had over this job what a game we might have still if and here he stopped for the first germ or conception of a magnificent coup dawned upon him and fairly dazzled him so that his eyes saw a bright light and nothing else if lotty would he said but i am afraid she wont hear of it he sprung to his feet and caught sight of his own face in the looking glass over the fireplace he smiled i will try he said i think i know by this time how to get round most of em once they get to feel there are other women in the world besides themselves theyre pretty easy worked i will try one has only to add to the revelations already made that joe paid a second visit to the shop this time early in the morning the shutters were only just taken down james was going about with that remarkable wateringpot only used in shops which has a little stream running out of it and mr emblem was upstairs slowly shaving and dressing in his bedroom he walked in nodded to his friend the assistant opened the safe and put back the roll now he murmured if the old man has really been such a dunderheaded pump as not to open the packet all these years what the devil can he know the name is different he hasnt got any clew to the will he hasnt got the certificate of his daughters marriage or of the childs baptismboth in the real name he hasnt got anything as for the girl here iris having the same christianname thats nothing i suppose there is more than one woman with such a fool of a name as that about in the world foxy he said cheerfully have you found anything yet about the investments odd isnt it nothing in the safe at all you can have your key back he tossed him the key carelessly and went away the question of his grandfathers savings was grown insignificant beside this great and splendid prize which lay waiting for him what could the savings be at best a few thousands the slowly saved thrift of fifty years nobody knew better than joe himself how much his own profligacies had cost his grandfather a few thousands and those settled on his cousin iris so that to get his share he would have to try every kind of persuasion unless he could get up a case for law but the other thingwhy it was nearly all personal estate so far as he could learn by the will and he had read it over and over again in the room at somerset house with the long table in it and the watchful man who wont let anybody copy anything what a shame he thought not to let wills be copied personalty sworn under a hundred and twenty thousand all in three per cents and devised to a certain young lady the testators ward in trust for the testators son or his heirs when he or they should present themselves meantime the ward was to receive for her own use and benefit year by year the whole income it is unfortunate said joe that we cant come down upon her for arrears still theres an income a steady income of three thousand six hundred a year when the sons heirs present themselves i should like to call myself a solicitor but that kite wont fly im afraid lotty must be the sole heiress dressed quiet without any powder and her fringe brushed flat shed pass for a lady anywhere perhaps its lucky after all that i married her though if i had had the good sense to make up to iris whos a deuced sight prettier shed have kept me going almost as well with her pupils and set me right with the old man and handed me over this magnificent haul for a finish if only the old man hasnt broken the seals and read the papers the old man had not and joes fears were therefore groundless chapter v as a brother arnold immediately began to use the privilege accorded to him with a large and liberal interpretation if he argued a man is to be treated as a brother there should be the immediate concession of the exchange of christiannames and he should be allowed to call as often as he pleases naturally he began by trying to read the secret of a life selfcontained so dull and yet so happy so strange to his experience is this iris he asked all your life is there nothing more no she said i think you have seen all in the morning i have my correspondence in the afternoon i do my sewing i play a little i read or i walk sometimes by myself and sometimes with lala roy in the evening i play again or i read again or i work at the mathematics while my grandfather and lala roy have their chess we used to go to the theater sometimes but of late my grandfather has not gone at ten we go to bed that is all my life but iris have you no friends at all and no relations are there no girls of your own age who come to see you no not one i have a cousin but he is not a good man at all his father and mother are in australia when he comes here which is very seldom my grandfather falls ill only with thinking about him and looking at him but i have no other relations because you see i do not know who my fathers people were then said arnold you may be countess in your own right you may have any number of rich people and nice people for your cousins do you not sometimes think of that no said iris i never think about things impossible if i were you i should go about the streets and walk round the picturegalleries looking for a face like your own there cannot be many let me draw your face iris and then we will send it to the grosvenor and label it wanted this young ladys cousins you must have cousins if you could only find them out i suppose i must but what if they should turn out to be rough and disagreeable people your cousins could not be disagreeable iris said arnold she shook her head one thing i should like she replied it would be to find that my cousins if i have any are clever peopleastronomers mathematicians great philosophers and writers but what nonsense it is even to talk of such things i am quite alone except for my grandfather and lala roy and they are old murmured arnold do not look at me with such pity said the girl i am very happy i have my own occupation i am independent i have my work to fill my mind and i have these two old gentlemen to care for and think of they have taken so much care of me that i ought to think of nothing else but their comfort and then there are the books downstairsthousands of beautiful old books always within my reach but you must have some companions if only to talk and walk with why the books are my companions and then lala roy goes for walks with me and as for talking i think it is much more pleasant to think where do you walk there is battersea park there are the squares and if you take an omnibus there are the gardens and hyde park but never alone iris oh yes i am often alone why not i suppose said arnold shirking the question because this is a civilized country and in fact why not i suppose that it is your work which keeps you from feeling life dull and monotonous no life she said looking as wise as newton if newton was ever young and handsomeno life can be dull when one is thinking about mathematics all day do you study mathematics no i was at oxford you know then perhaps you prefer metaphysics though lala roy says that the true metaphysics which he has tried to teach me can only be reached by the hindoo intellect no indeed i have never read any metaphysics whatever i have only got the english intellect this he said with intent satirical but iris failed to understand it so and thought it was meant for a commendable humility physical science perhaps no iris philosophy mathematics physics metaphysics or science of any kind have i never learned except only the science of heraldry which you have taught me with a few other things oh she wondered how a man could exist at all without learning these things not any science at all how can any one live without some science i knew very well he said that as soon as i was found out i should be despised oh no not despised but it seems such a pity there is another kind of life iris which you do not know you must let me teach you it is the life of art if you would only condescend to show the least curiosity about me iris i would try to show you something of the art life how can i show curiosity about you arnold i feel none no that is just the thing which shames me i have felt the most lively curiosity about you and i have asked you thousands of impertinent questions not impertinent arnold if you want to ask any more pray do i dare say you cannot understand my simple life and you ask me nothing at all about myself it isnt fair iris why should i i know you already you know nothing at all about me oh yes i know you very well indeed i knew you before you came here you showed me yourself in your letters you are exactly like the portrait i drew of you i never thought for instance that you were an old gentleman as you thought me he laughed it was a new thing to see iris using even gently the dainty weapons of satire but you do not know what i am or what is my profession or anything at all about me no i do not care to know all that is not part of yourself it is outside you and because you thought you knew me from those letters you suffer me to come here and be your disciple still yet you gave me back my letters that was because they were written to me under a wrong impression will you have them back again she shook her head i know them all by heart she said simply there was not the slightest sign of coquetry or flattery in her voice or in her eyes which met his look with clear and steady gaze i cannot ask you to read my portrait to me as you drew it from those pictures why not she began to read him his portrait as readily as if she were stating the conclusion of a problem i saw that you were young and full of generous thoughts sometimes you were indignant with things as they are but generally you laughed at them and accepted them it is it seems the nature of your friends to laugh a great deal at things which they ought to remedy if they could not laugh at them i thought that you wanted some strong stimulus to work anybody could see that you were a man of kindly nature and goodbreeding you were careful not to offend by anything that you wrote and i was certain that you were a man of honor i trusted you arnold before i saw your face because i knew your soul trust me still iris he said in rather a husky voice of course i did not know and never thought what sort of a man you were to look at yet i ought to have known that you were handsome i should have guessed that from the very tone of your letters a hunchback or a cripple could not have written in so lighthearted a strain and i should have discovered if i had thought of such a thing that you were very well satisfied with your personal appearance young men should always be that at least if only to give them confidence oh irisoh do you really think me conceited i did not say that i only said that you were satisfied with yourself that i understand now was clear from many little natural touches in your letters what else did you learn oh a great dealmuch more than i can tell you i knew that you go into society and i learned from you what society means and though you tried to be sarcastic i understood easily that you liked social pleasure was i sarcastic was it not sarcastic to tell me how the fine ladies who affect so much enthusiasm for art go to see the galleries on the privateview day and are never seen in them again was it not sarcastic spare me iris i will never do it again and knowing so much do you not desire to know more no arnold i am not interested in anything else but my position my profession my peopleare you not curious to know them no they are not you they are accidents of yourself philosopher but you must know more about me i told you i was an artist but you have never inquired whether i was a great artist or a little one you are still a little artist she said i know that without being told but perhaps you may become great when you learn to work seriously i have been lazy he replied with something like a blush but that is all over now i am going to work i will give up society i will take my profession seriously if only you will encourage me did he mean what he said when he came away he used at this period to ask himself that question and was astonished at the length he had gone with any other girl in the world he would have been taken at his word and either encouraged to go on or snubbed on the spot but iris received these advances as if they were a confession of weakness why do you want me to encourage you she asked i know nothing about art cant you encourage yourself arnold iris i must tell you something more about myself will you listen for a moment well i am the son of a clergyman who now holds a colonial appointment i have got the usual number of brothers and sisters who are doing the usual things i will not bore you with details about them no said iris please do not i am the adopted son or ward or whatever you please of a certain cousin she is a single lady with a great income which she promises to bequeath to me in the future in the meantime i am to have whatever i want do you understand the position iris yes i think so it is interesting because it shows why you will never be a great artist but it is very sad a man may rise above his conditions iris said arnold meekly no she went on it is only the poor men who do anything good lala roy says so i will pretend to be poorindeed i am poor i have nothing if it were not for my cousin i could not even profess to follow art what a pity she said that you are rich lala roy was rich once arnold repressed an inclination to desire that lala roy might be kept out of the conversation but he gave up all his wealth and has been happy and a philosopher ever since i cant give up my wealth iris because i havent got anyi owe my cousin everything but for her i should never even have known you he watched her at her work in the morning when she sat patiently answering questions working out problems and making papers she showed him the letters of her pupils exacting excusing petulantsometimes dissatisfied and even illtempered he watched her in the afternoon while she sewed or read in the evening he sat with her while the two old men played their game of chess regularly every evening at halfpast nine the bengalee checkmated mr emblem up to that hour he amused himself with his opponent formed ingenious combinations watched openings and gradually cleared the board until he found himself as the hour of halfpast nine drew near able to propose a simple problem to his own mind such as white moves first to mate in three four or five moves and then he proceeded to solve that problem and checkmated his adversary no one not even iris knew how lala roy lived or what he did in the daytime it was rumored that he had been seen at simpsons in the strand but this report wanted confirmation he had lived in mr emblems second floor for twenty years he always paid his bills with regularity and his long spare figure and white mustache and fez were as well known in chelsea as any redcoated lounger among the old veterans of the hospital it is quiet for you in the evenings said arnold i play to them sometimes they like to hear me play during the game look at them she sat down and played she had a delicate touch and played soft music such as soothes not excites the soul arnold watched her not the old men how was it that refinement grave selfpossession manners and the culture of a lady could be found in one who knew no ladies but then arnold did not know lala roy nor did he understand the old bookseller you are always wondering about me she said talking while she played i see it in your eyes can you not take me as i am without thinking why i am different from other girls of course i am different because i know none of them i wish they were all like you he said no that would be a great pity you want girls who understand your own life and can enter into your pursuitsyou want companions who can talk to you go back to them arnold as soon as you are tired of coming here and yet his instinct was right which told him that the girl was not a coquette she had no thoughtnot the least thoughtas yet that anything was possible beyond the existing friendship it was pleasant but arnold would get tired of her and go back to his own people then he would remain in her memory as a study of character this she did not exactly formulate but she had that feeling every woman makes a study of character about every man in whom she becomes ever so little interested but we must not get conceited my brothers over this fact the converse unhappily does not hold true very few men ever study the character of a woman at all either they fall in love with her before they have had time to make more than a sketch and do not afterward pursue the subject or they do not fall in love with her at all and in the latter case it hardly seems worth while to follow up a first rough draft checkmate said lala roy the game was finished and the evening over would you like he said another evening to see my studio or do you consider my studio outside myself i should very much like to see an artists studio she replied with her usual frankness leaving it an open question whether she would not be equally pleased to see any other studio she came however accompanied by lala roy who had never been in a studio before and indeed had never looked at a picture except with the contemptuous glance which the philosopher bestows upon the follies of mankind yet he came because iris asked him arnolds studio is one of the smallest of those in tite street of course it is built of red brick and of course it has a noble staircase and a beautiful paintingroom or studio proper all set about with bits of tapestry armor pictures and china besides the tools and properties of the craft he had portfolios full of sketches against the wall stood pictures finished and unfinished on an easel was a halfpainted picture representing a group taken from a modern novel most painters only draw scenes from two novelsthe vicar of wakefield and don quixote but arnold knew more the central figure was a girl quite unfinishedin fact barely sketched in iris looked at everything with the interest which belongs to the new and unexpected arnold began to show the pictures in the portfolios there were sketches of peasant life in norway and on the continent there were landscapes quaint old houses and castles there were ships and ports and there were headshundreds of heads i said you might be a great artist said iris i am sure now that you will be if you choose thank you iris it is the greatest compliment you could pay me and what is this she was before the easel on which stood the unfinished picture it is a scene from a novel but i cannot get the principal face none of the models are half good enough i want a sweet face a serious face a face with deep beautiful eyes irisit was a sudden impulse an inspirationlet me put your face there give me my first commission she blushed deeply all these drawings the multitudinous faces and heads and figures in the portfolio were a revelation to her and just at the very moment when she discovered that arnold was one of those who worship beautya thing she had never before understoodhe told her that her face was so beautiful that he must put in his picture oh arnold she said my face would be out of place in that picture would it please sit down and let me make a sketch he seized his crayons and began rapidly what do you say lala roy he asked by way of diversion the gifts of the understanding said the sage are the treasures of the lord and he appointeth to every one his portion thank you replied arnold very true and very apt im sure iris please your face turned just a little so ah if i can but do some measure of justice to your eyes when iris went away there was for the first time the least touch of restraint or selfconsciousness in her arnold felt it she showed it in her eyes and in the touch of her fingers when he took her hand at parting it was then for the first time also that arnold discovered a truth of overwhelming importance every new facteverything which cannot be disputed or denied is we all know of the most enormous importance he discovered no less a truth than that he was in love with iris so important is this truth to a young man that it reduces the countless myriads of the world to a single pairhimself and another it converts the most arid waste of streets into an eden and it blinds the eyes to ambition riches and success arnold sat down and reasoned out this truth he said coldly and squarely this is a girl whom i have known only a fortnight or so she lives over a secondhand bookshop she is a teacher by profession she knows none of the ways of society she would doubtless be guilty of all kinds of queer things if she were suddenly introduced to good people probably she would never learn our manners with more to the same effect which may be reasonably omitted then his conscience woke up and said quite simply arnold you are a liar conscience does sometimes call hard names she is feminine and therefore privileged to call hard names else we would sometimes kick and belabor conscience arnold dont tell more lies you have been gradually learning to know iris through the wisest and sweetest letters that were ever written for a whole year you gradually began to know her in fact when you first began to interlard your letters with conceited revelations about yourself you knew her to be sympathetic quick and of a most kind and tender heart you are quite sure though you try to disguise the fact that she is as honest as the day and as true as steel as for her not being a lady you ought to be ashamed of yourself for even thinking such a thing has she not been tenderly brought up by two old men who are full of honor and truth and all the simple virtues does she not look move and speak like the most gracious lady in the land like a goddess arnold confessed as for the ways and talk of society what are these worth and cannot they be acquired and what are her manners save those of the most perfect refinement and purity thus far conscience then arnold or arnolds secret advocatus diaboli began upon another and quite different line she must have schemed at the outset to get me into her net she is a siren she assumes the disguise of innocence and ignorance the better to beguile and to deceive she has gone home today elated because she thinks she has landed a gentleman conscience said nothing there are some things to which conscience has no reply in words to offer yet conscience pointed to the portrait of the girl and bade the most unworthy of all lovers look upon even his own poor and meager representation of her eyes and face and ask whether such blasphemies could ever be forgiven after a self abasement which for shames sake we must pass over the young man felt happier henry the second felt much the same satisfaction the morning after his scourging at the hands of the monks who were as muscular as they were vindictive chapter vi cousin clara that man who spends his days in painting a girls portrait in talking to her and in gazing upon the unfinished portrait when she is not with him and occupies his thoughts during the watches of the night in thinking about her is perilously near to taking the last and fatal step flight for such a man is the only thing left and he so seldom thinks of flight until it is too late arnold was at this point i am possessed by this girl he might have said had he put his thoughts into words i am haunted by her eyes her voice lingers on my ears i dream of her face the touch of her fingers is like the touch of an electric battery what symptoms are these so common that one is almost ashamed to write them down but the infallible symptoms of love and yet he hesitated not because he doubted himself any longer but because he was not independent and such an engagement might deprive him at one stroke of all that he possessed might it certainly would yes the new and beautiful studio all the things in it all his prospects for the future would have to be given up she is worth more than that said arnold and i should find work somehow but yet to plunge her into povertyand to make clara the most unhappy of women the reason why clara would be made the most unhappy of women was that clara was his cousin and his benefactor to whom he owed everything she was the kindest of patrons and she liked nothing so much as the lavishing upon her ward everything that he could desire but she also unfortunately illustrated the truth of chaucers teaching in that she loved power more than anything else and had already mapped out arnolds life for him it was his custom to call upon her daily to use her house as his own when they were separated they wrote to each other every day the relations between them were of the most intimate and affectionate kind he advised in all her affairs while she directed his it was understood that he was her heir and though she was not more than five and forty or so and had apparently a long life still before her so that the succession was distant the prospect gave him importance she had been out of town and perhaps the fact of a new acquaintance with so obscure a person as a simple tutor by correspondence seemed to arnold not worth mentioning at all events he had not mentioned it in his daily letters and now she was coming home she was actually arrived he would see her that evening her last letter was lying before him i parted from dear stella yesterday she goes to stay with the essex mainwarings for a month after that i hope that she will give me a long visit i do not know where one could find a sweeter girl or one more eminently calculated to make a man happy beautiful strictly speaking she is not perhaps but of excellent connections not without a portion young clever and ambitious with such a wife my dear arnold a man may aspire to anything to anything repeated arnold what is her notion of anything she has arrived by this time he looked at his watch and found it was past five i ought to have been at the station to meet her i must go round and see her and i must dine with her tonight he sighed heavily it would be much pleasanter to spend the evening with iris then a carriage stopped at his door it was his cousin and the next minute he was receiving and giving the kiss of welcome for his own part he felt guilty because he could put so little heart into that kiss compared with all previous embraces she was a stout hearty little woman who could never have been in the least beautiful even when she was young now on the middle line between forty and fifty she looked as if her face had been chopped out of the marble by a rude but determined artist one who knew what he wanted and would tolerate no conventional work so that her face at all events was if not unique at least unlike any other face one had ever seen most faces we know can be reduced to certain general typeseven iriss face might be classifiedwhile of yours my brother there are no doubt multitudes miss holland however had good eyesbright clear graythe eyes of a woman who knows what she wants and means to get it if she can well my dear she said taking the one comfortable chair in the studio i am back again and i have enjoyed my journey very much we will have all the travels this evening you are looking splendid arnold i am very well indeed and you clara but i need not ask no i am always well i told you about dear stella did i not i never had a more delightful companion so glad you liked her if only arnold you would like her too but i knowfor arnold changed colori know one must not interfere in these matters but surely one may go so far with a young man one loves as to say here is a girl of a million there is not arnold i declare her equal anywhere a clearer head i never met or a better educated girl or one who knows what a man can do and how he can be helped to do it thank you clara arnold said coldly i dare say i shall discover the young ladys perfections in time not i think without some help she is not an ordinary girl you must draw her out my dear boy i will he said listlessly i will try to draw her out if you like we talked a great deal of you arnold clara went on i confided to her some of my hopes and ambitions for you and i am free to confess to you that she has greatly modified all my plans and calculations oh arnold was interested in this but my dear clara i have my profession i must follow my profession surelysurely listen arnold patiently anybody can become an artistanybody of course who has the genius and all kinds of people gutter people have the genius the sun said arnold just as if he had been lala roy shines on all alike quite so and there is an immense enthusiasm for art everywhere but there is no art leader there is no one man recognized as the man most competent to speak on art of every kind think of that it is stellas idea entirely this man when he is found will sway enormous authority he will become if he has a wife able to assist him an immense social power and you want me to become that man yes arnold i do not see why you should not become that man cease to think of becoming president of the royal academy yet go on painting prove your genius so as to command respect cultivate the art of public speaking and look about for a wife who will be your right hand think of this seriously this is only a rough sketch we can fill in the details afterward but think of it oh my dear boy if i were only a man and fiveandtwenty with such a chance before me what a glorious career is yours if you choose but of course you will choose good gracious arnold who is that she pointed to the canvas on the easel where iriss face was like the tale of cambuscan half told it is no one you know clara one of your models she rose and examined it more closely through her glasses the eyes are wonderful arnold they are eyes i know as if i could ever forget them they are the same eyes exactly the same eyes i have never met with any like them before they are the eyes of my poor lost betrayed claude deseret where did you pick up this girl arnold is she a common model not at all she is not a model she is a young lady who teaches by correspondence she is my tutorof course i have so often talked to you about herwho taught me the science of heraldry and wrote me such charming letters your tutor you said your tutor was an old gentleman so i thought clara but i was wrong my tutor is a young lady and this is her portrait halffinished it does not do her any kind of justice a young lady she looked suspiciously at arnold whose telltale cheek flushed a young lady indeed and you have made her acquaintance as you see clara and she does me the honor to let me paint her portrait what is her name arnold she is a miss aglen strange the deserets once intermarried with the aglens i wonder if she is any connection they were warwickshire aglens but it is impossiblea teacher by correspondence a mere private governess who are her people she lives with her grandfather i think her father was a tutor or journalist of some kind but he is dead and her grandfather keeps a secondhand bookshop in the kings road close by a bookshop but you said arnold that she was a young lady so she is clara he replied simply arnold for the first time in his life arnold saw his cousin angry with him she was constantly being angry with other people but never before had she been angry with him arnold spare me this nonsense if you have been playing with this shopgirl i cannot help it and i beg that you will tell me no more about it and do not to my face speak of her as a lady i have not been playing with her i think said arnold gravely i have been very serious with her everybody nowadays is a young lady the girl who gives you a cup of tea in a shop the girl who dances in the ballet the girl who makes your dresses in that case clara you need not mind my calling miss aglen a young lady there is one word left at least women of my class are gentlewomen miss aglen is a gentlewoman arnold look me in the face my dear boy tell me are you mad oh think of my poor unhappy claude what he did and what he must have suffered i know what he did i do not know what he suffered my case however is different from his i am not engaged to any one arnold think of the great scheme of life i have drawn out for you my dear boy would you throw that all away she laid her hands upon his arm and looked in his eyes with a pitiful gaze he took her hands in his my dear every man must shape his life for himself or must live out the life shaped for him by his fate not by his friends what if i see a life more delightful to me than that of which you dream you talk of a delightful life arnold i spoke of an honorable career mine will be a life of quiet work and love yours clara would be of noisy and troublesome work without love without love arnold you are infatuated she sunk into the chair and buried her face in her hands first it was her lover who had deserted her for the sake of a governess the daughter of some london tradesman and now her adopted son almost the only creature she loved for whom she had schemed and thought for nearly twenty years was ready to give up everything for the sake of another governess also connected with the lower forms of commercial interests it is very hard arnold she said no dont try to persuade me i am getting an old woman and it is too late for me to learn that a gentleman can be happy unless he marries a lady you might as well ask me to look for happiness with a grocer not quite said arnold it is exactly the same thing pray have you proposed to thisthis young lady of the secondhand bookshop no i have not you are in love with her however i am clara and you intend to ask herin the shop i dare say among the secondhand booksto become your wife that is my serious intention clara claude did the same thing his father remonstrated with him in vain he took his wife to london where for a time he lived in misery and selfreproach do you know that he reproached himself i know what must have happened when he found out his mistake then he went to america where he died no doubt in despair although his father had forgiven him the cases are hardly parallel said arnold still will you permit me to introduce miss aglen to you if she should do me the honor of accepting me be generous clara do not condemn the poor girl without seeing her i condemn no onei judge no one not even you arnold but i will not receive that young woman very well clara how shall you live arnold she asked coldly it was the finishing strokethe dismissal i suppose we shall not marry but of course i am talking as if as if she was ready to jump into your arms go on we shall not marry until i have made some kind of a beginning in my work clara let us have no further explanation i understand perfectly well but my dear clara he laid his arm upon her neck and kissed her i shall not let you quarrel with me i owe you too much and i love you too well i am always your most faithful of servants no till you are marriedthenoh arnold arnold a less strongminded woman would have burst into tears clara did not she got into her carriage and drove home she spent a miserable evening and a sleepless night but she did not cry chapter vii on battersea terrace if a woman were to choose any period of her life which she pleased for indefinite prolongation she would certainly select that period which lies between the first perception of the first symptomswhen she begins to understand that a man has begun to love herand the day when he tells her so yet women who look back to this period with so much fondness and regret forget their little tremors and misgivingsthe selfdistrust the hopes and fears the doubts and perplexities which troubled this time for although it is acknowledged and has been taught by all philosophers from king lemuel and laokiun downward that no greater prize can be gained by any man than the love of a good woman which is better than a peeragebetter than a bonanza minebetter than name and fame kudos and the newspaper paragraph and is arrived at by much less exertion being indeed the special gift of the gods to those they love yet all women perfectly understand the other side to this great truthnamely that no greater happiness can fall to any woman than the love of a good man so that in all the multitudinous and delightful courtships which go on around us and in our midst there is on both sides both with man and with maid among those who truly reach to the right understanding of what this great thing may mean a continual distrust of self with humility and anxiety and when as sometimes happens a girl has been brought up in entire ignorance of love so that the thought of it has never entered her head the thing itself when it falls upon her is overwhelming and infolds her as with a garment from head to foot and except to her lover she becomes as a sealed fountain i know not how long this season of expectation would have lasted for iris but for arnolds conversation with his cousin which persuaded him to speak and bring matters to a final issue to this girl living as secluded as if she was in an oriental harem who had never thought of love as a thing possible for herself the consciousness that arnold loved her was bewildering and astonishing and she waited knowing that sooner or later something would be said but trembling for fear that it should be said after all it was lala roy and not clara who finally determined arnold to wait no longer he came every day to the studio with iris when she sat for her portrait this was in the afternoon but he now got into the habit of coming in the morning and would sit in silence looking on he came partly because he liked the young man and partly because the painters art was new to him and it amused him to watch a man giving his whole time and intellect to the copying or faces and things on canvas also he was well aware by this time that it was not to see mr emblem or himself that arnold spent every evening at the house and he was amused to watch the progress of an english courtship in india we know they manage matters differently and so as to give the bridegroom no more trouble than is necessary this young man however took he observed the most wonderful pains and the most extraordinary trouble to please do you know lala roy arnold said one morning after a silence of three hours or so do you know that this is going to be the portrait of the most beautiful woman in the world and the best it is well said the philosopher when a young man desires virtue as well as beauty you have known her all her life dont trouble yourself to speak lala you can nod your head if there isnt a maxim ready you began to lodge in the house twenty years ago and you have seen her every day since if she is not the best as well as the most beautiful girl in the world you ought to know and can contradict me but you do know it happy is the man said the sage who shall call her wife happy the children who shall call her mother i suppose lala arnold went on with an ingenuous blush i suppose that you have perceived thatthatin facti love her the philosopher inclined his head do you thinkyou who know her so wellthat she suspects or knows it the thoughts of a maiden are secret thoughts as well may one search for the beginnings of a river as inquire into the mind of a woman their ways are not our ways nor are their thoughts ours nor have we wit to understand nor have they tongue to utter the things they think i know not whether she suspects yet you have had experience lala roy a smile stole over the sages features in the old days when i was young i had experience as all men have i have had many wives yet to me as to all others the thoughts of the harem are unknown yet irissurely you know the thoughts of iris your pupil i know only that her heart is the abode of goodness and that she knows not any evil thought young man beware trouble not the clear fountain heaven knows said arnold i would not and here he stopped youth said the sage presently is the season for love enjoy the present happiness woman is made to be loved receive with gratitude what heaven gives the present moment is your own defer not until the evening what you may accomplish at noon with these words the oracle became silent and arnold sat down and began to think it all over again an hour later he presented himself at the house in the kings road iris was alone and she was playing you arnold it is early for you forgive me iris for breaking in on your afternoon but i thoughtit is a fine afternooni thought that perhapsyou have never taken a walk with me she blushed i think in sympathy with arnold who looked confused and stammered and then she said she would go with him they left the kings road by the royal avenue where the leaves were already thin and yellow and passed through the hospital and its broad grounds down to the riverside then they turned to the right and walked along the embankment where are the great new red houses to cheyne walk and so across the suspension bridge arnold did not speak one word the whole way his heart was so full that he could not trust himself to speak who would not be fourandtwenty again even with all the risks and dangers of life before one the set traps the gaping holes and the treacherous quicksands if it were only to feel once more the overwhelming spirit of the mysterious goddess of the golden cestus in silence they walked side by side over the bridge halfway across they stopped and looked up the river the tide was running in with a swift current and the broad river was nearly at the full the strong september sun fell upon the water which was broken into little waves under a fresh breeze meeting the current from the northwest there were lighters and barges majestically creeping up stream some with brown threecornered sails set in the bows and stern some slowly moving with the tide their bows kept steady by long oars and some lashed one to the other forming a long train and pulled along by a noisy little tug all paddle wheel and engine there was a sculler vigorously practicing for his next race and dreaming perhaps of sending a challenge to hanlan there were some boys in a rowingboat laughing and splashing each other on the north bank there was the garden of the embankment with its young trees still green for the summer lasted into late september this year and beyond the red brick tower of the old church with its flag post on the top these details are never so carefully marked as when one is anxious and fully absorbed in things of great importance perhaps arnold had crossed the bridge a hundred times before but to day for the first time he noticed the common things of the river one may be an artist and yet may miss the treasures that lie at the very feet this is a remark which occurs to one with each new academy show with every tide the boats go up and down with their brown sails and always the tower of chelsea church rises above the trees and the broad river never forgets to sparkle and to glow in the sunshine when it gets the chance such common things are for the most part unheeded but when the mind is anxious and full they force themselves upon one arnold watched boats and river and sunshine on the sails with a strange interest and wonder as one sees visions in a dream he had seen all these things before yet now he noticed them for the first time and all the while he was thinking what he should say to iris and how he should approach the subject i know not whether iris like him saw one thing and noticed another the thoughts of a maiden as lala roy said are secret thoughts she looked upon the river from the bridge with arnold when he turned she turned with him and neither spoke they left the bridge and passed through the wooden gate at the battersea end of it and across the corner where the stone columns lie like an imitation of tadmor in the desert and so to the broad terrace overlooking the river there is not anywhere a more beautiful terrace than this of battersea park especially when the tide is high before it lies the splendid river with the barges which arnold had seen from the bridge they are broad and flat and sometimes squat and sometimes black with coal and sometimes they go up and down sideways in lubberly dutch fashion but they are always picturesque and beyond the river is the embankment with its young trees which will before many years be tall and stately trees and behind the trees are the new red palaces and above the houses at this time of the year and day are the flying clouds already colored with the light of the sinking sun behind the terrace are the trees and lawns of the bestkept park in london in the afternoon of a late september day there are not many who walk in these gardens arnold and iris had the terrace almost to themselves save for halfadozen girls with children and two or three old men making the most of the last summer they were ever likely to see though it would have been cruel to tell them so this is your favorite walk iris said arnold at last breaking the silence yes i come here very often it is my garden sometimes in the winter and when the east wind blows up the river i have it all to myself a quiet life iris he said and a happy life yes a happy life iris will you change it for a life which will not be so quiet he took her hand but she made no reply i must tell you iris because i cannot keep it from you any longer i love youoh my dear i cannot tell you how i love you oh arnold she whispered it had come the thing she feared to hear may i go on i have told you now the most important thing and the rest matters little oh iris may i go on and tell you all go on she said tell me all as for telling you everything he said with a little laugh that is no new thing i have told you all that is in my mind for a year and more it seems natural that i should tell you this too even if it did not concern you at all but some other girl though that would be impossible i love you iris i love youi should like to say nothing more but i must tell you as well that i am quite a poor man i am an absolute pauper i have nothing at allno money no work nothing my studio and all must go back to her and yet iris in spite of this i am so selfish as to tell you that i love you i would give you if i could the most delightful palace in the world and i offer you a share in the uncertain life of an artist who does not know whether he has any genius or whether he is fit even to be called an artist she gave him her hand with the frankness which was her chief charm and with a look in her eyes so full of trust and truth that his heart sunk within him for very fear lest he should prove unworthy of so much confidence oh arnold she said i think that i have loved you all along ever since you began to write to me and yet i never thought that love would come to me he led her into that bosky grove set with seats convenient for lovers which lies romantically close to the italian restaurant where they sell the cocoa and the ginger beer there was no one in the place besides themselves and here among the falling leaves and in a solitude as profound as on the top of a dartmoor tor arnold told the story of his love again and with greater coherence though even more passion oh said iris again how could you love me arnoldhow could you love any girl so it is a shame arnold we are not worth so much could any woman she thought be worth the wealth of passion and devotion which her lover poured out for her my tutor he went on if you only knew what things you have taught me a man of experience if i admired you when i thought you must be a man and pictured an old scholar full of books and wisdom what could i do when i found that a young girl had written those letters you gave mine back to me did you think that i would ever part with yours and you ownedoh iris what would not the finished woman of the world give to have the secret of your poweryou owned that you knew all my letters every one by heart and after all you will love me your disciple and pupil and a man who has his way to make from the very beginning and first round of the ladder think iris first is it right to throw away so much upon a man who is worth so little but i am glad that you are poor if you were rich i should have been afraidoh not of you arnoldnever of you but of your people and besides it is so goodoh so very good for a young mana young man of the best kind not my cousins kindto be poor nobody ought ever to be allowed to become rich before he is fifty years of age at the very least because now you will have to work in earnest and you will become a great artistyes a truly great artist and we shall be proud of you you shall make of me what you please and what you can for your sake iris i wish i were another raphael you are my mistress and my queen bid me to die and i will dareiris i swear that the words of the extravagant old song are real to me nay she said not your queen but your servant always surely love cannot command but i think she added softly with a tender blush i thinknay i am sure and certain that it can obey he stooped and kissed her fingers my love he murmured my lovemy love the shadows lengthened and the evening fell but those two foolish people sat side by side and hand in hand and what they said further we need not write down because to tell too much of what young lovers whisper to each other is a kind of sacrilege at last arnold became aware that the sun was actually set and he sprung to his feet they walked home again across the suspension bridge in the western sky was hanging a huge bank of cloud all bathed in purple red and gold the river was ablaze the barges floated in a golden haze the light shone on their faces and made them all glorious like the face of moses for they too had stoodnay they were still standingat the very gates of heaven see iris said the happy lover the day is done your old life is finished it has been a happy time and it sets in glory and splendor the red light in the west is a happy omen of the day to come so he took her hand and led her over the river and then to his own studio in tite street there in the solemn twilight he held her in his arms and renewed the vows of love with kisses and fond caresses iris my dearmy dearyou are mine and i am yours what have i done to deserve this happy fate chapter viii the discovery at nine oclock that evening mr emblem looked up from the chess board where is mr arbuthnot this evening my dear he asked it would be significant in some houses when a young man is expected every evening iris blushed and said that perhaps he was not coming but he was and his step was on the stair as she spoke you are late mr arbuthnot said mr emblem reproachfully you are late sir and somehow we get no music now until you come play us something iris it is my move lala iris opened the piano and arnold sat down beside her and their eyes met there was in each the consciousness of what had passed i shall speak to him tonight iris arnold whispered i have already written to my cousin do not be hurt if she does not call upon you nothing of that sort will hurt me iris said being ignorant of social ways and without the least ambition to rise in the world if your cousin does not call upon me i shall not be disappointed why should she want to know me but i am sorry arnold that she is angry with you lala roy just then found himself in presence of a most beautiful problemwhite to move and checkmate in three moves mr emblem found the meshes of fate closing round him earlier than usual and both bent their heads closely over the table checkmate said lala roy my friend you have played badly this evening i have played badly mr emblem replied because tomorrow will be an important day for iris and for myself a day iris that i have been looking forward to for eighteen years ever since i got your fathers last letter written upon his deathbed it seems a long time but like a lifetime said the old man of seventyfive it is as nothing when it is gone eighteen years and you were a little thing of three child what is going to happen to me grandfather except that i shall be twentyone we shall see tomorrow patience my dearpatience he spread out his hands and laughed what was going to happen to himself was a small thing compared with the restoration of iris to her own mr emblem said arnold i also have something of importance to say you too mr arbuthnot cannot yours wait also until tomorrow no it is too important it cannot wait an hour well sirmr emblem pushed up his spectacles and leaned back in his chairwell mr arbuthnot let us have it i think you may guess what i have to say mr emblem i am sure that lala roy has already guessed it the philosopher inclined his head in assent it is that i have this afternoon asked iris to marry me mr emblem and she has consented have you consented iris my dear said her grandfather she placed her hand in arnolds for reply do you think you know him well enough my dear mr emblem asked gravely looking at her lover marriage is a serious thing it is a partnership for life children think well before you venture on the happiness or ruin of your whole lives and you are so young what a pitywhat a thousand pities that people were not ordained to marry at seventy or so we have thought well said arnold iris has faith in me then young man i have nothing to say iris will marry to please herself and i pray that she may be happy as for you i like your face and manners but i do not know who you are nor what your means may be remember that i am poori am so poori can tell you all now that tomorrow we shallwell patiencetomorrow i shall most likely have my very stock seized and sold your stock sold oh grandfather cried iris and you did not tell me and i have been so happy friend said lala was it well to hide this from me foolish people mr emblem went on have spread reports that i am rich and have saved money for iris it is not true mr arbuthnot i am not rich iris will come to you emptyhanded and as for me i have nothing said arnold except a pair of hands and all the time there is so we have all to gain and nothing to lose you have your profession said iris and i have mine grandfather do not fear even though we shall all four become poor together it seemed natural to include lala roy who had been included with them for twenty years as for iris being emptyhanded said arnold how can that ever be why she carries in her hands an inexhaustible cornucopia full of precious things my dear said the old man holding out his arms to her i could not keep you always some day i knew you would leave me it is well that you should leave me when i am no longer able to keep a roof over your head but we shall find a roof for you grandfather somewhere we shall never part the best of girls always said mr emblem the best of girls mr arbuthnot you are a happy man then the sage lifted up his voice and said solemnly on her tongue dwelleth music the sweetness of honey floweth from her lips humility is like a crown of glory about her head her eye speaketh softness and love her husband putteth his heart in her bosom and findeth joy oh you are all too good to me murmured iris a friend of mine said mr emblem now like nearly all my friends beneath the sod used to say that a good marriage was a happy blending of the finest wallsend with the most delicate silkstone but he was in the coal trade for my own part i have always thought that it is like the binding of two scarce volumes into one oh not secondhand volumes grandfather said iris i dont know certainly not new ones not volumes under oneandtwenty if you please mr arbuthnot i am glad you will know why very soon i am very glad that iris made her choice before her twentyfirst birthday whatever may happen now no one can say that either of you was influenced by any expectations you both think yourself paupers well i say nothing because i know nothing but children if a great thing happen to you and that before fourandtwenty hours have passed be preparedbe prepared i sayto receive it with moderate rejoicing tomorrow iris asked why tomorrow why not tonight if you have a secret to tell us your father enjoined in his last letter to wait till you were twentyone the eve of your birthday however is the same thing as your birthday we will open the papers tonight what i have to tell you iris shall be told in the presence of your lover whatever it isgood or bad he led the way downstairs into the back shop here he lit the gas and began to open his case slowly and cautiously eighteen years ago iris my child i received your fathers last letter written on his death bed this i have already told you he set down in that letter several things which surprised me very much we shall come to these things presently he also laid down certain instructions for your bringing up my dear i was first of all to give you as good an education as i could afford i was to keep you as much as possible separated from companions who might not be thought afterward fit to be the friends of a young lady you have as good an education as lala roy and i could devise between us from him you have learned mathematics so as to steady your mind and make you exact and you have learned the science of heraldry from me so that you may at once step into your own place in the polite world where no doubt it is a familiar and a necessary study you have also learned music because that is an accomplishment which every one should possess what more can any girl want for any station my dear i am happy to think that a gentleman is your lover let him tell us nowlala roy and meto our very faces if he thinks we have between us made you a lady arnold stooped and kissed her hand there is no more perfect lady he said in all the land iriss father mr arbuthnot was a gentleman of honorable and ancient family and i will tell you presently as soon as i find it out myself his real name as for his coatofarms he bore quarterly first and fourth two roses and a boars head erect second and third gules and fesse betweenstrange now that i have forgotten what it was between everybody calls himself a gentleman nowadays even mr chalker who is going to sell me up i suppose but everybody if you please is not armiger iris your father was armiger i suppose i am a gentleman on sundays when i go to church with iris and wear a black coat but your father my dear though he married my daughter was a gentleman by birth and one who knows heraldry respects a gentleman by birth he laid his hand now on the handle of the safe as if the time were nearly come for opening it but not quite he sent me with this last letter a small parcel for you my dear not to be opened until you reached the age of twentyone as for the person who had succeeded to his inheritance she was to be left in peaceable possession for a reason which he gavequite a romantic story which i will tell you presentlyuntil you came of age he was very urgent on this point if however any disaster of sickness or misfortune fell upon me i was to act in your interests at once without waiting for time children the old man added solemnly by the blessing of heaveni cannot take it as anything lessi have been spared in health and fortune until this day now let me depart in peace for my trust is expired and my child is safe her inheritance secured with a younger and better protector he placed the key in the door of the safe i do not know mind he said still hesitating to take the final step i do not know the nature of the inheritance it may be little or maybe great the letter does not inform me on this point i do not even know the name of the testator my soninlaws father nor do i know the name of my daughters husband i do not even know your true name iris my child but it is not aglen then have i been going under a false name all my life it was the name your father chose to bear for reasons which seemed good and sufficient to him and these are part of the story which i shall have to tell you will you have this story first or shall we first open the safe and read the contents of the parcel first said arnold let us sit down and look in each others faces it was a practical suggestion but as it proved it was an unlucky one because it deprived them of the story iris he said while they waited this is truly wonderful oh arnold what am i to do with an inheritance that depends on what it is perhaps it is a landed estate in which case we shall not be much better off and can go on with our work perhaps there will be houses perhaps it will be thousands of pounds and perhaps hundreds shall we build a castle in the air to suit our inheritance yes let us pretend oh grandfather stop one moment our castle arnold shall be first of all the most beautiful studio in the world for you you shall have tapestry blue china armor lovely glass soft carpets carved doors and painted panels a tall mantelshelf old wooden cabinets silver cups and everything else what one ought to like and you shall choose everything for yourself and never get tired of it but you must go on painting you must never stop working because we must be proud of you as well that you like oh but i have not done yet my grandfather is to have two rooms for himself which he can fill with the books he will spend his time in collecting lala roy will have two more rooms quite separate where he can sit by himself whenever he does not choose to sit with me i shall have my own study to myself where i shall go on reading mathematics and we shall all have between us the most beautiful diningroom and drawingroom that you ever saw and a garden and a fountain andyesmoney to give to people who are not so fortunate as ourselves will that do arnold yes but you have almost forgotten yourself dear there must be carriages for you and jewels and dainty things all your own and a boudoir and nobody shall think of doing or saying anything in the house at all except for your pleasure will that do iris i suppose we shall have to give parties of some kind and to go to them perhaps one may get to like society you will teach me lawntennis arnold and i should like i think to learn dancing i suppose i must leave off making my own dresses though i know that i shall never be so well dressed if i do and about the cakes and puddingsbut oh there is enough pretending it is difficult said lala roy to bear adversity but to be temperate in prosperity is the height of wisdom and now suppose iris said arnold that the inheritance instead of being thousands a year is only a few hundreds ah then arnold it will be ever so much simpler we shall have something to live upon until you begin to make money for us all yes that is very simple but suppose again that the inheritance is nothing but a small sum of money why then said iris we will give it all to grandfather who will pay off his creditor and we will go on as if nothing had happened child said mr emblem do you think that i would take your little all and suppose again arnold went on that the inheritance turns out a delusion and that there is nothing at all that cannot be supposed said mr emblem quickly that is absurd if it were said iris we shall only be tomorrow just exactly what we are today i am a teacher by correspondence with five pupils arnold is looking for artwork which will pay and between us my dear grandfather and lala roy we are going to see that you want nothing always lala roy with her grandfather as if their interests were identical and indeed he had lived so long with them that iris could not separate the two old men we will all live together iris continued and when our fortune is made we will all live in a palace and now grandfather that we have relieved our feelings shall we have the story and the opening of the papers in the safe which will you have first mr emblem asked again oh the safe said arnold the story can wait let us examine the contents of the safe the story said mr emblem is nearly all told in your fathers letter my dear but there is a little that i would tell you first before i read that letter you know iris that i have never been rich my shop has kept me up till now but i have never been able to put by money wellmy daughter alice your poor mother my dear who was as good and clever as you are was determined to earn her own living and so she went out as a governess and one day she came home with her husband she had been married the day before and she told me they had very little money and her husband was a scholar and a gentleman and wanted to get work by writing he got some but not enough and they were always in a poor way until one day he got a letter from americait was while the civil war was ragingfrom an old oxford friend inviting him to emigrate and try fortune as a journalist out there he went and his wife was to join him but she died my dear your mother died and a year later i had your fathers last letter which i am now going to read to you one moment sir said arnold before you open the safe and take out the papers remember that iris and i can take nothingnothing at all for ourselves until all your troubles are tided over childrenchildren cried mr emblem go my son to the desert observed the sage standing solemnly upright like a prophet of israel observe the young stork of the wilderness how he beareth on his wings his aged sire and supplieth him with food the piety of a child is sweeter than the incense of persia offered to the sun yea more delicious is it than the odors from a field of arabian spice thank you lala said mr emblem and now children we will discover the mystery he unlocked the safe and threw it open with somewhat of a theatrical air the roll of papers he took it out for iris to be opened on her twentyfirst birthday and this is the eve of it but where is the letter i tied the letter round it with a piece of tape very strange i am sure i tied the letter with a piece of tape perhaps it waswhere is the letter he peered about in the safe there was nothing else in it except a few old account books but he could not find the letter where could it be i remember he saidmost distinctly i remember tying up the letter with the parcel where can it be gone to a feeling of trouble to come seized him he was perfectly sure he had tied up the letter with the parcel and here was the parcel without the letter and no one had opened the safe except himself never mind about the letter grandfather said iris we shall find that afterward well then let us open the parcel it was a packet about the size of a crownoctavo volume in brown paper carefully fastened up with gum and on the face of it was a white label inscribed for iris to be opened on her twentyfirst birthday everybody in turn took it weighed it so to speak looked at it curiously and read the legend then they returned it to mr emblem who laid it before him and produced a penknife with this as carefully and solemnly as if he were offering up a sacrifice or performing a religious function he cut the parcel straight through after eighteen years he said after eighteen years the ink will be faded and the papers yellow but we shall see the certificates of the marriage and of your baptism iris there will also be letters to different people and a true account of the rupture with his father and the cause of which his letter spoke and of course we shall find out what was his real name and what is the kind of inheritance which has been waiting for you so long my dear now then the covering incase of the packet was a kind of stiff cardboard or millboard within brown paper mr emblem laid it open it was full of folded papers he took up the first and opened it the paper was blank the next it was blank the third it was blank the fourth and fifth and sixth and so on throughout the case which had been waiting so long waiting for eighteen years to be opened on iriss twentyfirst birthday was full of blank papers they were all half sheets of notepaper mr emblem looked surprised at the first two or three papers then he turned pale then he rushed at the rest when he had opened all he stared about him with bewilderment where is the letter he asked again then he began with trembling hands to tear out the contents of the safe and spread them upon the table the letter was nowhere i am certain he said for the tenth time i am quite certain that i tied up the letter with red tape outside the packet and no one has been at the safe except me tell us said arnold the contents of the letter as well as you remember them your soninlaw was known to you under the name of aglen which was not his real name did he tell you his real name no what did he tell you do you remember the letter i remember every word of the letter if you dictate it i will write it down that may be a help mr emblem began quickly and as if he was afraid of forgetting when you read these lines i shall be in the silent land whither alice my wife has gone before me then mr emblem began to stammer in one small thing we deceived you alice and i my name is not aglenis not aglen and here a strange thing happened his memory failed him at this point take time said arnold there is no hurry mr emblem shook his head i shall remember the rest tomorrow perhaps he said is there anything else you have to help us asked arnold never mind the letter mr emblem no doubt that will come back presently you see we want to find out first who iriss father really was and what is her real name there was his coatofarms that will connect her with some family though it may be a family with many branches yesoh yes his coatofarms i have seen his signetring a dozen times yes his coat yes first and fourth two roses and a boars head erect second and thirdi forget humph was there any one who knew him before he was married yes yes mr emblem sat up eagerly yes there isthere is he is my oldest customer but i forget his name i have forgotten everything perhaps i shall get back my memory tomorrow but i am old perhaps it will never get back he leaned his head upon his hands and stared about him with bewildered eyes i do not know young man he said presently addressing arnold who you are if you come from mr chalker let me tell you it is a day too soon tomorrow we will speak of business then he sprung to his feet suddenly struck with a thought which pierced him like a dagger tomorrow it is the day when they will come to sell me up oh iris what did that matter when you were safe now we are all paupers togetherall paupers he fell back in his chair white and trembling iris soothed him kissed his cheek and pressed his hand but the terror and despair of bankruptcy were upon him this is an awful specter which is ever ready to appear before the man who has embarked his all in one venture a disastrous season two or three unlucky ventures a succession of bad debts and the grisly specter stands before them he had no terror for the old man so long as he thought that iris was safe but now idle talk irisidle talk child he said when they tried to comfort him how can a girl make money by teaching idle talk young man how can money be made by painting its as bad a trade as writing how can money be made anyhow but in an honest shop and tomorrow i shall have no shop and we shall all go into the street together presently when lamentations had yielded to despair they persuaded him to go to bed it was past midnight iris went upstairs with him while lala roy and arnold waited down below and then arnold made a great discovery he began to examine the folded papers which were in the packet i think he had some kind of vague idea that they might contain secret and invisible writing they were all sheets of notepaper of the same size folded in the same waynamely doubled as if for a square envelope on holding one to the light he read the watermark hieroglyphica a vegetable vellum ms co they all had the same watermark he showed the thing to the hindoo who did not understand what it meant then iris came down again her grandfather was sleeping like a child he fell asleep the moment his head fell upon the pillow iris he said this is no delusion of your grandfathers the parcel has been robbed how do you know arnold the stupid fellow who stole and opened the packet no doubt thought he was wonderfully clever to fill it up again with paper but he forgot that the packet has been lying for eighteen years in the safe and that this notepaper was made the day before yesterday how do you know that you can tell by the look and feel of the paper they did not make paper like this twenty years ago besides look at the watermark he held it to the light and iris read the mystic words that is the fashion of today one house issues a new kind of paper with a fancy name and another imitates them tomorrow i will ascertain exactly when this paper was made but who would steal it arnold who could steal it it would not probably be of the least use to any one but it might be stolen in order to sell it back we may see an advertisement carefully worded guarded or perhapsiris who had access to the place when your grandfather was out no one but james the shopman he has been here fiveandtwenty years he would not surely rob his old master no one else comes here except the customers and cousin joe joe is not i believe quite joe is a very bad man he has done dreadful things but then even if joe were bad enough to rob the safe how could he get at it my grandfather never leaves it unlocked oh arnold arnold that all this trouble should fall upon us on the very day my dear is it not better that it should fall upon you when i am here one more added to your advisers if you have lost a fortune i have found one think that you have given it to me oh the fortune may go she said the future is ours and we are young but who shall console my grandfather in his old age for his bankruptcy as the stream said lala roy which passeth from the mountains to the ocean kisseth every meadow on its way yet tarries not in any place so fortune visits the sons of men she is unstable as the wind who shall hold her let not adversity tear off the wings of hope they could do nothing more arnold replaced the paper in the packet and gave it to iris they put back the ledgers and accountbooks in the safe and locked it up and then they went upstairs you shall go to bed iris said arnold and you too lala roy i shall stay here in case mr emblem shouldshould want anything he was in reality afraid that something would happen to the old man his sudden loss of memory his loss of selfcontrol when he spoke of his bankruptcy the confusion of his words told clearly of a mind unhinged he could not go away and leave iris with no better protection than one other weak old man he remained but iris sat with him and in the silent watches of the night they talked about the future under every roof are those who talk about the future and those who think about the past so the shadow of death is always with us and the sunshine of life not without reason is the roman catholic altar incomplete without a bone of some dead man as for the thing which had been stolen that affected them but little what does it matterthe loss of what was promised but five minutes since it was one oclock in the morning when lala roy left them they sat at the window handinhand and talked the street below them was very quiet now and then a late cab broke the silence or the tramp of a policeman but there were no other sounds they sat in darkness because they wanted no light the hours sped too swiftly for them at five the day began to dawn iris said arnold leave me now and try to sleep a little shall we ever forget this night of sweet and tender talk when she was gone he began to be aware of footsteps overhead in the old mans room what was he going to do arnold waited at the door presently the door opened and he heard careful steps upon the stairs they were the steps of mr emblem himself he was fully dressed with his usual care and neatness his black silk stock buckled behind and his white hair brushed ah mr arbuthnot he said cheerfully you are early this morning as if it was quite a usual thing for his friends to look in at six in the morning you are going down to the shop mr emblem yes certainlyto the shop pray come with me arnold followed him i have just remembered said the old man that last night we did not look on the floor i will have one more search for the letter and then if i cannot find it i will write it all outevery word there is not much to be sure but the story is told without the names tell me the story mr emblem while you remember it all in good time young man youth is impatient he drew up the blind and let in the morning light then he began his search for the letter on the floor going on his hands and knees and peering under the table and chairs with a candle at length he desisted i tied it up he said with the parcel with red tape very wellwe must do without it now mr arbuthnot my plan is this first i will dictate the letter this will give you the outlines of the story next i will send you toto my old customer who can tell you my soninlaws real name and then i will describe his coatofarms my memory was never so clear and good as i feel it today strange that last night i seemed for the moment to forget everything ha ha ridiculous wasnt it i supposebut there is no accounting for these queer things perhaps i was disappointed to find nothing in the packet do you think mr arbuthnot that i here he began to tremble do you think that i dreamed it all old men think strange things perhaps let us try to remember the letter mr emblem yes yescertainlythe letter why it wentahemas follows arnold laid down the pen in despair the poor old man was mad he had poured out the wildest farrago without sense coherence or story so much for the letter mr arbuthnot he was mad without doubt yet he knew arnold and knew too why he was in the house ah i knew it would come back to me strange if it did not why i read that letter once every quarter or so for eighteen years it is a part of myself i could not forget it and the name of your soninlaws old friend oh yes the name he gave some name which might have been the lost name but as mr emblem changed it the next moment and forgot it again the moment after it was doubtful certainly not much to build upon and the coatofarms we are getting on famously are we not the coat sir was as follows he proceeded to describe an impossible coata coat which might have been drawn by a man absolutely ignorant of science all this took a couple of hours it was now eight oclock thank you mr emblem said arnold i have no doubt now that we shall somehow bring iris to her own again in spite of your loss shall we go upstairs and have some breakfast it is all right iris cried the old man gleefully it is all right i have remembered everything and mr arbuthnot will go out presently and secure your inheritance iris looked at arnold yes dear she said you shall have your breakfast and then you shall tell me all about it when arnold goes and you will take a holiday wont youbecause i am twentyone today aha he was quite cheerful and mirthful because he had recovered his memory aha my dear all is well you are twentyone and i am seventyfive and mr arbuthnot will go and bring home thethe inheritance and i shall sit here all day long it was a good dream that came to me this morning was it not quite a voice from heaven which said get up and write down the letter while you remember it i got up i found by theby the merest accident mr arbuthnot on the stairs and we have arranged everything for youeverything chapter ix dr washington arnold returned to his studio sat down and fell fast asleep he was awakened about noon by his cousin clara oh arnold she cried shaking him wrathfully by the arm this is a moment of the greatest excitement and importance to me and you are my only adviser and you are asleep he sprung to his feet i am awake now clara anxiety and trouble on account of our talk yesterday he saw that she had been crying in her hands she had a packet of letters oh no no it is far more important than that as for our talk i am engaged to her clara so i expected she replied coldly but i am not come here about your engagement and you do not want my congratulations i suppose i should like to have your good wishes clara oh arnold that is what my poor claude said when he deserted me and married the governess you men want to have your own way and then expect us to be delighted with it i expect nothing clara pray understand that i told claude when he wrote asking forgiveness that he had my good wishes whatever he chose to do but that i would not on any account receive his wife very well arnold that is exactly what i say to you very well clara i quite understand as for the studio and all the things that you have given me they are of course yours again let me restore what i can to you no arnold they are yours let me hear no more about things that are your own of course your business as you call it is exciting but as for this other thing it is far more important something has happened something i always expected something that i looked forward to for years although it has waited on the way so long it has actually come at last when i had almost forgotten to look for it so true it is arnold that good fortune and misfortune alike come when we least expect them arnold sat down he knew his cousin too well to interrupt her she had her own way of telling a story and it was a roundabout way i cannot complain after twenty years can i i have had plenty of rope as you would say but still it has come at last and naturally when it does come it is a shock is it hereditary gout clara gout nonsense arnold when the will was read i said to myself claude is certain to come back and claim his own it is his right and i hope he will come but for my own part i have not the least intention of calling upon the governess then three or four years passed away and i heardi do not remember howthat he was dead and then i waited for his heirs his children or their guardians but they did not come and now they have really come oh clara this is indeed a misfortune no arnold call it a restitution not a misfortune i have been living all these years on the money which belongs to claudes heirs there was a son then and now he has dropped upon us from the clouds it is a daughter not a son but you shall hear i received a letter this morning from a person called dr joseph washington stating that he wrote to me on account of the only child and heiress of the late claude deseret who is dr joseph washington he is a physician he says and an american yes will you go on i do not mind it arnold i really do not i must give up my house and put down my carriage but it is for claudes daughter i rejoice to think that he has left some one behind him arnold that face upon your canvas really has got eyes wonderfully like his if it was not a mere fancy when i saw it yesterday i am glad i say to give up everything to the child of claude you think so kindly of him clara who inflicted so much pain on you i can never think bitterly of claude we were brought up together we were like brother and sister he never loved me in any other way oh i understood it all years ago to begin with i was never beautiful and it was his fathers mistake well this american followed up his letter by a visit in the letter he merely said he had come to london with the heiress but he called an hour ago and brought meoh arnold he brought me one more letter from claude it has been waiting for me for eighteen years after all that time after eighteen years my poor dead claude speaks to me again my dear when i thought he was miserable on account of his marriage i was wrong his wife made him happy and he died because she died the tears came into her eyes again poor boy poor claude the letter speaks of his child it says she opened and read the letter he says some day my child will i hope come to you and say cousin clara i am iris deseret iris said arnold it is her name arnold it was the childs grandmothers name a strange coincidence he said pray go on she will say cousin clara i am iris deseret then you will be kind to her as you would to me if i were to come home again i cannot read any more my dear even to you did this american give you any other proof of what he asserts he gave me a portrait of claude taken years ago when he was a boy of sixteen and showed me the certificate of marriage and the childs certificate of baptism and letters from his wife i suppose nothing more can be wanted i dare say it is all right clara but why was not the child brought over before becausethis is the really romantic part of the storywhen her father died leaving the child she was adopted by these charitable americans and no one ever thought of examining the papers which were lying in a desk until the other day you have not seen the young lady no he is to bring her tomorrow and what sort of a man is this american is he a gentleman well i do not quite know perhaps americans are different from englishmen if he was an englishman i should say without any hesitation that he is not a gentleman as we count good breeding and good manners he is a big man handsome and burly and he seems goodtempered when i told him what was the full amount of iriss inheritance iriss inheritance arnold repeated i beg your pardon clara pray go on but it seems like a dream he only laughed and said he was glad she would have so much the utmost they hoped he said was that it might be a farm or a house or two or a few hundreds in the stocks he is to bring her tomorrow and of course i shall make her stay with me as for himself he says that he is only anxious to get back home to his wife and his practice he wants nothing for himself then that seems a good sign i asked him that question and he said that he could not possibly take money for what he and his family had done for iris that is to say her education and maintenance this was very generous of him perhaps he is really a gentleman by birth but has provincial manners he said however that he had no objection to receiving the small amount of money spent on the voyage and on iriss outfit because they were not rich people and it was a serious thing to fit out a young lady suitably so of course i gave him what he suggested a check for two hundred pounds no one he added with true feeling would grudge a single dollar that had been spent upon the education of the dear girl and this went to my heart she is well educated then she sings well he says and has had a good plain education he said i might rest assured that she was ladylike because she had been brought up among his own friends that is a very safe guarantee said arnold laughing i wonder if she is pretty i asked him that question too and he replied very oddly that she had a most splendid figure which fetched everybody is not that rather a vulgar expression it is in england perhaps in america it belongs to the first circles and is a survival of the pilgrim fathers so you gave him a check for two hundred pounds yes surely i was not wrong arnold consider the circumstances the outfit and the voyage and the mans reluctance and delicacy of feeling i dare say you were quite right butwell i think i should have seen the young lady first remember you have given the money to a stranger on his bare word oh arnold this man is perfectly honest i would answer for his truth and honesty he has frank honest eyes besides he brought me all those letters well dear you are not going to desert me because you are engaged are you arnold i want you to be present when she comes tomorrow morning certainly i will be present with the greatestno not the greatest pleasure but i will be presenti will come to luncheon clara when she was gone he thought again of the strange coincidence both of the man and of the inheritance yet what had his iris in common with a girl who had been brought up in america besides she had lost her inheritance and this other iris had crossed the ocean to receive hers yet a very strange coincidence it was so strange that he told it to iris and to lala roy iris laughed and said she did not know she had a single namesake lala did not laugh but he sat thinking in silence there was no chess for him that night instead of playing his usual game mr emblem in his chair laughed and chuckled in rather a ghastly way chapter x it is my cousin well joe said his wife and how is it going to finish it looks to me as if there was a prisonvan and a policecourt at the end dont you think we had better back out of it while there is time youre a fool her husband repliedit was the morning after his visit to clara you know nothing about it now listen i do nothing but listen youve told me the story till i know it by heart do you think anybody in the world will be so green as to believe such a clumsy plan as that now look here lotty if theres another word saidmind nowyou shall have nothing more to do with the business at all ill give it to a girl i knowa clever girl who will carry it through with flying colors she set her lips hard and drummed her fingers on the table he knew how to rule his wife go on she said since we cant be honest be reasonable then thats all i ask you honest who is honest aint we every one engaged in getting round our neighbors isnt the whole game all the world over lying and deceit honest you might as well go on the boards without faking up your face as try to live honest hold your tongue then he growled and swore and after his fashion called on the heavens to witness and express their astonishment the girl bent her head and made no reply for a space she was cowed and afraid presently she looked up and laughed but with a forced laugh dont be cross joe ill do whatever you want me to do and cheerfully too if it will do you any good what is a woman good for but to help her husband only dont be cross joe she knew what her husband was by this timea false and unscrupulous man yet she loved him the case is not rare by any means so that there is hope for all of us from the meanest and most wriggling worm among us to the most hectoring ruffian why there lotty he said that is what i like now listen the old lady is a cakedo you understand she is a sponge she swallows everything and is ready to fall on your neck and cry over you for joy as for doubt or suspicion not a word i dont think there will be a single question asked no its all my poor dear claudethats your father lottyand my poor dear iristhats you lotty all right joe go on i am irisi am anybody you like go on the more i think about it the more im certain we shall do the trick only keep cool over the job and forget the musichall you are iris deseret and you are the daughter of claude deseret deceased i am dr washington one of the american family who brought you up youre grateful mind nothing can be more lively than your gratitude weve been brother and sister you and me and ive got a wife and young family and a rising practice at home in the state of maine and i am only come over here to see you into your rights at great personal expense paid a substitute yes actually paid a substitute we only found the papers the other day which is the reason why we did not come over before and i am going home again directly you are not really going away joe are you no i am going to stay here but i shall pretend to go away now remember weve got no suspicion ourselves and we dont expect to meet any if there is any we are surprised and sorry we dont come to the lady with a lawyer or a blunderbuss we come as friends and we shall arrange this little business between ourselves oh never you fear we shall arrange it quite comfortably without lawyers how much do you think we shall get out of it joe listen and open your eyes theres nearly a hundred and twenty thousand pounds and a small estate in the country dont let us trouble about the estate more than we can help estates mean lawyers money doesnt he spoke as if small sums like a hundred thousand pounds are carried about in the pocket good gracious and youve got two hundred of it already havent you yes but what is two hundred out of a hundred and twenty thousand a hundred and twenty thousand theres spending in it isnt there lotty gad well make the money spin i calculate it may be a few weeks before the old lady transfers the moneyi dont quite know where it is but in stocks or somethingto your name as soon as it is in your name ive got a plan well remember that youve got a sweetheart or something in america and youll break your heart for wanting to see him and then nothing will do but you must run across for a trip oh ill manage and well make the money fly he was always adding new details to his story finding something to embellish it and heighten the effect and now having succeeded in getting the false iris into the house he began already to devise schemes to get her out again a hundred thousand pounds why joe it is a terrible great sum of money good gracious what shall we do with it when we get it ill show you what to do with it my girl and you said joeyou declared that it is your own by rights certainly it is my own it would have been bequeathed to me by my own cousin but she didnt know it and she died without knowing it and i am her heir lotty wondered vaguely and rather sadly how much of this statement was true but she did not dare to ask she had promised her assistance every night she woke with a dreadful dream of a policeman knocking at the door whenever she saw a man in blue she trembled and she knew perfectly well that if the plot failed it was she herself in all probability and not her husband at all who would be put in the dock she did not believe a word about the cousin she knew she was going to do a vile and dreadful wickedness but she was ready to go through with it or with anything else to pleasure a husband who already the honeymoon hardly finished showed the propensities of a rover very well lotty we are going there at once you need take nothing with you but you wont come back here for a good spell in fact i think i shall have to give up these lodgings for fear of accidents i shall leave you with your cousin yes and im to be quiet and behave pretty i suppose youll be just as quiet and demure as you used to be when you were serving in the music shop no loud laughing no capers no comic songs and no dancing and am i to begin at once by asking for the money to bewhat do you call it transferred no you are not on any account to say a word about the money you are to go on living there without hinting at the moneywithout showing any desire to discuss the subjectperhaps for months until there cant be the shadow of a doubt that you are the old womans cousin you are to make much of her flatter her cocker her up find out all the family secrets and get the length of her foot but you are not to say one single word about the money as for your manners im not afraid of them because when you like you can look and talk like a countess i know now she got up and changed her face so that it became at once subdued and quiet like a quiet servinggirl behind a counter so is that modest enough joe and as for singing i shall sing for her but not musichall trash this kind of thing listen there was a piano in the room and she sat down and sang to her own accompaniment with a sweet low voice one of the soft sad german songs thatll do cried joe hang me what a clever girl you are lotty thats the kind of thing the swells like as for me give me ten minutes of jolly nash but you know how to pull em in lotty it was approaching twelve the hour when they were due lotty retired and arrayed herself in her quietest and most sober dress a costume in some brown stuff with a bonnet to match she put on her best gloves and boots having herself felt the inferiority of the shopgirl to the lady in those minor points and she modified and mitigated her fringe which she knew was rather more exaggerated than young ladies in society generally wear youre not afraid lotty said joe when at last she was ready to start afraid not i joe come along i couldnt look quieter not if i was to make up as i do in the evening as a quakeress come along oh joe it will be awful dull dont forget to send word to the hall that i am ill afraid not i she laughed but rather hysterically there would be however she secretly considered some excitement when it came to the finding out which would happen she was convinced in a very few hours in fact she had no faith at all in the story being accepted and believed by anybody to be sure she herself had been trained as ladies in shops generally are to mistrust all mankind and she could not understand at all the kind of confidence which comes of having the very thing presented to you which you ardently desire when they arrived in chester square she found waiting for her a lady who was certainly not beautiful but she had kind eyes which looked eagerly at the strange face and with an expression of disappointment it cant be the fringe thought lotty cousin clara she said softly and sweetly as her husband had taught her i am iris deseret the daughter of your old playfellow claude oh my dear my dear cried clara with enthusiasm come to my arms welcome home again she kissed and embraced her then she held her by both hands and looked at her face again my dear she said you have been a long time coming i had almost given up hoping that claude had any children but you are welcome after allvery welcome you are in your own house remember my dear this house is yours and the plate and furniture and everything and i am only your tenant oh said lotty overwhelmed why she had actually been taken on her word or rather the word of joe let me kiss you again your face does not remind me as yet in any single feature of your fathers but i dare say i shall find resemblance presently and indeed your voice does remind me of him already he had a singularly sweet and delicate voice iris has a remarkably sweet and delicate voice said joe softly no doubt she got it from her father you will hear her sing presently lotty hardly knew her husband his face was preternaturally solemn and he looked as if he was engaged in the most serious business of his life all her fathers ways were gentle and delicate said clara just like hers said joe when all of usamerican boys and girls pretty rough at timeswere playing and larking about iris would be just sittin out like a cat on a carpet quiet and demure i suppose she got that way too from her father no doubt and as for your face my dear i dare say i shall find a likeness presently but just now i see none will you take off your bonnet when the girls bonnet was off clara looked at her again curiously but kindly i suppose i cant help looking for a likeness my dear but you must take after your mother whom i never saw your fathers eyes were full and limpid yours are large and clear and bright very good eyes my dear but they are not limpid his mouth was flexible and mobile but yours is firm your hair however reminds me somewhat of his which was much your light shade of brown when he was young and now sirshe addressed joenow that you have brought this dear girl all the way across the atlantic what are you going to do well i dont exactly know that theres anything to keep me said joe you see ive got my practice to look after at homei am a physician as i told youand my wife and children and the sooner i get back the better now that i can leave iris with her friends safe and comfortable stay he added there are all those papers which i promised youthe certificates and the rest of them you had better take them all miss and keep them for iris thank you said clara touched by this confidence iris will be safe with me it is very natural that you should want to go home again and you will be content to stay with me my dear wont you you need not be afraid sir i assure you that her interests will not in any way suffer tell her to write and let you know exactly what is done let her however since she is an english girl remain with english friends and get to know her cousins and relations you can safely trust her with me dr washington thank you said joe you know that when one has known a girl all her life one is naturally anxious about her happiness we are almost brother and sister i know and i am sure mr washington we ought to be most grateful to you as for the money you have expended upon her let me once more beg of you joe waved his hand majestically as for that he said the money is spent iris is welcome to it if it were ten times as much now madam you trusted me the very first day that you saw me with two hundred pounds sterling only an english lady would have done that you trusted me without asking me who or what i was or doubting my word i assure you madam i felt that kindness and that trust very much indeed and in return i have brought you iris herself after all expenses paid of coming over and getting back buying a few things for iris if i find that theres anything over i shall ask you to take back the balance madam i thank you for the money but i am sure i have repaid youwith iris this was a very clever speech if there had been a shadow of doubt before it in claras heart which there was not it would vanish now she cordially and joyfully accepted her newlyfound cousin and now iris he said with a manly tremor in his voice i do not know if i shall see you again before i go away if not i shall take your fond love to all of them at hometom and dick and harry and harriet and prissy and all of themjoe really was carrying the thing through splendidlyand perhaps my dear when you are a grand lady in england you will give a thoughta thought now and againto your old friends across the water oh joe cried lotty really carried away with admiration and ashamed of her skeptical spirit oh she whispered aint you splendid but you must not go dr washington said clara without coming again to say farewell will you not dine with us tonight will you stay and have lunch no madam i thank you it will be best for me to leave iris alone with you the sooner she learns your english ways and forgets american ways the better but you are not going to start away for liverpool at once you will stay a day or two in london the american physician said that perhaps he might stay a week longer for scientific purposes have you got enough money joe asked the new iris thoughtfully joe gave her a glance of infinite admiration well he said the fact is that i should like to buy a few books and things perhaps cousin said lotty eagerly please give him a check for a hundred pounds make it a hundred you said everything was mine no joe i wont hear a word about repayment as if a little thing like fifty pounds or a hundred pounds should want to be repaid as if you and i could ever talk about repayment clara did as she was asked readily and eagerly then joe departed promising to call and say farewell before he left england and resolving that in his next visithis last visitthere should be another check but he had made one mistake he had parted with the papers no one in any situation of life should ever give up the power until he has secured the substance but it is human to err and now my dear said clara warmly sit down and let us talk arnold is coming to lunch with us and to make your acquaintance when arnold came a few minutes later he was astonished to find his cousin already on the most affectionate terms with the newlyarrived iris deseret she was walking about the room showing her the pictures of her grandfather and other ancestors and they were handinhand arnold said clara this is iris and i hope you will both be great friends iris this is my cousin but he is not yours i dont pretend to know how that may be said the young lady but then i am glad to know all your cousins whether they are mine or not only dont bother me with questions because i dont remember anything and i dont know anything why until the other day i did not even know that i was an english lady not until they found those papers a strange accent for an american and she certainly said laidy for lady and paipper for paper like a cockney alas this comes of london music halls even to countrybred damsels arnold made a mental observation that the newcomer might be called anything in the world but could not be called a lady she was handsome certainly but how could claude deserets daughter have grown into so common a type of beauty where was the delicacy of feature and manner which clara had never ceased to commend in speaking of her lost cousin iris said clara is our little savage from the american forest she is queen pocahontas who has come over to conquer england and to win all our hearts my dear my cousin arnold will help me to make you an english girl she spoke as in the state of maine was still the huntingground of sioux and iroquois arnold thought that a less americanlooking girl he had never seen that she did not speak or look like a lady was to be expected perhaps if she had as was probable been brought up by rough and unpolished people but he had no doubt any more than clara herself as to the identity of the girl nobody ever doubts a claimant every impostor from demetrius downward has gained his supporters and partisans by simply living among them and keeping up the imposition it is so easy in fact to be a claimant that it is wonderful there are not more of them then luncheon was served and the young lady not only showed a noble appetite but to arnolds astonishment confessed to an ardent love for bottled stout most american ladies he said impertinently only drink water do they not lotty perceived that she had made a mistake i only drink stout she said when the doctor tells me but i like it all the same she certainly had no american accent but she would not talk much she was perhaps shy after luncheon however clara asked her if she would sing and she complied showing considerable skill with her accompaniment and singing a simple song in good taste and with a sweet voice arnold observed however that there was some weakness about the letter h less common among americans than among the english presently he went away and the girl who had been aware that he was watching her breathed more easily who is your cousin arnold she asked my dear he is my cousin but not yours you will not see him often because he is going to be married i am sorry to say and to be married beneath himoh it is dreadful to some tradesmans girl my dear dreadful said iris with a queer look in her eyes well cousin i dont want to see much of him hes a goodlooking chap too though rather too finicking for my taste i like a man who looks as if he could knock another man down besides he looks at me as if i was a riddle and he wanted to find out the answer in the evening arnold found that no change had come over the old man he was however perfectly happy so that considering the ruin of his worldly prospects it was perhaps as well that he had parted for a time at least with his wits some worldly misfortunes there are which should always produce this effect you told me said lala roy that another iris had just come from america to claim an inheritance of your cousin yes it is a very strange coincidence very strange two englishmen die in america at the same time each having a daughter named iris and each daughter entitled to some kind of inheritance lala roy spoke slowly and with meaning oh cried arnold it is more than strange do you thinkis it possible he could not for the moment clothe his thoughts in words do you know if any one has brought this girl to england yes she was brought over by a young american physician one of the family who adopted and brought her up what is he likethe young american physician i have not seen him go my young friend tomorrow morning and ask your cousin if this photograph resembles the american physician it was the photograph of a handsome young fellow with strongly marked features apparently tall and wellsetup lala you dont really suspect anythingyou dont think hush i know who has stolen the papers perhaps the same man has produced the heiress and you thinkyou suspect that the man who stole the papers is connected withbut then those papers must beoh it cannot be for then iris would be claras cousinclaras cousinand the other an impostor even so everything is possible but silence do not speak a word even to iris if the papers are lost they are lost say nothing to her yet but gogo and find out if that photograph resembles the american physician the river wanders here and there but the sea swallows it at last chapter xi mr james makes atonement james arrived as usual in the morning at nine oclock in order to take down the shutters to his astonishment he found lala roy and iris waiting for him in the back shop and they had grave faces james said iris your master has suffered a great shock and is not himself this morning his safe has been broken open by some one and most important papers have been taken out papers misspapers out of the safe yes they are papers of no value whatever to the thief whoever he may be but they are of the very greatest importance to us your master seems to have lost his memory for a while and cannot help us in finding out who has done this wicked thing you have been a faithful servant for so long that i am sure you will do what you can for us think for us try to remember if anybody besides yourself has had access to this room when your master was out of it james sat down he felt that he must sit down though lala roy was looking at him with eyes full of doubt and suspicion the whole enormity of his own guilt though he had not stolen anything fell upon him he had got the key he had given it to mr joseph and he had received it back again in fact at that very moment it was lying in his pocket the worst that he had feared had happened the safe was robbed he was struck with so horrible a dread and so fearful a looking forward to judgment and condemnation that his teeth chattered and his eye gave way you will think it over james said iris think it over and tell us presently if you can remember anything think it over mr james lala roy repeated in his deepest tone and with an emphatic gesture of his right forefinger think it over carefully like a lamp that is never extinguished are the eyes of the faithful servant they left him and james fell back into his chair with hollow cheek and beating heart he told me he murmuredoh the villainhe swore to me that he had taken nothing from the safe he said he only looked in it and read the contents the scoundrel he has stolen the papers he must have known they were there and then to save himself he put me on to the job for who would be suspected if notoh lordif not me he grasped his paste brush and attacked his work with a feverish anxiety to find relief in exertion but his heart was not in it and presently a thought pierced his brain as an arrow pierceth the heart and under the pang and agony of it his face turned ashypale and the big drops stood upon his brow for he thought suppose that the thing gets abroad suppose they were to advertise a reward suppose the man who made the key were to see the advertisement or to hear about it and he knows my name too and my business and hell let out for a rewardi know he willwho it was ordered that key of him already he saw himself examined before a magistrate already he saw in imagination that locksmiths man who made the key kissing the testament and giving his testimony in clear and distinct words which could not be shaken oh lord oh lord he groaned no one will believe me even if i do confess the truth and as for him i know him well if i go to him hell only laugh at me but i must go to himi must he was so goaded by his terror that he left the shop unprotecteda thing he had never thought to doand ran as fast as he could to joes lodgings but he had left them he was no longer there he had not been there for six weeks the landlady did not know his address or would not give it then james felt sick and dizzy and would have sat down on the doorstep and cried but for the look of the thing besides he remembered the unprotected shop so he turned away sadly and walked back well understanding now that he had fallen like a tool into a trap artfully set to fasten suspicion and guilt upon himself when he returned he found the place full of people mr emblem was sitting in his customary place and he was smiling he did not look in the least like a man who had been robbed he was smiling pleasantly and cheerfully mr chalker was also present a man with whom no one ever smiled and lala roy solemn and dignified and a manan unknown manwho sat in the outer shop and seemed to take no interest at all in the proceedings were they come he asked himself to arrest him on the spot apparently they were not for no one took the least notice of him and they were occupied with something else how could they think of anything else yet mr chalker standing at the table was making a speech which had nothing to do with the robbery here i am you see mr emblem he said i have told you already that i dont want to do anything to worry you let us be friends all round this gentleman your friend from india will advise you i am sure for your own good not to be obstinate lord what is the amount after all to a substantial man like yourself a substantial man i say he spoke confidently but he glanced about the shop with doubtful eyes granted that it was borrowed to get your grandson out of a scrapesupposing he promised to pay it back and hasnt done so putting the case that it has grown and developed itself as bills will do and cant help doing and cant be stopped it isnt the fault of the lawyers but the very nature of a hill to go on growingits like a baby for growing why after all you were your grandsons securityyou cant escape that and when i would no longer renew you gave of your own accordcome now you cant deny thata bill of sale on goods and furniture now mr emblem didnt you dont let us have any bitterness or quarreling lets be friends and tell me i may send away the man mr emblem smiled pleasantly but did not reply a bill of sale it was dated january the th just before that cursed act of parliament granted the five days notice here is the bailiffs man in possession you can pay the amount which is with costs and sheriffs poundage three hundred and fiftyone pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence at once or you may pay it five days hence otherwise the shop and furniture and all will be sold off in seven days oh james gasped listening with bewilderment we cant be going to be sold up emblems to be sold up three hundred and fifty pounds said mr emblem my friend let us rather speak of thousands this is a truly happy day for all of us sit down mr chalkermy dear friend sit down rejoice with us a happy morning what the devil is the matter with him asked the moneylender there was something mr chalker mr emblem went on cheerfully something said about my grandson joe was always a bad lot lucky his father and mother are out of the way in australia you came to me about that business perhaps oh on such a joyful day as this i forgive everybody tell joe i do not want to see him but i have forgiven him oh hes mad growled james hes gone stark staring mad you dont seem quite yourself this morning mr emblem said mr chalker perhaps this gentleman your friend from india will advise you when i am gone you dont understand mister he addressed lala roy the nature of a bill once you start a bill and begin to renew it its like planting a tree for it grows and grows of its own accord and by act of parliament too though they do try to hack and cut it down in the most cruel way you see mr emblem is obstinate hes got to pay off that bill which is a bill of sale and he wont do it make him write the check and have done with it this is the best days work i ever did mr emblem went on to remember the letter word for word and everything mr arbuthnot has very likely finished the whole business by now thousandsthousandsand all for iris look here mr emblem said the lawyer angrily youll not only be a bankrupt if you go on like this but youll be a fraudulent bankrupt as well is it honest i want to know to refuse to pay your just debts when youve put by thousands as you boastyou actually boastfor your granddaughter yes said the old man iris will have thousands i think sir said lala roy that you are under an illusion mr emblem does not possess any such savings or investments as you imagine then why does he go on talking about thousands he has had a shock he cannot quite understand what has happened you had better leave him for the present leave him and nothing but these moldy old books here you siryou jamesyou shopmancome here what is the stock worth it depends upon whether you are buying or selling said james if you were to sell it under the hammer in lots it wouldnt fetch a hundred pounds there you hearyou hear all of you not a hundred pounds and my bill of sale is threefifty pray sir said lala roy who told you that mr emblem was so wealthy his grandson then sir perhaps it would be well to question the grandson further he may know things of which we have heard nothing the act of which came into operation in the following january is cruel indeed i am told to those who advanced money on bills of sale before that date for it allowsit actually allows the debtor five clear days during which he may if he can without being caught make away with portions of his furniture and belongingsthe smaller and the more precious portion or he may find some one else to lend him the money and so get off clear and save his sticks it is as the modern shylock declares a most wicked and iniquitous act by which the shark may be balked and many an honest tradesman who would otherwise have been most justly ruined is enabled to save his stock and left to worry along until the times become more prosperous to a man like mr david chalker such an act of parliament is most revolting he went away at length leaving the manthe professional personbehind then lala roy persuaded mr emblem to go upstairs again he did so without any apparent consciousness that there was a man in possession james said lala roy you have heard that your master has been robbed you are reflecting and meditating on this circumstance another thing is that a creditor has threatened to sell off everything for a debt most likely everything will be sold and the shop closed you will therefore lose the place you have had for fiveandtwenty years that is a very bad business for you you are unfortunate this morning to lose your placeand then this robbery that seems also a bad business it is said james with a hollow groan it is mr lala roy it is a dreadful bad business pray mr james continued this man with grave searching eyes which made sinners shake in their shoes pray why did you run away and where did you go after you opened the shop this morning you went to see mr emblems grandson did you not yes i did said james why did you go to see him i wwwentoh lordi went to tell him what had happened because he is masters grandson and i thought he ought to know said james did you tell him no he has left his lodgings i dont know where he isoh and he always told me the shop was hissettled on him he said he is the father of lies his end will be confusion shame and confusion shall wait upon all who have hearkened unto him or worked with him until they repent and make atonement dont mister lala roydont you frighten me said james oh what a dreadful liar he is all the morning the philosopher sat in the booksellers chair and james in the outer shop felt that those deep eyes were resting continually upon him and knew that bit by bit his secret would be dragged from him if he could get up and run awayif a customer would comeif the dark gentleman would go upstairsif he could think of something else but none of these things happened and james at his table with the paste before him passed a morning compared with which any seat anywhere in purgatory would have been comfortable presently a strange feeling came over him as if some invisible force was pushing and dragging him and forcing him to leave his chair and throw himself at the philosophers feet and confess everything this was the mesmeric effect of those reproachful eyes fixed steadily upon him and in the doorway like some figure in a nightmarea figure incongruous and out of placethe man in possession sitting passive and unconcerned with one eye on the street and the other on the shop upstairs mr emblem was sitting fast asleep joy had made him sleepy and iris was at work among her pupils letters compiling sums for the fruiterer making a paper on conic sections for the cambridge man and working out trigonometrical equations for the young schoolmaster and her mind full of a solemn exultation and glory for she was a woman who was loved the other things troubled her but little her grandfather would get back his equilibrium of mind the shop might be shut up but that mattered little arnold and lala roy and her grandfather and herself would all live together and she and arnold would work the selfishness of youth is really astonishing nothingexcept perhaps toothachecan make a girl unhappy who is loved and newly betrothed she may say what she pleases and her face may be a yard long when she speaks of the misfortunes of others but all the time her heart is dancing to lala roy the situation presented a problem with insufficient data some of which would have to be guessed a letter now lost said that a certain case contained papers necessary to obtain an unknown inheritance for iris how then to ascertain whether anybody was expecting or looking for a girl to claim an inheritance then there was half a coatofarms and lastly there was a certain customer of unknown name who had been acquainted with iriss father before his marriage so far for iris as for the thief lala roy had no doubt at all it was he was quite certain the grandson whose career he had watched for some years with interest and curiosity who else was there who would steal the papers and who would help him and give him access to the safe he did not only suspect he was certain that james was in some way cognizant of the deed why else did he turn so pale why did he rush off to joes lodgings why did he sit trembling at halfpast twelve lala roy rose it is your dinnerhour he said to james and it seemed to the unhappy man as it he was saying i know all it is your dinner hour go eat refresh the body whom should suspicion affright except the guilty james put on his hat and sneakedhe felt that he was sneakingout of the shop during his dinnerhour joseph himself called it was an unusual thing to see him at any time in fact as he was never wont to call upon his grandfather unless he was in a scrape and wanted money no one ever made the poor young man welcome or begged him to come more often but this morning he walked upstairs and appeared so cheerful so entirely free from any selfreproach for past sins and so easy in his mind without the least touch of the old hangdog look that iris began to reproach herself for thinking badly of her cousin when he was told about the robbery he expressed the greatest surprise that any one in the world could be so wicked as to rob an old man like his grandfather besides his abhorrence of crime in the abstract he affirmed that the robbery of a safe was a species of villainy for which hanging was too mildmuch too mild a punishment he then asked his grandfather what were the contents of the packet stolen and when he received no answer except a pleasant and a cheery laugh he asked iris and learned to his sorrow that the contents were unknown and could not therefore be identified even if they were found this he said was a thousand pities because if they had been known a reward might have been offered for his own part he would advise the greatest caution nothing at all should be done at first no step should be taken which might awaken suspicion they should go on as if the papers were without value as for that they had no real proof that there was any robbery iris thought of telling him about the watermark of the blank pages but refrained perhaps there was no robbery after allwho was to prove what had been inside the packet but if there had been papers and it they were valueless except to the rightful owners they would perhaps be sent back voluntarily or after a time say a year or two they might be advertised for not as if the owners were very anxious to get them and not revealing the nature of the papers but cautiously and presently if they had not been destroyed the holders of the papers would answer the advertisement and then a moderate reward might after a while be offered and so on giving excellent advice while he was speaking lala roy entered the room in his noiseless manner and took his accustomed chair and what do you think sir said joseph when he had finished you have heard my advice you are not an englishman but i suppose youve got some intelligence lala bowed and spread his hands but replied not your opinion should be asked joseph went on because you see as the only other person besides my grandfather and my cousin in the house you might yourself be suspected indeed he added i have no doubt you will be suspected when i talk over the conduct of the case which will be my task i suppose it will perhaps be my duty to suspect you lala bowed again and again spread his hands but did not speak in fact joseph now perceived that he was having the conversation wholly to himself his grandfather sat passive listening as one who in a dream hears voices but does not heed what they are saying yet smiling politely iris listened but paid no heed she thought that a great deal of fuss was being made about papers which perhaps were worth nothing and as for her inheritance why as she never expected to get any she was not going to mourn the loss of what perhaps was worth nothing very well then said joseph thats all ive got to say ive given you the best advice i can and i suppose i may go have you lost your voice iris no but i think you had better go joseph my grandfather is not able to talk this morning and i dare say your advice is very good but we have other advisers as for you mr lala roy or whatever you call yourself said joe roughly ive warned you suspicion certainly will fall upon you and what i say istake care for my own part i never did believe in niggers and i wouldnt have one in my house lala roy bowed again and spread his fingers then joseph went away the door between the shop and the hall was half open and he looked in a strange man was sitting in the outer shop a pipe in his mouth and james was leaning his head upon his hands with wild and haggard eyes gazing straight before him poor devil murmured joseph i feel for him i do indeed he had the key madefor himself he certainly let me use it once but only once and whos to prove it and hes had the opportunity every day of using it himself thats very awkward foxy my boy if i were foxy i should be in a funk myself he strolled away thinking that all promised well lotty most favorably and unsuspiciously received in her new character no one knowing the contents of the packet his grandfather gone silly and for himself he had had the opportunity of advising exactly what he wished to be donenamely that silence and inaction should be observed for a space in order to give the holders of the property a chance of offering terms what better advice could he give and what line of action would be better or safer for himself if james had known who was in the housepassage the other side of the door there would i think have been a collision of two solid bodies but he did not know and presently lala roy came back and the torture began again james took down books and put them up again he moved about feverishly doing nothing with a duster in his hand but all the time he felt those deep accusing eyes upon him with a silence worse than a thousand questions he knewhe was perfectly certainthat he should be found out and all the trouble for nothing and the bailiffs man in possession and the safe robbed and those eyes upon him saying as plain as eyes could speak thou art the man and joe is the man said james not me at all what i did was wrong but i was tempted oh what a precious liar and villain he is and what a fool ive been the day passed more slowly than it seemed possible for any day to pass always the man in the shop always the deep eyes of the silent hindoo upon him it was a relief when once mr chalker looked in and surveyed the shelves with a suspicious air and asked if the old man had by this time listened to reason it is the business of him who makes plunder out of other mens distressesas the jackal feeds upon the offal and the putrid carcassto know as exactly as he can how his fellowcreatures are situated for this reason such a one doth diligently inquire listen pick up secrets put two and two together and pry curiously into everybodys affairs being never so happy as when he gets an opportunity of going to the rescue of a sinking man thus among those who lived in good repute about the lower end of the kings road none had a better name than mr emblem and no one was considered to have made more of his chances and it was with joy that mr chalker received joe one evening and heard from him the dismal story that if he could not find fifty pounds within a few hours he was ruined the fifty pounds was raised on a bill bearing mr emblems name when it was presented however and the circumstances explained the old gentleman who had at first refused to own the signature accepted it meekly and told no one that his grandson had written it himself without the polite formality of asking permission to sign for him in other words joseph was a forger and mr chalker knew it and this made him the more astonished when mr emblem did not take up the bill but got it renewed quarter after quarter substituting at length a bill of sale as if he was determined to pay as much as possible for his grandsons sins where is he asked the moneylender angrily why doesnt he come down and face his creditors masters upstairs said james and youve seen yourself mr chalker that he is off his chump and oh sir who would have thought that emblems would have come to ruin but theres something jamescome thinkthere must be something mr joseph said there were thousands but hes a terrible liaroh mr chalker hes a terrible liar and villain why hes even deceived me what has he borrowed your money worseworse do you know where i could find him sir well i dont know mr chalker was not in the habit of giving addresses but in this case perhaps joe might be squeezed as well as his grandfather unfortunately that bill with the signature had been destroyed i dont know perhaps if i find out i may tell you and james if you can learn anythingthis rubbish wont fetch half the moneyill make it worth your while james i will indeed ill make him take his share said james to himself if i have to go to prison he shall go too they shant send me without sending him he looked round the watchful eyes were gone the hindoo had gone away noiselessly james breathed again after all he said how are they to find out how are they to prove anything mr joseph took the things and i helped him to a key and he isnt likely to split andoh lord if they were to find it for at that moment he felt the duplicate key in his waistcoatpocket if they were to find it he took the key out and looked at the bright and innocentlooking thing as a murderer might look at his blood stained dagger just then as he gazed upon it holding it just twelve inches in front of his nose one hand was laid upon his shoulder and another took the key from between his fingers he turned quickly and his knees gave way and he sunk upon the floor crying oh mr lala roy sir mr lala roy i am not the thief i am innocent i will tell you all about it i will confess all to you i will indeed i will make atonement oh what a miserable fool ive been upon the heels of folly said the sage treadeth shame you will now be able to understand the words of wisdom which say of the wicked man the curse of iniquity pursueth him he liveth in continual fear the anxiety of his mind taketh vengeance upon him stand up and speak the man in possession looked on as if an incident of this kind was too common in families for him to take any notice of it nothing in fact is able to awaken astonishment in the heart of the man in possession because nothing is sacred to him except the sticks he has to guard to iris the event was however of importance because it afforded lala roy a chance of giving arnold that photograph no other than an early portrait of mr emblems grandson chapter xii is this his photograph the best way to get a talk with his cousin was to dine with her arnold therefore went to chester square next day with the photograph in his pocket it was half an hour before dinner when he arrived and clara was alone my dear she cried with enthusiasm i am charmedi am delightedwith iris i am glad said arnold mendaciously i am delighted with herin every way she is more and better than i could have expectedfar more a few americanisms of course no doubt said arnold when i saw her i thought they rather resembled anglicisms but you have had opportunities of judging you have in your own possession he continued have you not all the papers which establish her identity oh yes they are all locked up in my strongbox i shall be very careful of them though of course there is no one who has to be satisfied except myself and i am perfectly satisfied but then i never had any doubt from the beginning how could there be any doubt how indeed truth honor loyalty and candor as well as gentle descent are written on that girls noble brow arnold plain so that all may read it is truly wonderful she went on how the old gentle blood shows itself and will break out under the most unexpected conditions in her face she is not much like her father that is true though sometimes i catch a momentary resemblance which instantly disappears again her eyes are not in the least like his nor has she his manner or carriage or any of his little tricks and peculiaritiesthough perhaps i shall observe traces of some of them in time but especially she resembles him in her voice the tonethe timbrereminds me every moment of my poor claude i suppose said arnold that one must inherit something if it is only a voice from ones father have you said anything to her yet about money matters and a settlement of her claims no not yet i did venture last night to approach the subject but she would not hear of it so i dropped it i call that true delicacy arnoldnative instinctive hereditary delicacy have you given any more money to the american gentleman who brought her home iris made him take a hundred pounds against his will to buy books with for he is not rich poor fellow it went much against the grain with him to take the money but she made him take it she said he wanted books and instruments and insisted on his having at least a hundred pounds it was generous of her yes she isi am convinceda truly generous girl and as openhanded as the day now would a common girl a girl of no descent have shown so much delicacy and generosity by the way clara here is a photograph does it belong to you ii picked it up he showed the photograph which lala roy had given him oh yes it is a likeness of dr washington iriss adopted brother and guardian she must have dropped it i should think it was taken a few years back but it is still a very good likeness a handsome man is he not he grows upon one rather his parting words with iris yesterday were very dignified and touching i will give it to her presently he replied without further comment there was then no doubt the woman was an impostor and the man was the thief and the papers were the papers which had been stolen from the safe and iris deseret was no other than his own iris but he must not show the least sign of suspicion what are you thinking about arnold asked clara your face is as black as thunder you are not sorry that iris has returned are you i was thinking of my engagement clara why you are not tired of it already an engaged man arnold ought not to look so gloomy as that i am not tired of it yet but i am unhappy as regards some circumstances connected with it your disapproval clara for one my dear cousin i owe so much to you that i want to owe you more now i have a propositiona promiseto make to you i am now so sure so very sure and certain that you will want me to marry miss aglenand no one elsewhen you once know her that i will engage solemnly not to marry her unless you entirely approve let me owe my wife to you as well as everything else arnold you are not in earnest quite in earnest but i shall never approve nevernevernever i could not bring myself under any circumstances that i can conceive to approve of such a connection my dear cousin i am on the other hand perfectly certain that you will approve why if i were not quite certain do you think i should have made this promise but to return to your newlyfound cousin tell me more about her well i have discovered that she is a really very clever and gifted girl she can imitate people in the most wonderful way especially actresses though she has only been to a theater once or twice in her life at liverpool she heard some one sing what she calls a tropical song and this she actually remembersshe carried it away in her head every wordand she can sing it just as they sing it on the stage with all the vulgarity and gestures imitated to the very life of course i should not like her to do this before anybody else but it is really wonderful indeed said arnold it must be very clever and amusing of course said clara with colossal ignorance an american lady can hardly be expected to understand english vulgarities no doubt there is an american variety arnold thought that a vulgar song could be judged at its true value by any lady either american or english but he said nothing and then the young lady herself appeared she had been driving about with clara among various shops and now bore upon her person the charming result of these journeys in the shape of a garment which was rich in texture and splendid in the making and she really was a handsome girl only with a certain air of being dressed for the stage but arnold now more than suspicious was not dazzled by the gorgeous raiment and only considered how his cousin could for a moment imagine this person to be a lady and how it would be best to break the news claras cousin she said i have forgotten your name but how do you do again and then they went in to dinner you have learned i suppose said arnold something about the deseret family by this time oh yes i have heard all about the familytree i dare say i shall get to know it by heart in time but you dont expect me all at once to care much for it little republican said clara she actually does not feel a pride in belonging to a good old family the girl made a little gesture your family cant do much for you that i can see except to make you proud and pretend not to see other women in the shop that is what the county ladies do why my dear what on earth do you know of the county ladies lotty blushed a little she had made a mistake but she quickly recovered i only know what ive read cousin about any kind of english ladies but thats enough im sure stuckup things and again she observed from claras pained expression that she had made another mistake if she showed a liking for stout at lunch she manifested a positive passion for champagne at dinner i do like the english custom she said of having two dinners in the day ladies in america i suppose said clara dine in the middle of the day always but i have visited many families in new york and boston who dined late said arnold dare say she replied carelessly im going to have some more of that curry stuff please and dont ask any more questions anybody till ive worried through with it im a wolf at curry she likes england arnold said clara covering up this remark so to speak she likes the country she says very much at all events said the girl i like this house which is firstclassfineproper and the furniture and pictures and alltiptop but im afraid it is going to be awful dull except at meals and when the boy is going her own head was just touched by the boy and she was a little off her guard my dear child said clara you have only just come and you have not yet learned to know and love your own home and your fathers friends you must take a little time oh ill take time as long as you like but i shall soon be tired of sitting at home i want to go about and see thingstheaters and musichalls and all kinds of places ladies in england do not go to musichalls said arnold gentlemen do why not ladies then answer me that why cant ladies go when gentlemen go what is proper for gentlemen is proper for ladies very well then i want to go somewhere every night i want to see everything there is to see and to hear all that there is to hear we shall go presently a good deal into society said clara timidly society will come back to town very soon nowat least some of it oh yes i dare say society no thank you with company manners i want to laugh and talk and enjoy myself the champagne in fact had made her forget the instructions of her tutor at all events she looked anything but quiet with her face flushed and her eyes bright suddenly she caught arnolds expression of suspicion and watchfulness and resolutely subdued a rising inclination to get up from the table and have a walk round with a snatch of a topical song forgive me clara she murmured in her sweetest tone forgive me cousin i feel as if i must break out a bit now and then yankee manners you know let me stay quiet with you for a while you know the thought of starched and stiff london society quite frightens me i am not used to anything stiff let me stay at home quiet with you dear girl cried clara her eyes filling with tears she has all claudes affectionate softness of heart i believe said arnold later on in the evening that she must have been a circus rider or something of that sort what on earth does clara mean by the gentle blood breaking out we nearly had a breaking out at dinner but it certainly was not due to the gentle blood after dinner arnold found her sitting on a sofa with clara who was telling her something about the glories of the deseret family he was half inclined to pity the girl or to laughhe was not certain whichfor the patience with which she listened in order to make amends for any bad impression she might have produced at dinner he asked her presently if she would play she might be and certainly was vulgar but she could play well and she knew good music people generally think that good music softens manners and does not permit those who play and practice it to be vulgar but concerning this young person so much could not be said with any truth you play very well where did you learn who was your master arnold asked she began to reply but stopped short he had very nearly caught her dont ask questions she said i told you not to ask questions before where should i learn but in america do you suppose no one can play the piano except in england look here she glanced at her cousin do you mr arbuthnot always spend your evenings like this how like this why going around in a swallow tail to drawingrooms with the women like a tame tomcat if you do you must be a truly good young man if you dont what do you do very often i spend my evenings in a drawingroom oh lord do most young englishmen carry on in the same proper way why not dont they go to musichalls please and dancing cribs and such perhaps but what does it concern us to know what some men do oh not much only if i were a man like you i wouldnt consent to be a tame tomcatthat is all but perhaps you like it she meant to insult and offend him so that he should not come any more but she did not succeed he only laughed feeling that he was getting below the surface and sat down beside the piano you amuse me he said and you astonish me you are in fact the most astonishing person i ever met for instance you come from america and you talk pure london slang with a cockney twang how did it get there in fact it was not exactly london slang but a patois or dialect learned partly from her husband partly from her companions and partly brought from gloucester i dont knowi never asked it came wrapped up in brown paper perhaps with a string round it you have lived in america all your life and you look more like an englishwoman than any other girl i have ever seen do i so much the better for the english girls they cant do better than take after me but perhapsmost likely in factyou think that american girls all squint perhaps or have got humpbacks anything else you were brought up in a little american village and yet you play in the style of a girl who has had the best masters she did not explainit was not necessary to explainthat her master had been her father who was a teacher of music i cant help it can i she asked i cant help it if i turned out different to what you expected people sometimes do you know and when you dont approve of a girl its english manners i suppose to tell her sokind of encourages her to persevere and pray for better luck next time doesnt it its simple too and prevents any foolish errorsno mistake afterward you see i say are you going to come here often because if you are i shall go away back to the states or somewhere or stay upstairs in my own room you and me wont get on very well together i am afraid i dont think you will see me very often he replied that is improbable yet i dare say i shall come here as often as i usually do what do you mean by that she looked sharply and suspiciously at him he repeated his words and she perceived that there was meaning in them and she felt uneasy i dont understand at all she said clara tells me that this house is mine nowdont you knowi dont intend to invite any but my own friends to visit me in my own house that seems reasonable no one can expect you to invite people who are not your friends well then i aint likely to call you my friendarnold inclined his headand i am not going to talk riddles any more is there anything else you want to say nothing more i think at present thank you if there is you know dont mind mehave it outim nobody of course im not expected to have any mannersim only a girl you can say what you please to me and be as rude as you please englishmen always are as rude as they can be to american girlsive always heard that arnold laughed at all events he said you have charmed clara which is the only really important thing goodnight missmiss deseret goodnight old man she said laughing because she bore no malice and had given him a candid opinion i dare say when you get rid of your fine company manners and put off your swallow tail youre not a bad sort after all perhaps if you would confess you are as fond of a kickup on your way home as anybody trust you quiet chaps clara had not fortunately heard much of this conversation which indeed was not meant for her because the girl was playing all the time some waltz music which enabled her to talk and play without being heard at the other end of the room well there was now no doubt the american physician and the subject of the photograph were certainly the same man and this man was also the thief of the safe and iris aglen was iris deseret of that arnold had no longer any reasonable doubt there was however one thing more before leaving claras house he refreshed his memory as to the deseret arms the quarterings of the shield were so far exactly what mr emblem recollected it is said lala roy what i thought but as yet not a word to iris he then proceeded to relate the repentance the confession and the atonement proposed by the remorseful james but he did not tell quite all for the wise man never tells all what really happened was this when james had made a clean breast and confessed his enormous share in the villainy lala roy bound him over to secrecy under pain of law law the rigorous pointing out that although they do not in england exhibit the kourbash or bastinado the soles of the feet they make the prisoner sleep on a hard board starve him on skilly set him to work which tears his nails from his fingers keep him from conversation tobacco and drink and when he comes out so hedge him around with prejudice and so clothe him with a robe of shame that no one will ever employ him again and he is therefore doomed to go back again to the english hell lala roy though a man of few words drew so vivid a description of the punishment which awaited his penitent that james foxy as he was by nature felt constrained to resolve that henceforth happen what might then and for all future he would range himself on the side of virtue and as a beginning he promised to do everything that he could for the confounding of joseph and the bringing of the guilty to justice chapter xiii his last chance three days elapsed during which nothing was done that cause is strongest which can afford to wait but in those three days several things happened first of all mr david chalker seeing that the old man was obdurate made up his mind to lose most of his money and cursed joe continually for having led him to build upon his grandfathers supposed wealth yet he ought to have known tradesmen do not lock up their savings in investments for their grandchildren nor do they borrow small sums at ruinous interest of moneylending solicitors nor do they give bills of sale these general rules were probably known to mr chalker yet he did not apply them to this particular case the neglect of the general rule in fact may lead the most astute of mankind into ways of foolishness james for his part stimulated perpetually by fear of prison and loss of character and of situationfor who would employ an assistant who got keys made to open the safeshowed himself the most repentant of mortals dr joseph washington lulled into the most perfect security enjoyed all those pleasures which the sum of three hundred pounds could purchase nobody knew where he was or what he was doing as for lotty she had established herself firmly in chester square and cousin clara daily found out new and additional proofs of the gentle blood breaking out on the fourth morning lala roy sallied forth he was about to make a great moral experiment the nature of which you will immediately understand none but a philosopher who had studied confucius and lao kiun would have conceived so fine a scheme first he paid a visit to mr chalker the office was the groundfloor front room in one of the small streets north of the kings road it was not an imposing office nor did it seem as if much business was done there and one clerk of tender years sufficed for mr chalkers wants oh he said its our friend from india youre a lodger of old emblems aint you i have lived with him for twenty years i am his friend very well i dare say we shall come to terms if hes come to his senses just take a chair and sit down how is the old man he has not yet recovered the use of his intellect oh then how can you act for him if hes off his head i came to ask an english creditor to show mercy mercy what is the man talking about mercy i want my money what has that got to do with mercy nothing truly but i will give you your money i will give you justice and you shall give me mercy you lent mr emblem fifty pounds will you take your fifty pounds and leave us in peace he drew a bag out of his pocketa brown bankers bagand mr chalker distinctly heard the rustling of notes this is a sound which to some ears is more delightful than the finest music in the world it awakens all the most pleasurable emotions it provokes desire and hankering after possession and it fills the soul with the imaginary enjoyment of wealth certainly not said mr chalker confident that better terms than those would be offered if that is all you have to say you may go away again but the rest is usury think to give fifty and ask three hundred and fifty is the part of an usurer call it what you please the bill of sale is for three hundred and fifty pounds pay that three hundred and fifty with costs and sheriffs poundage and i take away my man if you dont pay it then the books on the shelves and the furniture of the house go to the hammer the books i am informed said lala roy will not bring as much as a hundred pounds if they are sold at auction as for the furniture some of it is mine and some belongs to mr emblems granddaughter his granddaughter oh its a swindle said mr chalker angrily it is nothing more or less than a rank swindle the old man ought to be prosecuted and mind you ill prosecute him and you too for conspiring with him a prosecution said the hindoo will not hurt him but it might hurt you for it would show how you lent him fifty pounds five years ago how you made him give you a bill for a hundred how you did not press him to pay that bill but you continually offered to renew it for him increasing the amount on each time of renewal and at last you made him give you a bill of sale for three hundred and fifty this is i suppose one of the many ways in which englishmen grow rich there are also usurers in india but they do not in my country call themselves lawyers a prosecution my friend it is for us to prosecute shall we show that you have done the same thing with many others you are by this time well known in the neighborhood mr chalker and you are so much beloved that there are many who would be delighted to relate their experiences and dealings with so clever a man have you ever studied one asks with wonder the precepts of the great sage who founded your religion oh come dont let us have any religious nonsense i assure you they are worth studying i am myself an humble follower of gautama but i have read those precepts with profit in the kingdom imagined by that preacher there is no room for usurers mr chalker where then will be your kingdom every man must be somewhere you must have a kingdom and a king this is tomfoolery mr chalker turned red and looked very uncomfortable stick to business payment in full those are my terms you think then that the precepts of your sage are only intended for men while they sit in the church many englishmen think so i have observed payment in full mister thats what i want he banged his fist on the table no abatement no mercy shown to an old man on the edge of the grave think mr chalker you will soon be as old as mr emblem your hair as white your reason as unsteady payment in full and no more words it is well then mr chalker i have another proposal to make to you i thought we should come to something more out with it i believe you are a friend of mr emblems grandson joe oh yes i know joe you know him intimately yes i may say so you know that he forged his grandfathers name that he is a profligate and a spendthrift and that he has taken or borrowed from his grandfather whatever money he could get and thatin short he is a friend of your own it was not until after his visitor had gone that mr chalker understood and began to resent this last observation go on he said i know all about joe good then if you can tell me anything about him which may be of use to me i will do this i will pay you double the valuation of mr emblems shop in return for a receipt in full if you can not you may proceed to sell everything by auction mr chalker hesitated a valuation would certainly give a higher figure than a forced sale and then that valuation doubled well he said i dont know its a cruel hard case to be done out of my money how am i to find out whether anything i tell you would be of use to you or not what kind of thing do you want how do i know that if you get what you want you wont swear it is of no use to you you have the word of one who never broke his word mr chalker laughed derisively why he said i wouldnt take the word of an english bishopno nor of an archbishopwhere money is concerned what is itwhat is the kind of thing you want to know it is concerned with a certain woman oh well if it is only a woman i thought it might be something about money joe you see like a good many other people has got his own ideas about money and perhaps he isnt so strict in his dealings as he might befew men areand i should not like to let out one or two things that only him and me know in fact mr chalker saw in imagination the burly form of joe in his office brandishing a stick and accusing him of friendships trust betrayed but as it is only a womanwhich of em is it this is a young woman said to be handsome tall and finelymade she has i am told light brown hair and large eyes that is the description of her given to me i know the girl you mean splendid figure and goes well in tights i have not been informed on that subject can you tell me any more about her i suspect mister said joes friend with cunning eyes that youve made the acquaintance of a certain widow that wasmarried woman that is i remember now ive seen hindoos about her lodgings down shadwell way perhaps said lala and perhaps not his face showed not the least sign which could be read you can tell me afterward what you know of the woman at shadwell well then joe thinks i know nothing about it else i wouldnt tell you because i dont want a fight with joe is this any use to you he is married to the girl as well as to the widow he is married to the girl as well as to the widow he has then two wives it is against the english custom and breaks the english law the young wife who is beautiful and the old wife who has the lodginghouse very good what is the address of this woman mr chalker looked puzzled dont you know it then what are you driving at what is the name and address of this shadwell woman well thenhe wrote an address and handed it overyou may be as close as you like i dont care it isnt my business but you wont make me believe you dont know all about her look here whatever happens dont say i told you it shall be a secret said lala taking out the bag of notes let us complete the business at once mr chalker here is another offer i will give you two hundred pounds in discharge of your whole claim or you shall have a valuation made if you prefer it and i will double the amount mr chalker chose the former promptly and in a few moments handed over the necessary receipts and sent his clerk to recall the man in possession what are you going to do with joe he asked no good turn ill swear and a more unforgiving face than yours i never set eyes on it isnt my business but ill give you one warning if you make joe desperate hell turn on you and lord help your slender ribs if joe once begins dont make him desperate and now ill tell you another thing first the woman at shadwell is horribly jealous shell make a row next the young one who sings at a musichall shes desperately in love with her husbandmore than he is with herand if a womans in love with a man theres one thing she never forgives you understand what that is between the pair joes likely to have a rough time i do i have had many wives myself oh lord he says hes had many wives how many lala roy read the receipt and put it in his pocket then he rose and remarked with a smile of supreme superiority it is a pleasure to give money to you and to such as you mr chalker is it he replied with a grin give me some more then you are one of those who the richer they become the less harm they do many englishmen are of this disposition when they are poor they are jackals hyenas wolves and maneating tigers when they are rich they are benevolent and charitable and show mercy unto the wretched and the poor so that in their case the words of the wise man are naught when he says that the earth is barren of good things where she hoardeth treasure and that where gold is in her bowels no herb groweth pray mr chalker pray earnestly for gold in order that you may become virtuous mr chalker grinned but looked uncomfortable i will mister he said i will pray with all my might nevertheless he remained for the space of the whole morning in uneasiness the words of the philosopher troubled him i do not go so far as to say that his mind went back to the days when he was young and innocent because he was still young and he never had been innocent nor do i say that a tear rose to his eyes and trickled down his cheek because nothing brought tears into his eyes except a speck of dust or that he resolved to confine himself for the future to legitimate lawyers work because he would then have starved i only say that he felt uncomfortable and humiliated and chiefly so because an old man with white hair and a brown skinhang it a common niggerhad been able to bring discord into the sweet harmony of his thoughts lala roy then betook himself to joes former lodgings and asked for that gentlemans present address the landlady professed to know nothing you do know however he persisted reading knowledge in her eyes is it trouble you mean for him asked the woman and him such a fine wellsetup young man too is it trouble oh dear i always thought he got his money on the cross look here i aint going to round on him though he has gone away and left a comfortable room so there and you may go lala roy opened his hand there were at least five golden sovereigns glorifying his dingy palm can gold the moralist asked ever increase the virtue of man woman how much is it trouble she repeated looking greedily at the money will the young man get copped lala understood no london slang but he showed his hand again how much who so is covetous let him know that his heart is poor how much poor young man ill take them all please sir whats he done where does he live i know where he lives she said because our bill rode away with him at the back of his cab and saw where he got out hes married now and his wife sings at the musichall and he lives on her earnings quite the gentleman he is now and smokes cigars all day long theres his address and thank you for the money oh she said with a gasp to think that people can earn five pounds so easy may the gold procure you happinesssuch happiness as you desire said lala roy it will nearly pay the quarters rent and thats about happiness enough for one morning joe was sitting in his room alone half asleep in fact he had a head upon him he sprung to his feet however when he saw lala roy hallo he cried you here nig how the devil did you find out my address there was not only astonishment but some alarm upon his countenance never mind i want a little conversation with you mr joseph well sit down and let us have it out i say have you come to tell me that you did sneak those papers after all what did you get for them i have not come to tell you that i dare say however we shall be able some day to tell you who did steal the papersif any were stolen that is quite so my jolly mariner if any were stolen ho ho youve got to prove that first havent you hows the old man he is ill he is feeble with age he is weighed down with misfortune i am come mr joseph to ask your help for him my help for him why cant he help himself four or five years ago he incurred a debt for one who forged his name he needed not to have paid that money but he saved a man from prison who was that who forged his name i do not name that man whose end will be confusion unless he repent and make amends this debt has grown until it is too large for him to pay it unless it is paid his whole property his very means of living will be sold by the creditor how can i pay him back it is three hundred and fifty pounds now said joseph man thou hast named thyself joseph stammered but blustered still wellthenwhat the devil do you meanyou and your forgery forgery is one crime you have since committed perhaps others think you have been saved once from prison will any one save you a second time how have you shown your gratitude will you now do something for your benefactor what do you mean i say what do you mean by your forgery and prison hang me if i oughtnt to kick you out of the room i would too if you were ten years younger do you know sir that you are addressing an officer and a gentleman there is sometimes even at the very end a door opened for repentance the door is open now young man once more consider your grandfather is old and destitute will you help him joseph hesitated i dont believe he is poor he has saved up all his money for the girl let her help him you are wrong he has saved nothing his granddaughter maintains herself by teaching he has not a penny you have got from him and you have spent all the money he had he ought to have saved he could at least have lived by his calling but for you and for this debt which was incurred by you he is ruined by it what will you do for him i am not going to do anything for him said joseph is it likely did he ever have anything but a scowl for me he who injures another is always in the wrong you will then do nothing think it is the open door he is your grandfather he has kept you from starvation when you were turned out of office for drink and dishonesty i heard that you now have money i have been told that you have been seen to show a large sum of money will you give him some as a matter of fact joe had been the night before having a festive evening at the musichall from which his wife was absent owing to temporary indisposition while there he took so much scotch whisky and water that his tongue was loosened and he became boastful and that to so foolish an extent that he actually brandished in the eyes of the multitude a whole handful of banknotes he now remembered this and was greatly struck by the curious fact that lala roy should seem to know it i havent got any money it was all brag last night i couldnt help my grandfather if i wanted to you have what is left of three hundred pounds said lala roy if i said that last night replied joe i must have been drunker than i thought you old fool the flimsies were duffers where do you think i could raise three hundred pounds no noim sorry for the old man but i cant help him im going to see him again in a day or two we jolly sailors dont make much money but if a pound or two when i come home will be of any use to him hes only got to say the word after all i believe its a kid got up between you the old man must have saved something you will suffer him then even to be taken to the workhouse why i cant help it and i suppose youll have to go there too ho ho i say nig he began to laugh ho ho they wont let you wear that old fez of yours at the workhouse how beautiful youll look in the workhouse uniform wont you ill come home and bring you some baccy now you can cheese it old un i will go if that is what you mean it is the last time that you will be asked to help your grandfather the door is closed you have had one more chance and you have thrown it away so he departed and joe who was of a selfreliant and sanguine disposition thought nothing of the warning which was therefore thrown away and wasted as for lala he called a cab and drove to shadwell and if any man ever felt that he was an instrument set apart to carry out a scheme of vengeance that hindoo philosopher felt like one the count of monte cristo himself was not more filled with the faith and conviction of his divine obligation in the afternoon he returned to chelsea and perhaps one who knew him might have remarked upon his face something like a gleam of satisfaction he had done his duty it was now five days since the fatal discovery mr emblem still remained upstairs in his chair but he was slowly recovering he clearly remembered that he had been robbed and the principal sign of the shock was his firm conviction that by his own exercise of memory iris had been enabled to enter into possession of her own as regards the bill of sale he had clean forgotten it now in the morning there happened a thing which surprised james very much the man in possession was recalled he went away so that the money must have been paid james was so astonished that he ran upstairs to tell iris then said the girl we shall not be turned out after all but who has paid the money it could have been no other than arnold yet when later in the day he was taxed with having committed the good action arnold stoutly denied it he had not so much money in the world he said in fact he had no money at all the good man said the philosopher has friends of whom he knoweth not as the river returns its waters to the sea so the heart rejoiceth in returning benefits received oh lala said iris but on whom have we conferred any benefits the moon shines upon all alike said lala and knows not what she illumines lala roy said arnold suddenly getting a gleam of intelligence it is you who have paid this money you lala no one else could have paid it said arnold but i thoughti thought said iris you thought i had no money at all children i have some one may live without money in hindostan but in england even the philosopher cannot meditate unless he can pay for food and shelter i have money iris and i have paid the usurer enough to satisfy him let us say no more oh lala the tears came to iriss eyes and now we shall go on living as before i think not he replied in the generations of man the seasons continue side by side but spring does not always continue with winter i know now interrupted mr emblem suddenly waking into life and recollection i could not remember at first now i know very well but i cannot tell how that the man who stole my papers is my own grandson james would not steal james is curious he wants to read over my shoulders what i am writing he would pry and find out but he would not steal it doesnt matter muchdoes itsince i was able to repair the lossi always had a most excellent memoryand iris has now received her inheritance but it is my grandson joe who has stolen the papers my daughters son came home from australia whenbut this i learned afterwardhe had already disgraced himself there he ran into debt and i paid his debts he forged my name and i accepted the bill he took all the money i could let him have and still he asked for more there is no one in the world who would rob me of those papers except joseph now the door was open to the staircase and the door of communication between the shop and the housepassage was also open this seems a detail hardly worth noting yet it proved of the greatest importance from such small trifles follow great events observe that as yet no positive proof was in the hands of the two conspirators which would actually connect iris with claude deseret the proofs were in the stolen papers and though clara had those papers who was to show that these papers were actually those in the sealed packet when mr emblem finished speaking no one replied because arnold and lala knew the facts already but did not wish to spread them abroad and next because to iris it was nothing new that her cousin was a bad man and because she thought now that the man in possession was gone they might just as well forget the papers and go on as if all this fuss had not happened in the silence that followed this speech they heard the voice of james downstairs saying i am sorry to say sir that mr emblem is ill upstairs and you cant see him today ill is he i am very sorry take him my compliments james mr frank farrars compliments and tell him and then mr emblem sprung to his feet crying stop him stop him go downstairs some one and stop him i dont know where he lives stop him stop him arnold rushed down the stairs he found in the shop an elderly gentleman carrying a bundle of books it was in fact mr farrar come to negotiate the sale of another work from his library i beg your pardon sir said arnold mr emblem is most anxious to see you would you step upstairs quick mr farrarquick the old man held him tight by the hand tell me before my memory runs away with me againtell me listen iris yet it doesnt matter because you have alreadytell me he seemed about to wander again but he pulled himself together with a great effort you knew my soninlaw before his marriage surely mr emblem i knew your soninlaw and his father and all his people and his name was not aglen at all asked arnold no he took the name of aglen from a fancied feeling of pride when he quarreled with his father aboutwell it was about his marriage as you know mr emblem he came to london and tried to make his way by writing and thought to do it and either to hide a failure or brighten a success by using a pseudonym people were more jealous about their names in those days he had better added the unsuccessful veteran of letters he had far better have made his living as aas ahe looked about him for a fitting simileas a bookseller then sir said arnold what was his real name his name was claude deseret of course iris said arnold taking her hand this is the last proof we have known it for four or five days but we wanted the final proof and now we have it my dear you are the cousin of clara holland and all her fortune by her grandfathers will is yours this is the secret of the safe this was what the stolen papers told you chapter xiv the hand of fate at the first stroke of noon next day arnold arrived at his cousins house in chester square he was accompanied by iris by lala roy and by mr frank farrar pray arnold what is meant by all this mystery asked clara receiving him and his party with considerable surprise i will explain all in a few minutes my dear clara meanwhile have you done what you promised yes i wrote to dr washington he will be here i expect in a few minutes you wrote exactly in the form of words you promised me yes exactly i asked him to meet me here this morning at a quarter past twelve in order to discuss a few points connected with iriss future arrangements before he left for america and i wrote on the envelope immediate and important very well he will be sure to come i think perhaps your cousin will insist upon another check for fifty pounds being given to him arnold you are extremely suspicious and most ungenerous about dr washington on whose truth and disinterested honesty i thoroughly rely we shall see meanwhile clara i desire to present to you a young lady of whom we have already spoken this is miss aglen who is i need hardly say deeply anxious to win your good opinion and this is lala roy an indian gentleman who knew her father and has lived in the same house with her for twenty years our debti shall soon be able to say your debtof gratitude to this gentleman for his long kindness to miss aglenis one which can never be repaid clara gave the most frigid bow to both iris and lala roy really arnold you are talking in enigmas this morning what am i to understand what has this gentleman to do with my appointment with dr washington my dear cousin i am so happy this morning that i wonder i do not talk in conundrums or rondeaux or terza rima it is a mere chance i assure you perhaps i may break out in rhymes presently this evening we will have fireworks in the square roast a whole ox invite the neighbors and dance about a maypole you shall lead off the dance clara pray go on arnold all this is very inexplicable this gentleman however is a very old friend of yours clara do you not recognize mr frank farrar who used to stay at the hall in the old days i remember mr farrar very well clara gave him her hand but i should not have known him why have we never met in society during all these years mr farrar i suppose because i have been out of society miss holland said the scholar when a man marries and has a large family and a small income and grows old and has to see the young fellows shoving him out at every point he doesnt care much about society i hope you are well and happy i am very well and i ought to be happy because i have recovered claudes lost heiress my cousin iris deseret and she is the best and most delightful of girls with the warmest heart and the sweetest instincts of a lady by descent and birth she looked severely at arnold who said nothing but smiled incredulously mr farrar looked from iris to miss holland bewildered and why do you come to see me today mr farrarand with arnold because i have undertaken to answer one question presently which mr arbuthnot is to ask me that is why i am here not but what it gives me the greatest pleasure to see you again miss holland after so many years our poor claude died in america you know mr farrar so i have recently heard and left one daughter that also i have learned he looked at iris she is with me here in this house and has been with me for a week you may understand mr farrar the happiness i feel in having with me claudes only daughter mr farrar looked from her to arnold with increasing amazement but he said nothing i have appointed this morning at arnolds request clara went on to have an interview perhaps the last with the gentleman who brought my dear iris from america i say at arnolds request because he asked me to do this and i have always trusted him implicitly and i hope he is not going to bring trouble upon us now although i do not i confess understand the presence of his friends or their connection with my cousin my dear clara said arnold again i ask for nothing but patience and that only for a few moments as for the papers you have them all in your possession yes they are locked up in my strongbox do not on any account give them to anybody however after this morning you will not be asked have you taken as yet any steps at all for the transference of your property toto the rightful heir not yet thank goodness and now clara i will ask you as soon as dr washington andyour cousinare in the drawingroom to ring the bell you need not explain why we will answer the summons and we will give all the explanations that may be required i will not have my cousin vexed arnold you shall not your cousin shall never be vexed by me as long as i live and dr washington must not be in any way offended consider the feelings of an american gentleman arnold he is my guest you may thoroughly rely upon my consideration for the feelings of an american gentleman go there is a knock at the door go to receive him and when both are in the room ring the bell joe was in excellent spirits that morning his interview with lala roy convinced him that nothing whatever was known of the papers therefore nothing could be suspected what a fool he thought must be his grandfather to have had these papers in his hands for eighteen years and never to have opened the packet in obedience to the injunction of a dead man had it been his own case he would have opened the papers without the least delay mastered the contents and instantly claimed the property he would have gone on to use it for his own purposes and private gain and with an uninterrupted run of eighteen years he would most certainly have made a very pretty thing out of it however everything works well for him who greatly dares his wife would manage for him better than he could do it for himself yet a few weeks and the great fortune would fall into his hands he walked all the way to chester square considering how he should spend the money there are some forms of foolishness such as say those connected with art literature charity and work for others which attract some rich men but which he was not at all tempted to commit there were others however connected with horses races betting and gambling which tempted him strongly in fact joseph contemplated spending this money wholly on his own pleasures probably it would be a part of his pleasure to toss a few crumbs to his wife it is sad to record that lotty finding herself received with so much enthusiasm had already begun to fall off in her behavior even clara who thought she discovered every hour some new point of resemblance in the girl to her father was fain to admit that the americanisms were much too pronounced for general society her laugh was louder and more frequent her jests were rough and common she used slang words freely her gestures were extravagant and she walked in the streets as if she wished every one to notice her it is the walk of the musichall stage and the trick of it consists chiefly in giving so to speak prominence to the shoulders and oscillation to the skirts in fact she was one of those ladies who ardently desire that all the world should notice them further in her conversation she showed an acquaintance with certain phases of the english lower life which was astonishing in an american girl but clara had no suspicionnone whatever one thing the girl did which pleased her mightily she was never tired of hearing about her father and his way of looking standing walking folding his hands and holding himself and constantly more and more clara detected these little tricks in his daughter perhaps she learned them my dear she said to think that i ever thought you unlike your dear father so that it made her extremely uncomfortable to detect a certain reserve in arnold toward the girl and then a dislike of arnold in the girl herself however she was accustomed to act by arnolds advice and consented when he asked her to arrange so that arnold might meet dr washington as if anything that so much as looked like suspicion could be thought of for a moment but the bell rang and arnold followed by his party led the way from the morning room to the drawing room dr joseph washington was standing with his back to the door the girl was dressed as if she had just come from a walk and was holding claras hand yes madam he was saying softly i return tomorrow to america and my wife and my children i leave our dear girl in the greatest confidence in your hands i only venture to advise that to avoid lawyers expenses you should simply instruct somebodythe right personto transfer the property from your name to the name of iris then you will be saved troubles and formalities of every kind as for me my home is in america no joseph said lala roy gently it is in shadwell it is a lie he cried starting it is an infernal lie iris said arnold lift your veil my dear mr farrar who is this young lady look upon this face clara this is the daughter of claude deseret said mr farrar if she is the daughter of the man who married alice emblem and went by the name of aglen clara turned a terrified face to arnold arnold help me whose face is this he repeated it isgood heavensit is the face of your portrait it is claudes face again they are his very eyes she covered her face with her hands oh arnold what is it who is this other this other lady clara is a musichall singer who calls herself carlotta claridane wife of this man who is not an american at all but the grandson of mr emblem the bookseller and therefore cousin of iris it is he who robbed his grandfather of the papers which you have in your possession clara and this is an audacious conspiracy which we have been so fortunate as to unearth and detect step by step oh can such wickedness be said clara and in my house too joe said lotty the game is up i knew it wouldnt last let them prove it said joe let them prove it i defy you to prove it dont be a fool joe said his wife remember she whispered youve got a pocketful of money let us go peaceably as for you nigger said joe ill break every bone in your body not here said arnold there will be no breaking of bones in this house lotty began to laugh the gentle blood always shows itself doesnt it she said ive got the real instincts of a lady havent i oh it was beautiful while it lasted and every day more and more like my father arnold cried poor clara crushed help me come said arnold you had better go at once i wont laugh at you said lotty its a shame and youre a good old thing but it did me good it really did to hear all about the gentle blood come joe let us go away quietly she took her husbands arm joe was standing sullen and desperate mr chalker was right it wanted very little more to make him fall upon the whole party and go off with a fight young woman said lala roy you had better not go outside the house with the man it will be well for you to wait until he has gone why he is my husband whatever we have done and im not ashamed of him is he your husband ask him what i meant when i said his home was at shadwell come lotty said joe with a curious change of manner let us go at once wait lala repeated wait young woman let him go first praypray let him go first why should i wait i go with my husband i thought to save you from shame but if you will go with him ask him again why his home is at shadwell and why he left his wife lotty sprung upon her husband and caught his wrists with both hands joe what does he mean tell me he is a liar that would be useless said lala roy because a very few minutes will prove the contrary better however that he should go to prison for marrying two wives than for robbing his grandfathers safe its a lie joe repeated looking as dangerous as a wild boar brought to bay there was a joseph gallop formerly assistant purser in the service of the peninsular and oriental steam navigation company continued the man of fate who married nine months ago a certain widow at shadwell he was turned out of the service and he married her because she had a prosperous lodginghouse ohh cried lotty you villain you thought to live upon my earnings did you you put me up to pretend to be somebody else miss hollandshe fell upon her knees literally and simply and without any theatrical pretense at allforgive me i am properly punished oh he is made of lies he told me that the real iris was dead and buried and he was the rightful heir and as for youshe sprung to her feet and turned upon her husbandi know it is true i know it is truei can see it within your guilty eyes if you have any doubt said lala here is a copy of the marriagecertificate she took it read it and put it in her pocket then she went out of the room without another word but with rage and revenge in her eyes joseph followed her saying no more he had lost more than he thought to lose but there was still time to escape and he had most of the money in his pocket but another surprise awaited him the lady from shadwell in fact was waiting for him outside the door with her were a few shadwell friends of the seafaring profession come to see fair play it was a disgraceful episode in the history of chester square after five minutes or so during which no welsher on a racecourse was ever more hardly used two policemen interfered to rescue the man of two wives and there was a procession all the way to the policecourt where after several charges of assault had been preferred and proved against half a dozen mariners joseph was himself charged with bigamy both wives giving evidence and committed for trial his old friend mr david chalker one is sorry to add refused to give bail so that he remained in custody and will now endure hardness for a somewhat lengthened period clara said arnold iris will stay with you if you ask her we shall not marry my dear without your permission i have promised that already have i not the end a yachtsmans yarn ive knocked off the sea now for some years but i was yachting along with all sorts of gentlemen and in all sorts of craft from three to one hundred and twenty tons ever since the top of my head was no higher than your knee and as boy man and master ill allow theres no one who has seen much more than i have yet spite of that i can recall but one extraordinary circumstance daresay when ive told it you you wont believe it but i shant be able to help that truths truth no consequence how singlar its appearance may be and so now to begin no matter the port no matter the yachts name no matter her owners calling no matter nothing terms and dates and the like shall be imaginary and so let the vessel be a schooner of one hundred tons called the evangeline and her owner mr robinson and me who was captain of her jacob williams thisll furnish a creep you may go on sweeping with till doomsday without raising whats dead and gone though not forgotten mind ye from the bottom well for a whole fortnight had the evangeline been moored in a snug berth alongside a pier wall the english channel was wide there and it didnt need much sailing to find the atlantic ocean i began to think all cruising was to come to an end for mr robinson was a man fond of keeping the sea and i had never found a fortnights lying by to his taste at all but matters explained themselves after id seen him two or three times walking about with a very finelooking female party mr robinson was a bachelor his age i dare say about forty with handsome whiskers and one of those voices that show breeding in a man ay and the humblest ear that hears em recognizes them i didnt take much notice of her though i reckoned her large black eyes the beautifullest i had ever beheld in a female countenance she seemed youngnot more than eightandtwentywith what they call a fine figure though speaking for myself i never had much opinion of small waists give me bong poine as my old master sir arthur jones used to say and he ought to have known for he had been studying female beauty for eighty year and died i reckon of it i considered it to be a case of courting for she was a lady there was no mistaking that she held her head up like one and dressed as real ladies do expensively but plainlyay old jacob knows he didnt go yachting for years for nothing but it wasnt for me to form opinions my berth was an easy onejust a sprawl all day long with a pipe in my mouth and a good nights rest to follow and that was all it was my duty to think about well one afternoon mr robinson comes aboard alone and says to me williams at what hour will the tide serve tomorrow night why sir says i after thinking therell be plenty of water at nine oclock then says he see all ready williams to get away tomorrow at that hour were off to and he names a mediterranean port right sir says i though wondering a bit to myself for the season was pretty well advanced and i couldnt have guessed from what i knew and had heard of him that he would have pushed so far south well at half past eight that evening the deck was hailed by a boat alongside and up he comes handing a lady on board thickly veiled and they both went below as if they were in a hurry some parcels and a bit of a bandbox or so were chucked up to us by the watermen who then shoved off there was a nice little offshore breeze ablowing and soon after nine we were clear of the harbor and sailing quietly along the sea smooth and the moon rising red out of a smother of mist mr robinson came on deck and looked aloft to see what sail was made i was at the tiller and stepping up to me he says what dyer think of the weather williams why says i it seems as if it was going to keep fair there cant come too much wind for me says he short of a hurricane dont spare your cloths let it blow as it may you understand that quite easily says i now this order i took to be as singular as our going to the mediterranean for mr robinson was never a man to carry on there was no racing in him quiet sailing was his pleasure and what his hurry was all of a sudden i couldnt imagine though i guessed that the party in the cabin might have something to do with it she came on deck after we had been under way about three quarters of an hour this time without a veil with what they call a turban hat on her head there was plenty of moonlight and i tell you that the very shadow she cast and that lay like a carving of jet on ivory looked beautiful on the white deck so fine her figure was lord how her big eyes flashed too when she drew my way and turned em to the moon being a sober spectable man myself with correct views on the bringing up of daughters it seemed to be a queer start that if so be this young lady was keeping company with mr robinsonbeing courted by him you knowthat her mother or some female connection wasnt along with her praps they were married i thought might have been spliced that very morning she had no gloves on and whenever she walked with mr robinson near to me id take a long squint at her left hand but there was no distinguishing a weddingring by moonshine and even had it been broad daylight it would have been all the same for the jewels lay so thick on her fingers youd have fancied them sparkling with dew well all that night it blew a soft quiet wind but for hours next day twas all dead calm a light swell the sunlight coming off the water hot as steam and the yacht slewing round and round as if like the rest of us she was trying to find out where the wind meant to come from next i never saw any man fret more over a calm than mr robinson did over that the lady didnt appear discomposed she sat under the awning reading and once when mr robinson turned to look at her she ran her shining black eyes with a smiling roll around the sea that was just the same as if she had said isnt it big enough for hang me if even i couldnt read the language in them sparklers of hers when she chose to lift the eyelashes off their meaning unaccustomed as jacob williams ever was to female ways and the customs they pursue but mr robinson couldnt keep quiet he kept on asking of me when i thought the wind was coming and he was constantly getting up and staring round and id notice he was always letting his cigar go out which is a sure sign that either a man dont care about smoking or else hes got something weighing upon his spirits praps thought i its stipulated that hes not to get married anywhere but in the port were bound to and that the license dont run so long as to allow for calms but this i said to myself with a wink at my own thoughts for though theres a good many things in this ere yearth that i dont understand i must tell you jacob williams wasnt born without a mind well time went on and then a headwind sprung up with a short spiteful sea i kept the yacht under a press according to orders and the driving of her closehauled every luff trembling and the foam to leeward as high as the rail fairly smothered the vessel forward whilst as to her movements it was dreary and aching enough i can tell you the wind sweeping out of clouds of spray forward and splitting with shrieks upon the ropes and the canvas soaking up the damp till every stretch might have been owned for the matter of color by a coalman twas bout ship often enough mr robinson being full of anxiety and impatience and watching the compass for a shift of wind as if he was a cat and there was a mouse in the binnacle i could have sworn the handsome party would have been beamended by the dance it turned the stomachs of two of the crew anyhow and one of them said that if he had known the evangeline was to cross the bay hed have found another ship yet the lady took no notice of the weather shed come up dressed in waterproofs and her beautiful face shining with the big eyes in it out of a hood and the more the sea troubled the schooner the more the vessel labored and showed herself uneasy the more the lady would look pleased laughing out at times with plenty of music in her voice i allow but with a something in it and in the gleaming stare shed keep on the plunging and streaming bows that made me calculatedont know why im surethat lovely as she was and beautiful as she was shaped there was no more heart inside of her than theres pearls in cockles well we had two days of this passing a good many vessels both steam and sail that were getting all they could out of what was baffling us then there was a shift of wind it fell light everything turned dry and we went along with all cloths showing sailing about five knotsnot more and i dont think less when the change of weather came mr robinson looked more cheerful seemed happier he did and i overheard him say to the party as they stood looking over the starn at the wake that ran away in two white lines with a gull or two circling within a stones throw in waiting for whatever the cook had to heave overboardi heard him say every milell make it more difficult besides says he with a sweep of his hand what a waste this is williams he sings out to me how fur offs the horizon why i answered from this height i should say a matter of six mile and a half and how fur distant captain williams says the lady smiling sweetly and pretty nigh confusing my brains by the beautiful look she gave me would a vessel like ours be seen i took time to think with a squint at our mastheadsfor we carried long sticksand said well call it twelve mile mum its impossible to speak to a nicety and what i heard mr robinson observe as i turned away is twelve miles in this here watery wilderness of leagues and then she gave a laugh as if some one had made her feel glad and it was all like music and poetry i can tell you her laughing and his softness and the water smooth and the yacht sailing along as if she enjoyed it like a hardworked vessel out for a holiday time passed till it come on four oclock on the afternoon of that day there was a redness in the western heavens that betokened more wind though the sun still stood high meanwhile the breeze hung steady there was the smoke of a steamer away on our starboard quarter and there was nothing else in sight i took no notice of it for smokes not uncommon nowadays on the ocean but whatever the vessel might be the glances id take at her now and again made me see she was driving through it properly for threequarters of an hour after we had sighted it the smoke was abeam and the funnel raised up showing that her course was something to the eastward of ours i pointed the glass at her and made out a yellow chimney and polemastshull still below the horizon either a yacht sir or a government dispatch boatsomething of that kind sir says i to mr robinson who was sitting near me with the lady he jumped up and took a look and whilst he was working away with the telescope the breeze comes along right out of the red sky abeam where the steamer was with twice its former strength roughening the blue water into hollows and bowing down the yacht till the slope of her deck was like a roof the crew jumped about shortening canvas and the yacht began to snore as she felt the wind on a sudden and as if the steamer had only just then spied us she altered her course by three or four points as one could see by the swift rising of her hull till whilst the sun was still hanging a middling height over the sea line you could see the whole of the vessela long low craft of about one hundred and fifty tonssweeping through the seas like an arrow the smoke streaming black and fat from her small yellow funnel and her hull sinking out of sight one moment and reappearing the next in a sort of jump of the whole foaming wash as if by jove her screw would thrust her clean out of the water the lady looked at her with a sort of indifference but mr robinson was pale enough as he handed me the glass and said williams see if you know her i took a look at her and answered its hard to tell those steamers till you see their names sir but if shes not the violet belonging to general coldsteel of course these are false names shes uncommonly like her but law bless us how theyre driving her why therell be a bust up if they dont look out theyll blow the boilers out of her indeed i never before saw any vessel rush so shed shear clear through some of the larger seas and you didnt need watch her long to make you reckon youd seen the last of her then mr robinson talking like a man half in a rage half in a fright orders me to pack sail on the schooner but it was already blowing a singlereef breeze and i had no idea of losing our spars and so i told him very firmly that the yacht had all she needed and that more would only stop her by burying her and i had my way but we were foaming through it too we wanted no more pressure the freshening wind had worked the schooner into a fair nine knots and it was firstrate sailing too considering the character of the sea and the weight of the breeze twas now certain beyond all question that the steamer meant to close us though i thought she had a queer way of doing it for sometimes shed head right at us and then put her helm down and keep on a course parallel with ours forging well ahead and then shifting the helm for a fresh run at us there was no anxiety that i could see in the ladys looks but mr robinson was quite mightily bothered and worried and pale enough to make me suppose that all this meant a pursuit with a capture to follow and it was certain that whatever intentions the steamer had there was nothing in the night which was approaching to promise us a chance of sneaking clear for the sky was pure as glass and it wouldnt be long after sundown before the moon would be filling the air with a light like morning well sir fathom by fathom the steamer had her way of us she had drawn close enough to let mr robinson make out the people abroad as for me i was at the helm for there was something in the maneuvering of the steamer that made me suspicious and i wasnt going to trust any man but myself at the tiller we held on as we were we couldnt improve the schooners speed by bringing the wind anywhere else than where it was and no good was to be done by cracking on even though it had come to our dragging what we couldnt carry for the steamers speed was a fair fourteen if it was a mile and our yacht was not going to do that you know or anything like it the moon had arisen and the sea ran like heaving snow from the windward and by this time the steamer was about half a mile ahead of us about three points on the weather bow she was as plain as if daylight lay on her all the time the party and mr robinson had kept the deck she taking a view now and then of the steamer with an operaglass suddenly i yelled out mr robinson by all thats holy sir that vessel there means to run us down lads i shouted tumble aft quick and see the boats all ready for lowering the lady jumped up with a scream and seized hold of mr robinsons arm who seeming to forget what he was about shook her off and fell to raving to me to see that the steamer didnt touch us by thunder sir there was the cowardly brute slanting her flying length as though to cross our hawse but clearly aiming to strike us right amidships i shouted to the men to make ready and bout ship and a minute after i shoved the tiller over and the yacht rounded like a woman waltzing but before we had gathered way the steamer was after us the lady sent up scream after scream mr robinson stood motionless seeing as plain as i that if the steamer meant to sink us there was no seamanship in this wide world that could stop her and i saw the men throwing off their shoes and half stripping themselves ready for what was to come the steamer headed dead to strike our weatherbeam she rushed at us with the foam boiling over her bows once more i chucked the schooner right up into the wind and the steamer went past us like a rocket under our stern i looked at her and shant ever forget what i saw there was a whitehaired man with white whiskers and bareheaded roaring and raging at us in the grasp of three or four seamen twas like a deathstruggle a chap who looked as if he had just seized the wheel was grinding it hard over to get away from us and so the steamer fled past more like a nightmare than a reality and in a few minutes was standing with full speed to the norrard where in less than a quarter of an hour she faded slick out of sight it was some time after i had left the evangeline and was at home before i got to know the meaning of this here wonderful adventure the party it turned out was no less than the wife of the general as owned the violet and she was running away with mr robinson may be our men had talked about our going to the mediterranean but anyhow the general who was in london at the time got scent that his wife had bolted with mr robinson in the evangeline and in less than twentyfour hours he was after us in his steamer he tracked us by speaking the vessels we passed and the light airs and calms we had encountered easily allowed him to overhaul quickly and it turned out that when he had fairly sighted us he sent the man at the wheel forward and took the helm himself the crew dursnt express their wonder aloud though they knew he was no hand at steering not to mention the mad agitation he was in and they let him have his way when he headed the steamer for us expecting that he merely wished to close us in order to speak but when i put my helm down and the steamer passed and they spied the general rounding his craft evidently to run us down they threw themselves upon him to save their own lives as well as ours that was the sight i saw as the steamer rushed past a few moments after they had gone clear the poor old fellow was seized with an attack of apoplexy which killed him right off and thereupon they headed right away to england with the dead body aboard what do you think of this for a yarn would any one suppose such vengefulness could exist in a whitehaired man that had known his seventieth birthday what did he want to go and try and drown me and my mates for we werent running away with the female party but the worlds full of romantic capering sir and i tell you what it istaint all fair sailing even in yachts modest and pretty as the divarsion is
