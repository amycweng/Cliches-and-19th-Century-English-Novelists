and i was lying in his arms and he was kissing me her schoolgirls were engaged in working and embroidering flags for the dukes army boys i said beware if you go up higher you will certainly meet wild men i was standing at the wicket waiting for my basket to be taken in as i passed through the crowd one caught me by the arm when i came to my senses the captain gave me a glass of cordial this i did and so stood before them all bareheaded barnaby holding the pistol to the poor wretchs head so that he should not bellow and call for assistance for faith and freedom chapter i farewell sunday the morning of sunday august in the year of grace should have been black and gloomy with the artillery of rolling thunder dreadful flashes of lightning and driving hail and wind to strip the orchards and lay low the corn for on that day was done a thing which filled the whole country with grief and bore bitter fruit in after years of revenge and rebellion and because it was the day before that formerly named after bartholomew the disciple it hath been called the black bartholomew of england thus being likened unto that famous day approved by the pope when the french protestants were treacherously massacred by their king it should rather be called farewell sunday or exile sunday for on that day two thousand godly ministers preached their last sermon in the churches where they had laboured worthily and with good fruit some during the time of the protector and some even longer because among them were a few who possessed their benefices even from the time of the late king charles the first and since on that day two thousand ministers left their churches and their houses and laid down their worldly wealth for conscience sake there were also perhaps as many wives who went with them and i dare say three or four times as many innocent and helpless babes and further it is said that the time was fixed by design and deliberate malice of our enemies the ministers were called upon to make their choice only a week or two before the day of the collection of their tithes in other words they were sent forth to the world at the season when their purses were at the leanest indeed with most country clergymen their purses shortly before the collection of tithes have become wellnigh empty it was also unjust that their successors should be permitted to collect the tithes due to those who were ejected it is fitting to begin this history with the black bartholomew because all the troubles and adventures which afterwards befell us were surely caused by that accursed day one know not certainly what other rubs might have been ordained for us by a wise providence always with the merciful design of keeping before our eyes the vanity of worldly things the instability of fortune the uncertainty of life and the wisdom of looking for a hereafter which shall be lasting stable and satisfying to the soul still it must be confessed such trials as were appointed unto us were in severity and continuance far beyond those appointed to the ordinary sort so that i cannot but feel at times uplifted i hope not sinfully at having been called upon to endure so much let me not however be proud had it not been for this day for certain our boys would not have been tempted to strike a blowvain and useless as it provedfor the protestant religion and for liberty of conscience while perhaps i should now be forbidden to relate our sufferings were it not for the glorious revolution which has restored toleration secured the protestant ascendancy and driven into banishment a prince concerning whom all honest men pray that he and his son if he have indeed a son of his own may never again have authority over this realm this sunday i say should have wept tears of rain over the havoc which it witnessed yet it was fine and clear the sun riding in splendour and a warm summer air blowing among the orchards and over the hills and around the village of bradford orcas in the shire of somerset the wheat for the season was late stood goldcoloured in the fields ready at last for the reaper the light breeze bent down the ears so that they showed like waves over which the passing clouds make light and shade the apples in the orchards were red and yellow and nearly ripe for the press in the gardens of the manor house hard by the church the sunflowers and the hollyhocks were at their tallest and their best the yellow roses on the wall were still in clusters the sweetpeas hung with tangles of vine and flower upon their stalks the bachelors buttons the sweet mignonette the nasturtium the gillyflowers and stocks the sweetwilliams and the pansies offered their late summer blossoms to the hot sun among the lavender thyme parsley sage feverfew and vervain of my ladys garden oh i know how it all looked though i was then as yet unborn how many times have i stood in the churchyard and watched the same scene at the same sweet season on a weekday one hears the thumping and the groaning of the mill below the church there are the voices of the men at workthe yohoing of the boys who drive and the lumbering of the carts you can even hear the spinningwheels at work in the cottages on sunday morning everything is still save for the warbling of the winged tribe in the wood the cooing of the doves in the cote the clucking of the hens the grunting of the pigs and the droning of the bees these things disturb not the meditations of one who is accustomed to them at eight oclock in the morning the sexton an ancient man and rheumatic hobbled slowly through the village key in hand and opened the churchdoor then he went into the tower and rang the first bell i suppose this bell is designed to hurry housewives with their morning work and to admonish the men that they incline their hearts to a spiritual disposition this done the sexton set open the doors of the pews swept out the squires and the rectors in the chancel dusted the cushions of the pulpit the readingdesk at this time was not used opened the clasps of the great bible and swept down the aisle as he had done sunday after sunday for fifty years when he had thus made the church ready for the days service he went into the vestry which had only been used since the establishment of the commonwealth for the registers of birth death and marriage at one side of the vestry stood an ancient black oak coffer the sides curiously graven and a great rusty key in the lock the sexton turned the key with difficulty threw open the lid and looked in ay he said chuckling the old surplice and the old book of common prayer ye have had a long rest tis time for both to come out again when the surplice is out the book will stay no longer locked up these two go in and out together i mind me nowhere he sat down and his thoughts wandered for a space perhaps he saw himself once more a boy running in the fields or a young man courting a maid presently he returned to the task before him and drew forth an old and yellow roll which he shook out it was the surplice which had once been white here you be he said put you away for a matter of twelve year and more and you bide your time you know you will come back again you are not in any hurry even the sexton dies but you die not you bide your time everything comes again the old woman shall give you a taste o the suds and the hot iron thus we go up and thus we go down he put back the surplice and took out the great book of common prayermusty and damp after twelve years imprisonment fie he said thy leather is parting from the boards and thy leaves they do stick together shalt have a pot of paste and then lie in the sun before thou goest back to the desk whether tis mass or common prayer whether tis independent or presbyterian folk mun still die and be burieday and married and bornwhatever they do say parson goes and preacher comes preacher goes and parson comes but sexton stayshe chuckled again put back the surplice and the book and locked the coffer then he slowly went down the church and came out of the porch blinking in the sun and shading his old eyes he sat down upon the flat stones of the old cross and presently nodded his head and dropped off asleep this was a strange indifference in the man a great and truly notable thing was to be accomplished that day but he cared nothing two thousand godly and learned men were to go forth into poverty for liberty of consciencethis mans own minister was one of them he cared nothing the king was sowing the seed from which should spring a rod to drive forth his successor from the kingdom in the village the common sort were not moved nothing concerns the village folk but the weather and the market prices as for the good sexton he was very old he had seen the church of england displaced by the presbyterians and the presbyterians by the independents and now these were again to be supplanted by the church of england he had been sexton through all these changes he heeded them not why his father sexton before him could remember when the mass was said in the church and the virgin was worshipped and the folk were driven like sheep to confession all the time the people went on being born and marrying and dying creed doth not truly affect these things nor the sextons work therefore this old gaffer having made sure that the surplice was in the place where it had lain undisturbed for a dozen years and remembering that it must be washed and ironed for the following sunday sat down to bask in the sun his mind at rest and dropped off into a gentle sleep at ten oclock the bellringers came tramping up the stone steps from the road and the sexton woke up at ten they used to begin their chimes but at the hour they ring for five minutes only ending with the clash of all five bells together at a quarterpast ten they chime again for the service which begins at halfpast ten at the sound of these chimes the whole village begins to move slowly towards the church first come the children the bigger ones leading those who are little by the hand the boys come next but unwillingly because the sexton is diligent with his cane and some of those who now go up the steps to the church will come down with smarting backs the reward of those who play or laugh during the service then come the young men who stand about the churchyard and whisper to each other after them follow the elders and the married men with the women and the girls five minutes before the half hour the ringers change the chime for a single bell then those who are outside gather in the porch and wait for the quality when the single bell began there came forth from the rectory the rector himself mr comfort eykin doctor of divinity who was this day to deliver his soul and lay down his charge he wore the black gown and geneva bands for the use of which he contended at this time he was a young man of thirtytall and thin he stooped in the shoulders because he was continually reading his face was grave and austere his nose thin and aquiline his eyes brightnever was any man with brighter eyes than my father his hair which he wore long was brown and curly his forehead high rather than broad his lips were firm in these days as my mother hath told me and as i well believe he was a man of singular comeliness concerning which he cared nothing always from childhood upwards he had been grave in conversation and seriously inclined in mind if i think of my father as a boy no one ever seems to think that his father was once a boy i am fain to compare him with humphrey save for certain bodily defects my father having been like a priest of the altar for bodily perfection that is to say i am sure that like humphrey he had no need of rod or ferule to make him learn his lessons and like that dear and fond friend of my childhood he would willingly sit in a corner and read a book while the other boys played and went ahunting or anesting and very early in life he was smitten with the conviction of sin and blessed with such an inward assurance of salvation as made him afterwards steadfast in all afflictions he was not a native of this country having been born in new england he came over being then eighteen years of age to study at oxford that university being purged of malignants as they were then called and at the time entirely in the hands of the godly he was entered of balliol college of which society he became a fellow and was greatly esteemed for his learning wherein he excelled most of the scholars of his time he knew and could read hebrew chaldee and the ancient syriac as well as latin and greek of modern languages he had acquired arabic by the help of which he read the book which is called the koran of the false prophet mohammed french and italian he also knew and could read easily as for his opinions he was an independent and that not meekly or with hesitation but with such zeal and vehemence that he considered all who differed from him as his private enemiesnay the very enemies of god for this reason and because his personal habits were too austere for those who attained not to his spiritual height he was more feared than loved yet his party looked upon him as one of their greatest and stoutest champions he left oxford at the age of five or six and twenty and accepted the living of bradford orcas offered him by sir christopher challis of that place here he had preached for six years looking forward to nothing else than to remain there advancing in grace and wisdom until the end of his days so much was ordered indeed for him but not quite as he had designed let no man say that he knoweth the future or that he can shape out his destiny you shall hear presently how benjamin arrogantly resolved that his future should be what he chose and what came of that impious resolution my fathers face was always austere this morning it was more serious and sterner than customary because the day was to him the most important in his life and he was about to pass from a condition of plenty the rectory of bradford orcas is not rich but it affords a sufficiency to one of penury those who knew him however had no doubt of the course he was about to take even the rustics knew that their minister would never consent to wear a surplice or to read the book of common prayer or to keep holy daysyou have seen how the sexton opened the box and took out the surplice yet my father had said nothing to him concerning his intentions in his hand he carried his biblehis own copy i have it still the margins covered with notes in his writingbound in black leather worn by constant handling with brass clasps upon his head he had a plain black silk cap which he wore constantly in his study and at meals to keep off draughts indeed i loved to see him with the silk cap rather than with his tall steeple hat with neither ribbon nor ornament of any kind in which he rode when he afterwards went about the country to break the law in exhorting and praying with his friends beside him walked my mother holding in her hand her boy my brother barnaby then three years of age as for me i was not yet born she had been weeping her eyes were red and swollen with tears but when she entered the church she wept no more bravely listening to the words which condemned to poverty and hardship herself and her children if any more should be born to her alas poor soul what had she done that this affliction should befall her what had her innocent boy done for upon hernot upon her husbandwould fall the heavy burden of poverty and on her children the loss yet never by a single word of complaint did she make her husband sorry that he had obeyed the voice of conscience even when there was nothing left in the house not so much as the widows cruse of oil alas poor mother once so free from care what sorrow and anxiety wert thou destined to endure for the tender conscience of thy husband at the same timenamely at the ringing of the single bellthere came forth from the manor house hard by the church his honour sir christopher with his family the worthy knight was then about fifty years of age tall and handsome stillin his later years there was something of a heavenly sweetness in his face created i doubt not by a long life of pious thoughts and worthy deeds his hair was streaked with grey but not yet white he wore a beard of the kind called stiletto which was even then an ancient fashion and he was dressed more soberly than is common with gentlemen of his rank having no feather in his hat but a simple ribbon round it and though his ruffles were of lace and the kerchief round his neck was lace the colour of his coat was plain brown he leaned upon a goldheaded cane on account of an old wound it was inflicted by a cavaliers musketball when he was a captain in the army of lord essex the wound left him somewhat lame yet not so lame but that he could very well walk about his fields and could ride his horse and even hunt with the otterhounds by his side walked madam his wife after him came his son humphrey newly married and with humphrey his wife and last came his soninlaw the reverend philip boscorel ma late fellow of all souls college oxford also newly married with his wife sir christophers daughter patience mr boscorel like my father was at that time thirty years of age like him too his face was comely and his features fine yet they lacked the fire and the earnestness which marked my father and in his silken cassock his small white bands his lace ruffles and his dainty walk it seemed as if mr boscorel thought himself above the common run of mankind and of superior clay tis sometimes the way with scholars and those who survey the world from the eminence of a library sir christophers face was full of concern because he loved the young man who was this day to throw away his livelihood and although he was ready himself to worship after the manner prescribed by law his opinions were rather independent than episcopalian as for mr boscorel who was about to succeed to the ejected minister his face wore no look of triumph which would have been ungenerous he was observed indeed after he had silently gone through the service of the day with the help of the common prayerbook to listen diligently unto the preacher the people i have already said knew already what was about to happen perhaps some of them but i think not possessed a copy of the old prayerbook this they knew was to be restored with the surplice and the observance of holy days feasts and fasts and the kneeling at the administration of the holy communion our people are craftsmen as much as they are rustics every week the masterclothiers men drive their packhorses into the village laden with wool and return with yarn they are not therefore so brutish and sluggish as most country folk yet they made no outward show of caring whether prelacy or independency was to have the sway perhaps the abstruse doctrines which my father loved to discuss were too high for them perhaps his austerity was too strict for them so that he was not beloved by them perhaps even they would have cared little if they had heard that bishop bonner himself was coming back religion to country folk means mostly the going to church on sunday morning that done mans service of prayer and praise to his creator is also done if the form be changed the church remains and the churchyard one shepherd followeth another but the flock is always the same revolutions overthrow kings and send great heads to the block but the village heedeth not unless civil war pass that way to country folk what difference the sky and the fields are unchanged under queen mary they are papists under queen elizabeth they are protestants they have the prayerbook under king james and king charles under oliver they have had the presbyterian and independent now they have the book of common prayer and the surplice again yet they remain the same people and tell the same stories and so far as i know believe the same thingsviz that christ jesus saves the soul of every man who truly believes in him why if it were not for his immortal soulconcerning which he takes but little thoughtthe rustic might be likened unto the patient beast whom he harnesseth to his plough and to his muckcart he changeth no more he works as hard he is as longenduring his eyes and his thoughts are as much bound by the hedge the lane and the field he thinks and invents and advances no more were it not i say for the church he would take as little heed of anything as his ox or his ass his village would become his country his squire would become his king the nearest village would become the camp of an enemy and he would fall into the condition of the ancient briton when julius caesar found every tribe fighting against every other i talk as a fool for sometimes there falls upon the torpid soul of the rustic a spark which causes a mighty flame to blaze up and burn fiercely within him i have read how a simple monk called peter the hermit drew thousands of poor illiterate credulous persons from their homes and led them a mob armed with scythes and pikes across europe to the deserts of asia minor where they miserably perished i have read also of jack cade and how he drew the multitudes after him crying aloud for justice or death and i myself have seen these sluggish spirits suddenly fired with a spirit which nothing could subdue the sleeping soul i have seen suddenly starting into life strength and swiftness have i seen suddenly put into sluggish limbs light and fire have i seen gleaming suddenly in dull and heavy eyes oh it was a miracle but i have seen it and having seen it i cannot despise these lads of the plough these honest boys of somerset nor can i endure to hear them laughed at or contemned bradford orcas in the hundred of horethorne somerset is a village so far from the great towns that one would think a minister might have gone on praying and preaching after his own fashion without ever being discovered but the arm of the law is long the nearest town is sherborne in dorsetshire to which there is a bridlepath across the fields it is the markettown for the villages round it bradford orcas is an obscure little village with no history and no antiquities it stands in the southeastern corner of the county close to the western declivity of the corton hills which here sweep round so as to form a valley in which the village is built along the banks of a stream the houses are for the most part of stone with thatched roofs as is the custom in our country the slopes of the hills are covered with trees and round the village stand goodly orchards the cider from which cannot be surpassed as for the land but little of it is arable the greater part is a sandy loam or stone brash the church which in the superstitious days was dedicated to st nicolas is built upon a hillock a rising ground in the west of the village this building of churches upon hillocks is a common custom in our parts and seemeth laudable because a church should stand where it can be seen by all the people and by its presence remind them of death and of the judgment the practice doth obtain for example at sherborne where there is a very noble church and at huish episcopi and at many other places in our county our church is fair and commodious not too large for the congregation having in the west a stone tower embattled and consisting of a nave and chancel with a very fine roof of carved woodwork there is an ancient yewtree in the churchyard from which in old times bows were cut some of the bows yet hang in the great hall of the manor house among the graves is an ancient stone cross put up no man knows when standing in a sixsided slab of stone but the top was broken off at the time of the reformation two or three tombs are in the churchyard and the rest is covered with mounds beneath which lie the bones and dust of former generations close to the churchyard and at the northeast corner is the manor house as large as the church itself but not so ancient it was built in the reign of henry vii a broad arched gateway leads into a court wherein is the entrance to the house over the gateway is a kind of tower but not detached from the house in the wall of the tower is a panel lozengeshaped in which are carved the arms of the challis family the house is stately with many gables and in each are casement windows set in richlycarved stone tracery as for the rooms within the house i will speak of them hereafter at present i have the churchyard in my mind there is no place upon the earth which more i love to stand in the long grass among the graves to gaze upon the wooded hills beyond the orchards the meadows the old house the venerable church the yewtree to listen to the murmur of the stream below and the singing of the lark above to feel the fresh breeze upon my cheekoh i do this daily it makes me feel young once more it brings back the days when i stood here with the boys and when sir christopher would lean over the wall and discourse with us gravely and sweetly upon the love of god and the fleeting joys of earth which yet he said we should accept and be happy withal in thankfulness and the happiness unspeakable that awaiteth the lords saints or if my thoughts continue in the past the graveyard brings back the presence and the voice of mr boscorel in such a spot as this he would say speaking softly and slowly the pastorals of virgil or theocritus might have been written here would the shepherds hold their contests certainly they could find no place even in sunny sicily or at mantua itself where save for three months in the year the air is more delightful here they need not to avoid the burning heat of a sun which gently warms but never burns here they would find the shade of the grove pleasant in the soft summer season innocent lambs instead of kids which are tasteless play in our meadows the cider which we drink is i take it more pleasing to the palate than was their wine flavoured with turpentine and our viols violins and spinets are instruments more delightful than the oaten pipe or the cithara itself then would he wave his hand and quote some poet in praise of a country life there is no man but may make his paradise and it is nothing but his love and dotage upon the worlds foul joys that keeps him out ont for he that lives retired in mind and spirit is still in paradise but child he would add with a sigh one may not always wish to be in paradise the worlds joys lie elsewhere only when youth is gonethen paradise is best the service began after the manner of the independents with a long prayer during which the people sat mr boscorel as i have said went through his own service in silence the book of common prayer in his hand after the prayer the minister read a portion of scripture which he expounded at length and with great learning then the congregation sang that psalm which begins triumphing songs with glorious tongues lets offer unto him this done the rector ascended the pulpit for the last time gave out his text turned his hourglass and began his sermon he took for his text those verses in st pauls second epistle to the corinthians vi in which the apostle speaks of his own ministry as if he was actually predicting the tribulation which was to fall upon these faithful preachers of a later timein much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastingscould not the very words be applied to my father he read the text three times so that everybody might fully understand the subject upon which he was to preachnamely the faithfulness required of a minister of the gospel i need not set down the arguments he used or the reasons he gave for his resolution not to conform with the act of uniformity the rustics sat patiently listening with no outward sign of assent or of sympathy but their conduct afterwards proved abundantly to which side their minds inclined it behoves us all to listen with respect when scholars and wise men inquire into the reasons of things yet the preachings and expositions which such as my father bestowed upon their flocks did certainly awaken mens minds to consider by themselves the things which many think too high for them it is a habit which may lead to the foundation of false and pernicious sects and it certainly is not good that men should preach the doctrines of the anabaptists the fifth monarchy men or the quakers yet it is better that some should be deceived than that all should be slaves i have been assured by onei mean humphreywho hath travelled that in those countries where the priest taketh upon himself the religion of the people so that they think to be saved by attending mass by fasting confession penance and so forth not only does religion itself become formal mechanical and inanimate but in the very daily concerns and business of life men grow slothful and lack spirit their religion which is the very heat of the body the sustaining and vital force of all mans actions is cold and dead therefore all the virtues are cold also and with them the courage and the spirit of the people thus it is that italy hath fallen aside into so many small and divided kingdoms and for this reason spain in the opinion of those who know her best is now falling rapidly into decay i am well assured by those who can remember that the intelligence of the village folk greatly increased during the period when they were encouraged to search the scriptures for themselves many taught themselves to read others had their children taught in order that they might read or hear daily portions of the scriptures it is now thirty years since authority resumed the rule the village folk have again become to outward seeming sheep who obey without questioning yet it is observed that when they are within reach of a townthat is to say of a meetinghousethey willingly flock to the service in the afternoon and evening it was with the following brave words that my father concluded his discourse seeing therefore my brethren how clear is the word of god on these points and considering that we must always obey god rather than man and observing that here we plainly see the finger of god pointing to disobedience and its consequences i am constrained to disobey the consequence will be to me that i shall stand in this place no more to you that you will have a stranger in your church i pray that he may be a godly person able to divide the word learned and acceptable as for me i must go forth perhaps from among you altogether if persecutions arise it may behove me and mine to seek again that land beyond the seas whither my fathers fled for the sake of religious liberty whatever happens i must fain preach the gospel it is laid upon me to preach if i am silent it will be as if death itself had fallen upon me my brethren there have been timesand those times may returnwhen the elect have had to meet secretly on the sides of barren hills and in the heart of the forest to pray together and to hear the word i say that these times may return if they do you will find me willing i hope and pray to brave for you the worst that our enemies can devise perhaps however this tyranny may pass over already the lord hath achieved one great deliverance for this ancient realm perhaps another may be in his secret purposes when we have been chastened as for our many sins we richly deserve whether in affliction or in prosperity let us always say the lords name be praised now therefore for the sand is running low and i may not weary the young and the impatient let me conclude farewell sweet sabbaths farewell the sweet expounding of the word farewell sweet pulpit farewell sweet faces of the souls which i have yearned to present pure and washed clean before the throne my brethren i go about henceforth as a dog which is muzzled another man will fill this pulpit our simple form of worship is gone the prayerbook and the surplice have come back again pray god we see not confession penance the mass the inquisition the enslavement of conscience the stake and the martyrs axe then he paused and bowed his head and everybody thought that he had finished he had not he raised it again and threw out his arms and shouted aloud while his eyes glowed like fire no i will not be silent i will not i am sent into the world to preach the gospel i have no other business i must proclaim the word as i hope for everlasting life brethren we shall meet again in the woods and on the hills we shall find a temple there are houses where two or three may be gathered together the lord himself being in their midst never doubt that i am ready in season and out of season whatever be the law to preach the gospel of the lord he ended and straightway descended the pulpit stair and stalked out of the church the people looking after him with awe and wonder but mr boscorel smiled and wagged his head with a kind of pity chapter ii in the village thus did my father by his own act and deed strip himself of all his worldly wealth yet having nothing he ceased not to put his trust in the lord and continued to sit among his books never asking whence came the food provided for him i think indeed so wrapt was he in thought that he knew not as for procuring the daily food my mother it was who found out the way those who live in other parts of this kingdom do not know what a busy and populous county is that of somerset apart from the shipping and the great trade with ireland spain and the west indies carried on from the port of bristol we have our great manufactures of cloth in which we are surpassed by no country in the world the town of taunton alone can boast of eleven hundred looms always at work making sagathies and des roys there are many looms at bristol where they make for the most part druggets and cantaloons and there are great numbers at that rich and populous town of frome selwood where they manufacture the spanish medleys besides the clothworkers we have in addition our knittedstocking trade which is carried on mostly at glastonbury and shepton mallet not only does this flourishing trade make the masters rich and prosperous it is not uncommon to find a master with his twentyay and his fortythousand pounds but it fills all the country with work so that the towns are frequent populous and full of everything that men can want and the very villages are not like those which may be seen in other parts poor and squalid but wellbuilt and comfortable every cottage has its spinningwheel the mother when she is not doing the work of the house sits at the wheel the girls when they have nothing else to do are made to knit stockings every week the masterclothier sends round his men among the villages their packhorses laden with wool every week they return their packs laden with yarn ready for the loom there is no part of england where the people are more prosperous and more contented nowhere are there more towns and all thriving nowhere are the villages better built nor can one find anywhere else more beautiful churches because the people make good wages they are independent in their manners they have learned things supposed to be above the station of the humble most of them in the towns and many in the villages are able to read this enables them to search the scriptures and examine into doctrine by the light of their own reason guided by grace and to me the daughter of a nonconforming preacher it does not seem wonderful that so many of them should have become stiff and sturdy nonconformists this was seen in the year and again three years later when a greater than monmouth landed on the western shores my mother then seeing no hope that her husband would earn by any work of his own the daily bread of the household bravely followed the example of the women in the village that is to say she set up her spinningwheel and spent all the time that she could spare spinning the wool into yarn while she taught her little boy first and afterwards her daughteras soon as i was old enough to manage the needlesto knit stockings what trade indeed could her husband follow save oneand that by law prohibited he could not dig he could not make anything he knew not how to buy or sell he could only study write and preach therefore while he sat among his books in one room she sat over her wheel in the other working for the masterclothiers of frome selwood it still makes my heart to swell with pity and with love when i think upon my mother thus spending herself and being spent working all day huckstering with the rough packhorsemen more accustomed to exchange rude jests with the rustics than to talk with gentlewomen and this she continued to do year after year cheerful and contented so that her husband should never feel the pinch of poverty love makes us willing slaves my father happily was not a man whose mind was troubled about food he paid no heed at all to what he ate provided that it was sufficient for his needs he would sup his broth of pork and turnips and bread after thanks rendered as if it were the finest dish in the world and a piece of cold bacon with a hot cabbage would be a feast for him the cider which he drank was brewed by my mother from her own apples to him it was as good as if it had been sherris or rhenish i say that he did not even know how his food was provided for him his mind was at all times occupied with subjects so lofty that he knew not what was done under his very eyes the hand of god he said doth still support his faithful doubtless we cannot look back upon those years without owning that we were so supported but my mother was the instrument nay my father sometimes even compared himself with satisfaction unto the prophet elijah whom the ravens fed beside the brook cherith bringing him flesh and bread in the morning and flesh and bread in the evening i suppose my father thought that his bacon and beans came to him in the same manner yet we should sometimes have fared but poorly had it not been for the charity of our friends many a fat capon green goose side of bacon and young grunter came to us from the manor house with tobacco which my father loved and wine to comfort his soul yea and clothes for us all else had we gone barefoot and in rags in this way was many an ejected elijah at that time nourished and supported fresh meat we should never have tasted any more than the humblest around us had it not been for our good friends at the manor house those who live in towns cannot understand how frugal and yet sufficient may be the fare of those who live in the country and have gardens and orchards cider was our drink which we made ourselves we had some sweet appletrees which gave us a stock of russets and pippins for winter use we had bees but we sold most of our honey at sherborne market our garden grew sallets and onions beans and the like skim milk we could have from the manor house for the fetching for breakfast we had bread and milk for dinner bread and soft cheese with a lettuce or an apple and bread or bread and butter for supper for my father there was always kept a piece of bacon or fat pork our house was one of the cottages in the village it is a stone house often i sit down to look at it and to remember those days of humility with a thick thatch it had two rooms below and two garrets above one room was made into a study or library for my father where also he slept upon a pallet the other was kitchen spinning room parlour all in one the door opened upon the garden and the floor was of stone so that it was cold but when barnaby began to find the use of his hands he procured some boards which he laid upon the stones and so we had a wooden floor and in winter across the door we hung a blanket or rug to keep off the wind the walls were whitewashed and over all my mother had written texts of scripture with charcoal so that godly admonition was ever present to our eyes and minds she also embroidered short texts upon our garments and i have still the cradle in which i was laid carved but i do not know by whose hand with a verse from the word of god my father used himself and would have us employ the words of the bible even for the smaller occasions of daily use nor would he allow that anything was lawful unless it was sanctioned by the bible holding that in the word was everything necessary or lawful did barnaby go shooting with sir christopher and bring home a rabbitlo david bade the children of israel teach the use of the bow did my mother instruct and amuse me with riddlesshe had the warrant of scripture for it in the example of samson did she sing psalms and spiritual songs to while away the time and make her work less irksome and please her little daughterin the congregation of nehemiah there were two hundred fortyandfive singing men and singing women my father read and expounded the bible to us twice a daymorning and evening besides the bible we had few books which we could read as for my mother poor soul she had no time to read and as for me when i grew older i borrowed books from the manor house or mr boscorel and there were old mr dods sayings and plain directions by joseph large always on the shelf beside the bible now while my father worked in his study and my brother barnaby either sat over his lessonbook his hands rammed into his hair as if determined to lose nothing not the least scrap of his portion yet knowing full well that on the morrow there would be not a word left in his poor unlucky noddle and once more the whip my mother would sit at her wheel earning the daily bread and when i was little she would tell me speaking very softly so as not to disturb the wrestling of her husband with a knotty argument all the things which you have heardhow my father chose rather poverty than to worship at the altar of baal and how two thousand pious ministers likeminded with himself left their pulpits and went out into the cold for conscience sake so that i was easily led to think that there were no christian martyrs and confessors more excellent and praiseworthy than these ejected ministers which still i believe then would she tell me further of how they fared and how the common people do still reverence them there was the history of john norman of bridgwater joseph chadwick of wrenford felix howe of west torrington george minton and many others she also instructed me very early in the history of the protestant uprising over the best half of europe and showed me how against fearful odds and after burnings and tortures unspeakable the good people of germany the netherlands and great britain won their freedom from the pope so that my heart glowed within me to think of the great goodness and mercy which caused me to be born in a protestant country and she instructed me later in the wickedness of king charles whom they now call a martyr and in the plots of that king and laud his archbishop and how king and archbishop were both overthrown and perished when the people arose and would bear no more in fine my mother made me from the beginning a puritan as i remember my mother always she was pale of cheek and thin her voice was gentle yet with her very gentleness she would make the blood to run quick in the veins and the heart to beat how have i seen the boys spring to their feet when she has talked with them of the great civil war and the revolution but always soft and gentle her blue eyes never flashing no wrath in her heart but the truth which often causeth righteous anger always upon her tongue one day i remember when i was a little girl playing in the garden mr boscorel walked down the village in his great silken gown which seemed always new his lace ruffs and his white bands looking like a bishop at least and walking delicately holding up his gown to keep it from the dust and mud when he spoke it was in a soft voice and a mincing speech not like our plain somersetshire way he stopped at our gate and looked down the garden it was a summer day the doors and windows of the cottage were open at our window sat my father bending over his books in his rusty gown and black cap thin and lank at the door sat my mother at her wheel child said the rector take heed thou never forget in thine age the thing which thou seest daily in thy childhood i knew not what he meant read and mark he said yea little alice learn by heart what the wise man hath said of the good woman she layeth her hands to the spindle she maketh fine linen and selleth it she eateth not the bread of idleness let her works praise her in the gates chapter iii the boys the family of challis of bradford orcas is well known here there has always been a challis from time immemorial they are said to have been on the land before the time of the conqueror but because they have never been a great family like the mohuns of dunster but only modest gentlefolk with some four or five hundred pounds a year they have not suffered like those great houses from the civil wars which when they raged in the land brought in their train so many attainders sequestrations beheadings imprisonments and fines whether the barons fought or whether cavaliers and roundheads the challises remained at bradford orcas since the land is theirs and the village it is reasonable that they should have done everything that has been done for the place one of them built the church but i know not when another built the tower another gave the peal of bells he who reigned here in the time of henry vii built the manor house another built the mill the monuments in the church are all put up to the memory of challises dead and gone there is one a very stately tomb which figures to the life sir william challis who died in the time of queen elizabeth carved in marble and coloured kneeling at a desk opposite to him is his second wife grace also kneeling behind the husband are three boys on their knees and behind the wife are three girls apart from this group is the effigy of filipa sir christophers first wife with four daughters kneeling behind her i was always sorry for filipa thus separated and cut off from the society of her husband there are brasses on the floor with figures of other challises and tablets in the wall and the challis coatofarms is everywhere cut in lozenges and painted in wood and shining in the east window it seemed to me in my young days that it was the grandest thing in the world to be a challis in this family there was a laudable practice with the younger sons that they stayed not at home as is too often their custom leading indolent lives without ambition or fortune but they sallied forth and sought fortune in trade or in the law or in the church or in foreign servicewherever fortune is to be honourably wonso that though i daresay some have proved dead and dry branches others have put forth flowers and fruit abundantly forming new and vigorous trees sprung from the ancient root thus some have become judges and some bishops and some great merchants some have crossed the ocean and are now settled in the plantations some have attained rank and estates in the service of the low countries thus sir christophers brother humphrey went to london and became a levant merchant and adventurer rising to great honour and becoming alderman i doubt not that he would have been made lord mayor but for his untimely death and as for his wealth which was rumoured to be so greatbut you shall hear of this in due time that goodly following of his household which you have seen enter the church on farewell sunday was shortly afterwards broken into by death there fell upon the village i think it was in the year the scourge of a putrid fever of which there died besides numbers of the village folk madam herselfthe honoured wife of sir christopherhumphrey his son and madam patience boscorel his daughter there were left to sir christopher therefore only his daughterinlaw and his grandsons robin and benjamin and in that year his household was increased by the arrival of his grandnephew humphrey this child was the grandson of sir christophers brother the turkey or levant merchant of whom i have spoken he was rich and prosperous his ships sailed out every year laden with i know not what and returned with figs dates spices gums silks and all kinds of precious commodities from eastern parts it is i have been told a profitable trade but subject to terrible dangers from moorish pirates who must be bravely fought and beaten off otherwise ship and cargo will be taken and captain and crew driven into slavery mr challis dwelt in thamesstreet close to towerhill it is said that he lived here in great splendour as befits a rich merchant who is also an alderman now in the year as is very well known a great plague broke out in the city there were living in the house in thamesstreet the alderman his wife his son his sons wife a daughter and his grandson little humphrey on the first outbreak of the pestilence they took counsel together and resolved that the child should be first sent away to be out of danger and that they would follow if the plague spread this was done and a sober man one of their porters or warehousemen carried the child with his nurse all the way from london to bradford orcas alas before the boy reached his greatuncle the house in thamesstreet was attacked by the plague and everyone therein perished thus was poor little humphrey deprived of his parents i know not who were his guardians or trustees or what steps if any were taken to inquire into the aldermans estate but when next year the great fire of london destroyed the house in thamesstreet with so many others all the estate whatever it had been vanished and could no more be traced there must have been large moneys owing it is certain that he had ventures in ships it has been supposed that he owned many houses in the city but they were destroyed and their very sites forgotten and no deeds or papers or any proof of ownership were left moreover there was nobody charged with inquiring into this orphans affairs therefore in the general confusion nothing at all was saved out of what had been a goodly property and the child humphrey was left without a guinea in the world thus unstable is fortune i know not whether humphrey received a fall in his infancy or whether he was born with his deformity but the poor lad grew up with a crooked figure one shoulder being higher than the other and his legs short so that he looked as if his arms were too long for him we who saw him thus every day paid no heed nor did he suffer from any of those cruel gibes and taunts which are often passed upon lads thus afflicted as he was by nature or misfortune debarred from the rough sports which pleased his cousins the boy gave himself up to reading and study and to music his manner of speech was soft and gentle his voice was always sweet and afterwards became strong as well so that i have never heard a better singer his faceah my brother humphrey what a lovely face was thine all goodness surely was stamped upon that face never never did an unworthy thought defile that candid soul or a bad action cast a cloud upon that brow as for robin sir christophers grandson i think he was always what he is still namely one of a joyous heart and a cheerful countenance as a boy he laughed continually would sing more willingly than read would play rather than work loved to course and shoot and ride better than to learn latin grammar and would readily off coat and fight with any who invited him yet not a fool or a clown but always a gentleman in manners and one who read such things as behove a country gentleman and scrupulous as to the point of honour such as he is still such he was always and of a comely presence with a rosy cheek and bright eyes and the strength of a young david as well as his ruddy and goodly countenance the name of david i am told means darling therefore ought my robin to have been named david there were two other boysbarnaby my brother who was six years older than myself and therefore always to me a great boy and benjamin the son of the rev mr boscorelthe rector barnaby grew up so broad and strong that at twelve he would have passed easily for seventeen his square shoulders deep chest and big limbs made him like a bull for strength yet he was shorter than most and looked shorter than he was by reason of his great breadth he was always exercising his strength he would toss the hay with the haymakers and carry the corn for the reapers and thresh with the flail and guide the plough he loved to climb great trees and fell to them with an axe everybody in the village admired his wonderful strength unfortunately he loved not books and could never learn anything so that when by dint of great application and many repetitions he had learned a little piece of a latin verb he straightway forgot it in the night and so next day there was another flogging but that he heeded little he was five years older than robin and taught him all his woodcraftwhere to find pheasants eggs how to catch squirrels how to trap weasels and stoats how to hunt the otter how to make a goldfinch whistle and a raven talknever was there such a master of that wisdom which doth not advance a man in the world now before barnabys birth his mother after the manner of hannah gave him solemnly unto the lord all the days of his life and after his birth her husband after the manner of elkanah said do what seemeth thee good only the lord establish his word he was therefore to become a minister like his father before him alas poor barnaby could not even learn the latin verbs and his heart it was found as he grew older was wholly set upon the things of this world wherefore my mother prayed for him daily while she sat at her work that his heart might be turned and that he might get understanding as for the fourth of the boys benjamin boscorel he was about two years younger than barnaby a boy who for want of a mother and because his father was careless of him grew up rough and coarse in manners and in speech and boastful of his powers to hear ben talk you would think that all the boys of his school the grammar school of sherborne were heroes that the latin taught was of a quality superior to that which robin and humphrey learnt of my father and that when he himself went out into the world the superiority of his parts would be immediately perceived and acknowledged those who watch boys at play togethergirls more early learn to govern themselves and to conceal their thoughts if not their tempersmay after a manner predict the future character of every one there is the man who wants all for himself and still wants more and will take all and yield nothing save on compulsion and cares not a straw about his neighboursuch was benjamin as a boy there is the man who gives all generouslysuch was robin there is again the man whose mind is raised above the petty cares of the multitude and dwells apart occupied with great thoughtssuch was humphrey lastly there is the man who can act but cannot think who is born to be led who is full of courage and of strength and leaves all to his commander captain or mastersuch was barnaby as i think of these lads it seems as if the kind of man into which each would grow must have been stamped upon their foreheads perhaps to the elders this prognostic was easy to read they suffered me to play with them or to watch them at play when the boys went off to the woods i went with them i watched them set their trapsi ran when they ran and then as now i loved robin and humphrey but i could not endureno not even the touch of himbenjamin with the loud laugh and the braggart voice who laughed at me because i was a girl and could not fight the time came when he did not laugh at me because i was a girl and oh to thinkonly to thinkof the time that came after that chapter iv sir christopher at the mere remembrance of sir christopher i am fain to lay down my pen and to weep as for one whose goodness was unsurpassed and whose end was undeserved good works i know are rags and men cannot deserve the mercy of god by any merits of their own but a good mana man whose heart is full of justice mercy virtue and truthis so rare a creature that when there is found such a one his salvation seems assured is it not wonderful that there are among us so many good christians but so few good men i am indeed in private duty bound to acknowledge sir christophers goodness to me and to mine he was as i have said the mainstay of our household had we depended wholly on my mothers work we should sometimes have fared miserably indeed nay he did more though a justice of the peace he invited my father every sunday evening to the manor house for spiritual conversation not only for his own profit but knowing that to expound was to my father the breath of his nostrils so that if he could not expound he must die in person sir christopher was tall after the fashion which i love of the days when he was a young man he wore his own hair which being now white and long became his venerable face much better than any wigwhite black or brown he was generally dressed as became his station of simple country gentleman in a plush coat with silver buttons and for the most part he wore boots being of an active habit and always walking about his fields or in his gardens among his flowers and his fruittrees he was so good a sportsman that with his rod his gun and his hawk he provided his table with everything except beef mutton and pork in religion he inclined to independency being above all things an upholder of private judgment in politics he denied the divine right and openly said that a challis might be a king as well as a stuart he abhorred the pope and all his works and though he was now for a monarchy he would have the kings own power limited by the parliament in his manners he was grave and dignified not austere but one who loved a cheerful companion he rode once a week on market day to sherborne where he dined with his brother justices hearing and discussing the news though news comes but slowly from london to these partsit was fourteen days after the landing of the king in the year that the bells of sherborne minster rang for that event sometimes a copy of the london gazette came down by the exeter coach or some of the company had lately passed a night where the coach stopped and conversed with travellers from london and heard the news for the rest of the week his honour was at home for the most part he sat in the hall in the middle stands the great oak table where all the household sit at meals together there was little difference between the dishes served above and those below the salt save that those above had each a glass of strong ale or of wine after dinner and supper one side of the hall was hung with arras worked with representations of herbs beasts and birds on the other side was the great chimney where in the winter a noble fire was kept up all day long on either side of it hung fox skins otter skins polecat skins with fishingrods stags heads horns and other trophies of the chase at the end was a screen covered with old coats of mail helmets bucklers lances pikes pistols guns with matchlocks and a trophy of swords arranged in form of a star below the cornice hung a row of leathern jerkins black and dusty which had formerly been worn in place of armour by the common sort in the oriel window was a sloping desk having on one side the bible and on the other foxes book of martyrs below was a shelf with other books such as vincent wings almanack king charless golden rules glanville on apparitions the complete justice and the book of farriery there was also in the hall a great sideboard covered with turkey work pewter brass and fine linen in the cupboard below was his honours plate reported to be worth a great deal of money sir christopher sat in a high chair curiously carved with arms and a triangular seat it had belonged to the family for many generations within reach of the chair was the tobaccojar his pipe and his favourite booknamely the gentlemans academie or the book of st albans being a work on hunting hawking and armorie by dame juliana berners who wrote it two hundred and fifty years ago sir christopher loved especially to read aloud that chapter in which it is proved that the distinction between gentleman and churl began soon after the creation when cain proved himself a churl and seth was created gentleman and esquire or armiger by adam his father this distinction was renewed after the flood by noah himself a gentleman by lineal descent from seth in the case of his sons ham was the churl and the other two were the gentlemen i have sometimes thought that according to this author all of us who are descended from shem or japhet should be gentlemen in which case there would be no churl in great britain at all but certainly there are many so that to my poor thinking dame juliana berners must be wrong there is in addition to the great hall the best parlour but as this was never wanted the door of it was never opened except at cleaning time then to be sure one saw a room furnished very grand with chairs in turkey work and hung round with family portraits the men were clad in armour as if they had all been soldiers or commanders the women were mostly dressed as shepherdesses with crooks in their hands and flowing robes in the garden was a long bowling green where in summer sir christopher took great pleasure in that ancient game below the garden was a broad fishpond made by damming the stream above and below the pond there were trout and in the pond were carp and jack a part of the garden was laid out for flowers a part for the stillroom and a part for fruit i have never seen anywhere a better ordered garden for the stillroom everything grew therein that the housewife wants sweet cicely rosemary burnet sweet basil chives dill clary angelica lipwort tarragon thyme and mint there were as lord bacon in his essay on gardens would have whole alleys of them to have the pleasure when you walk or tread there were thick hedges to keep off the east wind in spring so that one would enjoy the sun when that cold wind was blowing but in somerset that wind hath not the bitterness that it possesses along the eastern shores of the land every morning sir christopher sat in his justices chair under the helmets and the coats of armour sometimes gipsies would be brought before him charged with stealing poultry or poisoning pigs or a rogue and vagabond would stray into the parish these gentry were very speedily whipped out of it as for our own people there is nowhere a more quiet and orderly village quarrels there are with the clothiers men who will still try to beat down the value of the womens work and bickerings sometimes between the women themselves sir christopher was judge for all truly he was a patriarch like unto abraham and a father to his people never was sick man suffered to want for medicines and succour never was aged man suffered to lack food and fire did any youth show leanings towards sloth profligacy or drunkenness he was straightway admonished and that right soundly so that his back and shoulders would remind him for many days of his sin by evildoers sir christopher was feared as much as he was beloved by all good men and true this also is proper to one in high station and authority in the evening he amused himself in playing backgammon with the boys or chess with his soninlaw mr boscorel but the latter with less pleasure because he was generally defeated in the game he greatly delighted in the conversation and society of that learned and ingenious gentleman though on matters of religion and of politics his soninlaw belonged to the opposite way of thinking i do not know why mr boscorel took upon himself holy orders god forbid that i should speak ill of any in authority and especially of one who was kind and charitable to all and refused to become a persecutor of those who desired freedom of conscience and of speech but if the chief duty of a minister of the gospel is to preach then was mr boscorel little better than a dog who cannot bark he did not preach that is to say he could not like my father mount the pulpit bible in hand and teach admonish argue and convince without a written word he read every sunday morning a brief discourse which might perhaps have instructed oxford scholars but would not be understood by the common people as for arguments on religion spiritual conversation or personal experience of grace he would never suffer such talk in his presence because it argued private judgment and caused he said the growth of spiritual pride and of those hot gospellers whose zeal brings them to prison and the pillory he spoke with contempt his conversation i must acknowledge was full of delight and instruction if the things which one learned of him were not vanities he had travelled in italy and in france and he loved to talk of poetry architecture statuary medals and coins antiquities and so forththings harmless and perhaps laudable in themselves but for a preacher of the gospel who ought to think of nothing but his sacred calling they are surely superfluities or he would talk of the manners and customs of strange countries and especially of the pope this person whom i have been taught to look upon as from the very nature of his pretensions the most wicked of living men mr boscorel regarded with as much toleration as he bestowed upon an independent then he would tell us of london and the manners of the great of the king whom he had seen and the court seeming to wink at things which one ought to hold in abhorrence he even told us of the playhouse which according to my father is the most subtle engine ever invented by the devil for the destruction of souls yet mr boscorel sighed to think that he could no longer visit that place of amusement he loved also music and played movingly upon the violoncello and he could make pictures with pen pencil or brush i have some of his paintings still especially a picture which he drew of humphrey playing the fiddle his great eyes looking upwards as if the music was drawing his soul to heaven i know not why he painted a halo about his face mr boscorel also loved poetry and quoted shakspeare and ben jonson more readily than the word of god in person he was of a goodly countenance having clearcut features a straight nose rather long soft eyes and a gentle voice he was dainty in his apparel loving fine clean linen and laced neckerchiefs but was not a gross feeder he drank but little wine but would discourse upon fine wines such as the tokay of hungary commandery wine from cyprus and the like and he seemed better pleased to watch the colour of the wine in the glass and to breathe its perfume than to drink it above all things he hated coarse speech and rude manners he spoke of men as if he stood on an eminence watching them and always with pity as if he belonged to a nobler creation how could such a man have such a son chapter v the runaway everybody hath heard and old people still remember how one act after the other was passed for the suppression of the nonconformists whom the church of england tried to extirpate but could not had these laws been truly carried into effect there would have been great suffering among the dissenters but in order to enforce them every mans hand would have been turned against his neighbour and thisthank godis not possible in somerset for example the act of uniformity provided not only for the ejectment of the nonconforming ministers which was duly carried out but also enacted that none of them should take scholars without the license of the bishop yet many of the ejected ministers maintained themselves in this way openly without the bishops license they were not molested though they might be threatened by some hot episcopalian nor were the bishops anxious to set the country afire by attempting to enforce this law one must not take from an honest neighbour whatever an unjust law may command his only way of living again the act passed two years later punished all persons with fine and imprisonment who attended conventicles yet the conventicles continued to be held over the whole country because it was impossible for the justices to fine and imprison men with whom they sat at dinner every marketday with whom they took their punch and tobacco and whom they knew to be honest and godfearing folk again how could they fine and imprison their own flesh and blood why in every family there were some who loved the meetinghouse better than the steeplehouse laws have little power when they are against the conscience of the people thirdly there was an act prohibiting ministers from residing within five miles of the village or town where they had preached this was a most cruel and barbarous act because it sent the poor ministers away from the help of their friends yet how was it regarded my father for his part continued to live at bradford orcas without let or hindrance and so no doubt did many more again another act was passed giving authority to justices of the peace to break open doors and to take in custody persons found assembling for worship i have heard of disturbances at taunton where the magistrates carried things with a high hand but i think the people who met to worship after their own fashion were little disturbed among the churchmen were some no doubt who remembered the snubs and rubs they had themselves experienced and the memory may have made them revengeful all the persecution it is certain was not on the side of the church there was for instance the case of dr walter raleigh dean of wells who was clapped into a noisome prison where the plague had broken out he did not die of that disease but was done to death in the jail barbarously by one david barrett shoemaker who was never punished for the murder but was afterwards made constable of the city there was also the case of the rev dr piers whom i have myself seen for he lived to a good old age he was a prebendary of wells and being driven forth was compelled to turn farmer and to work with his own handsdigging hoeing ploughing reaping and threshingwhen he should have been in his study every week this reverend and learned doctor of divinity was to be seen at ilminster market standing beside the pillars with his cart among the farmers and their wives selling his apples cheese and cabbages i say that no doubt many remembered these things yet the affection of the people went forth to the nonconformists and the ejected ministers as was afterwards but too well proved i have been speaking of things which happened before my recollection it was in the year four years after the ejection that i was born my father would have named me grace abounding but my mother called me alice after her own name i was thus six years younger than my brother barnaby and two years younger than robin and humphrey the first thing that i can recollect is a kind of picture preserved so to speak in my head at the open door is a woman spinning at the wheel she is a woman with a pale grave face she works diligently and for the most part in silence if she speaks it is to encourage or to admonish a little girl who plays in the garden outside her lips move as she works because she communes with her thoughts all day long from time to time she turns her head and looks with anxiety into the other room where sits her husband at his table before him stand three boys they are barnaby robin and humphrey they are learning latin the room is piled with books on shelves and books on the floor in the corner is a pallet which is the masters bed by night i hear the voices of the boys who repeat their lessons and the admonishing of their master i can see through the open door the boys themselves one a stout and broad lad is my brother barnaby he hangs his head and forgets his lesson and causes his father to punish him every day he receives admonition with patience yet profiteth nothing the next is humphrey he is already a lad of grave and modest carriage who loves his book and learns diligently the third is robin whose parts are good were his application equal to his intelligence he is impatient and longs for the time when he may close his book and go to play again poor barnaby at the sight of a latin grammar he would feel sick he would willingly have taken a flogging every dayto be sure that generally happened to himin order to escape his lessons and be off to the fields and woods it was the sight of his rueful faceyet never sad except at lessonswhich made my mother sigh when she saw him dull but patient over his book had he stayed at home i know not what could have been done with him seeing that to become a preacher of the gospel was beyond even the power of prayer the lord having clearly expressed his will in this matter he would have had to clap on a leathern apron and become a wheelwright or blacksmith nothing better than an honest trade was possible for him but whether happily or not a strange whim seized the boy when he was fourteen years of age he would go to sea how he came to think of the sea i know not he had never seen the sea there were no sailors in the village there was no talk of the sea perhaps humphrey who read many books told him of the great doings of our sailors on the spanish main and elsewhere perhaps some of the clothiers men who are a roving and unsettled crew had been sailorssome i know had been soldiers under oliver however this matters not barnaby must needs become a sailor when first he broke this resolution which he did secretly to my mother she began to weep and lament because everybody knows how dreadful is the life of a sailor and how full of dangers she begged him to put the thought out of his head and to apply himself again to his books mother he said it is no use what comes in at one ear goes out at the other nothing sticks i shall never be a scholar then my son learn an honest trade what become the village cobbleror the blacksmith go hat in hand to his honour when my father should have been a bishop and my mother is a gentlewoman that will i not i will go and be a sailor all sailors are gentlemen i shall rise and become first mate and then second captain and lastly captain in command who knows i may go and fight the spaniard if i am lucky oh my son canst thou not stay at home and go to church and consider the condition of thine immortal soul of sailors it is well known that their language is made up of profane oaths and that they are all profligates and drunkards consider my sonmy mother laid her hand upon his armwhat were heaven to me if i have not my dear children with me as well as my husband how could i praise the lord if i were thinking of my son who was not with me butah heaven forbid the thought barnaby made no reply what could he say in answer to my mothers tears yet i think she must have understood very well that her son having got this resolution into his head would never give it up oh she said when thou wast a little baby in my arms barnabywho art now so big and strongshe looked at him with the wonder and admiration that women feel when their sons grow big and stouti prayed that god would accept thee as an offering for his service thou art vowed unto the lord my son as much as samuel do you think he complained of his lessons what would have happened think you to samuel if he had taken off his ephod and declared that he would serve no longer at the altar but must take spear and shield and go to fight the amalekite said barnaby in reply speaking from an unregenerate heart mother had i been samuel to wear an ephod and to learn the latin syntax every day i should have done that ay i would have done it even if i knew that at the first skirmish an arrow would pierce my heart it was after a great flogging on account of the passive voice or some wrestling with the syntax that barnaby plucked up courage to tell his father what he wished to do with my consent said my father sternly thou shalt never become a sailor as soon would i send thee to become a buffoon in a playhouse never dare to speak of it again barnaby hung his head and said nothing then my mother who knew his obstinate disposition took him to sir christopher who chid him roundly telling him that there was work for him on land else he would have been born beside the coast where the lads take naturally to the sea that being as he was only an ignorant boy and landborn he could not know the dangers which he would encounter that some ships are cast away on desert islands where the survivors remain in misery until they die and some on lands where savages devour them and some are dragged down by calamaries and other dreadful monsters and some are burned at sea their crews having to choose miserably between burning and drowning and some are taken by the enemy and the sailors clapped into dungeons and tortured by the accursed inquisition illustration he was seized with a mighty wrath and catching his son sharply by the ear led him out of the throng many more things did sir christopher set forth showing the miserable life and the wretched end of the sailor but barnaby never changed countenance and though my mother bade him note this and mark that and take heed unto his honours words his face showed no melting twas always an obstinate lad nay it was his obstinacy alone which kept him from his learning otherwise he might perhaps have become as great a scholar as humphrey sir he said when sir christopher had no other word to say with submission i would still choose to be a sailor if i could in the end he obtained his wish that is to say since no one would help him towards it he helped himself and this i think is the only way in which men do ever get what they want it happened one evening that there passed through the village a man with a pipe and tabor on which he played so movingly that all the people turned out to listen for my own part i was with my mother yet i ran to the gardengate and leaned my head over drawn by the sound of the music presently the boys and girls began to take hands together and to dance i dare not say that to dance is sinful because david danced but it was so regarded by my father so that when he passed by them on his way home from taking the air and actually saw his own son barnaby in the middle of the dancers footing it merrily with them all joyfully leading one girl up and the other down at john come and kiss me now he was seized with a mighty wrath and catching his son sharply by the ear led him out of the throng and so home for that evening barnaby went supperless to bed with the promise of such a flogging in the morning as would cause him to remember for the rest of his life the sinfulness of dancing never had i seen my father so angry i trembled before his wrathful eyes but barnaby faced him with steady looks making answer none yet not showing the least repentance or fear i thought it was because a flogging had no terrors for him the event proved that i was wrong that was not the reason he had resolved to run away and when we awoke in the morning he was gone he had crept downstairs in the night he had taken half a loaf of bread and a great cantle of soft cheese and had gone away he had not gone for fear of the rod he had run away with design to go to sea perhaps he had gone to bristol perhaps to plymouth perhaps to lyme my mother wept and my father sighed and for ten years more we neither saw nor heard anything of barnaby not even whether he was dead or living chapter vi benjamin lord chancellor summer follows winter and winter summer in due course turning children into young men and maidens changing school into work and play into love and love into marriage and so onwards to the churchyard where we all presently lie hopeful of heavens mercy whether mr boscorel did stand beside our open grave in his white surplice or my father in his black gown barnaby was gone the other three grew tall and would still be talking of the lives before them girls do never look forward to the future with the eagerness and joy of boys to the dullest boy it seems a fine thing to be master of his own actions even if that liberty lead to whippingpost pillory or gallows to boys of ambition and imagination the gifts of fortune show like the splendid visions of a prophet they think that earthly fame will satisfy the soul perhaps women see these glories and their true worth with clearer eye as not desiring them and truly it seems a small thing after a life spent in arduous toil and with one foot already in the grave to obtain fortune rank or title benjamin and humphrey were lads of ambition to both but in fields which lay far apart the best life seemed to be that which is spent among men on the anthill where all are driving or being driven loading each other with burdens intolerable or with wealth or with honours and then dying and being forgotten in a momentwhich we call london in the kindly country one stands apart and sees the vanity of human wishes teat the ambition of humphrey it must be confessed was noble because it was not for his own advancement but for the good of mankind i shall stay at home said robin you two may go if you please perhaps you will like the noise of london where a man cannot hear himself speak they say for the roaring of the crowd the ringing of the bells and the rumbling of the carts as for me what is good enough for my grandfather will be surely good enough for me it should indeed be good enough for anybody to spend his days after the manner of sir christopher administering justice for the villagers with the weekly ordinary at sherborne for company the green fields and his garden for pleasure and for exercise and the welfare of his soul for prayer robin besides loved to go forth with hawk and gun to snare the wild creatures to hunt the otter and the fox to bait the badger and trap the stoat and weasel to course the hares but cities and crowds even if they should be shouting in his honour did never draw him even after he had seen them nor was he ever tempted to believe any manner of life more full of delight and more consistent with the end of mans creation than the rural life the air of the fields the following of the plough for the men and the spinningwheel for the women i shall be a lawyer said benjamin puffing out his cheeks and squaring his shoulders very well then i say i shall be a great lawyer what none of your pettifogging tribe for me i shall step to the front and stay there what someone must have the prizes and the promotion there are always places falling vacant and honours to be given away they shall be given to me why not to me as well as another well said robin you are strong enough to take them willynilly i am strong enough he replied with conviction first i shall be called to the outer bar where i shall plead in stuffi saw them at exeter last sizes next i shall be summoned to become kings counsel when i shall flaunt it in silk who but i then he seemed to grow actually three inches taller so great is the power of imagination he was already six feet in height his shoulders broad and his face red and fiery so that now he looked very big and tall then my inn will make me a bencher and i shall sit at the high table in termtime and the attorneys shall run after me and fight with each other for my services in court so that in every great case i shall be heard thundering before the jury and making the witnesses perjure themselves with terrorfor which they will be afterwards flogged i shall belong to the kings partynone of your canting whigs for me when the high treason cases come on i shall be the counsel for the crown that is the high road to advancement this is very well so far said robin laughing ben is too modest however he does not get on fast enough all in good time ben replied i mean to get on as fast as anybody but i shall follow the beaten road first favour with attorneys and those who have suits in the courts then the ear of the judge i know not how one gets the ear of the judgehe looked despondent for a moment then he held up his head againbut i shall find out others have found outwhy not i what i am no fool am i certainly not ben but as yet we stick at kings counsel after the ear of the judge the favour of the crown what do i care who is king it is the king who hath preferment and place and honours in his gift where these are given away there shall i be found next am i made serjeantatlaw then i am saluted as brother by the judges on the bench while all the others burst with envy after that i shall myself be called to the bench i am already my lordwhy do you laugh robinand a knight sir benjamin boscorelsir benjamin here he puffed out his cheeks again and swung his shoulders like a very great person indeed proceed sir benjamin said humphrey gravely while robin laughed when i am a judge i promise you i will rate the barristers and storm at the witnesses and admonish the jury until there shall be no other question in their minds but to find out first what is my will in the case and then to govern themselves accordingly i will be myself judge and jury and all oh i have seen the judge at last exeter sizes he made all to shake in their shoes i shall not stop there chief baron i shall be perhapsbut on that point i have not yet made up my mindand then lord chancellor he paused to take breath and looked around him grandeur and authority upon his brow lord chancellor he repeated on the woolsack you will then said robin be raised to the peeragefirst lord boscorel or perhaps if your lordship will so honour this poor village lord bradford orcas earl of sherborne i have chosen for title said benjamin and while i am climbing up the ladder where wilt thou be humphrey grovelling in the mud with the poor devils who cannot rise nay i shall have a small ladder of my own ben i find great comfort in the thought that when your lordship is roaring and bawling with the goutyour noble toe being like a ball of fire and your illustrious foot swathed in flanneli shall be called upon to drive away the pain and you will honour me with the title not only of humble cousin but also of rescuer and preserver will it not be honour enough to cure the right honourable the earl of sherborne first of the name the lord chancellor of his gout and to restore him to the duties of his great office so that once more he shall be the dread of evildoers and of all who have to appear before him as yet my lord your extremities i perceive are free from that diseasethe result too often of that excess in wine which besets the great here robin laughed again and so did benjamin nobody could use finer language than humphrey if he pleased a fine ambition said ben to wear a black velvet coat and a great wig to carry a goldheaded cane all day long to listen while the patient tells of his gripes and pains to mix boluses and to compound nauseous draughts well humphrey laughed if you are lord chancellor ben you will i hope give us good laws and so make the nation happy and prosperous while you are doing this i will be keeping you in health for the good of the country i say that this is a fine ambition and robin here will sit in the great chair and have the rogues haled before him and order the headborough to bring out his catoninetails in the winter evenings he will play backgammon and in the summer bowls then a posset and to bed and never any change from year to year a fine life truly truly i think it is a very fine life said robin while you make the laws i will take care that they are obeyed what better service is there than to cause good laws to be obeyed make good laws my lord chancellor and be thankful that you will have faithful lawabiding men to carry them out thus they talked presently the time came when the lads must leave the village and go forth to prepare for such course as should be allotted to them whether it led to greatness or to obscurity benjamin went first being sixteen years of age and a great fellow as i have said broadshouldered and lusty with a red face a strong voice and a loud laugh in no respect did he resemble his father who was delicate in manner and in speech he was to be entered at grays inn where under some counsel learned in the law he was to read until such time as he should be called he came to bid me farewell which at first until he frightened me with the things he said i took kindly of him child he said i am going to london and i suppose i shall not come back to this village for a long time nay were it not for thee i should not wish to come back at all why for me ben becausehere his red face became redder and he stammered a little but not much for he was ever a lad of confidencebecause child thou art not yet turned twelve which is young to be hearing of such a thing yet a body may as well make things safe and as for humphrey or robin interfering i will break their heads with my cudgel if they do remember that then he shook his finger at me threatening in what business should they interfere i asked kiss me alicehere he tried to lay his arm round my neck but i ran away oh if thou art skittish i care not all in good time very well then let us make things safe alice when i come back thou wilt be seventeen or eighteen which is an age when girls should marry i have nothing to do with marrying ben not yet if i mistake not child thou wilt then be as beautiful as a rose in june i want no foolish talk ben let me go then i shall be twentyone years of age practising in the courts i shall go the western circuit in order to see thee oftenpartly to keep an eye upon thee and partly to warn off other men because child it is my purpose to marry thee myself think upon that now at this i laughed laugh if you please my dear i shall marry thee as soon as the way is open to the bench and the woolsack what i can see a long way ahead i will tell thee what i see there is a monstrous great crowd of people in the street staring at a glass coach who is the lovely lady they ask the lovely ladythat is you alice none otherwith the diamonds at her neck and the gold chain in the glass coach says one who knows her liveries tis the lady of the great lord chancellor the earl of sherborne and the women fall green with envy of her happiness and great good fortune and her splendour courage child i go to prepare the way oh thou knowest not the grand things that i shall pour into thy lap when i am a judge this was the first time that any man spoke to me of love but benjamin was always masterful and had no respect for such a nice point as the wooing of a maidenwhich methinks should be gentle and respectful not as if a woman was like a savage to be tempted by a string of beads or so foolish as to desire with her husband such gauds as diamonds or gold chains or a glass coach nor doth a woman like to be treated as if she was to be carried off by force like the sabine women of old the rector rode to london with his son it is a long journey over rough ways but it pleased him once more to see that great city where there are pictures and statues and books to gladden the hearts of such as love these things and on the way home he sojourned for a few days at his old college of all souls where were still left one or two of his old friends then he rode back to his village there are but two places in this country he said or perhaps three at most where a gentleman and a scholar or one who loveth the fine arts would choose to live these are london and oxford and perhaps the sister university upon the granta well i have once more been privileged to witness the humours of the court and the town i have once more been permitted to sniff the air of a great library let us be thankful he showed his thankfulness with a sigh which was almost a groan it was three years before we saw benjamin again then he returned but not for long like his father he loved london better than the country but for other reasons certainly he cared nothing for those arts which so much delighted the rector and the air of a coffeehouse pleased him more than the perfume of books in a library when he left us he was a rustic when he came back he was already what they call a fopling that is to say when he went to pay his respects to sir christopher his grandfather he wore a very fine cravat of flanders lace with silken hose and lace and ribbons at his wrist he was also scented with bergamot and wore a peruke which while he talked he combed and curled to keep the curls of this monstrous headdress in place gentlemen must i suppose wear this invention and one of the learned professions must show the extent of the learning by the splendours of his fullbottomed wig yet i think that a young man looks most comely while he wears his own hair he had cocked his hat on which were bows of riband and he wore a sword he spoke also in a mincing london manner having now forsworn the honest broad speech of somerset and but not in the presence of his elders he used strange oaths and ejaculations behold him said his father by no means displeased at his sons foppery because he ever loved the city fashions and thought that a young man did well to dress and to comport himself after the way of the world behold him thus he sits in the coffeehouse thus he shows himself in the pit youth is the time for finery and for folly alas would that we could bring back that time what saith john drydenglorious johnof sir fopling his various modes from various fathers follow one taught the toss and one the new french wallow his swordknot this his cravat that designed and this the yardlong snake he twirls behind from one the sacred periwig he gained which wind neer blew nor touch of hat profaned well ben said sir christopher if the mode can help thee to the bench why not follow the mode it will not hinder sir ben replied a man who hath his fortune to make does well to be seen everywhere and to be dressed like other men of his time one must do benjamin the justice to acknowledge that though like the young gentlemen his friends and companions his dress was foppish and his talk was of the pleasures of the town he suffered nothing to stand in the way of his advancement he was resolved upon being a great lawyer and therefore if he spent the evening in drinking singing and making merry he was reading in chambers or else attending the courts all the day and neglected nothing that would make him master of his profession and though of learning he had little his natural parts were so good and his resolution was so strong that i doubt not he would have achieved his ambition had it not been for the circumstances which afterwards cut short his career his course of life by his own boastful confession was profligate his friends were drinkers and revellers his favourite haunt was the tavern where they all drank punch and sang ungodly songs and smoked tobacco and of religion he seemed to have no care whatever i was afraid that he would return to the nauseous subject which he had opened three years before therefore i continued with my mother and would give him no chance to speak with me but he found me and caught me returning home one evening alice he said i feared that i might have to go away without a word alone with thee i want no words alone benjamin let me pass for he stood before me in the way not so fast prettyhe caught me by the wrist and being a young man so strong and determined he held me as by a vice not so fast mistress alice first my dear let me tell thee that my purpose still holdsnayhere he swore a most dreadful impious oathi am more resolved than ever there is not a woman even in london that is to be compared with thee child what compared with thee why they are like the twinkling stars compared with the glorious queen of night what did i saythat at nineteen thou wouldst be a miracle of beauty nay that time hath come already i love thee child i love thee i say ten times as much as ever i loved thee before he gasped and then breathed hard but still he held me fast idle compliments cost a man nothing benjamin say what you meant to say and let me go if you hold me any longer i will cry out and bring your father to learn the reason well he said i will not keep thee i have said what i wanted to say my time hath not yet arrived i am shortly to be called and shall then begin to practise when i come back here again twill be with a ring in one hand and in the other the prospect of the woolsack think upon that while i am gone your ladyship is finer than plain madam and the court is more delightful than a village green among the pigs and ducks think upon it well thou art a lucky girl a plain village girl to be promoted to a coronet however i have no fears for thee thou wilt adorn the highest fortune thou wilt be worthy of the great place whither i shall lead thee what is sir george jeffreys a better man than i is he of better family had he better interest is he a bolder man not so yet was sir george a common serjeant at twentythree and recorder at thirty chief justice of chester at thirtytwo what he hath done i can do moreover sir george hath done me the honour to admit me to his company and will advance me this he hath promised both in his cups and when he is sober think it over child a ring in one hand and a title in the other so benjamin went away again i was afraid when i thought of him and his promise because i knew him of old and his eyes were as full of determination as when he would fight a lad of his own age and go on fighting till the other had had enough yet he could not marry me against my will his own father would protect me to say nothing of mine i should have told him thenas i had told him beforethat i would never marry him then perhaps he would have been shaken in his purpose the very thought of marrying him filled me with terror unspeakable i was afraid of him not only because he was so masterfulnay women like a man to be strong of willbut because he had no religion in him and lived like an atheist if such a wretch there be at all events with unconcern about his soul and because his life was profligate his tastes were gross and he was a drinker of much wine even at the manor house i had seen him at supper drinking until his cheeks were puffed out and his voice grew thick what kind of happiness would there be for a wife whose husband has to be carried home by his varlets too heavy with drink to stand or to speak alas there is one thing which girls happily do never apprehend they cannot understand how it is possible for a man to become so possessed with the idea of their charms which they hold themselves as of small account knowing how fleeting they are and of what small value that he will go through fire and water for that woman yea and break all the commandments heedless of his immortal soul rather than suffer another man to take herand that even though he knows that the poor creature loves him not or loves another man if maidens knew this i think that they would go in fear and trembling lest they should be coveted by some wild beast in human shape and prove the death of the gallant gentleman whom they would choose for their lover or they would make for themselves convents and hide in them so great would be their fear but it is idle to speak of this because say what one will girls can never understand the power and the vehemence of love when once it hath seized and doth thoroughly possess a man chapter vii medicinae doctor humphrey did not like benjamin brag of the things he would do when he should go forth to the world nevertheless he thought much about his future and frequently he discoursed with me about the life that he fain would lead a young man i think wants someone with whom he may speak freely concerning the thoughts which fill his soul we who belong to the sex which receives but does not create or invent which profits by mans good work and suffers from the evil which he too often does have no such thoughts and ambitions i cannot he would say take upon me holy orders as mr boscorel would have me promising in my cousin robins name this living after his death because though i am in truth a mere pauper and dependent there are in me none of those prickings of the spirit which i could interpret into a divine call for the ministry next because i cannot in conscience swear to obey the thirtynine articles while i still hold that the nonconformist way of worship is more consonant with the word of god and again i am of opinion that the law of moses which forbade any but a wellformed man from serving at the altar hath in it something eternal it denotes that as no cripple may serve at the earthly altar so in heaven of which the altar is an emblem all those who dwell therein shall be perfect in body as in soul what then is such a one as myself who hath some learning and no fortune to do sir christopher my benefactor will maintain me at oxford until i have taken a degree this is more than i could have expected therefore i am resolved to take a degree in medicine it is the only profession fit for a misshapen creature they will not laugh at me when i alleviate their pains could anyone laugh at you humphrey pray heaven i frighten not the ladies at the first aspect of me he laughed but not with merriment for indeed a cripple or a hunchback cannot laugh mirthfully over his own misfortune some men speak scornfully of the profession he went on the great french playwright monsieur moliere doth make the physicians the butt and laughingstock of all paris yet consider it is medicine which prolongs our days and relieves our pains before the science was studied the wretch who caught a fever in the marshy forest lay down and died an ague lasted all ones life a sore throat putrefied and killed a rheumatism threw a man upon the bed from which he would never rise the physician is mans chief friend if our sovereigns studied the welfare of humanity as deeply as the art of war they would maintain at vast expense great colleges of learned men continually engaged in discovering the secrets of naturethe causes and the remedies of disease what better use can a man make of his life than to discover oneonly onesecret which will drive away part of the agony of disease the jews more merciful than the romans stupefied their criminals after they were crucified they died indeed but their sufferings were less so the physician though in the end all men must die may help them to die without pain nay i have even thought that we might devise means of causing the patient by some potent drug to fall into so deep a sleep that even the surgeons knife shall not cause him to awaken he therefore before he entered at oxford read with my father many learned books of the ancients on the science and practice of medicine and studied botany with the help of such books as he could procure some men have but one side to themthat is to say the only active part of them is engaged in but one study the rest is given up to rest or indolence thus benjamin studied law diligently but nothing else humphrey for his part read his galen and his celsus but he neglected not the cultivation of those arts and accomplishments in which mr boscorel was as ready a teacher as he was a ready scholar he thus learned the history of painting and sculpture and architecture and that of coins and medals so that at eighteen humphrey might already have set up as a virtuoso nor was this all still by the help of the rector he learned the use of the pencil and the brush and could both draw prettily or paint in water colours whether the cottages or the church the cows in the fields or the woods and hills i have many pictures of his painting which he gave me from time to time and he could play sweetly whether on the spinnet or the violin or the guitar spending many hours every week with mr boscorel playing duettos together and willingly he would sing having a rich and full voice very delightful to hear when i grew a great girl and had advanced far enough i was permitted to play with them there was no end to the music which mr boscorel possessed first he had a great store of english ditties such as country people loveas sing all a green willow gather ye rosebuds while ye may or once i loved a maiden fair there was nothing rough or rude in these songs though i am informed that much wickedness is taught by the ribald songs that are sung in playhouses and coffeerooms and when we were not playing or singing mr boscorel would read us poetryportions from shakspeare or ben jonson or out of miltons paradise lost or from herrick who is surely the sweetest poet that ever lived yet marred said mr boscorel by his coarseness and corruption now one day after we had been thus readingone winter afternoon when the sun lay upon the meadowshumphrey walked home with me and on the way confessed with many blushes that he too had been writing verses and with that he lugged a paper out of his pocket they are for thine own eyes only he said truly my dear thou hast the finest eyes in the world they are for no other eyes than thine he repeated not for robin mind lest he laugh poetry hath in it something sacred so that even the writer of bad verses cannot bear to have them laughed at when thou art a year or two older thou wilt understand that they were written for thy heart as well as for thine eyes yet if thou like the verses they may be seen by mr boscorel but in private and if he laugh at them do not tell me yet again one would like to know what he said wherefore tell me though his words be like a knife in my side thus he wavered between wishing to show them to his master in art and fearing in the end when i showed them to mr boscorel he said that for a beginner they were very wellvery well indeed that the rhymes were correct and the metre true that years and practice would give greater firmness and that the crafty interlacing of thought and passion which was the characteristic of italian verse could only be learned by much reading of the italian poets more he said speaking upon the slight subject of rhyme and poetry with as much seriousness and earnestness as if he were weighing and comparing texts of scripture then he gave me back the verses with a sigh child he said to none of us is given what most we desire for my part i longed in his infancy that my son should grow up even as humphrey as quick to learn with as true a taste with as correct an ear with a hand as skilful butyou see i complain not though benjamin loves the noisy tavern better than the quiet coffeehouse where the wits resort to him such things as verses art and music are foolishness i say that i complain not but i would to heaven that humphrey were my own and that his shoulders were straight poor lad thy father hath made him a puritan he is such as john milton in his youthand as beautiful in face as that stout republican i doubt not that we shall have from the hand of humphrey if he live and prosper something fine the nature of which whether it is to be in painting or in music or in poetry i know not take the verses and take care that thou lose them not and childrememberthe poet is allowed to say what he pleases about a womans eyes be not deceived into thinkingbut nonothere is no fear goodnight thou sweet and innocent saint i knew not then what he meant but these are the verses and i truly think that they are very moving and religious for if woman be truly the most beautiful work of the creator which all men aver then it behoves her all the more still to point upwards i read them with a pleasure and surprise that filled my whole soul and inflamed my heart with pious joy around above and everywhere the earth hath many a lovely thing the zephyrs soft the flowers fair the babbling brook the bubbling spring the grey of dawn the azure sky the sunset glow the evening gloom the warbling thrush the skylark high the blossoming hedge the gardens bloom the sun in state the moon in pride the twinkling stars in order laid the winds that ever race and ride the shadows flying oer the glade oh many a lovely thing hath earth to charm the eye and witch the soul yet one there is of passing worth for that one thing i give the whole the crowning work the last thing made creations masterpiece to be bend oer yon stream and there displayed this wondrous thing reflected see behold a face for heaven designed see how those eyes thy soul betray lovesecret lovethere sits enshrined and upwards still doth point the way when humphrey went away he did not like benjamin come blustering and declaring that he would marry me and that he would break the skull of any other man who dared make love to menot at all humphrey with tears in his eyes told me that he was sorry i could not go to oxford as well that he was going to lose the sweetest companion in the world and that he should always love me and then he kissed me on the forehead and so departed why should he not always love me i knew very well that he loved me and that i loved him although he was so young being only seventeen when he was entered at exeter college i suppose there never was a young gentleman went to the university of oxford with so many accomplishments and so much learning by my fathers testimony he read greek as if it were his mother tongue and he wrote and conversed easily in latin and you have heard what arts and accomplishments he added to this solid learning he was elected to a scholarship at his college that of exeter and after he took his degree as bachelor of medicine he was made a fellow of all souls where mr boscorel himself had also been a fellow this election was not only a great distinction for him but it gave him what a learned young man especially desiresthe means of living and of pursuing his studies while he was at oxford he wrote letters to sir christopher to mr boscorel and to my father to whom also he sent such new books and pamphlets as he thought would interest him to me he sent sometimes drawings and sometimes books but never verses now to make an end of humphrey for the present when he had obtained his fellowship he asked for and obtained leave of absence and permission to study medicine in those great schools which far surpass they say our english schools of medicine these are that of montpellier the yet more famous school of padua in italy and that of leyden whither many englishmen have resorted for study notably mr evelyn whose book called sylva was in the rectors library he carried on during the whole of this time a correspondence with mr boscorel on the paintings statues and architecture to be seen wherever his travels carried him these letters mr boscorel read aloud with a map spread before him discoursing on the history of the place and the chief things to be seen there before he began to read surely there never was a man so much taken up with the fine arts especially as they were practised by the ancients there remains the last of the boysrobin sir christophers grandson and heir i should like this book to be all about robinyet one must needs speak of the others i declare that from the beginning there never was a boy more happy more jolly never anyone more willing to be always making someone happy he loved the open air the wild creatures the trees the birds everything that lives beneath the sky yet notlike my poor brother barnabya hater of books he read all the books which told about creatures or hunting or country life and all voyages and travels a freshcoloured wholesome lad not so grave as humphrey nor so rustic as barnaby who always seemed to carry with him the scent of woods and fields he was to sir christopher what benjamin was to jacob even my father loved him though he was so poor a scholar those who stay at home have homely wits that is well known therefore robin must follow humphrey to oxford he went thither the year after his cousin i never learned that he obtained a scholarship or that he was considered one of the younger pillars of that learned and ancient university or indeed that he took a degree at all after he left oxford he must go to london there to study justices law and fit himself for the duties he would have to fulfil also his grandfather would have him acquire some knowledge of the court and the city and the ways of the great and the rich this too he did though he never learned to prefer those ways to the simple customs and habits of his somerset village he too like the other two bade me a tender farewell poor alice he said taking both my hands in his what wilt thou do when i am gone indeed since humphrey went away we had been daily companions and at the thought of being thus left alone the tears were running down my cheeks why sweetheart he said to think that i should ever make thee cryi who desire nothing but to make thee always laugh and be happy what wilt thou do go often to my mother she loves thee as if thou wert her own daughter go and talk to her concerning me it pleaseth the poor soul to be still talking of her son and forget not my grandfather play backgammon with him fill his pipe for him sing to the spinnet for him talk to him about humphrey and me and forget not mr boscorel my uncle the poor man looks as melancholy since humphrey went away as a turtle robbed of her nest i saw him yesterday opening one of his drawers full of medals and he sighed over them fit to break his heart he sighed for humphrey not for ben well child what more take lancetwas his dogfor a run every day make george sparrow keep an eye upon the stream for otters andthere are a thousand things but i will write them down have patience with the dear old man when he will be still talking about me patience robin i said why we all love to talk about thee do you all love to talk about me dost thou too alice oh my dear my dear here he took me in his arms and kissed me on the lips dost thou also love to talk about me why my dear i shall think of nothing but of thee becauseoh my deari love thee with all my heart well i was still so foolish that i understood nothing more than that we all loved him and he loved us all alice i will write letters to thee i will put them in the packet for my mother thus thou wilt understand that i am always thinking of thee he was as good as his word but the letters were so full of the things he was doing and seeing that it was quite clear that his mind had plenty of room for more than one object to be sure i should have been foolish indeed had i desired that his letters should tell me that he was always thinking about me when he should have been attending to his business after a year in london his grandfather thought that he should travel therefore he went abroad and joined humphrey at montpellier and with him rode northwards to leyden where he sojourned while his cousin attended the lectures of that famous school chapter viii a royal progress when all the boys were gone the time was quiet indeed for those who were left behind my mothers wheel went spinning still but i think that some kindness on the part of mr boscorel as well as sir christopher caused her weekly tale of yarn to be of less importance and as for me not only would she never suffer me to sit at the spinningwheel but there was so much request of me to replace the boys that i was nearly all the day either with sir christopher or with madam or with mr boscorel up to the year or thereabouts i paid no more attention to political matters than any young woman with no knowledge may be supposed to give yet of course i was on the side of liberty both civil and religious how should that be otherwise my father being such as he was muzzled for all these years the work of his life prevented and destroyed it was in that year however that i became a most zealous partisan and lover of the protestant cause in the way that i am about to relate everybody knows that there is no part of great britain not even scotland where the protestant religion hath supporters more stout and staunch than somerset and devonshire i hope i shall not be accused of disloyalty to queen anne under whom we now flourish and are happy when i say that in the west of england we had growni know not howto regard the late misguided duke of monmouth as the champion of the protestant faith when therefore the duke came into the west of england in the year five years before his rebellion he was everywhere received with acclamations and by crowds who gathered round him to witness their loyalty to the protestant faith they came also to gaze upon the gallant commander who had defeated both the french and the dutch and was said but erroneously to be as wise as he was brave and as religious as he was beautiful to look upon as for his wisdom those who knew him best have since assured the world that he had little or none his judgment being always swayed and determined for him by crafty and subtle persons seeking their own interests and as for his religion whatever may have been his profession good works were wantingas is now very well known but at that time and among our people the wicked ways of courts were only half understood and there can be no doubt that whether he was wise or religious the show of affection with which the duke was received upon this journey turned his head and caused him to think that these people would rally round him if he called upon them and i suppose that there is nothing which more delights a prince than to believe that his friends are ready even to lay down their lives in his behalf at that time the country was greatly agitated by anxiety concerning the succession those who were nearest the throne knew that king charles was secretly a papist we in the country had not learned that dismal circumstance yet we knew the religion of the duke of york thousands there were like sir christopher himself who now lamented the return of the king considering the disgraces which had fallen upon the country but what was done could not be undone they therefore asked themselves if the nation would suffer an avowed papist to ascend a protestant throne if not what should be done and here as everybody knows was opinion divided for some declared that the duke of monmouth had he his rights was the lawful heir and others maintained on the kings own words that he was never married to mistress lucy waters therefore they would have the duke of yorks daughter a protestant princess married to william of orange proclaimed queen the monmouth party were strong however and it was even saidmr henry clark minister of crewkerne wrote a pamphlet to prove itthat a poor woman elizabeth parcet by name touched the duke he being ignorant of the thing for kings evil and was straightway healed sir christopher laughed at the story saying that the king himself whether he was descended from a scottish stuart or from king solomon himself could no more cure that dreadful disease than the seventh son of a seventh son as some foolish people believe or the rubbing of the part affected by the hand of a man that had been hanged as others do foolishly believe which is the reason why on the gibbets the hanging corpses are always handless it was noised abroad beforehand that the duke was going to ride through the west country in order to visit his friends the progress it was more like a royal progress than the journey of a private nobleman began with his visit to mr thomas thynne of longleat house it is said that his chief reason for going to that house was to connect himself with the obligation of the tenant of longleat to give the king and his suite a nights lodging when they visited that part of the country mr thynne who entertained the duke on this occasion was the same who was afterwards murdered in london by count konigsmark they called him tom of ten thousand the poet dryden hath written of this progress in that poem wherein under the fabled name of absalom he figures the duke he now begins his progress to ordain with chariots horsemen and a numerous train fame runs before him as the morning star and shouts of joy salute him from afar each house receives him as a guardian god and consecrates the place of his abode it was for his hospitable treatment of the duke that mr thynne was immediately afterwards deprived of the command of the wiltshire militia soninlaw said sir christopher i would ride out to meet the duke in respect to his protestant professions as for any pretensions he may have to the succession i know nothing of them i will ride with you sir said the rector to meet the son of the king and as for any protestant professions i know nothing of them his grace still remains i believe within the pale of the church as by law established let us all ride out together seeing that my father also rode with them it is certain that there were many and diverse reasons why so many thousands gathered together to welcome the duke madam robins mother out of her kind heart invited me to accompany her and gave me a white frock to wear and blue ribbons to put into it we made with our servants a large party we were also joined by many of the tenants with their sons and wives so that when we came to ilchester sir christopher was riding at the head of a great company of sixty or more and very fine they looked all provided with blue favours in honour of the duke from bradford orcas to ilchester is but six miles as the crow flies but the ways which are narrow and foul in winter do so wind and turn about that they add two miles at least to the distance fortunately the season was summernamely augustwhen the sun is hottest and the earth is dry so that no one was bogged on the way we started betimesnamely at six in the morningbecause we knew not for certain at what time the duke would arrive at ilchester when we came forth from the manor house the farmers were already waiting for us and so after greetings from his honour they fell in and followed we first took the narrow and rough lane which leads to the high road but when we reached it we found it full of people riding like ourselves or trudging staff in hand all in the same direction they were going to gaze upon the protestant duke who if he had his way would restore freedom of conscience and abolish the acts against the nonconformists we rode through marston magna but only the old people and the little children were left there in the fields the ripe corn stood waiting to be cut in the farmyards the beasts were standing idle all the hinds were gone to ilchester to see the duke and i began to fear lest when we got to ilchester we should be too late at marston we left the main road and entered upon a road call it a track rather than a road across the country which is here flat and open in winter it is miry and boggy but it was now dry and hard this path brought us again to the main road in two miles or thereabouts and here we were but a mile or so from ilchester now such a glorious sight as awaited us here i never expected to see once again after five years i was to see a welcome still more splendid but nothing can ever efface from my memory that day for first the roads as i have said were thronged with rustics and next when we rode into the town we found it filled with gentlemen most richly dressed and ladies so beautiful and with such splendid attire that it dazzled my eyes to look upon them it was a grand thing to see the gentlemen take off their hats and cry huzza for brave sir christopher everybody knew his opinions and on what side he had fought in the civil war the old man bent his head and i think that he was pleased with this mark of honour the town which though ancient is now decayed and hath but few good houses in it was made glorious with brightcoloured cloths carpets flags and ribbons there were bands of music the bells of the church were ringing the main street was like a fair with booths and stalls and in the marketplace there were benches set up with white canvas covering where sat ladies in their fine dresses some of them with naked necks unseemly to behold yet it was pretty to see the long curls lying on their white shoulders some of them sat with halfclosed eyes which i have since learned is the fashion at court mostly they wore satin petticoats and demigowns also of satin furnished with a long train our place was beside the old cross with its gilt ball and vane the people who filled the streets came from sherborne from bruton from shepton from glastonbury from langport and from somerton and from all the villages round it was computed that there were twenty thousand of them two thousand at least rode out to meet the duke and followed after him when he rode through the town and oh the shouting as he drew near the clashing of the bells the beating of the drums the blowing of the horns the firing of the guns as if the more noise they made the greater would be the duke since that day i have not wondered at the power which a prince hath of drawing men after him even to the death never was heir to the crown received with such joy and welcome as was this young man who had no title to the crown and was base born yet because he was a brave young man and comely above all other young men gracious of speech and ready with a laugh and a joke and because he was the son of the king and the reputed champion of the protestant faith the people could not shout too loud for him the duke was at this time in the prime of manhood being thirtyfive years of age at that age mr boscorel used to say one would desire to remain if the body of clay were immortal for then the volatile humours of youth have been dissipated the time of follies has passed love is regarded with the sober eyes of experience knowledge has been acquired skill of eye and hand has been gained if one is so happy as to be a follower of art and music wisdom hath been reached if wisdom is ever to be attained but wisdom he would add is a quality generally lacking at every period of life when last i saw the duke he told us while we waited was fifteen years ago in st jamess park he was walking with the king his father who had his arm about his sons shoulders and regarded him fondly at that time he was indeed a very david for beauty i suppose that he hath not kept that singular loveliness which made him the darling of the court that indeed were not a thing to be desired or expected he is now the hero of maestricht and the chancellor of cambridge university and then all hats were pulled off and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and the men shouted and you would have thought the bells would have pulled the old tower down with the vehemence of their ringing for the duke was riding into the town he was no longer a beautiful boy but a man at whose aspect every heart was softened his enemies in his presence could not blame him his friends at sight of him could not praise him of such singular beauty was he possessed softness gentleness kindness and goodwill reigned in his large soft eyes graciousness sat upon his lips and all his face seemed to smile as he rode slowly between the lane formed by the crowd on either hand what said the poet dryden in that same poem of his from which i have already quoted early in foreign fields he won renown with kings and states allied to israels crown in peace the thoughts of war he could remove and seemed as he were only born for love whateer he did was done with so much ease in him alone twas natural to please his motions all accompanied with grace and paradise was opened in his face now i have to tell of what happened to methe most insignificant person in the whole crowd it chanced that as the duke came near the spot beside the cross where we were standing the press in front obliged him to stop he looked about him while he waited smiling still and bowing to the people presently his eyes fell upon me and he whispered a gentleman who rode beside him yet a little in the rear this gentleman laughed and dismounted what was my confusion when he advanced towards me and spoke to me madam he said calling me madam his grace would say one word to you with permission of your friends go with this gentleman child said sir christopher laughing everybody laughsi know not whywhen a girl is led out to be kissed fair white rose of somerset said his gracetwas the most musical voice in the world and the softest fair white rosehe repeated the wordslet me be assured of the welcome of ilchester by a kiss from your sweet lips which i will return in token of my gratitude all the people who heard these words shouted as if they would burst themselves asunder and the gentleman who had led me forth lifted me so that my foot rested on the dukes boot while his grace laid his arm tenderly round my waist and kissed me twice sweet child he said what is thy name by your graces leave i said the words being very strange my name is alice i am the daughter of dr comfort eykin an ejected minister i have come with sir christopher challis who stands yonder sir christopher said the duke as if surprised let me shake hands with sir christopher i take it kindly sir christopher that you have so far honoured me so he gave the old man who stepped forward bareheaded his hand still holding me by the waist i pray that we may meet again sir christopher and that before long then he drew a gold ring set with an emerald from his forefinger and placed it upon mine god grant it bring thee luck sweet child he said and kissed me again and then suffered me to be lifted down and you may be sure that it was with red cheeks that i took my place among my friends yet sir christopher was pleased at the notice taken of him by the duke and my father was not displeased at the part i had been made to play when the duke had ridden through the town many of the people followed after as far as white lackington which is close to ilminster so many were they that they took down a great piece of the park paling to admit them all and there under a spanish chestnuttree the duke drank to the health of all the people at ilminster whither he rode a few days later at chard a ford abbey at colyton and at exeterwherever he went he was received with the same shouts and acclamations it is no wonder therefore that he should believe a few years later that those people would follow him when he drew the sword for the protestant religion one thing is certainthat in the west of england from the progress of monmouth to the rebellion there was uneasiness with an anxious looking forward to troubled times the people of taunton kept as a day of holiday and thanksgiving the anniversary of the raising of charless siege when the mayor in tried to stop the celebration they nearly stoned him to death after this sir george jeffreys afterwards lord jeffreys who took the spring circuit in was called upon to report on the loyalty of the west country he reported that the gentry were loyal and well disposed but he knew not the mind of the weavers and spinners of the country illustration fair white rose of somerset let me be assured by a kiss from your sweet lips it was this progress the sight of the dukes sweet face his flattery of me and his soft words and the ring he gave me which made me from that moment such a partisan of his cause as only a woman can be women cannot fight but they can encourage those who do and they can not only ardently desire but they can despise and contemn those who think otherwise i cannot say that it was i who persuaded our boys five years later to join the duke but i can truly say that i did and said all that a woman can that i rejoiced when they did so and that i should never have forgiven robin had he joined the forces of the papist king chapter ix with the elders so we went home again all well pleased and i holding the dukes ring tight i promise you it was a most beautiful ring when i came to look at it a great emerald was in the midst of it with little pearls and emeralds set alternately around it never was such a grand gift to so humble a person i tied it to a black ribbon and put it in the box which held my clothes but sometimes i could not forbear the pleasure of wearing it round my neck secretly not for the joy of possessing the ring so much as for remembering the lovely face and the gracious words of the giver at that time i was in my sixteenth year but wellgrown for my age like my father i was above the common stature and taller than most we continued for more than four years longer to live without the company of the boys which caused me to be much in the society of my elders and as much at the manor house and the rectory as at home at the former place sir christopher loved to have me with him all day long if my mother would suffer it when he walked abroad i must walk with him when he walked in his garden i must be at his side when he awoke after his afternoon sleep he liked to see me sitting ready to talk to him i must play to him and sing to him or i must bring out the backgammon board or i must read the last letters from robin and humphrey life is dull for an old man whose friends are mostly dead unless he have the company of the young so david in his old age took to himself a young wife i have sometimes thought that he would have done better to have comforted his heart with the play and prattle of his grandchildrenof whom i suppose there must have been many families now as i was so much with his honour i had much talk with him upon things on which wise and ancient men do not often converse with girls and i was often present when he discoursed with my father or with his soninlaw the rector on high and serious matters it was a time of great anxiety and uncertainty there were great pope burnings in the country and when some were put in pillory for riot at these bonfires not a hand was lifted against them they had one at sherborne on november the anniversary of queen elizabeths coronation day instead of november guy faux day boys went about the streets asking for halfpence and singing up with the ladder and down with the rope give us a penny to burn the old pope there were riots in taunton where the high church party burned the pulpit of a meetinghouse people went about openly saying that the roundheads would soon come back again from robin we heard of the popish plot and the flight of the duke of york and afterwards of monmouths disgrace and exile at all the market towns where men gathered together they talked of these things and many whispered together a thing which sir christopher loved not because it spoke of conspiracies and secret plots whereas he was all for bold declaration of conscience in short it was an anxious time and everybody understood that serious things would happen should the king die there were not wanting besides omens of coming illsif you accept such things as omens or warnings to taunton afterwards the town most affected by the rebellion a plain warning was vouchsafed by the rumbling and thundering and shaking of the earth itself so that dishes were knocked down and cups broken and plaster shaken off the walls of houses and once this did i myself see with my own eyes the sun rose with four other suns for companionsa most terrifying sight though mr boscorel who spoke learnedly on omens had an explanation of this miracle which he said was due to natural causes alone and at ile brewers there was a monstrous birth of two girls with but one body from the breast downwards their names were aquila and priscilla but i believe they lived but a short time i needs must tell of mr boscorel because he was a man the like of whom i have never since beheld i believe there can be few men such as he was who could so readily exchange the world of heat and argument for the calm and dispassionate air of art and music even religion if i may venture to say so seemed of less importance to him than painting and sculpture i have said that he taught me to play upon the spinnet now that humphrey was gone he desired my company every day in order he pretended that i might grow perfect in my performance but in reality because he was lonely at the rectory and found pleasure in my company we played togetherhe upon the violoncello and i upon the spinnetsuch music as he chose it was sometimes grave and solemn music such as lullis miserere or his de profundis sometimes it was some part of a roman catholic mass then was my soul uplifted and wafted heavenwards by the chords which seemed prayer and praise fit for the angels to harp before the throne sometimes it was music which spoke of human passions when i would be in like manner carried out of myself my master would watch not only my execution commenting or correcting but he would also watch the effect of the music upon my mind we are ourselves he said like unto the instruments upon which we play for as one kind of instrument as the drum produces but one note and another as the cymbals but a clashing which is in itself discordant but made effective in a band so others are like the most delicate and sensitive violinsthose of cremonacapable of producing the finest music that the soul of man hath ever devised it is by such music child that some of us mount unto heaven as for me indeed i daily feel more and more that music leadeth the soul upward and that as regards the disputations on the word of god the letter indeed killeth but the spirit which music helpeth us to feelthe spirit i say giveth life he sighed and drew his bow gently across the first string of his violoncello tis a time of angry argument the word of god is thrown from one to the other as a pebble is shot from a sling it wearies me in this room among these books of music my soul finds rest and the spiritual part of me is lifted heavenwards humphrey and you my dear alone can comprehend this saying thou hast a mind like his to feel and understand what music means listen here he executed a piece of music at which the tears rose to my eyes that is from the romish mass which we are taught ignorantly to despise my child i am indeed no catholic and i hold that ours is the purer church yet in losing the mass we have lost the great music with which the catholics sustain their souls some of our anthems truly are good but what is a single anthem finished in ten minutes compared with a grand mass which lasts three hours illustration we played together he on the violoncello i upon the spinnet then he had portfolios filled with engravings which he would bring forth and contemplate with a kind of rapture discoursing upon the engravers art and its difficulties so that i should not as is the case with ignorant persons suppose that these things were produced without much training and skill he had also boxes full of coins medals and transparent gems carved most delicately with heathen gods and goddesses shepherds and swains after the ancient fashion unclothed and unashamed on these things he would gaze with admiration which he tried to teach me but could not succeed because i cannot believe that we may without blame look upon such figures nevertheless they were most beautiful the hands and faces and the very hair so delicately and exquisitely carved that you could hardly believe it possible and he talked solemnly and scholarly of these gauds as if they were things which peculiarly deserved the attention of wise and learned men nay he would be even lifted out of himself in considering them child he said we know not and we cannot even guess the wonders of art that in heaven we shall learn to accomplishas if carving and painting were the occupation of angelsor the miracles of beauty and of dexterity that we shall be able to design and execute here the hand is clumsy and the brain is dull we cannot rise above ourselves we are blind to the beauty with which the lord hath filled the earth for the solace of human creatures nay we are not even tender with the beauty that we see and love we suffer maidens sweet as the dreams of poets to waste their beauty unpraised and unsung i am old child or i would praise thee in immortal verse much i fear that thou wilt grow old without the praise of sweet numbers well there is no doubt more lasting beauty of face and figure hereafter to joy the souls of the elect and thou wilt make his happiness for one man on earth pray heaven sweet child that he look also to thine he would say such things with so grand an air speaking as if his words should command respect and with so kindly an eye and a soft smile while he gently stroked the side of his nose which was long that i was always carried away with the authority of it and not till after i left him did i begin to perceive that my father would certainly never allow that the elect should occupy themselves with the frivolous pursuits of painting and the fine arts but only with the playing of their harps and the singing of praises it was this consideration which caused him to consent that his daughter should learn the spinnet i did not tell him god forgive me for the deceit if there was any that we sometimes played music written for the mass nor did i repeat what mr boscorel said concerning art and the flinging about of the word of god because my father was wholly occupied in controversy and his principal if not his only weapon was the word of god another pleasure which we had was to follow humphrey in his travels by the aid of his letters and a mappa mundi or atlas which the rector possessed then i remember when we heard that the boys were about to ride together through france from montpellier to leyden in holland we had on the table the great map of france there were many drawings coatsofarms and other pretty things on the map it is now said mr boscorel finding out the place he wanted and keeping his forefinger upon it nearly thirty years since i made the grand tour being then governor to the young lord silchester who afterwards died of the plague in london else had i been now a bishop who am forgotten in this little place the boys will ride i take it by the same road which we took first because it is the high road and the safest next because it is the best provided with inns and resting places and lastly because it passes through the best part of his most christian majestys dominions and carries the traveller through his finest and most stately cities from montpellier they will ridefollow my finger childto nismes before the revocation it was a great place for those of the reformed religion and a populous town here they will not fail to visit the roman temple which still stands it is not indeed such a noble monument as one may see in rome but it is in good preservation and a fair example of the later style they will also visit the great amphitheatre which should be cleared of the mean houses which are now built up within it and so exposed in all its vastness to the admiration of the world after seeing these things they will direct their way across a desolate piece of country to avignon passing on the way the ancient roman aqueduct called the pont de gard at avignon they will admire the many churches and the walls and will not fail to visit the palace of the popes during the great schism thence they will ride northwards unless they wish first to see the roman remains at arles thence will they proceed up the valley of the rhone through many stately towns till they come to lyons where doubtless they will sojourn for a few days next they will journey through the rich country of burgundy and from the ancient town of dijon will reach paris through the city of fontainebleau on the way they will see many noble houses and castles with rich towns and splendid churches in no country are there more splendid churches built in the gothic style which we have now forgotten some of them alas have been defaced in the wars socalled of religion where as happened also to us the delicate carved work the scrolls and flowers and statues were destroyed and the painted windows broken alas that men should refuse to suffer art to become the minister and handmaid of religion yet in the first and most glorious temple in which the glory of the lord was visibly present there were carved and graven lilies with lions oxen chariots cherubim palmtrees and pomegranates he closed his atlas and sat down child he said meditating for a scholar in his youth there is no pleasure comparable with the pleasure of travelling in strange countries among the monuments of ancient days my own son did never to my sorrow desire the pleasant paths of learning and did never show any love for the arts in which i have always taken so great delight he desireth rather the companionship of men he loveth to drink and sing and he nourisheth a huge ambition tis best that we are not all alike humphrey should have been my son forget not my child that he hath desired to be remembered to thee in every letter which he hath written if the rector spoke much of humphrey madam made amends by talking continually of robin and of the great things that he would do when he returned home justice of the peace that he would certainly be made captain first and afterwards colonel in the somerset militia that also should he be knight of the shire if he were ambitiousbut that i knew he would never be high sheriff of the county if his slender means permittedfor the estate was not worth more than five or six hundred pounds a year perhaps he would marry an heiress it would be greatly to the advantage of the family if an heiress were to come into it with broad acres of her own but she was not a woman who would seek to control her son in the matter of his affections and if he chose a girl with no fortune to her back if she was a good girl and pious madam would never say him nay and he would soon return the boy had been at oxford and next in london learning law such as justices require he was now with humphrey at the university of leyden doubtless learning more law my dear said madam we want him home his grandfather groweth old though still thank god in the full possession of his faculties yet a young mans presence is needed i trust and pray that he will return as he went innocent in spite of the many temptations of the wicked city and oh childwhat if he should have lost his heart to some designing city hussy he cameas you shall hear immediatelyrobin came home would to god that he had waited if only for a single month had he not come all our afflictions would have been spared us had he not come that good old man sir christopherbut it is vain to imagine what might have been we are in the hands of the lord nothing that happens to us is permitted but by him and for some wise purpose was sir christopher in his old agealas why should i anticipate what i have to narrate chapter x le roy est mort in february of the year king charles ii died sir christopher himself brought us the news from sherborne whither he had gone as was his wont to the weekly ordinary he clattered up the lane on his cob and halted at our gate call thy father child give you good day madam eykin will your husband leave his books and come forth for a moment tell him i have news my father rose and obeyed his gown was in rags his feet were clad in cloth shoon which i worked for him his cheek was wasted but his eye was keen he was lean and tall his hair was as white as sir christophers though he was full twenty years younger friend and gossip said sir christopher the king is dead is charles stuart dead my father replied he cumbered the earth too long for fiveandtwenty years hath he persecuted the saints also he hath burnt incense after the abomination of the heathen let his lot be as the lot of ahaz nay he is buried by this time his brother the duke of york hath been proclaimed king james the papist it is as though manasseh should succeed to ahaz and after him jehoiakim yet the bells will ring and we shall pray for the king and wise men friend eykin will do well to keep silence there is a time to speak and a time to keep silence it may be that the time is at hand when a godly man must stretch forth his hand to tear down the scarlet woman though she slay him in the attempt it may be so my friend yet stretch not forth thine hand until thou art well assured of the divine command the king is dead now will my soninlaw ring out the bells for the new king and we shall pray for him as we prayed for his brother it is our duty to pray for all in authority though to the prayers of a whole nation there seemeth so far as human reason can perceive no answer i for one will pray no more for a king who is a papist rather will i pray daily for his overthrow king charles is said to have received a priest before he died yet it is worse that the king should be an open than a secret catholic let us be patient my friend and await the time so he rode up the village and presently the bells were set aringing and they clashed as joyously echoing around the corton hills as if the accession of king james ii was the only thing wanted to make the nation prosperous happy and religious my father stood at the gate after sir christopher left him the wind was cold and the twilight was falling and his cassock was thin but he remained there motionless until my mother went out and drew him back to the house by the arm he went into his own room but he read no more that day in the evening he came forth and sat with us and while i sat sewing my mother spinning by the light of the fire he discoursed which was unusual with him upon things and peoples and the best form of government which he held to be a commonwealth with a strong man for president but he was to hold his power from the people and was to lay it down frequently lest he should in his turn be tempted to become a king and if he were to fall away from righteousness or to live in open sin or to be a merrymaker or to suffer his country to fall from a high place among the nations he was to be displaced and be forced to retire as for the man charles now dead he would become my father said an example to all future ages and a warning of what may happen when the doctrine of divine right is generally accepted and acted upon the king himself being not so much blamed by him as the practice of hereditary rule which caused him to be seated upon the throne when his true place my father said was among the lacqueys and varlets of the palace his brother james he added hath now an opportunity such as is given to fewfor he may become another josiah but i think he will neglect that opportunity he concluded yea even if hilkiah the priest were to bring him a message from huldah the prophetess for he doth belong to a family which by the divine displeasure can never perceive the truth let us now read the word and wrestle with the lord in prayer next we heard that loyal addresses were poured in from all quarters congratulating the king and promising most submissive obedience one would have thought that the people were rejoiced at the succession of a roman catholic it was said that the king had promised liberty of conscience unto all that he claimed that liberty for himself and that he went to mass daily and openly but many there were who foresaw trouble unfortunately one of them was sir christopher who spoke his mind at all times too fiercely for his safety mr boscorel also was of opinion that civil war would speedily ensue the kings friends he said may for a time buy the support of the nonconformists and make a show of religious liberty thus may they govern for a while but it is not in the nature of the roman catholic priest to countenance religious liberty or ever to sit down contented with less than all the pie they must for ever scheme and intrigue for more power religious liberty it means to them the eternal damnation of those who hold themselves free to think for themselves they would be less than human if they did not try to save the souls of the people by docking their freedom they must make this country even as spain or italy is it to be believed that they will suffer the church to retain her revenues or the universities to remain out of their control nay will they allow the grammar schools to be in the hands of protestants never the next generation will be wholly catholic unless the present generation send king and priests packing these were treasonable words but they were uttered in the hall of the manor house with no other persons present than sir christopher and the rector himself seeing these things soninlaw said sir christopher what becomes of right divine where is the duty of nonresistance the doctrine of right divine said mr boscorel rubbing his nose includes the divine institution of a monarchy which i confess is manifestly untenable because the lord granted a king to the people only because they clamoured for one also had the institution been of divine foundation the jews would never have been allowed to live under the rule of judges tetrarchs and roman governors you have not always spoken so plainly said sir christopher nay why be always proclaiming to the world your thoughts and opinions besides even if the doctrine of nonresistance were sound there may be cases in which just laws may be justly set aside i say not that this is one as yet but if there were danger of the ancient superstitions being thrust upon us to the destruction of our souls i say not that we should meekly sit down nay if a starving man take a loaf of bread there being no other way possible to save his life one would not therefore hold him a thief yet the law remains shall the blood which hath been poured out for the cause of liberty prove to be shed in vain asked sir christopher why sir said the rector the same question might be asked in france where the protestants fought longer and against greater odds than we in this country yet the blood of those martyrs hath been shed so far as man can see in vain the church of rome is there the conqueror indeed it is laid upon the protestants even upon us who hold that we are a true branch of the ancient apostolic church to defend ourselves continually against an enemy who is always at unity always guided by one man always knows what he wants and is always working to get it we on the other hand do not know our own minds and must for ever be quarrelling among ourselves nevertheless the heart of the country is protestant and sooner or later the case of conscience may arise whetherthe law remaining unchangedwe may not blamelessly break the law that case of conscience was not yet ripe for consideration there needed first many thingsincluding the martyrdom of saints and innocent men and poor ignorant rusticsbefore the country roused herself once more to seize her liberties then as to that poor doctrine of divine right they all made a mouthful of it except only a small and harmless band of nonjurors at the outset whatever the opinions of the peoplewho could have been made to rise as one manthe gentry remained loyal above all things they dreaded another civil war we must fain accept the kings professions said the rector if we have misgivings let us disguise them let us rather nourish the hope that they are honestly meant and let us wait england will not become another spain in a single day let us wait the stake is not yet set up in smithfield and the inquisition is not yet established in the country it was in this temper that the kings accession found sir christopher afterwards he was accused of having harboured designs against the king from the beginning that indeed was not the case he had no thought of entering into any such enterprise yet he never doubted that in the end there would be an uprising against the rule of the priests nor did he doubt that the king would be pushed on by his advisers to one pretension after another for the advancement of his own prerogative and the displacement of the protestant church nay he openly predicted that there would be such attempts and he maintainedsuch was his wisdomthat in the long run the protestant faith would be established upon a surer foundation than ever but as for conspiring or being cognisant of any conspiracy that was untrue why he was at this time seventyfive years of agea time when such men as sir christopher have continually before their eyes death and the judgment as for my father perhaps i am wrong but in the daily prayers of night and morning and in the grace before meat he seemed to find a freer utterance and to wrestle more vehemently than was his wont on the subject of the scarlet woman offering himself as a willing martyr and confessor if by the shedding of his blood the great day of her final overthrow might be advanced yet always humble not daring to think of himself as anything but an instrument to do the will of his master in the end his death truly helped with others to bring a protestant king to the throne of these isles and since we knew him to be so deep a scholar always reading and learning and in no sense a man of activity the thing which he presently did amazed us all yet we ought to have known that one who is under the divine command to preach the word of god and hath been silenced by man for more than twenty years so that the strength of his manhood hath run to waste and is lostit is a most terrible and grievous thing for a man to be condemned to idlenessmay become like unto one of those burning mountains of which we sometimes read in books of voyages in him as in them the inner fires rage and burn growing ever stronger and fiercer until presently they rend asunder the sides of the mountain and burst forth pouring down liquid fire over the unhappy valleys beneath with showers of redhot ashes to destroy and cover up the smiling homesteads and the fertile meadows it is true that my father chafed continually at the inaction forced upon him but his impatience was never so strong as at this time namely after the accession of king james it drove him from his books and out into the fields and lanes where he walked to and fro waving his long arms and sometimes crying aloud and shouting in the woods as if compelled to cry out in order to quench some raging fever or heat of his mind about this time too i remember they began to talk of the exiles in holland the duke of monmouth was there with the earl of argyle and with them a company of firebrands eager to get back to england and their property i am certain now that my father and perhaps through his information sir christopher also was kept acquainted with the plots and designs that were carried on in the low countries nay i am also certain that his informant was none other than humphrey who was still in leyden i have seen a letter from him written as i now understand in a kind of allegory or parable in which one thing was said and another meant thus he pretends to speak of dutch gardeningthe gardeners he says take infinite pains that their secrets shall not be learned or disclosed i know however that a certain blue tulip much desired by many gardeners in england will be taken across the water this year and i hope that by next year the precious bulb may be fully planted in english soil the preparation of the soil necessary for the favourable reception of the bulb is well known to you and you will understand how to mix your soil and to add manure and so forth i myself expect to finish what i have to do in a few weeks when i shall cross to london and so ride westwards and hope to pay my respects to my revered tutor in the month of june next it may be that i shall come with the tulip but that is not certain many messages have been received offering large sums of money for the bulb so that it is hoped that the dutch gardeners will let it go from h c the tulip in a word was the duke of monmouth and the dutch gardeners were the scotch and english exiles then in holland and the english gardeners were the dukes friends and h c was humphrey challis i think that sir christopher must have known of this correspondence because i now remember that my father would sit with him for many hours looking at a map of england conversing long and earnestly and making notes in a book these notes he made in the arabic character which no one but himself could read i therefore suppose that he was estimating the number of nonconformists who might be disposed to aid in such an enterprise as humphreys gardeners were contemplating robin who certainly was no conspirator also wrote a letter from leyden about this time saying that something was expected nobody knew what but that the exiles were meeting constantly as if something was brewing it was about the first week of june that the news came to us of lord argyles landing this was the beginning after that as you will hear the news came thick and fast every day something fresh and something to quicken the most sluggish pulse to me at least it seemed as if the breath of god himself was poured out upon the country and that the people were everywhere resolved to banish the accursed thing from their midst alas i was but a simple country maid and i was deceived the accursed thing was to be driven forth but not yet the country party hated the pope but they dreaded civil war and indeed there is hardly any excuse for that most dreadful scourge except the salvation of the soul and the safeguarding of liberties they would gladly welcome a rising but it must be general and universal they had for fiveandtwenty years been taught the wickedness of rebellion and now there was no way to secure the protestant faith except by rebellion unhappily the rebellion began before the country gentlemen were ready to begin chapter xi before the storm before the storm breaks there sometimes falls upon the earth a brief time when the sun shines in splendour from a clear sky the air is balmy and delightsome the birds sing in the coppice and the innocent lambs leap in the meadows then suddenly dark clouds gather from the north the wind blows cold in a minute the sky is black the lightnings flash the thunders roll the wind roars the hail beats down and strips the orchard of its promise and silences the birds cowering in the branches and drives the trembling sheep to take shelter in the hedges this was to be my case you shall understand how for a single dayit was no morei was the happiest girl in all the world i may now without any shame confess that i have always loved robin from my earliest childhood that was no great wonder seeing what manner of boy he was and how he was always kind and thoughtful for me we were at first only brother and sister together which is natural and reasonable when children grow up together nor can i tell when or how we ceased to be brother and sister save that it may have been when robin kissed me so tenderly at parting and told me that he should always love me i do not think that brothers do generally protest love and promise continual affection barnaby certainly never declared his love for me nor did he ever promise to love me all his life perhaps had he remained longer he might have become as tender as he was goodhearted but i think that tenderness towards a sister is not in the nature of a boy i loved robin and i loved humphrey both as if they were brothers but one of them ceased to be my brother while the other in consequence remained my brother always a girl may be ignorant of the world as i was and of lovers and their ways as i was and yet she cannot grow from a child to a woman without knowing that when a young man who hath promised to love her always speaks of her in every letter he means more than common brotherly love nor can any woman be indifferent to a man who thus regards her nor can she think upon love without the desire of being herself loved truly i had always before my eyes the spectacle of that holy love which consecrates every part of life i mean in the case of my mother whose waking and sleeping thoughts were all for her husband who worked continually and cheerfully with her hands that he might be enabled to study without other work and gave up her whole life without grudgingeven reckoning it her happiness and her privilegein order to provide food and shelter for him it was enough reward for her that he should sometimes lay his hand lovingly upon her head or turn his eyes with affection to meet hers it was in the night of june as i lay in bed not yet asleep though it was already past nine oclock that i heard the trampling of hoofs crossing the stream and passing our cottage had i known who were riding those horses there would have been but little sleep for me that night but i knew not and did not suspect and so supposing that it was only one of the farmers belated i closed my eyes and presently slept until the morning about five o clock or a little before that time i awoke the sun having already arisen and being now well up above the hills i therefore arose softly leaving my mother asleep still and having dressed quickly and prayed a little i crept down the stairs in the house there was such a stillness that i could even hear the regular breathing of my father as he slept upon his pallet among his books it was chill and damp as is the custom in the early morning in the room where he lived and worked yet when i threw open door and shutter and looked outside the air was full of warmth and refreshment as for the birds they had long since left their nests and now were busy looking for their breakfast the larks were singing overhead and the bees already humming and droning who would lie abed when he could get up and enjoy the beauty of the morning when i had breathed a while with pleasure and satisfaction the soft air which was laden with the scent of flowers and of hay i went indoors again and swept and dusted the room then i opened the cupboard and considered the provision for breakfast for my father there would be a slice of cold bacon with a good crust of homemade bread better bread or sweeter was nowhere to be had and a cup of cider warming to the spirits and good for one who is no longer young against any rawness of the morning air for my mother and myself there would be as soon as our neighbours cows were milked a cup of warm milk and bread soaked in it tis a breakfast good for a grown person as well as for a child and it costs us nothing but the trouble of going to take it when i had swept the room and laid everything in its place i went into the garden hoe in hand to weed the beds and trim the borders the garden was not very big it is true but it produced many things useful for us notably onions and sallet besides many herbs good for the house for it was a fertile strip of ground and planted in every part of it now such was the beauty of the morning and the softness of the air that i presently forgot the work about which i had come into the garden and sat down in the shade upon a bench suffering my thoughts to wander hither and thither much have i always pitied those poor folk in towns who can never escape from the noise and clatter of tongues and sit somewhere in the sunshine or the shade while the cattle low in the meadows and the summer air makes the leaves to rustle and thus alone suffer their thoughts to wander here and there every morning when i arose was this spectacle of natures gladness presented to my eyes but not every morning could my spirit which sometimes crawls as if fearing the light of day and the face of the sun rise to meet and greet it and to feel it calling aloud for a hymn of praise and thanksgiving for indeed this is a beautiful world if we could always which we cannot for the earthliness of our natures suffer its loveliness to sink into our hearts i know not what i thought this morning but i remember while i considered the birds which neither reap nor sow nor take any thought of tomorrow yet are daily fed by heaven that the words were whispered in mine ear are ye not much better than they and this without doubt prepared my heart for what should follow while i sat thinking of i know not what there came footstepsquick footstepsalong the road and i knew those footsteps and sprang to my feet and ran to the gardengate crying robinit is robin yes it was robin he seized me by both hands looking in my face curiously and eagerly alice he said drawing a deep breath oh but what hath happened to thee what should happen robin oh thou art changed alice i left thee almost a child and nownowi thought to catch thee in my armsa sweet rustic nymphand nowfain must i go upon my knees to a goddess robin who indeed would have expected such language from robin illustration and robin was come home again and i was lying in his arms and he was kissing me alice he said still gazing upon me with a kind of wonder which made me blush do you remember when we parted four years agothe words we said as for me i have never forgotten them i was to think of thee always i was to love thee always truly i may say that there is never a day but thou hast been in my mind but not like thishe continued to look upon me as upon some strange creature so that i began to be frightened and turned away nay alice forgive me i am one who is dazzled by the splendour of the sun forgive me i cannot speak i thought of a village beauty rosycheeked sweet and wholesome as an august quarander and i find robinnot a goddess well then a woman tall and stately and more beautiful than words can say nay robin you do but flatter that is not like the old robin i remember andi should have added loved but the word stuck i swear sweet saintif i may swearnay then i do affirm that i do not flatter hear me tell a plain tale i have travelled far since last i saw thee i have seen the great ladies of the court both of st jamess and of the louvre i have seen the famous beauties of provence and the blackeyed witches of italy but nowhere have i seen a woman half so fair robinyou must not nay robinyou shame me then he knelt at my feet and seized my hand and kissed it oh the foolishness of a man in love and yet it pleases us no woman is worth it no woman can understand it nor can she comprehend the power and might of mans love nor why he singles out her alone from all the rest and fills his heart wholly with her so that all other women are henceforward as his sisters it is wonderful it is most wonderful yet it pleases us nay we cannot choose but thank god for it with all our heart and with all our soul i would not if i could set down all the things which robin said first because the words of love are sacred next because i would not that other women should know the extravagance of his praise it was in broken words because love can never be eloquent as for me what could i do what could i say for i had loved him from my very childhood and now all my heart went out from me and became his i was all his i was his slave to command that is the quality of earthly love by which it most closely resembles the heavenly love so that just as the godly man is wholly devoted to the will of the lord in all things great and small resigned to his chastisements and always anxious to live and die in his service so in earthly love one must be wholly devoted to the person whom one loves and robin was come home again and i was lying in his arms and he was kissing me and calling me all the sweet and tender things that he could invent and laughing and sighing together as if too happy to be quiet oh sweetest moments of my life why did they pass so quickly oh sacrament of love which can be taken only once and yet changes the whole of life and fills it with memory which is wholly sweet in all other earthly things there is something of bitterness in this holy joy of pure and sacred love there is no bitternessno not any it leaves behind nothing of reproach or of repentance of shame or of sorrow it is altogether holy now when my boy had somewhat recovered from his first rapture and i had assured him very earnestly that i was not indeed an angel but a most sinful woman daily offending in my inner thoughts an assurance which he received indeed with an appearance of disbelief and scorn i was able to consider his appearance which was now very fine though always as i learned when i saw him among other gentlemen with some soberness as became one whose upbringing inclined him to plainness of dress as well as of speech and manner he wore a long wig of brown hair which might have been his own but for its length his hat was laced and cocked which gave him a gallant and martial appearance his neckcloth was long and of fine lace beside him in my russet gown i must have looked truly plain and rustic but robin was pleased not to think so and love is a great magician to cheat the eyes he was home again he told me he should travel no more yet you shall hear how far he afterwards travelled against his will his only desire now was to stay at home and live as his grandfather had lived in his native village he had nothing to pray for but the continuance of my loveof which indeed there was no doubt possible it was now close upon six oclock and i begged him to go away for the present and if my father and sir christopher should agree and if it should seem to his honour a fit and proper thing that robin should marry a girl so penniless as myself whythenwe might meet again after breakfast or after dinner or indeed at any other time and so discourse more upon the matter so he left me being very reluctant to go and i forgetting my garden and what i had come forth to do returned to the house you must understand that all these things passed in the garden divided from the lane by a thick hedge and that passersbybut there were nonecould not very well have seen what was done though they might have heard what was said but if my father had looked out of his window he could have seen and if my mother had come downstairs she also might have seen through the window or through the open door this i thought not upon nor was there anything to hidethough one would not willingly suffer anyone even ones own mother to see and listen at such a moment yet mother has since told me that she saw robin on his knees kissing my hands but she withdrew and would not look again when i stepped within the door she was at work with her wheel and looked up with a smile upon her lips but tears were lying in her eyes had i known what she had seen i should have been ashamed daughter she said softly thy cheek is burning red hast thou perchance been too long in the sun no mother the sun is not too hot daughter she went on still smiling through her tears thine eyes are bright and glowing hast thou a touch of fever by ill chance no mother i have no fever child thy lips are trembling and thy hands are shaking my dear my dear what is it tell thy mother all she held out her arms to me and i threw myself at her feet and buried my head in her lap as if i had been again a child mother mother i cried robin hath come home again and he says he loves me and nothing will do but he must marry me my dear she said kissing and fondling me robin hath always been a good lad and i doubt not that he hath returned unspotted from the world but nay do not let us be too sure for first his honour must consent and then madam and thy father must be askedand he would never for any worldly honourno neversuffer thee to marry an ungodly man as for thy lack of fortune i know not if that will not also stand in the way and as for family thy father though he was born in new england cometh of a good stock and i myself am a gentlewoman and on both sides we bear an ancient coatofarms and as for thyself my dear thou arti thank god for itof a sweet temper and an obedient disposition from the earliest thou hast never given thy mother any uneasiness and i think thy heart hath been mercifully disposed towards goodness from thy childhood upwards it is a special grace in this our long poverty and oppression and it consoles me partly for the loss of my son barnaby here she was silent for a space and her eyes filled and brimmed over daughter she said earnestly thou art comely in the eyes of men that have i known for long it is partly for thy sweet looks that sir christopher loves thee mr boscorel plays music with thee partly because his eyes love to behold the beauty of woman nay i mean no reproach because it is the nature of men to love all things beautiful whether it be the plumage of a bird or the shape of a womans head yes thou art beautiful my dear beauty passes but love remains thy husband will perchance never cease to think thee lovely if he still proves daily thy goodness and the loveliness of thy heart my dear thou hast long comforted thy mother now shalt thou go with the blessing of the lord to be the solace and the joy of thy husband chapter xii humphrey presently my father came in the bible in his hand by his countenance it was plain that he had been already engaged in meditation and that his mind was charged as with a message alas to think of the many great discourses that he pronounced being as a dog who must be muzzled should he leave the farmyard to us women alone if they were written down the world would lift up its hands with wonder and ask if a prophet indeed had been vouchsafed to this unhappy country the roman church will have that the time of saints did not end with the last of the apostles that may be and yet a saint has no more power after death than remains in his written words and in the memory of his life shall we not however grant that there may still be prophets who see and apprehend the meaning of words and of things more fully than others even as spiritually minded as themselves now i say considering what was immediately to befall us the passage which my father read and expounded that morning was in a manner truly prophetic it was the vision of the basket of summer fruit which was vouchsafed to the prophet amos he read to us that terrible chaptereverybody knows it though it hath but fourteen verses i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord he then applied the chapter to these times saying that the scriptures and the prophecies apply not only to the israel of the time when amos or any other prophet lived but to the people of god in all ages yet so that sometimes one prophet seems to deliver the message that befits the time and sometimes another all these things prophesied by amos had come to pass in this country of great britain so that there was and had now been for twentyfive years a grievous famine and a sore thirst for the words of the lord he continued to explain and to enlarge upon this topic for nearly an hour when he concluded with a fervent prayer that the famine would pass away and the sealed springs be open again for the children of grace to drink and be refreshed this done he took his breakfast in silence as was his wont loving not to be disturbed by any earthly matters when his mind was full of his morning discourse when he had eaten the bread and meat and taken the cup of cider he arose and went back to his own room and shut the door we should have no more speech of him until dinnertime i will speak with him my dear said my mother but not yet let us wait till we hear from sir christopher i would that my father had read us a passage of encouragement and promise on this morning of all mornings i said my mother turned over the leaves of the bible i will read you a verse of encouragement she said it is the word of god as much as the book of the prophet amos so she found and read for my comfort words which had a new meaning to me my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away and again these that follow set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned in these gracious nay these enraptured words doth the bible speak of love and though i am not so ignorant as not to know that it is the love of the church for christ yet i am persuaded by my own spiritual experiencewhatever doctors of divinity may arguethat the earthly love of husband and wife may be spoken of in these very words as being the type of that other and higher love and in this matter i know that my mother would also confirm my judgment it might have been between nine and ten that humphrey came surely he was changed more than robin for the great white periwig which he wore being now a physician falling upon his shoulders did partly hide the deformity of his wry shape and the black velvet coat did also become him mightily as for his face that was not changed at all it had been grave and serious in youth it was now more grave and more serious in manhood he stood in the doorway not seeing mei was making a pudding for dinner with my sleeves rolled up and my arms white with flour mistress eykin he said are old friends passed out of mind why my mother left her wheel and gave him her hand tis humphrey i knew that we should see thee this morning humphrey is thy health good my son and is all well with thee all is well madam and my health is good how is my masterthy husband he is always well andbut thou knowest what manner of life he leads of late he hath been much disquieted he is restlesshis mind runs much upon the prophecies of war and pestilence it is the news from london and the return of the mass which keeps him uneasy go in and see him humphrey he will willingly suffer thee to disturb him though we must not go near him in his hours of study presently but where is my old playfellowwhere is alice she is behind you humphrey he turned and his pale face flushed when he saw me alice he cried is this truly alice nay she is changed indeed i knew noti could not expectnay how could one expect there is no change said my mother sharply alice was a child and is now a woman that is all humphrey expects i said that we should all stop still while time went on you were to become a bachelor of medicine sir and a fellow of all souls college and to travel in italy and france and to come back in a velvet coat and a long sword and a periwig over your shoulders and i was to be a little girl still humphrey shook his head it is not only that he said though i confess that one did not make due allowance for the flight of time it is that the sweetfaced child has become no humphrey i said i want no compliments go now sir and speak with my father afterwards you shall tell me all that you have been doing he obeyed and opened my fathers door humphrey my father sprang to his feet welcome my pupil thou bringest good news nay i have received thy letters i read the good news in thy facei see it in thine eyes welcome home sir i have indeed great news said humphrey then the door was closed he stayed there for half an hour and more and we heard from within earnest talkmy fathers voice sometimes uplifted loud and angry but humphreys always low as if he did not wish us to overhear them so not to seem unto each other as if we were listening mother and i talked of other things such as the lightness of the pudding and the quantity of suet which should be put into it and the time it should boil in the pot and other things as women can whose hearts are full yet they must needs be talking father hath much to say to humphrey i said after a time he doth not use to like such interruption humphreys conversation is no interruption my dear they think the same thoughts and talk the same language your father may teach and admonish us but he can only converse with a scholar such as himself it is not the least evil of our oppression that he hath been cut off from the society of learned men in which he used to take so much delight if humphrey remains here a little while you shall see your father lose the eager and anxious look which hath of late possessed him he will talk to humphrey and will clear his mind then he will be contented again for a while or at least resigned presently humphrey came forth his face was grave and serious my father came out of the room after him let us talk more he said let us resume our talk join me on the hillside where none can hear us it is indeed the vision of the basket of summer fruit that we read this morning his face was working with some inward excitement and his eyes were full of a strange light as of a glad conqueror or of oneforbid the thoughtwho was taking a dire revenge he strode down the garden and out into the lanes thus said my mother will he walk out and sometimes remain in the woods walking preaching to the winds and swinging his arms the whole day long art thou a physician and canst thou heal him humphrey if the cause be removed the disease will be cured perhaps before long the cause will be removed the causeoh the causewhat is the cause but the tyranny of the law he who was ordered by heaven itself to preach hath been perforce silent for fiveandtwenty years his very life hath been taken from him and you talk of removing the cause madam if the law suffer him once more to preach freely would that satisfy himand you my mother shook her head the law she said now we have a papist on the throne is far more likely to lead my husband to the stake than to set him free that shall we shortly see said humphrey my mother bent her head over her wheel as one who wishes to talk no more upon the subject she loved not to speak concerning her husband to any except to me i went out into the garden with humphrey i was foolish i laughed at nothing i talked nonsense oh i was so happy that if a pipe and tabor had been heard in the village i should have danced to the music like poor barnaby the night before he ran away i regarded not the grave and serious face of my companion you are merry alice said humphrey it is because you are come back againyou and robin oh the time has been long and dulland now you have come back we shall all be happy again yes my father will cease to fret and rage he will talk latin and greek with you sir christopher will be happy only in looking upon you madam will have her son home again and mr boscorel will bring out all the old music for you humphrey it is a happy day that brings you home again it may be a happy day also for me he said but there is much to be done when the business we have in hand is accomplished what business humphrey for he spoke so gravely that it startled me tis business of which thy father knows child nay let us not talk of it i think and hope that it is as good as accomplished now before it is well taken in hand it is not of that business that i would speak alice thou art so beautiful and so tall nay humphrey i must not be flattered and i so crooked humphrey i will not hear this talk you so great a scholar thus to speak of yourself let me speak of myself my dear hear me for a moment i declare that i had not the least thought of what he was going to say my mind being wholly occupied with the idea of robin i am a physician as you doubtless know i am medicinae doctor of oxford of padua montpellier and leyden i know alli may fairly say and without boastingthat may be learned by one of my age from schools of medicine and from books on the science and practice of healing i believe in short that i am as good a physician as can be found within these seas i am minded as soon as tranquillity is restored to set up as a physician in london where i have already many friends and am assured of some support i think humbly speaking that reasonable success awaits me aliceyou know that i have loved you all my lifewill you marry me crooked as i am oh you cannot but know that i have loved you all my life oh child he stretched forth his hands and in his eyes there was a world of longing and of sadness which moved my heart my dear the crooked in body have no friends among men they cannot join in their rough sports nor drink with them nor fight with them they have no chance of happiness but in love my dear my dear give me that chance i love thee oh my dear give me that chance never had i seen humphrey so moved before i felt guilty and ashamed in the presence of this passion of which i was the most unworthy cause oh humphrey stopfor heavens sake stopbecause i am but this very morning promised to robin who loves me tooand i love robin humphrey he sank back pale and disordered and i thought that he would swoon but he recovered humphrey never doubt that i love you too but oh i love robin and robin loves me yes dearyes childyes alice he said in broken accents i understand everything is for robineverything for robin why i might have guessed it for robin the straight and comely figure for robin the strength for robin the inheritance for robin happy love for me a crooked body for me a feeble frame for me the loss of fortune for me contempt and poverty for me the loss of loveall for robinall for robin humphrey surely thou wouldst not envy or be jealous of robin never had i seen him thus moved or heard him thus speak he made no answer for a while then he said slowly and painfully alice i am ashamed why should not robin have all who am i that i should have anything forgive me child i have lived in a paradise which fools create for themselves i have suffered myself to dream that what i ardently desired was possible and even probable forgive me let me be as beforeyour brother will you forgive me dear oh humphrey there is nothing for me to forgive nay there is much for me to repent of forget it then if there is nothing to forgive i have forgotten it already humphrey sohe turned upon me his grave sweet face to think of it makes me yearn with tenderness and pityso farewell fond dream do not think my dear that i envy robin twas a sweet dream yet i pray that heaven in wrath may forget me if ever i suffer this passion of envy to hurt my cousin robin or thyself so saying he burst from me with distraction in his face poor humphrey alas when i look back and consider this day there is a doubt which haunts me always had i loved robin that is most true but i had always loved humphrey that is most true what if it had been humphrey instead of robin who had arisen in the early morning to find his sweetheart in the garden when the dew was yet upon the grass chapter xiii one day in times of great sorrow the godly person ought to look forward to the neverending joy and happiness that will follow this short life yet we still look backwards to the happy time that is past and can never come again and then how happy does it seem to have been in comparison with present affliction it pleased heaven after many trials to restore my earthly happinessat least in its principal part which is earthly love some lossesgrievous and lamentablethere were which could not be restored yet for a long time i had no other comfort apart from that hope which i trust was never suffered to leave me than the recollection of one single day in its course too short from dewy morn till dusky eve i began that day with the sweetest joy that a girl can ever experiencenamely the return of her lover and the happiness of learning that he loves her more than ever with the knowledge that her heart hath gone forth from her and is wholly his to such a girl the woods and fields become the very garden of eden the breath of the wind is as the voice of the lord blessing another eve the very showers are the tears of gladness and gratitude the birds sing hymns of praise the leaves of the trees whisper words of love the brook prattles of kisses the flowers offer incense the royal course of the sun in splendour the glories of the sunrise and sunset the twinkling stars of night the shadows of the flying clouds the pageant of the summer daythese are all prepared for that one happy girl and for her happy lover oh divine gift of love which thus gives the whole world with its fruits in season to each pair in turn nay doth it not create them anew what was adam without eve and eve was created for no other purpose than to be a companion to the man i say then that the day when robin took me in his arms and kissed menot as he had done when we parted and i was still a child but with the fervent kiss of a loverwas the happiest day in all my life i say that i have never forgotten that day but by recalling any point of it i remember all how he held my hand and how he made me confess that i loved him how we kissed and parted to meet again as for poor humphrey i hardly gave him so much as a thought of pity then how we wandered along the brook hand in hand never to part again my dear said the fond lover here will we live and here we will die let benjamin become if he please lord chancellor and humphrey a great physician they will have to live among men in towns where every other man is a rogue we shall live in this sweet country place where the people may be rude but they are not knaves why in that great city of london where the merchants congregate upon the exchange and look so full of dignity and wisdom each man is thinking all the time that if he fail to overreach his neighbour that neighbour will overreach him who would live such a life when he can pass it in the fields with such a companion as my alice the pleasures of london had only increased his thirst for the country life surely never was seen a swain more truly rustic in all his thoughts the fine ladies at the playhouse with their painted faces made him he told me think of one who wore a russet frock in somersetshire and did not paint her sweet facethis was the way he talked the plays they acted could never even be read much less witnessed by that dear girlso full of wickedness they were at the assemblies the ladies were jealous of each other and put on scornful looks when one seemed preferred at the taverns the men drank and bellowed songs and quarrelled in the streets they fought and took the wall and swaggered there was nothing but fighting among the baser sort with horrid imprecations at the coffeehouses the politicians argued and quarrelled nay in the very churches the sermons were political arguments and while the clergyman read his discourse the gallants ogled the ladies all this and more he told me to hear my boy one would think there was nothing in london but what was wicked and odious no doubt it is a wicked place where many men live together those who are wicked easily find each other out and are encouraged in their wickedness yet there must be many honest and godfearing persons otherwise the judgment of heaven would again fall upon that city as it did in the time of the plague and in the great fire my pretty puritan said robin i am now come away from that place and i hope never to see it again oh native hills i salute you oh woods and meadows i have returned to wander again in your delightful shade then which was unusual in my boy and would have better become mr boscorel or humphrey he began to repeat verses i knew not that he had ever learned any as i range these spacious fields feast on all that nature yields everything inspires delight charms my smell my taste my sight every rural sound i hear soothes my soul and tunes my ear i do not know where robin found these verses but as he repeated them waving his arm around i thought that humphrey himself never made sweeter lines he then told me how humphrey would certainly become the most learned physician of the time and that he was already master of a polite and dignified manner which would procure him the patronage of the great and the confidence of all it was pleasant to hear him praise his cousin without jealousy or envy to be sure he knew not thenthough afterwards i told himthat humphrey was his rival even had he known this such was the candour of my robin and the integrity of his soul that he would have praised him even more loudly one must not repeat more of the kind and lovely things that the dear boy said while we strolled together by the brookside while thus abroad we walkedtwas in the forenoon after humphreys visitsir christopher his grandfather dressed in his best coat and his goldlaced hat which he commonly kept for church and accompanied by madam walked from the manor house through the village till they came to our cottage then with great ceremony they entered sir christopher bowing low and madam dropping a deep courtesy to my mother who sat humbly at her wheel madam said sir christopher we would with your permission say a few words with the learned dr eykin and yourself my father who had now returned and was in his room came forth when he was called his face had recovered something of its serenity but his eyes were still troubled madam sat down but sir christopher and my father stood sir said his honour i will proceed straight to the point my grandson desires to marry your daughter alice robin is a good ladnot a scholar if you willfor his religion the root of the matter is in him for the goodness of his heart i will answer for his habit of life he hath so far as we can learn acquired no vile vices of the cityhe doth neither drink nor gamble nor waste his health and strength in riotous living and for his means they are my own all that i have will be his tis no great estate but twill serve him as it hath served me sir the boys mother and i have come to ask your daughter in marriage we know her worth and we are right well satisfied that our boy hath made so good and wise a choice they were marrying and giving in marriage when the flood came they will be marrying and giving in marriage in the great day of the lord said my father yes gossip but that is no reason why they should not now be marrying and giving in marriage you ask my consent said my father this surprises me the child is too young she is not yet of marriageable age husband she is nigh upon her twentieth birthday i thought she had been but twelve or thereabouts my consent why sir christopher in the eyes of the world this is great condescension on your part to take a penniless girl i looked i suppose to the marriage of my daughter some timeperhaps to a farmeryetyet we are told that a virtuous woman hath a price far above rubies and that it is she who buildeth up the house and we are nowhere told that she must bring her husband a purse of gold sir christopher it would be the blackest ingratitude in us to deny you even if this thing were which i say not against the mind of our daughter it is notit is not said my mother wherefore seeing that the young man is a good man as youths go though in the matter of the latin syntax he hath yet much to learn and that his heart is disposed towards religion i am right glad that he should take our girl to wife bravely said cried sir christopher hands upon it man and we will have a merry wedding but today i bid you both to come and feast with us we will have holiday and rejoicing yes said my father we will feast though tomorrow comes the deluge i know now what he meant but at that time we knew not and it seemed to his honour a poor way of rejoicing at the return of the boys and the betrothal of his daughter thus to be foretelling woes the vision of the plumbline is before mine eyes my father went on is the land able to bear all this we talk of feasting and of marriages yet a few days or perhaps alreadybut we will rejoice together my old friend and benefactor we will rejoice together with these strange words he turned and went back to his room and after some tears with my mother madam went home and sir christopher with her but in honour to the day he kept on his best coat robin suffered me to go home but only that i might put on my best frock i had but two and make my hair straight which had been blown into curls as was the way with my hair and then learning from my mother with the utmost satisfaction what had passed he led me by the hand as if i were already his bride and so to the manor house where first sir christopher saluted me with great kindness calling me his dear granddaughter and saying that next to robins safe return he asked for nothing more than to see me robins wife and madam kissed me with tears in her eyes and said that she could desire nothing better for her son and that she was sure i should do my best endeavours to make the boy happy then humphrey as quietly as if he had not also asked me to be his wife kissed my hand and wished me joy and mr boscorel also kissed me and declared that robin ought to be the happiest dog on earth and so we sat down to our feast the conversation at dinner was graver than the occasion demanded for though our travellers continually answered questions about the foreign lands and peoples they had seen yet the subject returned always to the condition of the country and to what would happen after dinner we sat in the garden and the gentlemen began to talk of right divine and of nonresistance and here it seemed to me as if mr boscorel was looking on as from an eminence apart for when he had once stated the texts and arguments upon which the high church party do mostly rely he retired and made no further objections listening in silence while my father held forth upon the duty of rising against wicked princes at last however being challenged to reply by humphrey mr boscorel thus made answer the doctrine that subjects may or may not rebel against their sovereign is one which i regard with interest so long as it remains a question of logic and argument only unfortunately the times are such that we may be called upon to make a practical application of it in which case there may follow once more civil war with hard knocks on both sides and much loss of things temporal wherefore to my learned brothers arguments which i admit to be plausible i will for the present offer no reply except to pray heaven that the occasion may not arise of converting a disputed doctrine into a rule of conduct alas even while he spoke the messenger was speeding swiftly towards us who was to call upon all present to take a side the question is now i hope decided for ever but many men had first to die it was not decided then but three years later when king william cut the knot and with the applause of the nation pulled down his fatherinlaw and mounted the throne himself with his gracious consort we are agreed at last that kings like judges generals and all great officers of state are to hold their offices in good behaviour if they enter into machinations against the liberty of the people and desert the national religion they must descend and let others take their place but before that right could be established for the country streams of blood must first flow while they talked wei mean madam my mother and myselfsat and listened but my mind was full of another subject and i heard but little of what was said noting chiefly the fiery ardour of my father and the careless grace of mr boscorel presently my father who was never easy in the company of mr boscorelso oil and water will not agree to fill a cup in friendshipand besides being anxious to rejoin the society of his books arose and went away and with him my motherhe in his ragged cassock who was a learned scholar she in her plain homespun who was a gentlewoman by birth often had i thought of our poverty with bitterness but now it was with a softened heart that i saw them walk side by side across the lawns for now i understood plainlyand for the first timehow love can strengthen and console my mother was poor but she was not therefore unhappy mr boscorel also rose and went away with humphrey they went to talk of things more interesting to the rector than the doctrine of nonresistance of painting namely and statuary and medals and when we presently walked from the rectory gardens we heard a most gladsome scraping of fiddlestrings within which showed that the worthy man was making the most of humphreys return when sir christopher had taken his pipe of tobacco he fell asleep robin and i walked in the garden and renewed our vows needs must that i should tell him all that i had done or thought since he went away as if the simple thoughts of a country maid should be of interest to a man yet he seemed pleased to question and to listen and presently broke into a rapture swearing that he was in love with an angel young lovers it is feared may fall into grievous sin by permitting themselves these extravagances of speech and thought yet it is hard to keep them sober and besides because every sin in man meeteth with its correspondent in woman if the lover be extravagant the maiden takes pleasure in his extravagance to call a mortal full of imperfections an angel is little short of blasphemy yet i heard it with i confess a secret pleasure we know ourselves and the truth concerning ourselves we do not deceive ourselves as to our imperfections yet we are pleased that our lovers should so speak and think of us as if we were angels indeed robin told me presently ceasing his extravagances for a while that he was certain something violent was on foot to be sure everybody expected so much he said moreover that he believed humphrey had certain knowledge of what was going to happen that before they left the low countries humphrey had been present at a meeting of the exiles in rotterdam where it was well known that lord argyles expedition was resolved upon that he had been much engaged in london after their return and had paid many visits the nature of which he kept secret and that on the road there was not a town and scarcely a village where humphrey had not someone to visit my dear he said humphrey is slight as to stature and strength but he carries a stout heart there is no man more bitter against the king than he and none more able if his counsels were listened to monmouth i am certain purposes to head an expedition into england like that of lord argyle in scotland the history of england hath many instances of such successful attempts king stephen king henry iv king henry vii are all examples if monmouth lands humphrey will join him i am sure and i my dearhe paused and you too robin oh must you too go forth to fight and yet if the duke doth head a rising all the world would follow oh to drive away the papist king and restore our liberty my dear i will do what my grandfather approves if it be my duty to go he will send me forth i had almost forgotten to say that madam took me to her own chamber where she opened a box and pulled out a gold chain very fine this she hung about my neck and bade me sit down and gave me some sound advice reminding me that woman was the weaker vessel and should look to her husband not only to love and cherish her but also to prevent her from falling into certain grievous sins as of temper deceitfulness vanity and the like to which the weaker nature is ever prone many other things she said being a good and virtuous woman but i pass them over after supper we went again into the garden the weather being warm and fine the sun went down but the sky was full of light though it was past nine oclock and time for me to go home and to bed yet we lingered the birds had gone to sleep there was no whisper of the wind the village was in silence and robin was whispering in my ear i rememberi remember the very tones of his voice which was low and sweet i remember the words he said sweet love sweet love how could i live so long without thee i remember my swelling heart and my glowing cheeks oh robinrobin oh poor heart poor maid the memory of this one day was nearly all thou hadst to feed upon for so longso long a time chapter xiv the vision of the basket suddenly we heard footsteps as of those who are running and my fathers voice speaking loud sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart now in the name of heaven cried sir christopher what meaneth this the arm of the lord the deliverance of israel he burst upon us dragging a man with him by the arm in the twilight i could only see at first that it was a broad thickset man but my fathers slender form looked taller as he waved his arms and cried aloud had he been clad in a sheepskin he would have resembled one of those ancient prophets whose words were always in his mouth good friend said sir christopher what meaneth these cries whom have we here then the man with my father stepped forward and took off his hat why i knew him at once though it was ten years since i had seen him last twas my brother barnabynone othercome home again he was now a great strong mana stouter have i never seen though he was somewhat under the middle height broad in the shoulders and thick of chest beside him robin though reasonable in breadth showed like a slender sapling but he had still the same goodnatured face though now much broader it needed no more than the first look to know my brother barnaby again barnaby i cried barnaby hast thou forgotten me i caught one of his great handsnever surely were there bigger hands than barnabys hast thou forgotten me why he said slowlytwas ever a boy slow of speech and of understandingbeliketis sister he kissed my forehead it is sister he said as if he were tasting a cup of ale and was pronouncing on its quality how dost thou sister bravely i hope thou art grown sister i have seen my mother andandshe does bravely too though i left her crying tis their way the happier they be barnaby said sir christopher is it thou scapegrace where hast thoubut first tell us what has happened briefly man in two words sir the duke of monmouth landed the day before yesterday at lyme regis with my lord grey and a company of a hundredof whom i was one the duke had landed then what robin expected had come to pass and my brother barnaby was with the insurgents my heart beat fast the duke of monmouth hath landed sir christopher repeated and sat down again as one who knows not what may be the meaning of the news ay sir the duke hath landed we left holland on the th of may and we made the coast at lyme at daybreak on thursday the th tis now i take it saturday the duke had with him on board ship lord grey mr andrew fletcher of saltoun mr heywood dare of taunton i know the man said sir christopher for an impudent loudtongued fellow perhaps he was sir said barnaby gravely perhaps he was but now how was he was shot on thursday evening by mr fletcher for offering him violence with a cane and is now dead tis a bad beginning go on barnaby the duke had also mr ferguson colonel venner mr chamberlain and others whom i cannot remember first we set mr dare and mr chamberlain ashore at seatown whence they were to carry intelligence of the rising to the dukes friends the duke landed at seven oclock with his company in seven boats first he fell on his knees and prayed aloud then he drew his sword and we all marched after to the marketplace where he raised his flag and caused the declaration to be read here it is your honour he lugged out a copy of the declaration which sir christopher put aside saying that he would read it in the morning then we tossed our hats and shouted a monmouth a monmouth sixty stout young fellows listed on the spot then we divided our forces and began to land the cannonfour pretty pieces as you could wish to seeand the arms of which i doubt if we have enough and the powdertwo hundred and fifty barrels the duke lay on thursday night at the george next day before dawn the country people began flocking in what gentlemen have come in i know not sirmy duty was most of the day on board in the evening i received leave to ride home and indeed sir christopher had orders to carry the dukes declaration to yourself and now we shall be well rid of the king the pope and the devil because said my father solemnlybecause with lies ye have made the hearts of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and what doest thou among this goodly company friend barnaby i am to be a captain in one of the regiments said barnaby grinning with pride though a sailor yet can i fight with the best my colonel is mr holmes and my major mr parsons on board the frigate i was master and navigated her there will be knocks barnaby knocks i doubt by your honours leave i have been where knocks were flying for ten years and i will take my share remembering still the treatment of my father and the poverty of my mother it is rebellion barnabyrebellion why sir oliver cromwell was a rebel and your honour fought in the army of the earl of essexand what was he but a rebel i wondered to hear my brother speak with so much boldness who ten years before had bowed low and pulled his hair in presence of his honour yet sir christopher seemed to take this boldness in good part barnaby he said thou art a stout and proper lad and i doubt not thy couragenay i see it in thy face which hath resolution in it and yet is modest no ruffler or boaster art thou friend barnaby yetyetif rebellion faileven rebellion in a just causethen those who rise lose their lives in vain and the cause is lost until better times this he said as one who speaketh to himself i saw him look upon his grandson the king isa papist he said that is most true a papist should not be suffered to rule this country yet to rise in rebellion have a care lad what if the time be not yet ripe how know we who will join the duke the people are flocking to his standard by thousands said barnaby when i rode away last night the dukes secretaries were writing down their names as fast as they could be entered they were landing the arms and already exercising the recruits and such a spirit they show sir it would do your heart good only once to witness now as i looked at barnaby i became aware that he was not only changed in appearance but that he was also very finely dressednamely in a scarlet coat and a sword with a silken sash with laced ruffles a goldlaced hat a great wig white breeches and a flowered waistcoat in the light of day as i afterwards discovered there were stains of wine visible upon the coat and the ruffles were torn and the waistcoat had marks upon it as of tar one doth not to be sure expect in the sailing master of a frigate the same neatness as in a gallant of saint jamess yet our runaway lad must have prospered what doth the duke intend sir christopher asked him indeed sir i know not tis said by some that he will raise the west country and by some that he will march north into cheshire where he hath many friends and by others that he will march upon london and call upon all good protestants to rise and join him we look to have an army of twenty thousand within a week as for the king it is doubted whether he can raise a paltry five thousand to meet us courage dadhe dared to call his father the rev comfort eykin doctor of divinity dadand he clapped him lustily upon the shoulder thou shalt mount the pulpit yet ay of westminster abbey if it so please you his father paid no heed to this conversation being wrapt in his own thoughts i know not said sir christopher what to think the news is sudden and yetand yet we waste time cried my father stamping his foot oh we waste the time talking what helps it to talk every honest man must now be up and doing why it is a plain duty laid upon us the finger of heaven is visible i say in this out of the very sins of charles stuart hath the instrument for the destruction of his race been forged a plain duty i say as for me i must preach and exhort as for my son who was dead and yet livethhe laid his hand upon barnabys shouldertime was when i prayed that he might become a godly minister of gods word now i perceive clearly that the lord hath ways of his own my son shall fight and i shall preach perhaps he will rise and become another cromwellbarnaby grinned sir said my father turning hotly upon his honour i perceive that thou art lukewarm if the cause be the lords what matter for the chances the issue is in the hands of the lord as for me and my household we will serve the lord yea i freely offer myself and my son and my wife and my daughtereven my tender daughterto the cause of the lord young men and maidens old men and children the voice of the lord calleth nobody made reply my father looked before him as if he saw in the twilight of the summer night a vision of what was to follow his face as he gazed changed his eyes which were fierce and fiery softened his lips smiled then he turned his face and looked upon each of us in turnupon his son and upon his wife and upon me upon robin and upon sir christopher it is indeed he said the will of the lord why what though the end be violent death to me and to all of us ruin and disaster we do but share the afflictions foretold in the vision of the basket of summer fruit what is death what is the loss of earthly things compared with what shall follow to those who obey the voice that calls children let us up and be doing as for me i shall have a season of freedom before i die for twentyfive years have i been muzzled or compelled to whisper and mutter in corners and hidingplaces i have been a dumb dog i whose heart was full and overflowing with the sweet and precious word of god i to whom it is not life but death to sit in silence now i shall deliver my soul before i die sirs the lord hath given to every man a weapon or two with which to fight to me he hath given an eye and a tongue for discerning and proclaiming the word of sacred doctrine i have been muzzleda dumb dog i saythough sometimes i have been forced to climb among the hills and speak to the bending treetops now i shall be free again and i will speak and all the ends of the earth shall hear his eyes gleamed he panted and gasped and waved his arms as for sister dad said barnaby she and mother may bide at home no they shall go with me i offer my wife my son my daughter and myself to the cause of the lord a camp is but a rough place for a woman said barnaby she is offered she is dedicated she shall go with us i know not what was in his mind or why he wished that i should go with him unless it was a desire to give everything that he hadto hold back nothingto the lord therefore he would give his children as well as himself as for me my heart glowed to think that i was even worthy to join in such a cause what could a woman do but that i should find out robin i whispered tis religion calls if i am to be among the followers of the duke thou wilt not remain behind childit was my mother who whispered to me i had not seen her beforechild let us obey him perhaps it will be better for him if we are at his side and there is barnaby but we must not be in their way we shall find a place to sit aside and wait alas that my son hath returned to us only to go fighting we will go with them daughter we should be better without women said barnaby grumbling i would as lief have a woman on shipboard as in a camp to be sure if dad has set his heart upon itand then he will not stay long in camp where the cursing of the men is already loud enough to scare a preacher out of his cassock dad i saybut my father was fallen again into a kind of rapture and heard nothing when doth the duke begin his march he said suddenly i know not but we shall find him never fear i must have speech with him at the earliest possible time hours are precious and we waste themwe waste them well sir it is bedtime tomorrow we can ride unless because it is the sabbath you would choose to wait till monday and as to the women by your leave it is madness to bring them to a camp wait till monday art thou mad barnaby art thou mad why i have things to tell the duke shall we waste eight precious hours up let us ride all night tomorrow is the sabbath and i will preach yeai will preach my soul longethyea even it fainteth for the courts of the lord quick quick let us mount and ride all night at this moment humphrey joined us lads said sir christopher you are fresh from holland knew you aught of this sir said humphrey i confess that i have already told dr eykin what to expect i knew that the duke was coming robin did not know because i would not drag him into the conspiracy i knew that the duke was coming and that without delay i have myself had speech in amsterdam with his grace who comes to restore the protestant religion and to give freedom of worship to all good protestant people his friends have promises of support everywhere indeed sir i think that the expedition is well planned and is certain of support success is in the hands of the lord but we do not expect that there will be any serious opposition with submission sir i am under promise to join the duke i came over in advance to warn his friends as i rode from london of his approach thousands are waiting in readiness for him but sir of all this i repeat robin knew nothing i have been for three months in the counsels of those who desire to drive forth the popish king but robin have i kept in the dark humphrey said robin reproachfully am not i also a protestant chapter xv a night and morning when i read of men possessed by some spiritthat is to say compelled to go hither and thither where but for the spirit they would not go and to say things which they would not otherwise have saidi think of our midnight ride to lyme and of my father there and of the three weeks madness which followed it was some spiritwhether of good or evil i cannot say and i dare not so much as to questionwhich seized him that he hurried away to join the duke on the first news of his landing without counting the cost or weighing the chances is easy to be understood like humphrey he was led by his knowledge of the great numbers who hated the catholic religion to believe that they like himself would rise with one accord he also remembered the successful rebellion against the first charles and expected nothing less than a repetition of that success this i know was what the exiles in holland thought and believed the duke they said was the darling of the people he was the protestant champion who would not press forward when he should draw the sword but what other manwhat man in his sober senses would have dragged his wife and daughter with him to the godless riot of a camp perhaps he wanted them to share his triumph to listen while he moved the soldiers as that ancient hermit peter moved the people to the holy wars but i know not he said that i was to be like jephthahs daughter consecrated to the cause of the lord and what he meant by that i never understood he was so eager to start upon the journey that he would not wait a moment the horses must be saddled we must mount and away mark that they were sir christophers horses which we borrowed this also was noted afterwards for the ruin of that good old man with other particulars as that monmouths declaration was found in the house barnaby brought it one of monmouths captains barnaby eykin by name had ridden from lyme to bradford in order to see him he was a friend of the preacher dr eykin he was grandfather to one of the rebels and granduncle to another with many other things but these were enough surely surely friend said sir christopher thou wilt not take wife and daughter they cannot help the cause they have no place in a camp young men and maidens one with another quick we waste the time and to ride all night consider manall night long what is a night they will have all eternity for rest he hath set his heart upon it said my mother let us goa nights weariness will not do much harm let us go sir christopher without further parley go then in the name of god said the old man child give me a kiss he took me in his arms and kissed me on the forehead thou art then he said tenderly devoted to the protestant cause why thou art already promised to a protestant since this morning forget not that promise child humphrey and barnaby will protect theeand sir cried robin quickly by your leave i alone have the right to go with her and to protect her nay robin i said stay here until sir christopher himself bids thee go that will perhaps be very soon remember thy promise we did not know robin an hour ago that the promise would be claimed so soon robinfor he murmuredi charge thee remain at home until i promise thee sweetheart but he hung his head and looked ashamed sir christopher holding my hand stepped forth upon the grass and looked upwards into the clear sky where in the transparent twilight we could see a few stars twinkling this friend eykinthis humphrey he said gravely is a solemn night for all no more fateful night hath ever fallen upon any of us no not that day when i joined hampdens new regiment and followed with the army of lord essex granted that we have a righteous cause we know not that our leader hath in him the root of the matter to rise against the king is a most weighty matterfatal if it fail a dangerous precedent if it succeed civil war is of all wars the most grievous to fight under a leader who doth not live after the laws of god is methinks most dangerous the duke hath lit a torch which will spread flames everywhere it is the voice of the lord which calleth us my father interrupted tomorrow i shall speak again to gods elect sir said humphrey very seriously i pray you think not that this enterprise hath been rashly entered upon nor that we depend upon the judgment of the duke alone it is most unhappily true that his life is sinful and so is that of lord grey who hath deserted his own lawful wife for her sister but those who have pushed on the enterprise consider that the duke is at least a true protestant they have moreover received solid assurances of support from every quarter you have been kept in the dark from the beginning at my own earnest request because though i knew full well your opinion i would not trouble your peace or endanger your person suffer us then to depart and for yourself do nothing and keepoh sir i entreat youkeep robin at home until our success leaves no room for doubt go then go said sir christopher i have grievous misgivings that all is not well but go and heaven bless the cause robin kissed me whispering that he would follow and that before many days and so we mounted and rode forth in such hot haste did we depart that we took with us no change of raiment or any provision for the journey at all save that barnaby who as i afterwards found never forgot the provisions found time to get together a small parcel of bread and meat and a flask of canary with which to refresh our spirits later on we even rode away without any money my father rode one horse and my mother sat behind him then i followed barnaby marching manfully beside me and humphrey rode last the ways are rough so that those who ride even by daylight go but slowly and we riding between high hedges went much too slowly for my father who if he spoke at all cried out impatiently quicker quicker we lose the time he sat bending over the horses head with rounded shoulders his feet sticking out on either side his long white hair and his ragged cassock floating in the wind in his left hand he carried his bible as a soldier carries his sword on his head he wore the black silk cap in which he daily sat at work he was praying and meditating he was preparing the sermon which he would deliver in the morning barnaby plodded on beside me night or day made no difference to him he slept when he could and worked when he must sailors keep their watch day and night without any difference it was sir christopher that i came after he told me presently mr darewho hath since been killed by mr fletchertold the duke that if sir christopher challis would only come into camp old as he is the country gentlemen of his opinions would follow to a man so respected is he well he will not but we have his grandnephew humphrey and if i mistake not we shall have his grandsonif kisses mean anything so robin is thy sweetheart sister thou art a lucky girl and we shall have dad to preach to us well i know not what will happen but some will be knocked o the head and if dad goes in the way of knocksbut whatever happens he will get his tongue againand so he will be happy as for preaching he went on speaking with due pauses because there was no hurry in these dark lanes and he was never one of those whose words flow easily if he thinks to preach daily as they say was done in cromwells time i doubt if he will find many to listen for by the look of the fellows who are crowding into camp they will love the clinking of the can better than the division of the text but if he cause his friends to join he will be welcomed and for devoting his wife and daughter to the cause that sister with submission is rank nonsense and the sooner you get out of the camp if you must go there the better women aboard ship are bad enough but in camp they are the very devil barnaby speak not lightly of the evil one where shall we bestow you when the fighting comes well it shall be in some safe place oh barnaby will there be fighting good lack child what else will there be as the walls of jericho fell down at the blast of the trumpet so the kings armies will be dispersed at the approach of the lords soldiers that was a vast long time ago sister there is now no such trumpetwork employed in war and no priests on the march but plenty of fighting to be done before anything is accomplished but have no fear the country is rising they are sick at heart already of a popish king i say not that it will be easy work but it can be done and it will be done before we all sit down again and what will happen when it is done truly i know not when one king is sent apacking they must needs put up another i suppose my father shall have the biggest church in the country to preach in humphrey shall be made physician to the new kingnothing less you shall marry robin and he shall be made a duke or a lord at least and i shall have command of the biggest ship in the kings navy and go to fight the spaniards or to trade for negroes on the guinea coast but suppose the duke should be defeated well sister if he is defeated it will go hard with all of us those who are caught will be stabbed with a bridport dagger as they say ask not such a question as well ask a sailor what will happen to him if his ship is cast away some may escape in boats and some by swimming and some are drowned and some are cast upon savage shores every man must take his chance never again ask such a question nevertheless i fear my father will get his neck as far in the noose as i myself but remember sister alice do you and my mother keep snug let others carry on the rebellion do you keep snug for dye see a man takes his chance and if there should happen as there may a defeat and the rout of these country lads i could een scud by myself before the gale and maybe get to a seaport and so aboard and away while the chase was hot but for a woman keep snug i say therefore the night happily was clear and fine a slight breeze was blowing from the northwest which made one shiver yet it was not too cold i heard the screechowl once or twice which caused me to tremble more than the cold the road when we left the highway which is not often mended in these parts became a narrow lane full of holes and deep ruts or else a track across open country but barnaby knew the way it was about ten of the clock when we began our journey and it was six in the morning when we finished it i suppose there are few women who can boast of having taken so long a ride and in the night yet strange to say i felt no desire to sleep nor was i wearied with the jogging of the horse but was sustained by something of the spirit of my father a wonderful thing it seemed to me that a simple country maid such as myself should help in putting down the catholic king women there have been who have played great parts in historyjael deborah judith and esther for example but that i should be called since then i have discovered that i was not called this indeed seemed truly wonderful then i was going forth to witness the array of a gallant army about to fight for freedom and for religion just as they were arrayed forty years before when sir christopher was a young man and rode among them my brother this stout barnaby was one of them my father was one of them humphrey was one of them and in a little while i was very sure because robin would feel no peace of mind if i was with the insurgents and he was still at home my lover would be with them too and i pictured to myself a holy and serious camp filled with godly sober soldiers listening to sermons and reading the bible going forth to battle with hymns upon their lips and withal so valiant that at their very first onset the battalions of the king would be shattered alas anyone may guess the foolish thoughts of a girl who had no knowledge of the world nor any experience yet all my life i had been taught that resistance was at times a sacred duty and that the divine right of the socalled lords anointed was a vain superstition so far therefore was i better prepared than most women for the work in hand when we rode through sherborne all the folk were abed and the streets were empty from sherborne our way lay through yetminster and evershott to beaminster where we watered and rested the horses and took some of barnabys provisions the country through which we rode was full of memories of the last great war the castle of sherborne was twice besieged once by lord bedford when the marquis of hertford held it for the king that siege was raised but it was afterwards taken by fairfax with its garrison of six hundred soldiers and was then destroyed so that it is now a heap of ruins and as for beaminster the town hath never recovered from the great fire when prince maurice held it and it is still half in ruins though the ivy hath grown over the blackened walls of the burned houses the last great war of which i had heard so much and now perhaps we were about to begin another it was two oclock in the morning when we dismounted at beaminster my mother sat down upon a bench and fell instantly asleep my father walked up and down impatiently as grudging every minute barnaby for his part made a leisurely and comfortable meal eating his bread and meatof which i had someand drinking his canary with relish as if we were on a journey of pleasure and there was plenty of time for leisurely feeding presently he arose with a sigh the food and wine being all gone and said that the horses being now rested we might proceed so he lifted my mother into her seat and we went on with the journey the day now breaking the way i say was never tedious to me for i was sustained by the novelty and the strangeness of the thing although i had a thousand things to ask barnaby it must be confessed that for one who had travelled so far he had marvellous little to tell i daresay that the deck and cabins of a ship are much the same whether she be on the spanish main or in the bristol channel and sailors even in port are never an observant race except of weather and so forth it was strange however only to look upon him and to mark how stout a man he was grown and how strong and yet how he still spoke like the old barnaby so goodnatured and so dull with his book who was daily flogged for his latin grammar and bore no malice but prepared himself to enjoy the present when the flogging was over and not to anticipate the certain repetition of the flogging on the morrow he spoke in the same slow way as if speech were a thing too precious to be poured out quickly and there was always sense in what he said barnaby was only stupid in the matter of syntax though he gave me not such answers as i could have wished however he confessed little by little something of his history and adventures when he ran away it was as we thought to the port of bristol where he presently found a berth as cabinboy on board a west indiaman in this truly enviable posteverybody on board has a cuff or a kick or a ropesend for the boyhe continued for some time but said barnaby you are not to think that the ropesend was half so bad as my fathers rod nor the captains oath so bad as my fathers rebuke nor the rough work and hard fare so bad as the latin syntax being so strong and a hearty willing lad to boot he was quickly promoted to be an able seaman when there were no more ropesendings for him then having an ambition above his station and not liking his rude and ignorant companions of the foksle which is the forepart of a ship where the common sailors sleep and eat and being so fortunate as to win the good graces of the supercargo first and of the captain next he applied his leisure time when he had any leisure to the method of taking observations of calculating longitudes and latitudes his knowledge of arithmetic having fortunately stuck in his mind longer than that of latin these things i understand are of the greatest use to a sailor and necessary to an officer armed with this knowledge and the recommendation of his superiors barnaby was promoted from before the mast and became what they call a mate and so rose by degrees until he was at last second captain but by this time he had made many voyages to the west indies to new york and baltimore and to the west coast of africa in the service of his owners and i daresay had procured much wealth for them though but little for himself and being at rotterdam upon his owners business he was easily persuadedbeing always a stout protestant and desirous to strike a blow in revenge for the ejection of his fatherto engage as sailing master on board the frigate which brought over the duke of monmouth and his company and then to join him on his landing this was the sum of what he had to tell me he had seen many strange people wonderful things and monsters of the deep indians whom the cruelty and avarice of the spaniards have wellnigh destroyed the sugar plantations in the islands negro slaves negroes free in their own country sharks and calamaries of which i had read and heardhe had seen all these things and still remained in his mind i mean as if he had seen nothing so wonderfully made are some men that whatever they see they are in no way moved i say then that barnaby answered my questions as we rode along briefly and as if such matters troubled him not when i asked him for example how the poor miserable slaves liked being captured and sold and put on board ship crowded together for so long a voyage barnaby replied that he did not know his business being to buy them and carry them across the water and if they rebelled on board ship to shoot them down or flog them and when they got to jamaica to sell them where if they would not work they would be flogged until they came to a better mind if a man was born a negro what else he asked could he expect there was one question which i greatly desired to ask him but dared not it concerned the welfare of his soul presently however barnaby answered that question before i put it sister he said my mothers constant affliction concerning me before i ran away was as to the salvation of my soul and truly that formerly seemed to me so difficult a thing to compass like navigation to an unknown port over an unknown sea set everywhere with hidden rocks and liable to sudden gusts that i could not understand how a plain man could ever succeed in it wherefore it comforted me mightily after i got to sea to learn on good authority that there is another way which compared with my fathers is light and easy in short sister though he knows it not there is one religion for landsfolk and another for sailorfolk a sailor everybody knows cannot get so much as a sail bent without cursing and swearingthis which is desperately wicked ashore counts for nothing at all afloat and so with many other things and the long and the short of it is that if a sailor does his duty fights his ship like a man is true to his owners and faithful to his messmates it matters not one straw whether he hath daily sworn great oaths drunk himself whenever he went ashore as helpless as a log and kissed a pretty girl whenever his good luck gave him the chancewhich does indeed seldom come to most sailorshe added this with a deep sighi say sister that for such a sailor when his ship goes down with him or when he gets a grapeshot through his vitals or when he dies of fever as happens often enough in the hot climates there is no question as to the safety of his soul but he goes straight to heaven what he is ordered to do when he gets there said barnaby i cannot say but it will be something i doubt not that a sailor will like to do no catechism or latin syntax wherefore sister you can set my mothers heartpoor soulquite at rest on this important matter you can tell her that you have conversed with me and that i have that very same inward assurance of which my father speaks so much and at such length the very same assurance it istell her that and beg her to ask me no questions upon the matter well barnaby but art thou sure it is a heavenly comfort he replied before i had time to finish to have such an assurance for why a man that hath it doth never more trouble himself about what shall happen to him after he is dead therefore he goes about his duty with an easy mind and so sister no more upon this head if you love me and desire peace of mind for my mother so nothing more was said upon that subject then or afterwards a sailor to be exempted by right of his calling from the religion of the landsman tis a strange and dangerous doctrine but if all sailors believe it yet how can it be this question i confess is too high for me and as for my mother i gave her barnabys message begging her at the same time not to question him further and she sighed but obeyed presently barnaby asked me if we had any money i had none and i knew that my mother could have but little of course my father never had any i doubt if he had possessed a single penny since his ejection well said barnaby i thought to give my money to mother but i now perceive that if she has it she will give it to dad and if he has it he will give it all to the duke for the causewherefore sister do you take it and keep it not for me but to be expended as seemeth you best he lugged out of his pocket a heavy bag here is all the money i have saved in ten years nayi am not as some sailors one that cannot keep a penny in purse but must needs fling all away here are two hundred and fifty gold pieces take them alice hang the bag round thy neck and never part with it day or night and say nothing about the money either to mother or to dad for he will assuredly do with it as i have said a time may come when thou wilt want it two hundred and fifty gold pieces was it possible that barnaby could be so rich i took the bag and hung it round my waistnot my neckby the string which he had tied above the neck and as it was covered by my mantle nobody ever suspected that i had this treasure in the end as you shall hear it seemed to be useful it was now broad daylight and the sun was up as we drew near bridport there stood a man in the road armed with a halbert whither go ye good people he asked what is your business friend said barnaby flourishing his oaken staff we ride upon our own business stand aside or thou mayest henceforth have no more business to do upon this earth ride on thenride on he replied standing aside with great meekness this was one of the guards whom they posted everywhere upon the roads in order to stop the people who were flocking to the camp in this way many were sent back and many were arrested on their way to join monmouth now as we drew near to bridport the time being about four oclock we heard the firing of guns and a great shouting they have begun the fighting said barnaby i knew it would not be long acoming it was in fact the first engagement when the dorsetshire militia were driven out of bridport by the dukes troops and there would have been a signal victory at the very outset but for the cowardice of lord grey who ran away with the horse well it was a strange and a wonderful thing to think that close at hand were men killing each other on the sabbath yea and some lying wounded on the roads and that civil war had again begun let us push on said humphrey out of the way of these troops they are but country lads all of them if they retreat they will run and if they run they will be seized with a panic and will run all the way back to lyme trampling on everything that is in the road this was sound advice which we followed taking an upper track which brought us into the high road a mile or so nearer charmouth i do not think there can be anywhere a finer road than that which runs from charmouth to lyme it runneth over high hills sometimes above the sea which rolls far below and sometimes above a great level inland plain the name of which i have forgotten the highest of the hills is called golden cap the reason why was plainly shown this morning when the sky was clear and the sun was shining from the southeast full upon this tall pico when we got into this road we found it full of young fellows lusty and wellconditioned all marching running walking shouting and singing on their way to join monmouth some were adorned with flowers some wore the blue favour of the duke some had cockades in their hats and some again were armed with musket or with sword some carried pikes some knives tied on to long poles some had nothing but thick cudgels which they brandished valiantly at sight of these brave fellows my father lifted his head and waved his hand crying a monmouth a monmouth follow me brave lads just as if he had been a captain encouraging his men to charge the church of lyme standeth high upon the cliff which faces the sea it is on the eastern side of the town and before you get to the church on the way from charmouth there is a broad field also on the edge of the cliff it was this field that was the first camp of monmouths men there were no tents for the men to lie in but there were waggons filled i suppose with munitions of war there were booths where things were sold such as hot sausages fried over a charcoal fire fried fish lobsters and periwinkles cold bacon and pork bread cheese and such like and barrels of beer and cider on wooden trestles the men were haggling for the food and drink and already one or two seemed fuddled some were exercising in the use of arms some were dancing and some singing and no thought or respect paid at all to the sabbath oh was this the pious and godly camp which i had expected sister said barnaby this is a godly and religious place to which the wisdom of dad hath brought thee perhaps he meaneth thee to lie in the open like the lads where is the duke asked my father looking wrathfully at these revellers and sabbathbreakers the duke lies at the george inn said barnaby i will show the way in the blue parlour of the george the duke was at that time holding a council there were different reports as to the bridport affair already it was said that lord grey was unfit to lead the horse having been the first to run away and some said that the militia were driven out of the town in a panic and some that they made a stand and that our men had fled i know not what was the truth and now it matters little except that the first action of our men brought them little honour when the council was finished the duke sent word that he would receive dr challis that was humphrey and dr comfort eykin so they were introduced to the presence of his grace and first my fatheras humphrey told mefell into a kind of ecstasy praising god for the landing of the duke and foretelling such speedy victory as would lay the enemies of the country at his feet he then drew forth a roll of paper in which he had set down for the information of the duke the estimated number of the disaffected in every town of the south and west of england with the names of such as could be trusted not only to risk their own bodies and estates in the cause but would stir up and encourage their friends there were so many on these lists that the dukes eyes brightened as he read them sir he said if these reports can be depended upon we are indeed made men what is your opinion dr challis my opinion sir is that these are the names of friends and wellwishers if they see your grace well supported at the outset they will flock in if not many of them will stand aloof will sir christopher join me asked the duke no sir he is now seventyfive years of age the duke turned away presently he returned to the lists and asked many more questions sir said my father at length i have given you the names of all that i know who are well affected to the protestant cause they are those who have remained faithful to the ejected ministers many a time have i secretly preached to them one thing is wanting the assurance that your grace will bestow upon us liberty of conscience and freedom of worship else will not one of them move hand or foot why said the duke for what other purpose am i come assure them good friend assure them in my name make the most solemn pledge that is in your power and in mine in that case sir said my father i will at once write letters with my own hand to the brethren everywhere there are many honest country lads who will carry the letters by ways where they are not likely to be arrested and searched and now sir i pray your leave to preach to these your soldiers they are at present drinking swearing and breaking the sabbath the campaign which should be begun with prayer and humiliation for the sins of the country hath been begun with many deadly sins with merriment and with fooling suffer me then to preach to them preach by all means said the duke you shall have the parish church i fear sir that my business will not suffer me to have the edification of your sermon but i hope that it will tend to the soberness and earnestness of my men forgive them sir for their lightness of heart they are for the most part young encourage them by promises rather than by rebuke and so sir for this occasion farewell in this way my father obtained the wish of his heart and preached once more in a church before the people who were the young soldiers of monmouths army i did not hear that sermon because i was asleep it was in tones of thunder that my father preached to them he spoke of the old war and the brave deeds that their fathers had done under cromwell theirs was the victory now as then the victory should be theirs if they carried the spirit of faithfulness into battle he warned them of their sins sparing none and in the end he concluded with such a denunciation of the king as made all who heard it and had been taught to regard the kings majesty as sacred open their mouths and gape upon each other for then for the first time they truly understood what it was that they were engaged to do while my father waited to see the duke barnaby went about looking for a lodging the town is small and the houses were all filled but he presently found a cottage call it rather a hut on the shore beside the cobb where on promise of an extravagant payment the fishermans wife consented to give up her bed to my mother and myself before the bargain was concluded i had laid myself down upon it and was sound asleep so i slept the whole day though outside there was such a trampling on the beach such a landing of stores and creaking of chains as might have awakened the seven sleepers but me nothing could awaken in the evening i woke up refreshed my mother was already awake but for weariness could not move out of her chair the good woman of the cottage a kindly soul brought me rough food of some kind with a drink of waterthe army had drunk up all the milk eaten all the cheese the butter the eggs and the pork beef and mutton in the place and then humphrey came and asked if i would go with him into the town to see the soldiers so i went and glad i was to see the sight but lord to think that it was the sabbath evening for the main street of lyme was full of men swaggering with long swords at their sides and some with spursfeathers in their hats and pistols stuck in their beltsall were talking loud as i am told is the custom in a camp of soldiers outside the george there was a barrel on a stand and vendors and drawers ran about with cans fetching and carrying the liquor for which the men continually called then at the door of the george there appeared the duke himself with his following of gentlemen all rose and huzzaed while the duke came down the steps and turned towards the camp outside the town i saw his face very well as he passed indeed i saw him many times afterwards but i declare that my heart sank when first i gazed upon him as he stood upon the steps of the george inn for on his face plain to read was the sadness of coming ruin i say i knew from that moment what would be his end nay i am no prophetess nor am i a witch to know beforehand the counsels of the almighty yet the lord hath permitted by certain signs the future to become apparent to those who know how to read them in the duke of monmouth the signs were a restless and uneasy eye an air of preoccupation a trembling mouth and a hesitating manner there was in him nothing of the confidence of one who knows that fortune is about to smile upon him this i say was my first thought about the duke and the first thought is prophecy there sat beside the benches a secretary or clerk who took down the names of recruits the duke stopped and looked on a young man in a sober suit of brown in appearance different from the country lads was giving in his name daniel foe your grace said the clerk looking up he is from london from london the duke repeated i have many friends in london i expect them shortly thou art a worthy lad and deservest encouragement so he passed on his way chapter xvi on the march at daybreak next morning the drums began to beat and the trumpets began to blow and after breakfast the newlyraised army marched out in such order as was possible i have not to write a history of this rebellion which hath already been done by able hands i speak only of what i saw and the things with which i was concerned first then it is true that the whole country was swiftly put into a ferment by the dukes landing and had those who planned the expedition provided a proper supply of arms the army would have quickly mustered men all resolute and capable of meeting any force that the king could have raised nay it would have grown and swelled as it moved but there were never enough arms from the outset everything at first promised well for the duke but there were not arms for the half of those who came in the spirit of the devon and somerset militia was lukewarm they ran at bridport at axminster and at chard nay some of them even deserted to join the duke there were thousands scattered about the countrythose namely who still held to the doctrines of the persecuted ministers and those who abhorred the catholic religionwho wished well and would have joinedhumphrey knew wellwishers by the thousand whose names were on the lists in hollandbut how could they join when the army was so illfound and this was the principal reason i have been assured why the country gentlemen with their following did not come in at firstbecause there were no arms how can soldiers fight when they have no arms how could the duke have been suffered to begin with so scanty a preparation of arms afterwards when monmouth proclaimed himself king there were perhaps other reasons why the wellwishers held aloof some of them certainly who were known to be friends of the duke among them our old friend mr prideaux of ford abbey were arrested and thrown into prison while many thousands who were flocking to the standard were either turned back upon the road or seized and thrown into prison as for the quality of the troops which formed the army i know nothing except that at sedgemoor they continued to fight valiantly after their leaders had fled they were raw troopsmere country ladsand their officers were for the most part simple tradesmen who had no knowledge of the art of war dare the younger was a goldsmith captain perrot was a dyer captain hucker a maker of serge and so on with all of them it was unfortunate that mr andrew fletcher of saltoun should have killed mr dare the elder on the first day because as everybody agrees the former was the most experienced soldier in the whole army the route proposed by the duke was known to everybody he intended to march through taunton bridgwater and bristol to gloucester where he thought he would be joined by a new army raised by his friends in cheshire he also reckoned on receiving adherents everywhere on the road and on easily defeating any force that the king should be able to send against him how he fared in that notable scheme is common history long before the army was ready to march humphrey came to advise with us first of all he endeavoured to have speech with my father but in vain henceforth my father seemed to have no thought of his wife and daughter humphrey therefore advised us to go home as for your alleged dedication to the cause he said i think that he hath already forgotten it seeing that it means nothing and that your presence with us cannot help go home then madam and let alice persuade robin to stay at home in order to take care of you nay said my mother that may we not do i must obey my husband who commanded us to follow him whither he goeth thither also i will follow finding that she was resolute upon this point humphrey told us that the duke would certainly march upon taunton where more than half of the town were his friends he therefore advised that we should ride to that placenot following the army but going across the country most of which is a very wild and desolate part where we should be in no danger except from gipsies and such wild people robbers and rogues truly but now making the most of the disturbed state of the country and running about the roads plundering and thieving but he said he would himself provide us with a guide one who knew the way and a good stout fellow armed with a cudgel at least to this my mother agreed fearing to anger her husband if she should disturb him at his work humphrey had little trouble in finding the guide for us he was an honest lad from a place called holford in the quantock hills who finding that there were no arms for him was going home again unhappily when we got to taunton he was persuadedpartly by me alasto remain he joined barnabys company and was either killed at sedgemoor or was one of those hanged at weston zoyland or bridgwater for he was no more heard of this business settled we went up to the churchyard in order to see the march of the army out of camp and a brave show the gallant soldiers made first rode colonel wade with the vanguard after them with a due interval rode the greater part of the horse already three hundred strong under lord grey of wark among them was the company sent by mr speke of white lackington forty very stout fellows well armed and mounted on carthorses the main army was composed of four regiments the first was the blue regiment or the dukes own whose colonel was the aforesaid wade they formed the van and were seven hundred strong the others were the white commanded by colonel foukes the green by colonel holmes and the yellow by colonel fox all these regiments were fully armed the men wearing favours or rosettes in their hats and on their arms of the colour from which their regiment was named the duke himself who rode a great white horse was surrounded by a small bodyguard of gentlemen afterwards they became a company of forty richly dressed and well mounted with him were carried the colours embroidered with the words pro religione et libertate this was the second time that i had seen the duke and again i felt at sight of his face the foreknowledge of coming woe on such an occasion the chief should show a gallant mien and a face of cheerful hope the duke however looked gloomy and hung his head truly it seemed to me as if no force could dare so much as to meet this great and invincible army and certainly there could nowhere be gathered together a more stalwart set of soldiers nearly all young men and full of spirit they shouted and sang as they marched presently there passed us my brother barnaby with his company of the green regiment it was easy to perceive by the handling of his arms and by his bearing that he was accustomed to act with others and already he had so begun to instruct his men that they set an example to the rest both in their orderliness of march and the carriage of their weapons after the main army they carried the ordnancefour small cannonand the ammunition in waggons with guards and horsemen lastly there rode those who do not fight yet belong to the army these were the chaplain to the army dr hooke a grave clergyman of the church of england mr ferguson the dukes private chaplain a fiery person of whom many hard things have been said which here concern us not and my father who thus rode openly with the other two in order that the nonconformists might be encouraged by his presence as an equal with the two chaplains he was clad in a new cassock obtained i know not whence he sat upright in the saddle a bible in his hand his long white locks lying on his shoulders like a perruque but more venerable than any wig his thin face was flushed with the joy of coming victory and his eyes flashed fire if all the men had shown such a spirit the army would have overrun the whole country the four surgeonsdr temple dr gaylard dr oliver and humphreyfollowed all splendid in black velvet and great periwigs lastly marched the rearguard and after the army there followed such a motley crew as no one can conceive there were gipsies with their black tents and carts ready to rob and plunder there were tinkers who are nothing better than gipsies and are even said to speak their language there were men with casks on wheels filled with beer or cider there were carts carrying bread cakes biscuits and such things as one can buy in a booth or at a fair there were women of bold and impudent looks singing as they walked there were besides whole troops of country lads some of them mere boys running and strutting along in hopes to receive arms and to take a place in the regiments presently they were all gone and lyme was quit of them what became in the end of all the rabble rout which followed the army i know not one thing was certain the godly disposition the pious singing of psalms and the devout exposition of the word which i had looked for in the army were not anywhere apparent rather there was evident a tumultuous joy as of schoolboys out for a holidaycertainly no schoolboys could have made more noise or showed greater happiness in their faces among them however there were some men of middle age whose faces showed a different temper but these were rare lord help them said our friendly fisherwoman who stood with us there will be hard knocks before those fine fellows go home again they fight on the lords side said my mother therefore they may be killed but they will not wholly perish as for the hard knocks they began without any delay and on that very morning for at axminster they encountered the somerset and devon militia who thought to join their forces but were speedily put to flight by the rebelsa victory which greatly encouraged them it hath been maliciously said i have heard that we followed the armyas if we were two sutler womenon foot i suppose tramping in the dust singing ribald songs like those poor creatures whom we saw marching out of lyme you have heard how we agreed to follow humphreys advice well we left lyme very early the next morning our fisherwoman having now become very friendly and loth to let us go and rode out our guide poor lad his death lies heavy on my soul yet i meant the best and truly he was on the side of the lord marching beside us armed with a stout bludgeon we kept the main road which was very quiet at this early hour as far as axminster where we left it and after crossing the river by a ford or wash we engaged upon a track or path which led along the banks of a little stream for a mile or twoas far as the village of chardstock here we made no halt but leaving it behind we struck into a most wild and mountainous country full of old forests and great bare places it is called the forest of neroche and is said to shelter numbers of gipsies and vagabonds and to have in it some of those wild people who live in the hills and woods of somerset and do no work except to gather the dry broom and tie it up and sell it and so live hard and hungry lives but know not any master these are reported to be a harmless people but the gipsies are dangerous because they are ready to rob and even murder i thought of barnabys bag of gold tied about my waist and trembled however we met with none of them on our journey because just then they were all running after monmouths army there was no path over the hills by the way we took but our guide knew the country so well that he needed none pointing out all the hills with a kind of pride as if they belonged to him and telling us the name of every one but these i have long since forgotten the country however i can never forget because it is so wild and beautiful one place i remember it is a very strange and wonderful place the ground here is high and at one place it rises to a kind of point or hill falling away on all sides but one in steep sides up which a man could climb with difficulty round the hill have been cut deep trenches no doubt to fortify and strengthen the place which is by nature a fortress and on the side where the ground is level there are raised very high earthworks or walls with trenches beyond most wonderful to consider within this double or triple circle of trenches and earthen walls there stands a farmhouse solitary among the hills here we found an ancient dame who told us that the place had been a castle of the romans yet it was not like unto the castle at sherborne which oliver cromwell slighted after he took the place blowing it up with gunpowder nor was it like the castle at taunton which i afterwards saw for there were no stone walls or towers or any appearance of stone work to be sure sherborne castle was not built by the romans then this old dame showed us bits of pots dug up within the walls and rusty arrow heads and green copper things which she said were buckles to fasten their clothes withal she gave us a cup of cider while we rested and took here our dinner of cold bacon and bread which we had brought with us after dinner our guide took us to the hill called the beacon and showed us the broad vale of taunton spread out below us like unto a map with its farmhouses fields orchards and churches and all for monmouth he said surely there cannot be a richer more fertile or more lovely place in all england than the vale of taunton when we had rested and enjoyed this enchanting prospect we remounted our nags and descended by a gradual incline into the plain below humphrey had provided us with a letter commendatory he who knew the names of all who were well affected assured us that the lady to whom the letter was addressed miss susan blake by name was one of the most forward in the protestant cause she was well known and much respected and she kept a school for young gentlewomen where many children of the nonconformist gentry were educated he instructed us to proceed directly to her house and to ask her to procure for us a decent and safe lodging he could not have given us a letter to any better person it was late in the afternoon when we rode into taunton the streets were full of people running about talking now in groups and now by twos and threes now shouting and now whispering while we rode along the street a man ran bawling great news great news monmouth is upon us with twice ten thousand men it seems that they had only that day learned of the defeat of the militia by the rebels a company of the somerset militia were in the town under colonel luttrell in order to keep down the people taunton is as everybody knows a most rich prosperous and populous town i had never before seen so many houses and so many people gathered together why if the men of taunton declared for the duke his cause one felt sure was already won for there is nowhere as i could not fail to know a greater stronghold of dissent than this town except london and none where the nonconformists have more injuries to remember only two years before this their meetinghouses had been broken into and their pulpits and pews brought out and burned and they were forced against their conscience to worship in the parish church we easily found miss blakes house and giving our horses to the guide we presented her with our letter she was a young woman somewhat below the common stature quick of speech her face and eyes full of vivacity and about thirty years of age but when she had read the letter and understood who we were and whence we came she first made a deep reverence to my mother and then she took my hands and kissed me madam she said believe me my poor house will be honoured indeed by the presence of the wife and the daughter of the godly dr comfort eykin pray pray go no further i have a room that is at your disposal go thither madam i beg and rest after your journey the wife of dr comfort eykin tis indeed an honour and so with the kindest words she led us upstairs and gave us a room with a bed in it and caused water for washing to be brought and presently went out with me to buy certain things needful for us who were indeed somewhat rustical in our dress in order that we might present the appearance of gentlewomenthanks to barnabys heavy purse i could get them without troubling my mothers careful mind about the cost she then gave us supper and told us all the news the king she said was horribly afraid and it was rumoured that the priests had all been sent away to france the taunton people were resolved to give the duke a brave reception all over the country there was no doubt men would rally by thousands she was in a rapture of joy and gratitude supper over she took us to her schoolroom and hereoh the pretty sighther schoolgirls were engaged in working and embroidering flags for the dukes army i know not she said whether his grace will condescend to receive them but it is all we women can do poor wretch she afterwards suffered the full penalty for her zeal all that evening we heard the noise of men running about the town with the clanking of weapons and the commands of officers but we knew not what had happened lo in the morning the glad tidings that the militia had left the town nor was that all for at daybreak the people began to assemble and there being none to stay them broke into the great church of st marys and took possession of the arms that had been deposited for safety in the tower they also opened the prison and set free a worthy nonconformist divine named vincent all the morning the mob ran about the streets shouting a monmouth a monmouth the magistrates and royalists not daring so much as to show their faces and there was nothing talked of but the overthrow of the king and the triumph of the protestant religion nay there were fiery speakers in the marketplace and before the west porch of the church who mounted on tubs and exhorted the people grave merchants came forth and shook hands with each other and godly ministers who had been in hiding walked forth boldly it was truly a great day for taunton the excitement grew greater when captain hucker a wellknown sergemaker of the town rode in with a troop of monmouths horse captain hucker had been seized by colonel phillips on the charge of receiving a message from the duke but he escaped and joined the rebels to his greater loss as afterwards appeared however he now rode in to tell his fellow townsmen of his own wonderful and providential escape and that the duke would certainly arrive the next day and he exhorted them to give him such a welcome as he had a right to expect at their hands he also reminded them that they were the sons of the men who forty years before defended taunton under admiral blake there was a great shouting and tossing of caps after captain huckers address and no one could do too much for the horsemen with him so that i fear these brave fellows were soon fain to lie down and sleep till the fumes of the strong ale should leave their brains illustration her schoolgirls were engaged in working and embroidering flags for the dukes army all that day and half the night we sat in miss blakes schoolroom finishing the flags in which i was permitted to join there were twentyseven flags in all presented to the army by the taunton maids twelve by miss blake and fifteen by one mrs musgrave also a schoolmistress and now indeed seeing that the militia at axminster had fled almost at the mere aspect of one man and that those of taunton had also fled away secretly by night and catching the zeal of our kind entertainer and considering the courage and spirit of these good people i began to feel confident again and my heart which had fallen very low at the sight of the dukes hanging head and gloomy looks rose again and all dangers seemed to vanish and so in a mere fools paradise i continued happy indeed until the fatal news of sedgemoor fight awoke us all from our fond dreams chapter xvii taunton i never weary in thinking of the gaiety and happiness of those four days at taunton among the rebels there was no more doubt in any of our hearts we were all confident of victoryand that easy and perhaps bloodless as was the rejoicing at taunton so it would be in every town of the country one only had to look out of window in order to feel assurance of that victory so jolly so happy so confident looked every face why said miss blake in future ages even we women who have only worked the flags will be envied for our share in the glorious deliverance great writers will speak of us as they speak of the roman women then all our eyes sparkled and the needles flew faster and the flags grew nearer to completion if history should condescend to remember the poor maids of taunton at all it will be at best with pity for the afflictions which afterwards fell upon them none certainly will envy them but we shall be forgotten why should we be remembered women it is certain have no business with affairs of state and especially none with rebellions and civil wars our hearts and passions carry us away the leaders in the cause which we have joined appear to us to be more than human we cannot restrain ourselves we fall down and worship our leaders especially in the cause of religion and liberty now behold on the very morning after we arrived at taunton i was abroad in the streets with miss blake looking at the town which hath shops full of the most beautiful and precious things and wondering at the great concourse of people for the looms were all deserted and the workmen were in the streets filled with a martial spirit when i saw riding into the town no other than robin himself oh how my heart leapt up to see him he was most gallantly dressed in a purple coat with a crimson sash over his shoulders to carry his sword he had pistols in his holsters and wore great ridingboots and with him rode a company of a dozen young men mounted on good strong nags why they were men of our own village and i knew them every one they were armed with muskets and pikesi knew where those came fromand when they saw me the fellows all began to grin and to square their shoulders so as to look more martial but robin leapt from his horse tis alice he cried dear heart thou art then safe so far madam your servant here he took off his hat to miss blake lads ride on to the white hart and call for what you want and take care of the nags this is a joyful meeting sweetheart here he kissed me the duke they say draws thousands daily i thought to find him in taunton by this time why we are as good as victorious already humphrey i take it is with his grace my dear even had the cause of freedom failed to move me i had been dragged by the silken ropes of love truly i could not choose but come there was the thought of these brave fellows marching to battle and i all the time skulking at home who had ever been so loud upon their side and there was the thought of humphrey braving the dangers of the field tender though he be and i strong and lusty sitting by the fire and sleeping on a feather bed and always there was the thought of thee my dear among these rude soldierslike miltons lady among the rabble rout because well i know that even christian warriors socalled are not lambs and again there was my grandfather who could find no rest but continually walked to and fro with looks that at one time said go my son and at others nay lest thou receive a hurt and the white face of my mother which said as plain as eyes could speak he ought to go he ought to go and yet he may be killed oh robin pray god there prove to be no more fighting well my dear if i am not tedious to madam here oh sir said miss blake it is a joy to hear this talk she told me afterwards that it was also a joy to look upon so gallant a gentleman and such a pair of lovers she poor creature had no sweetheart then on monday robin continued the day before yesterday i could refrain no longer but laid the matter before my grandfather sweetheart there is i swear no better man in all the world of that i am well assured robin first he said that if anything befell me he should go down in sorrow to his grave yet that as to his own end an old man so near the grave should not be concerned about the manner of his end so long as he should keep to honour and duty next that in his own youth he had himself gone forth willingly to fight in the cause of liberty without counting the risk thirdly that if my conscience did truly urge me to follow the duke i ought to obey that voice in the name of god and this with tears in his eyes and yet a lively and visible satisfaction that as he himself had chosen so his grandson would choose sir i said that voice of conscience speaks out very loudly and clearly i cannot stifle it therefore by your good leave i will go then he bade me take the best horse in the stable and gave me a purse of gold and so i made ready miss blake at this point said that she was reminded of david it was i suppose because robin was so goodly a lad to look upon otherwise david though an exile did never endeavour to pull king saul from his throne then robin continued i went to my mother she wept because war hath many dangers and chances but she would not say me nay and in the evening when the men came home i went into the village and asked who would go with me a dozen stout fellowsyou know them all sweetheartstepped forth at once another dozen would have come but their wives prevented them and so mounting them on good carthorses i bade farewell and rode away sir said miss blake you have chosen the better part you will be rewarded by so splendid a victory that it will surprise all the world and for the rest of your lifeyes and for generations afterwardsyou will be ranked among the deliverers of your country it is a great privilege sir to take part in the noblest passage of english history oh she clasped her hands i am sorry that i am not a man only because i would strike a blow in this sacred cause but we are women and we can but prayand make flags we cannot die for the cause the event proved that women can sometimes die for the cause because she herself if any woman ever did died for her cause then robin left us in order to take steps about his men and himself captain hucker received them in the name of the duke they joined the cavalry and robin was told that he should be made a captain this done he rode out with the rest to meet the duke now when his approach was known everybody who had a horse rode forth to meet him so that there followed him when he entered the town not counting his army so great a company that they almost made another army as soon as it was reported that the duke was within a mile they had that day marched sixteen miles from ilminster the church bells were set aringing children came out with baskets of flowers in readiness to strew them at his feet as he should passthere were roses and lilies and all kinds of summer flowers so that his horse had a most delicate carpet to walk upon the common people crowded the sides of the streets the windows were filled with ladies who waved their handkerchiefs and called aloud on heaven to bless the good duke the brave duke the sweet and lovely duke if there were any malcontents in the town they kept snug it would have cost them dear even to have been seen in the streets that day the duke showed on this occasion a face full of hope and happiness indeed if he had not shown a cheerful countenance on such a day he would have been something less or something greater than human i mean that he would have been either insensible and blockish not to be moved by such a welcome or else he would have been a prophet as foreseeing what would follow he rode bareheaded carrying his hat in his hand he was dressed in a shining corslet with a blue silk scarf and a purple coat his long brown hair hung in curls upon his shoulders his sweet lips were parted with a gracious smile his beautiful brown eyesnever had any prince more lovely eyeslooked pleased and benignant truly there was never made any man more comely than the duke of monmouth the face of his father and that of his uncle king james were dark and gloomy but the dukes face was naturally bright and cheerful king charless long nose in him was softened and reduced to the proportions of manly beauty in short there was no feature that in his father was harsh and unpleasing but was in him sweet and beautiful if i had thought him comely and like a kings son when four years before he made his progress i thought him now ten times as gracious and as beautiful he was thinner in the face which gave his appearance the greater dignity he had ever the most gracious smile and the most charming eyes and at such a moment as this who could believe the things which they said about his wife and lady wentworth nothey were inventions of his enemies they must be base liesso noble a presence could not conceal a guilty heart he must be as good and virtuous as he was brave and lovely thus we talked sitting in the window and thus we cheered our souls even now to think how great and good he looked on that day it is difficult to believe that he was in some matters so vile i am not of those who expect one kind of moral conduct from one man and a different kind from another there is but one set of commandments for rich and poor for prince and peasant but the pity of itoh the pity of it with such a prince never in short did one see such a tumult of joy it is impossible to speak otherwise the people had lost their wits with excess of joy nor did they show their welcome in shouting only for all doors were thrown wide open and supplies and necessaries of all kinds were sent to the soldiers in the camp outside the town so that the country lads declared they had never fared more sumptuously there now rode after the duke several nonconformist ministers beside my father thus there was the pious mr larke of lyme he was an aged baptist preacher who thought it no shame to his profession to gird on a sword and to command a troop of horse and others there were whose names i forget who had come forth to join the deliverer lord grey rode on one side of him and colonel speke on the other dr hooke the chaplain and my father rode behind my heart swelled with joy to hear how the people when they had shouted themselves hoarse cried out for my father because his presence showed that they would have once more that liberty of worship for want of which they had so long languished the dukes own chaplain mr ferguson had got a naked sword in his hand and was marching on foot crying out in a most vainglorious manner i am ferguson the famous ferguson that ferguson for whose head so many hundred pounds were offered i am that man i am that man he wore a great gown and a silken cassock which consorted ill with the sword in his hand and in the evening he preached in the great church while my father preached in the old meetinghouse to a much larger congregation and i venture to think with a much more edifying discourse the army marched through the town in much the same order as it had marched out of lyme and it seemed not much bigger but the men marched more orderly and there was less laughing and shouting but the streets were so thronged that the men could hardly make their way in the marketplace the duke halted while his declaration was read aloud one thing i could not approve they dragged forth three of the justiceshigh churchmen and standing stoutly for king jamesand forced them to listen bareheaded to the declaration a thing which came near afterwards to their destruction yet they looked sour and unwilling as anyone would have testified the declaration was a long document and the reading of it took half an hour at least but the people cheered all the time after this they read a proclamation warning the soldiers against taking aught without payment but robin laughed saying that this was the way with armies where the general was always on the side of virtue yet the soldiers were always yielding to temptation in the matter of sheep and poultry that human nature must not be too much tempted and that camp rations are sometimes scanty but it was a noble proclamation and i cannot but believe that the robberies afterwards complained of were committed by the tattered crew who followed the camp rather than by the brave fellows themselves the duke lay at captain huckers house over against the three cups inn this was a great honour for mr hucker a plain sergemaker and there were many who were envious thinking that the duke should not have gone to the house of so humble a person it was also said that for his services mr hucker boasted that he should expect nothing less than a coronet and the title of peer once the business was safely dispatched a peer to be made out of a master sergemaker but we must charitably refuse to believe all that is reported and indeed i say it with sorrow of that most unfortunate lady miss blake much idle tattle concerning neighbours was carried on in her house and i was told that it was the same in every house of taunton so that the women spent all their time in talking of their neighbours affairs and what might be going on in the houses of their friends this is a kind of talk which my father would never permit as testifying to idle curiosity and leading to undue importance concerning things which are fleeting and trivial however the duke was bestowed in captain huckers best bedof that there was no doubt and the bells rang and bonfires blazed and the people sang and shouted in the streets chapter xviii the maids of taunton the next day was made remarkable in our eyes by an event which though doubtless of less importance than the enlistment of a dozen recruits seemed to us a very great thing indeednamely the presentation to the duke of the colours embroidered for him by susan blakes schoolgirls i was myself permitted to walk with the girls on this occasion as if i had been one of them though a stranger to the place and but newly arrivedsuch was the kindness of susan blake and her respect for the name of the learned and pious dr comfort eykin at nine of the clock the girls who were to carry the flags began to gather in the schoolroom there were twentyseven in all but twelve only were the pupils of miss blake the others were the pupils of mrs musgrave another schoolmistress in the town i remember not the names of all the girls but some of them i can still write down one was katharine bovet daughter of colonel bovet she it was who walked first and named to the duke those who followed there was also mary blake cousin of susan who was afterwards thrown into prison with her cousin but presently was pardoned miss hucker daughter of captain hucker the mastersergemaker who entertained the duke was another there were three daughters of captain herring two daughters of mr thomas baker one of monmouths privy councillors there was mary meade the girl who carried the famous golden flag and others whom i have forgotten when we were assembled being dressed all in white and each maid wearing the monmouth colours we took our flags and sallied forth in the street there was almost as great a crowd to look on as the day before when the duke rode in and certainly it was a very pretty sight to see first marched a man playing on the crowd very briskly after him one who beat a tabor and one who played a fife so that we had music on our march when the music stopped we lifted our voices and sang a psalm all together that done the crowder began again as for the procession no one surely had ever seen the like of it after the music walked sixandtwenty maids the youngest eight and the eldest not more than twelve they marched two by two very orderly all dressed in white with blue favours and every girl carrying in her hands a flag of silk embroidered by herself assisted by miss blake or some other older person with devices appropriate to the nature of the enterprise in hand for one flag had upon it truly figured in scarlet silk an open bible because it was for liberty to read and expound that book that the men were going forth to fight upon another was embroidered a great cross upon a third were the arms of the duke a fourth bore upon it to show the zeal of the people the arms of the town of taunton and a fifth had both a bible and a drawn sword and so forth every one with a legend embroidered upon it plain for all to read the flags were affixed to stout white staves and as the maids walked apart from each other and at a due distance the flags all flying in the wind made a pretty sight indeed so that some of the women who looked on shed tears among the flags was one which i needs must mention because unless the device was communicated by some person deep in the dukes counsels it most strangely jumped with the event of the following day mary meade poor child carried it we called it the golden flag because it had a crown worked in gold thread upon it and the letters j r a fringe of lace was sewn round it so that it was the richest flag of all what could the crown with the letters j r mean but that james duke of monmouth would shortly assume the crown of these three kingdoms last of all walked miss susan blake and i by her side she bore in one hand a bible bound in red leather stamped with gold and in the other a naked sword the duke came forth to meet us standing bareheaded before the porch there were standing beside and behind him the lord grey his two chaplains dr hooke and mr ferguson my father mr larke the baptist minister of lyme regis he wore a corslet and carried a sword and the colonels of his regiments his bodyguard were drawn up across the street looking brave and splendid in their new favours the varlets waited beyond with the horses for the dukes party who to look upon the martial array the bravery of the guard the gallant bearing of all the confidence in their looks and the presence which should surely bring a blessing of the ministers of religion would think that all this pomp and promise could be shattered at a single blow as each girl advanced in her turn she knelt on one knee and offered her flag bowing her head we had practised this ceremony several times at the school until we were all quite perfect in our parts then the duke stepped forward and raised her tenderly kissing her then she stood aside holding her flag still in her hands my turnbecause i had no flagcame last but one miss susan blake being the last nowi hope it was not folly or a vainglorious desire to be distinguished by any particular notice of his gracei could not refrain from hanging the ring which the duke had given me at ilchester five years ago outside my dress by a blue ribbon miss blake to whom i had told the story of the ring advised me to do so partly to show my loyalty to the duke and partly because it was a pretty thing and one which some women would much desire to possess miss katharine bovet informed the duke that i was the daughter of the learned preacher dr comfort eykin when i knelt he raised me then as he was about to salute me his eyes fell upon the ring and he looked first at me and then at the ring madam he said this ring i ought to know if i mistake not there are the initials of j s upon it sir i replied the ring was your own your grace was so good as to bestow it upon me in your progress through the town of ilchester five years ago gad so he said laughing i remember now twas a sweet and lovely child whom i kissedand now thou art a sweet and lovely maiden art thou truly the daughter of dr comfort eykinhe looked behind him but my father neither heard nor attended being wrapped in thought tis strange his daughter tis indeed wonderful that such a child shouldhere he stopped fair rose of somerset i called thee then fair rose of somerset i call thee again why if i could place thee at the head of my army all england would certainly follow as if helen of troy or queen venus herself did lead so he kissed me on the cheek with much warmthmore indeed than was necessary to show a gracious and friendly goodwill and suffered me to step aside dr eykins daughter he repeated with a kind of wonder how could dr eykin have such a daughter when i told robin of this gracious salutation he first turned very red and then he laughed then he said that everybody knew the duke but he must not attempt any court freedoms in the protestant camp and if he were to trythen he broke off short changed colour again and then he kissed me saying that of course the duke meant nothing but kindliness but that for his own part he desired not his sweetheart to be kissed by anybody but himself so i suppose my boy was jealous but the folly of being jealous of so great a prince who could not possibly have the least regard for a simple country maiden and who had known the great and beautiful court ladies it made me laugh to think that robin could be so foolish as to be jealous of the duke then it was miss susan blakes turn she stepped forward very briskly and knelt down and placed the bible in the dukes left hand and the sword in his right sir she said speaking the words we had made up and she had learned it is in the name of the women of tauntonnay of the women of all englandthat i give you the book of the word of god the most precious treasure vouchsafed to man so that all may learn that you are come for no other purpose than to maintain the right of the english people to search the scriptures for themselves i give you also sir a sword with which to defend those rights in addition sir the women can only give your grace the offering of their continual prayers in behalf of the cause and for the safety and prosperity of your highness and your army madam said the duke much moved by this spectacle of devotion i am come believe me for no other purpose than to defend the truths contained in this book and to seal my defence with my blood if that need be then the duke mounted and we marched behind him in single file each girl led by a soldier till we came to the camp when our flags were taken from us and we returned home and took off our white dresses i confess that i laid mine down with a sigh white becomes every maiden and my only wear till then had been of russet brown and all that day we acted over againin our talk and in our thoughtsour beautiful procession and we repeated the condescending words of the duke and admired the graciousness of his kisses and praised each other for our admirable behaviour and listened with pleasure unspeakable while susan blake prophesied that we should become immortal by the ceremony of that day chapter xix king monmouth and his camp next day the town being thronged with people and the young men pressing in from all quarters to enrol themselves over four thousand joined the colours at taunton alone another proclamation was readthat namely by which the duke claimed the throne many opinions have been given as to this step for the dukes enemies maintainfirst that his mother was never married to king charles the second indeed there is no doubt that the king always denied the marriage next that an illegitimate son could never be permitted to sit upon the ancient throne of this realm and thirdly that in usurping the crown the duke broke faith with his friends to whom he had solemnly given his word that he would not put forward any such pretensions nay some have gone so far as to allege that he was not the son of charles at all but of some other whom they even name and they have pointed to his face as showing no resemblance at all to that swarthy and gloomylooking king on the other hand the dukes friends say that there were in his hands clear proofs of the marriage that the promise given to his friends was conditional and one which could be set aside by circumstances that the country gentry to whom a republic was most distasteful were afraid that he designed to reestablish that form of government and further that his friends were all fully aware from the beginning of his intentions on these points i know nothing but when a thing has been done it is idle to spend time in arguing that it was well or ill done james duke of monmouth was now james king of great britain and ireland and if we were all rebels before who had risen in the name of religion and liberty i suppose we were all ten times as much rebels now when we had in addition set up another king and declared king james to be an usurper and no more than the duke of york nay that there might be wanting no single circumstance of aggravation it was in this proclamation declared that the duke of york had caused his brother the late king to be secretly poisoned i know not what foundation exists for this accusation but i have been told that it gave offence unto many and that it was an illadvised thing to say the proclamation was read aloud at the market cross by mr tyley of taunton on the saturday morning before a great concourse of people it ended with the words we therefore the noblemen gentlemen and commons at present assembled in the names of ourselves and of all the loyal and protestant noblemen gentlemen and commons of england in pursuance of our duty and allegiance and for the delivering of the kingdom from popery tyranny and oppression do recognise publish and proclaim the said high and mighty prince james duke of monmouth as lawful and rightful sovereign and king by the name of james ii by the grace of god king of england scotland france and ireland defender of the faith god save the king after this the duke was always saluted as king prayed for as king and styled his majesty he also touched some as only the king can do for the kingsevil and it is said wrought many miracles of healinga thing which being noised abroad should have strengthened the faith of the people in him but the malignity of our enemies caused these cases of healing to be denied or else explained as fables and inventions of the dukes friends among the accessions of this day was one which i cannot forbear to mention it was that of an old soldier who had been one of cromwells captains colonel basset by name he rode inbeing a man advanced in years yet still strong and haleat the head of a considerable company raised by himself twas hoped that his example would be followed by the adhesion of many more of cromwells men but the event proved otherwise perhaps being old republicans they were deterred by the proclamation of monmouth as king perhaps they had grown slothful with age and were now unwilling to face once more the dangers and fatigues of a campaign another recruit was the oncefamous colonel perrot who had been engaged with colonel blood in the robbery of the crown jewelsthough the addition of a robber to our army was not a matter of pride he came it was afterwards said because he was desperate his fortunes broken and with no other hope than to follow the fortunes of the duke it became known in the course of the day that the army was to march on the sunday therefore everybody on saturday evening repaired to the camp some to bid farewell and godspeed to their friends and others to witness the humours of a camp i was fortunate in having robin for a companion and protectorthe place being rough and the behaviour and language of the men coarse even beyond what one expects at a country fair the recruits still kept pouring in from all parts but as i have already said many were disheartened when they found that there were no arms and went home again they were not all riotous and disorderly some of the men those namely who were older and more soberminded we found gathered together in groups earnestly engaged in conversation they are considering the proclamation said robin truly we did not expect that our duke would so soon become king they say he is illegitimate what then let him mount the throne by right of arms as oliver cromwell could have done had he pleasedwho asks whether oliver was illegitimate or no the country will not have another commonwealthand it will no longer endure a catholic king let us have king monmouth then who is there better in all the camp there was none who spoke with greater cheerfulness and confidence than robin yet he did not disguise from himself that there might be warm work the kings troops he said are closing in all round us that is certain yet even if they all join we are still more numerous and in much better heart of that i am assured at wellington the duke of albemarle commands the devonshire militia lord churchill is at chard with the somerset regiment lord bath is reported to be marching upon us with the cornishmen the duke of beaufort hath the gloucester militia at bristol lord pembroke is at chippenham with the wiltshire trainbands lord feversham is on the march with the kings standing army what then are these men protestants or are they papists answer me that sweetheart alas had they been true protestants there would have been such an answer as would have driven king james across the water three years sooner the camp was now like a fair only much finer and bigger than any fair i have ever seen that of lyme regis could not be compared with it there were booths where they sold gingerbread cakes ale and cider monmouth favours for the recruits to sew upon their hats or sleeves shoes and stockings were sold in some and even chapbooks were displayed there was a puppet show with patient grizzle and a stand where a monkey danced men and women carried about in baskets last years withered apples with kentish cobs and walnuts there were booths where they fried sausages and roasted pork all day long tumblers and clowns were performing in others painted and dressedup girls danced in others there was a bullbaiting a man was making a fiery oration on the dukes proclamation but i saw no one preaching a sermon there were here and there companies of country lads exercising with pike and halbert and others more advanced with the loading and firing of their muskets there were tables at which sat men with cards and dice gambling shouting when they won and cursing when they lost others of more thrifty mind sat on the ground practising their trade of tailor or cobblerthus losing no money though they did go soldiering some polished weapons and sharpened swords pikes and scythes nowhere did we find any reading the bible or singing of hymns or listening to sermons save for a few groups of sober men of whom i have spoken the love of amusement carried all away and the officers of the army who might have turned them back to sober thought were not visible everywhere noise everywhere beating of drums playing of pipes singing of songs bowling and laughing among the men there ran about a number of saucy gipsy girls their brown faces showing under red kerchiefs their black eyes twinkling truly they are pretty creatures to look upon when they are young but they have no religion and say of themselves that they have no souls these girls talked with each other in their own language which none out of their own nationexcept the tinkerfolk who are said to be their cousinsunderstand but english they talk very well and they are so clever that it is said they will talk to a somersetshire man in good broad somerset and to a man of norfolk in his own speech though he of norfolk would not understand him of somerset they are the vultures said robin who follow for prey before the battle these women cajole the soldiers out of their money and after the battle their men rob and even murder the wounded and plunder the dead then one of them ran and stood before us let me tell thy fortune handsome gentleman let me tell thine fair lady a sixpence or a groat to cross my palm captain and you shall know all that is to happen robin laughed but gave her sixpence look me in the face fair ladyshe spoke good plain english this blackeyed wench though but a moment before she had been talking broad somerset to a young recruitlook me in the face yes all is not smooth he loves you but there will be separation and trouble one comes between a big man with a red face he parts you there is a wedding i see your ladyship plain why you are crying at it you cry all the time but i do not see this gentleman then there is another weddingyes anotherand i see you at both you will be twice married yet be of good heart fair lady she turned away and ran after another couple no doubt with much the same tale how should there be a wedding i asked if i am there and you not there robinand i to be crying and how could ioh robinhow could i be married twice nay sweetheart she could not tell what wedding it was she only uttered the gibberish of her trade i am sorry that i wasted a sixpence upon her robin is it magic that they practisethese gipsies do they traffic with the devil we ought not to suffer witches to live amongst us most are of opinion that they have no other magic than the art of guessing which they learn to do very quickly putting things together from their appearance so that if brother and sister walk out together they are taken to be lovers and promised a happy marriage and many children that may be so and perhaps the fortune told by this gipsy was only guesswork but i cannot believe it for the event proved that she had in reality possessed an exact knowledge of what was about to happen some of the gipsy womenbut these were the older women who had lost their good looks though not their impudencewere singing songs and those as robin told me songs not fit to be sung and one old crone sitting before her tent beside a roaring wood fire over which hung a great saucepan sold charms against shot and steel the lads bought these greedily giving sixpence apiece for them so that the old witch must have made a sackful of money they came and looked on shyly then one would say to the other what thinkest lad is there aught in it and the other would say truly i know not but she is a proper witch and ill buy one we may have to fight best make sure of a whole skin and so he bought one and then all bought the husbands of the gipsy women were engaged meantime we understood in robbing the farmyards in the neighbourhood the blame being afterwards laid upon our honest soldiers then there was a balladmonger singing a song about a man and a broom and selling it to those who would buy printed on a long slip of paper the first lines were there was an old man and he lived in a wood and his trade it was making a broom but i heard no more because robin hurried me away then there were some who had drunk too much cider or beer and were now reeling about with stupid faces and glassy eyes there were some who were lying speechless or asleep upon the grass and some were cooking supper over fires after the manner of the gipsies i have seen enough robin i said alas for sacred religion if these are her defenders tis always so said robin in time of war we must encourage our men to keep up their hearts should we be constantly reminding them that tomorrow half of them may be lying dead on the battlefield then they would mope and hang their heads and would presently desert one need not preach of death but one should preach of godliness and of sober joy look but at those gipsy wenches and those lads rolling about drunk are these things decent if they escape the dangers of war will it make them happy to look back upon the memory of this camp is it fit preparation to meet their maker in times of peace sweet saint these lads remember easily that in the midst of life we are in death and they govern themselves accordingly in times of war every man hopes for his own part to escape with a whole skin though his neighbour fall that is why we are all so blithe and jolly let us now go homebefore the night falls and the mirth becomes riotous and unseemly we passed a large booth whence there issued sounds of singing it was a roofless inclosure of canvas some alehouse man of taunton had set it up robin drew aside the canvas door look in he said see the brave defenders of religion keeping up their hearts it was furnished with benches and rough tables at one end were casks the benches were crowded with soldiers every man with a pot before him and the varlets were running backwards and forwards with cans of ale and cider most of the men were smoking pipes of tobacco and they were singing a song which seemed to have no end one bawled the lines and when it came to the let the hautboys play and the huzza they all roared out together now now the dukes health and let the hautboys play while the troops on their march shall roar huzza huzza huzza now now the dukes health and let the hautboys play while the drums and the trumpets sound from the shore huzza huzza huzza they sang this verse several times over then another began now now lord greys health and let the hautboys play while the troops on their march shall roar huzza huzza huzza now now lord greys health and let the hautboys play while the drums and the trumpets sound from the shore huzza huzza huzza next a third voice took it up now now the colonels health and let the hautboys play and then a fourth and a fifth and the last verse was bawled as lustily and with so much joy that one would have thought the mere singing would have gotten them the victory men are so made i suppose that they cannot work together without singing and music to keep up their hearts sailors sing when they weigh anchor men who unlade ships sing as they carry out the bales even cromwells ironsides could not march in silence but sang psalms as they marched the sun was set and the twilight falling when we left the camp and there was no abatement of the roaring and singing but rather an increase they will go on said robin until the drink or their money gives out then they will lie down and sleep you have now seen our camp sweetheart it is not truth to say as decorous as a conventicle nor is the talk so godly as in sir christophers hall for rough fellows there must be rough play in a month these lads will be veterans the singing will have grown stale to them the blackeyed gipsywomen will have no more power to charm away their money they will understand the meaning of war the camp will be sober if it is not religious so we walked homewards i for my part saddened to think in what a spirit of riot these young men whom i had pictured so full of godly zeal were preparing to meet the chance of immediate death and judgment sweet said robin i read thy thoughts in thy troubled eyes pray for us some will fight none the worse for knowing that there are good women who pray for them we were now back in the town the streets were still full of people and no one seemed to think of bed presently we passed the castle inn the windows were open and we could see a great company of gentlemen sitting round a table on which were candles lit and bowls full of strong drink nearly every man had his pipe at his lips and his glass before him and one of them was singing to the accompaniment of a guitar their faces were red and swollen as if they had taken too much at one end of the table sat humphrey what could humphrey too be a reveller with the rest his face which was gloomy and his eyes which were sad showed that he was not the officers have supped together said robin it may be long before we get such good quarters again a cup of hipsy and a song in good fellowship thou wilt not grudge so much nay i said tis all of a piece like man like master officers and men alikeall drinking and singing is there not one good man in all the army as i spoke one finished a song at which all laughed except humphrey and drummed the table with their fists and shouted then one who seemed to be the president of the table turned to humphrey doctor he said thou wilt not drink thou dost not laugh and thou hast not sung thou must be tried by courtmartial and the sentence of the court is a brimming glass of punch or a song then gentlemen said humphrey smiling i will give you a song but blame me not if you mislike it i made the song in praise of the sweetest woman in the world he took the guitar and struck the strings when he began to sing my cheeks flamed and my breath came and went for i knew the song he had given it to me four years agone who was the sweetest woman in the world oh he made this song for mehe made this song for me and none but me but these rude revellers would not know thatand i never guessed that the song was for me how could i think that he would write these extravagances for me but poets cannot mean what they say as rides the moon in azure skies the twinkling stars beside as when in splendour she doth rise their lesser lights they hide so beside celia when her face we see all unregarded other maidens be as helen in the town of troy shone fair beyond all thought that to behold her was a joy by death too poorly bought so when fair celia deigns the lawn to grace all life all joy dwells in her lovely face as the sweet river floweth by green banks and alders tall it stayeth not for prayer or sigh nor answereth if we call so celia heeds not though love cry and weep she heavenward wendeth while we earthward creep the marbled saint so cold and pure minds naught of earthly ways nor can mans gauds entice or lure that fixed heavenly gaze so celia though thou queen and empress art to heaven to heaven alone belongs thy heart now while humphrey sang this song a hush fell upon the revellers they had expected nothing but a common drinkingsong after the bawling and the noise and the ribaldry twas like a breath of fresh air after the closeness of a prison or like a drink of pure water to one halfdead with thirst robin i said there is one good man in the camp i say that while humphrey sang this songwhich to be sure was neither a drinkingsong nor a party song nor a song of wickedness and follythe company looked at each other in silence and neither laughed nor offered to interrupt nay there were signs of grace in some of their faces which became grave and thoughtful when humphrey finished it he laid down the guitar and rose up with a bow saying i have sung my song gentlemen alland so goodnight and walked out of the room robin i said again thank god there is one good man in the camp i had forgotten humphrey yes robin replied humphrey is a good man if ever there was one but he is glum something oppresses him his eyes are troubled and he hangs his head or if he laughs at all it is as if he would rather cry yet all the way home from holland he was joyful save when his head was held over the side of the ship he sang and laughed he spoke of great things about to happen i have never known him more happy and now his face is gloomy and he sighs when he thinks no one watcheth him perhaps like thee sweet he cannot abide the noise and riot of the camp he would fain see every man bible in hand today he spent two hours with the duke before the council and was with thy father afterwards tis certain that the duke hath great confidence in him why is he so gloomy he bitterly reproached me for leaving sir christopher as if he alone had a conscience to obey or honour to remember humphrey came forth at this moment and stood for a moment on the steps then he heaved a great sigh and walked away slowly with hanging head not seeing us what is the matter with him said robin perhaps they flout him for being a physician these fellows have no respect for learning or for anyone who is not a country gentleman well perhaps when we are on the march he will again pick up his spirits they are going to sing again shall we go child but the president called a name which made me stop a little longer barnaby he cried jolly captain barnaby now that doctor graveairs hath left us we will begin the night barnaby my hero thy song pill up gentlemen the night is young and tomorrow we march captain barnaby tip us a seasong silence gentlemen for the captains song it was my brother that they called uponno other he got up from his place at the summons and rose to his feet heavens what a broad man he seemed compared with those who sat beside him his face was red and his cheeks swollen because of the strong drink he had taken in his hand he held a full glass of it robin called it hipsyand it is a mixture of wine brandy and water with lemon juice and sugarvery heady and strong said not barnaby that there was one religion for a landsman and another for a sailor i thought of that as he stood looking round him if it were so it would be truly a happy circumstance for most sailors but i know not on what assurance this belief can be argued then barnaby waved his hand yoho my lads he shouted the ships in port and the crew has gone ashore then he began to sing in a deep voice which made the glasses ring shut the doorlock the door out of window fling the key hasten bring me more bring me more fill it up fill it up for me the daylight which you think the daylight which you think the daylight which you think tis but the candles flicker the morning star will never wink the morning star will never wink till there cometh stint of liquor for tis tipple tipple tipple all around the world my lads and the sun in drink is nightly lapped and curled my lads and tonight let us drink and tomorrow well to sea for tis tipple tipple tippleyes tis tipple tipple tipple makes the world and us to jee take me home robin i said i have seen and heard enough alas we have need of all the prayers that we can utter from the depths of our heart and more chapter xx benjamins warning since i have so much to tell before long of benjamins evil conduct it must in justice be recorded of him that at this juncture he endeavoured knowing more of the world than we of somerset to warn and dissuade his cousins from taking part in any attempt which should be made in the west and this he did by means of a letter written to his father i know not how far the letter might have succeeded but unfortunately it arrived two or three days too latewhen our boys had already joined the insurgents honoured sir he wrote i write this epistle being much concerned in spirit lest my grandfather whose opinions are well known not only in his own county but also at the court should be drawn into or become cognisant of some attempt to raise the west country against their lawful king it will not be news to you that the earl of argyle hath landed in scotland where he will meet with such a reception which will doubtless cause him to repent of his rashness it is also currently reported and everywhere believed that the duke of monmouth intends immediately to embark and cross the sea with the design of raising the country in rebellion the dissenters who have been going about with sour looks for fiveandtwenty years venture now to smile and look pleased in anticipation of another civil war this may follow but its termination i think will not be what they expect i have also heard that my cousin humphrey dr eykins favourite pupil who hath never concealed his opinions hath lately returned from holland where the exiles are gathered and passed through london accompanied by robin i have further learned that while in london he visited but alone without robins knowledge many of those who are known to be friends of the duke and redhot protestants wherefore i greatly fear that he hath been in correspondence with the exiles and is cognisant of their designs and may even be their messenger to announce the intentions of his protestant champion certain i am that should any chance occur of striking a blow for freedom of worship my cousin though he is weak and of slender frame will join the attempt he will also endeavour to draw after him everyone in his power therefore my dear father use all your influence to withstand him and if he must for his own part plunge into ruin persuade my grandfather and my cousin robin to stay quiet at home i hear it on the best authority that the temper of the country and especially in your part of it hath been carefully studied by the government and is perfectly well known those who would risk life and lands for the duke of monmouth are few indeed he may perhaps draw a rabble after him but no more the fat tradesmen who most long for the conventicle will not fight though they may pray for him the country gentlemen may be protestants but they are mostly for church and king it is quite true that his majesty is a roman catholic nor hath he ever concealed or denied his religion being one who scorns deception it is also true that his profession of faith is a stumblingblock to many who find it hard to reconcile their teaching of nonresistance and divine right with the introduction of the mass and the romish priest but the country had not yet forgotten the sour rule of the independent and rather than suffer him to return the people will endure a vast deal of royal prerogative it is absolutely certainassure my grandfather on this point whatever he may learn from humphreythat the better sort will never join monmouth whether he comes as another cromwell to restore the commonwealth or whether he aspires to the crown and dares to maintaina thing which king charles did always stoutly denythat his mother was married is it credible that the ancient throne of these kingdoms should be usurped by the baseborn son of lucy waters i had last night the honour of drinking a bottle of wine with that great lawyer sir george jeffreys the conversation turned upon this subject we were assured by the judge that the affections of the people are wholly with the king that the liberty of worship which he demands for himself he will also willingly extend to the country so that the last pretence of reason for disaffection shall be removed why should the people run after monmouth when if he were successful he could give no more than the king is ready to give i was also privately warned by sir george that my grandfathers name is unfavourably noted and his actions and speeches will be watched therefore sir i humbly beg that you will represent to him and to my cousins and to dr eykin himself first the hopelessness of any such enterprise and the certainty of defeat and next the punishment which will fall upon the rebels and upon those who lend them any countenance men of such a temper as dr comfort eykin will doubtless go to the scaffold willingly with their mouths full of the texts which they apply to themselves on all occasions for such i have no pity yet for the sake of his wife and daughter i would willingly if i could save him from the fate which will be his if monmouth lands in the west and as for my grandfather tis terrible to think of his white hairs blown by the breeze while the hangman adjusts the knot and i should shudder to see the blackened limbs of robin stuck upon poles for all the world to see it is my present intention if my affairs permit to follow my fortunes on the western circuit in the autumn when i shall endeavour to ride from taunton or exeter to bradford orcas my practice grows apace daily i am heard in the courts the judges already know me and listen to me the juries begin to feel the weight of my arguments the attorneys besiege my chambers for a junior i am in great demand it is my prayer that you sir may live to see your son chancellor and a peer of the realm less than lord chancellor will not content me as for marriage that might hinder my rise i shall not marry yet there is in your parish sir one who knows my mind upon this matter i shall be pleased to think that you will assure heryou know very well whom i meanthat my mind is unaltered and that my way is now plain before me so i remain with dutiful respect your obedient son b b this letter arrived i say after the departure of robin with his company of village lads when mr boscorel had read it slowly and twice over so as to lose no point of the contents he sat and pondered awhile then he arose and with troubled face he sought sir christopher to whom he read it through then he waited for sir christopher to speak the boy writes said his honour after a while according to his lights he repeats the things he hears said by his boon companions nay more he believes them why it is easy for them to swear loyalty and to declare in their cups where the affections of the people are placed sir christopher what is done cannot be undone the boys are gonealasbut you still remain take heed for a space what you say as well as what you do how should they know the temper of the country sir christopher went on regardless what doth the foulmouthed profligate sir george jeffreys know concerning sober and godly people these are not noisy templars they are not profligates of the court they are not haunters of tavern and pothouse they are not those who frequent the playhouse judge jeffreys knows none such they are lovers of the word of god they wish to worship after their fashion they hate the pope and all his works let us hear what these men say upon the matter nay said mr boscorel i care not greatly what they say but would to god the boys were safe returned benjamin means well sir christopher went on i take this warning kindly he means well it pleases me that in the midst of the work and the feasting which he loves he thinks upon us tell him soninlaw that i thank him for his letter it shows that he hath preserved a good heart as for his good heartmr boscorel stroked his nose with his forefingerso long as benjamin gets what he wantswhich is benjamins mess and five times the mess of any otherthere is no doubt of his good heart worse things than these said sir christopher were said of us when the civil wars began the kings troops would ride us down the country would not join us those of us who were not shot or cut down in the field would be afterwards hanged drawn and quartered yet we drove the king from his throne and then another king came back again so we go up and so we go down but about this expedition and about these boys my mind misgives me soninlaw sir christopher said solemnly i am now old and the eyes of my mind are dim so that i no longer discern the signs of the times or follow the current of the stream moreover we hear but little news so that i cannot even see any of those signs yet to men in old age before they pass away to the rest provided by the lord there cometh sometimes a vision by which they are enabled to see clearly when younger men are still groping their way in a kind of twilight monmouth hath landed my boys are with him they are rebels should the rising fail their lives are forfeit and that of my dear friend dr comfort eykinsyea and my life as well belike because i have been a consenting party ruin and death will in that event fall upon all of us whether it will so happen i know not nor do i weigh the chance of that event against the voice of conscience duty and honour my boys have obeyed that voice they have gone forth to conquer or to die my vision doth not tell me what will happen to them but it shows me the priest flying from the country the king flying from the throne and that fair angel whom we call freedom of conscience returning to bless the land to know that the laws of god will triumphought not that to reconcile a man already seventyfive years of age to death even a death upon the gallows what matter for this earthly body so that it be spent until the end in the service of the lord chapter xxi we wait for the end i have said that my father from the beginning unto the end of this business was as one beside himself being in an ecstasy or rapture of mind insomuch that he heeded nothing the letters he sent out to his friends the nonconformists either brought no answer or else they heaped loads of trouble being intercepted and read upon those to whom they were addressed but he was not moved the defection of his friends and of the gentry caused him no uneasiness nay he even closed his eyes and ears to the drinking the profane oaths and the riotous living in the camp others there were likeminded with himself who saw the hand of the lord in this enterprise and thought that it would succeed by a miracle the desertions of the men which afterwards followed and the defection of those who should have joinedthese things were but the weeding of the host which should be still further weededas in a wellknown chapter in the book of judgesuntil none but the righteous should be left behind these things he preached daily and with mighty fervour to all who would listen but these were few in number as regards his wife and daughter he took no thought for them at all being wholly enwrapped in his work he did not so much as ask if we had moneyto be sure for fiveandtwenty years he had never asked that questionor if we were safely bestowed or if we were well never have i seen any man so careless of all earthly affections when he considered the work of the lord but when the time came for the army to march what were we to do where should we be bestowed as to following the army said robin that is absurd we know not whither we may march or what the course of events may order you cannot go home without an armed escort for the country is up the clubmen are out everywhere to protect their cattle and horses a rough and rude folk they would be to meet and the gipsies are robbing and plundering can you stay here until we come back or until the country hath settled down again miss blake generously promised that we should stay with her as long as we chose adding many kind things about myself out of friendship and a good heart and so it was resolved that we should remain in taunton where no harm could befall us while my father still accompanied the army to exhort the soldiers i will take care of him said barnaby he shall not preach of a morning till he hath taken breakfast nor shall he go to bed until he hath had his supper so long as the provisions last out he shall have his ration after that i cannot say maybe we shall all go on short commons as hath happened to me already and truth to tell i love it not all these things belong to the voyage and are part of our luck farewell therefore mother heart upall will go well kiss me sis we shall all come back again never fear king monmouth shall be crowned in westminster dad shall be archbishop of canterbury and i shall be captain of a kings ship all our fortunes shall be made and you sis shall have a great estate and shall marry whom you pleaserobin or another as for the gentry who have not come forward hang em well divide their estates between us and so change places and they will be so astonished at not being shot for cowardice that they will rejoice and be glad to clean our boots thus shall we all be happy so they marched away monmouth being now at the head of an army seven thousand strong and all in such spirits that you would have thought nothing could withstand them and when i consider and remember how that army marched away with the cheers of the men and the laughter and jokes of the young recruits the tears run down my cheeks for thinking how their joy was turned to mourning and life was exchanged for death the last i saw of robin was that he was turning in his saddle to wave his hand his face full of confidence and joy the only gloomy face in the whole army that morning was the face of humphrey afterwards i learned that almost from the beginning he foresaw certain disaster in the first place none of those on whom the exiles of holland had relied came into camp these were the backbone of the protestant partythe sturdy blood that had been freely shed against charles i this was a bitter disappointment next he saw in the army nothing but a rabble of country lads with such officers as captain hucker the sergemaker instead of the country gentlemen with their troops as had been expected and from the beginning he distrusted the leaderseven the duke himself so he hung his head and laughed not with the rest but his doubts he kept locked up in his own heart robin knew none of them it was a pretty sight to see the taunton maids walking out for a mile and more with their lovers who had joined monmouth they walked handinhand with the men they wore the monmouth favours they had no more doubt or fear of the event than their sweethearts those who visit taunton now may see these women now grown old creeping about the streets lonely and sorrowful mindful still of that sunday morning when they saw their lovers for the last time when i consider the history of this expedition i am amazed that it did not succeed it was surely by a special judgment of god that the victory was withheld from monmouth and reserved for william i say not presumptuously that the judgment was pronounced against the duke on account of his sinful life but i think it was the will of heaven that the country should endure for three years the presence of a prince who was continually seeking to advance the catholic religion the people were not yet ripe perhaps for that universal disgust which caused them without bloodshed in this island at least to pull down king james from his throne when i say i consider the temper and the courage of that great army which left taunton greater than any which the king could bring against it when i consider the multitudes who flocked to the standard at bridgwater i am lost in wonder at the event from sunday the st when the army marched out of taunton till the news came of their rout on sedgemoor we heard nothing certain about them on tuesday the duke of albemarle hearing that the army had gone occupied taunton with the militia and there were some who expected severities on account of the welcome given to the duke and the recruits whom he obtained here but there were no acts of revenge that i heard ofand indeed he did not stay long in the town as for us we remained under the shelter of miss blakes roof and daily expected news of some great and signal victory but none came save one letter every day we looked for this news and every day we planned and laid down the victorious march for our army they will first occupy bristol said miss blake that is certain because there are many stout protestants in bristol and the place is important once master of that great city our king will get possession of ships and so will have a fleet there are no doubt plenty of arms in the town with which he will be able to equip an army ten times greater than that which he now has then withsay thirty thousand menhe will march on london the militia will of course lay down their arms or desert at the approach of this great and resolute army the kings regiments will prove i expect to be protestants every man oxford will open her gates london will send out her trainbands to welcome the deliverer and so our king will enter in triumph and be crowned at westminster abbey one king james succeeding another then there shall be restored to this distracted countrybeing a schoolmistress miss blake could use language worthy of the dignity of historythe blessings of religious freedom and the pure word of god stripped of superstitious additions made by man shall be preached through the length and breadth of the land what shall be done i asked with the bishops they shall be suffered to remain she said speaking with a voice of authority for those congregations which desire a prelacy but stripped of their titles and of their vast revenues we will not persecute but we will never suffer one church to lord it over another oh when will the news come where is the army now the letter of which i have spoken was from robin sweetheart he said all goes well so far at bridgwater we have received a welcome only second to that of taunton the mayor and aldermen proclaimed our king at the high cross and the people have sent to the camp great store of provisions and arms of all kinds we are now six regiments of foot with a thousand cavalry besides the kings own bodyguard we have many good friends at bridgwater especially one mr roger hoar who is a rich merchant of the place and is very zealous in the cause your father preached on sunday evening from the text deuteronomy vii ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire it was a most moving discourse which fired the hearts of all who heard it they say that our chief is downhearted because the nobility and gentry have not come in they only wait for the first victory after which they will come in by hundreds but some of our men look forward to depriving them of their estates and dividing them among themselves and already the colonels and majors are beginning to reckon up the great rewards which await them as for me there is but one reward for which i praynamely to return unto bradford orcas and to the arms of my sweet saint lord churchill is reported to be at chard there has been a brush in the forest of neroche between the scouts and it is said that all the roads are guarded so that recruits shall be arrested or at least driven back perhaps this is the reason why the gentry sit down barnaby says that so far there have been provisions enough and to spare and he hopes the present plenty may continue no ships crew can fight he says on half rations our march will be on bristol i hope and believe that when we have gotten that great town our end is sure humphrey continueth glum many women there were who passed that time in prayer continually offering up supplications on behalf of husband brother lover or son but at taunton the vicar one walter harte a zealous high churchman came forth from hiding and with the magistrates said prayers daily for king james ii to tell what follows is to renew a time of agony unspeakable yet must it be told farewell happy days of hope and confidence farewell the sweet exchange of dreams farewell to our lovely hero the gracious duke all the troubles that mans mind can conceive were permitted to be rained upon our headsdefeat wounds death prisonnay for me such a thing as no one could have expected or even fearedsuch a fate as never entered the mind of man to invent when the duke marched out of bridgwater across sedgemoor to glastonbury the weather which had been hot and fine became cold and rainy which made the men uncomfortable at glastonbury they camped in the ruins of the old abbey thence they went to shepton mallet the spirits of the men still being high from shepton mallet they marched to a place called pensford only five miles from bristol here they heard that the bridge over the avon at keynsham was broken down this being presently repaired the army marched across they were then within easy reach of bristol and now began the disasters of the enterprise up to this time everything had prospered had the duke boldly attacked bristoli speak not of my own wisdom having none in such matters but from others wisdomhe would have encountered no more than twenty companies or thereabouts of militia and a regiment of two hundred and fifty horse moreover bristol was full of dissenters who wanted nothing but encouragement to join the protestant champion not only the dukes friends but also his enemies agree in declaring that it wanted nothing but courage to take that great rich and populous city where he would have found everything that he wantedmen and money arms and ammunition i cannot but think that for his sins or for the sins of the nation a judicial blindness was caused to fall upon the duke so that he chose of two ways open to him that which led to his destruction in short he turned away from bristol and drew up his forces against bath when he summoned that city to surrender they shot his herald and scoffed at him then instead of taking the town the duke retired to philips norton where tis said he expected some great reinforcements but none came and he now grew greatly dejected showing his dejection in his face which could conceal nothing yet he fought an action with his halfbrother the duke of grafton in which he was victorious a thing which ought to have helped him in this action lieutenant blake miss blakes cousin was killed from philips norton the army marched to frome and here such was the general despondency that two thousand mena third of the whole armydeserted in the night and returned to their own homes i think also it was at frome that they learned the news of lord argyles discomfiture then a council was held at which it was proposed that the army should be disbanded and ordered to return seeing that the king had proclaimed a pardon to all who would peacefully lay down their arms and return home and that the duke with lord grey and those who would be certainly exempted from that pardon should make the best of their way out of the country alas here was a way open to the safety of all those poor men but again was the duke permitted to choose the other waythat namely which led to the destruction of his army and himself yet they say that he himself recommended the safer course he must have known that he wanted arms and ammunition that his men were deserting and that no more recruits came in colonel venner one of his principal men was at this juncture sent away to holland in order to get assistance in arms and money and the kings proclamation of pardon was carefully kept from the knowledge of the soldiers on july the th the army returned to bridgwater and now dr hooke chaplain to the army and some of the officers were sent away secretly in order to raise an insurrection in london and elsewhere the only hope being that risings in various parts would call away some of the kings forces from the west some of the taunton men in the army rode from bridgwater to see their friends but we women who for the most part remained at home learned no news save that as yet there had been no signal victory we did not hear of the large desertions nor of the dukes despondency therefore we continued in our fools paradise and looked every day for some great and crowning mercy those who are on the side of the lord are always expecting some special interference whereas they ought to be satisfied with being on the right side whether victory or defeat be intended for them in this enterprise i doubt not that those godly men there were i dare say some godly men who fell in battle or were afterwards executed received their reward and that a far far greater reward than their conduct deservedfor who can measure the short agony of death beside the everlasting life of glory and joy unspeakable the last day of this fatal expedition was sunday the fifth day of july so that it took no more than three weeks in all between its first beginning and its failure only three weeks but how much longer was it before the punishment and the expiation were concluded nay are they even yet concluded when thousands of innocent women and children still go in poverty and mourning for the loss of those who should have worked for them in the morning my father preached to the soldiers on the text joshua xxii the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day and now the time was come when the last battle was to be fought the earl of feversham who had been at somerton marched this day across sedgemoor and encamped at weston zoyland which is but five or six miles from bridgwater now it chanced that one william sparke of chedzoy hearing of this advance climbed the church tower and by aid of a spyingglass such as sailors use at sea he discerned clearly the approach of the army and its halt at weston being a wellwisher to the duke he sent one of his men richard godfrey by name with orders to spy into and learn the position and numbers of the earls army and to carry his information straightway to bridgwater this duty the fellow promised and most faithfully performed the duke had already learned the approach of lord feversham and being now wellnigh desperate with his continued losses and seeing his army gradually wasting away with no fresh recruits he had resolved upon not waiting to be attacked but on a retreat northwards hoping to get across the bridge at keynsham and so march into shropshire and cheshire where still he hoped to raise another army but says he who hath helped me with this brief account of the expedition the retreat which would have been harassed by lord fevershams horse would have turned into flight the men would have deserted in all directions and when the remains of the army arrived at keynsham bridge they would certainly have found it occupied by the duke of beaufort the carriages were already loaded in readiness for this march it was to begin at nightfall when the arrival of the man godfrey and the news that he brought caused the duke to change everything for he now perceived that such a chance was offered him as had never before occurred since his landing viz a night surprise and if he were fortunate the rout of the kings best troops it is said that had the duke shown the same boldness in the matter of bristol that he showed in this night attack he would have gained that city first and his own cause next nor did it appear at all a desperate attempt for though lord feversham had men with him horse and foot with sixteen fieldpieces the duke had nearly foot counting those armed with pikes and scythes and horse with four fieldpieces and though the kings troops included many companies of grenadiers with a battalion of that famous regiment the coldstream guards and some hundred horse of the kings regiment and dragoons the duke had with him at least men well armed and resolute as the event showed besides this he had the advantage of the surprise and confusion of a night attack and in addition the camp was not entrenched the troopers had all gone to bed the footsoldiers were drinking cider and the officers were reported to be all drunk therefore it was resolved that the intended flight into shropshire should be abandoned and that the whole matter should be brought to an issue that very night had the attack succeeded all might yet have gone well with the duke his enemies boasted that his raw country lads would be routed at the first charge of regular soldiers if he proved the contrary those who had deserted him would have returned those who held aloof would join it was not the cause which found men lukewarm it was the doubtand nothing but the doubtwhether the dukes enterprise would be supported and i never heard that any found aught but commendation of the boldness and spirit which brought us to the battle of sedgemoor all that day we spent in quiet meditation in prayer in the reading of the bible and in godly discourses and herein i must commend the modesty as well as the piety of miss susan blake in that she invited my mother as her elder and the wife of an eminent minister to conduct the religious exercises though as the hostess she might have demanded that privilege we stirred not abroad at all that day the meetinghouses which had been opened when the duke marched in were now closed again in the evening while we sat together discoursing upon the special mercies vouchsafed to the people of the lord a strange thing happened nay i do not say that news may not have reached taunton already of the dukes intentions and of the position of the kings forces but this seems incredible since it was not knownexcept to the council by whom it was decidedtill late in the afternoon and it was not to be thought that these would hurry to spread the news abroad and so ruin the whole affair the window being open then we could hear the voices of those who talked in the street below now there passed two men and they were talking as they went said oneand these were the words we heard i tell thee that the duke will have no more to do than to lock the stable doors and so seize the troopers in their beds we all started and listened the voice below repeated i say sir and i have it first hand that he hath but to lock the stable doors and so seize all the troopers in their beds then they passed on their way said my mother my husband hath told me that not only may the conscience be awakened by a word which seemeth chance but the future may be revealed by words which were perhaps meant in another sense what we have heard this evening may be a foretelling of victory my children let us pray and so to bed chapter xxii the day after the fight it was five oclock when i awoke next morning though the hour was so early i heard a great trampling and running about the streets and looking out of window i saw a concourse of the townspeople gathered together listening to one who spoke to them but in the middle of his speech they broke away from him and ran to another speaker and so distractedly and with such gestures that they were clearly much moved by some news the nature of which i could not guess for in some faces there was visible the outward show of triumph and joy and on others there lay plainly visible the look of amazement or stupefaction and in the street i saw some women weeping and crying what had happened oh what had happened then while i was still dressing there burst into the room susan blake herself but half dressed her hair flying all abroad the comb in her hand rejoice she cried oh rejoice and give thanks unto the lord what did we hear last night that the duke had but to shut the stable doors and seize the troopers in their beds look out of window see the people running and listening eagerly oh tis the crowning mercy that we have looked for the lord hath blown and his enemies are scattered remember the strange words we heard last night what said the unknown mannay he said it twice the duke had but to lock the stable doors nay and yesterday i saw and last night i heard the screechowl thricewhich was meant for the ruin of our enemies oh alice alice this is a joyful day but look i said they have a downcast look they run about as if distracted and some are wringing their hands tis with excess of joy she replied looking out of the window with me though her hair was flying in the wind they are so surprised and so rejoiced that they cannot speak or move but there are women weeping and wailing why do they weep it is for those who are killed needs must in every great victory that some are killedpoor brave fellowsand some are wounded nay my dear thou hast three at least at the camp who are dear to thee and god knows i have many let us pray that we do not have to weep like those poor women she was so earnest in her looks and words and i myself so willing to believe that i doubted no longer listen oh listen she cried never never before have bells rung a music so joyful to my heart for now the bells of the great tower of st marys began to ring clash clash clash all together as if they were cracking their throats with joy and at the sound of the bells those men in the street who seemed to me stupefied as by a heavy blow put up their hands to their ears and fled as if they could not bear the noise and the women who wept wrung their hands and shrieked aloud in anguish as if the joy of the chimes mocked the sorrow of their hearts poor creatures said susan from my heart i pity them but the victory is ours and now it only remains to offer up our humble prayers and praises to the throne of all mercy so we knelt and thanked god o lord we thank and bless thee o lord we thank and bless thee cried susan the tears of joy and gratitude running down her cheeks outside the noise of hurrying feet and voices increased and more women shrieked and still the joybells clashed and clanged o lord we thank thee o lord we bless thee susan repeated on her knees her voice broken with her joy and triumph twas all that she could say i declare that at that moment i had no more doubt of the victory than i had of the sunshine there could be no doubt the joybells were ringing how should we know that the rev mr harte the vicar caused them to be rung and not our friends there could be no manner of doubt the people running to and fro in the street had heard the news and were rushing to tell each other and to hear morethe women who wept were mothers or wives of the slain again we had encouraged each other with assurances of our success so that we were already fully prepared to believe that it had come had we not seen a splendid army seven thousand strong march out of taunton town led by the bravest man and most accomplished soldier in the english nation was not the army on the lords side were we not in a protestant country were not the very regiments of the king protestants why go on and yetoh sad to thinkeven while we knelt and prayed the army was scattered like a cloud of summer gnats by a shower and a breeze and hundreds lay dead upon the field and a thousand men were prisoners and many were already hanging in gemmaces upon the gibbets where they remained till king williams coming suffered them to be taken down and the rest were flying in every direction hoping to escape o lord we thank thee o lord we bless thee while thus we prayed we heard the door below burst open and a trampling of a mans boots and susan hastily rolling up her hair ran downstairs followed by mother and myself there stood barnaby thank god one of our lads was safe out of the fight his face and hands were black with powder his red coat which had been so fine was now smirched with mud and stained with i know not whatmarks of weather of dust and of gunpowder the righthand side was torn away he had no hat upon his head and a bloody clout was tied about his forehead barnaby i cried captain barnaby cried susan clasping her hands my son cried mother oh thou art wounded quick alice childa basin of water quick naytis but a scratch he said and there is no time for nursing whenwherehow we all cried together was the victory won is the enemy cut to pieces is the war finished victory he repeated in his slow waywhat victory give me a drink of cider and if there is a morsel of victual in the house i hurried to bring him both cold meat and bread and a cup full of cider he began to eat and drink why he said talking between his mouthfuls if the worst comes tis better to face it with ayour health madam he finished the cider another cup sister if you love me i have neither eaten nor drunk since yesterday at seven oclock or thereabouts he said no more until he had cleared the dish of the gammon and left nothing but the bone this he dropped into his pocket when the provisions are out he said wisely there is good gnawing in the shankbone of a ham then he drank up the rest of the cider and looked around victory did someone speak of victory yeswhere was it tell us quick well there was in some sort a victory but the king had it what mean you barnaby the king had itwhat king not king monmouth that king is riding away to find some port and get some ship i take it which will carry him back to holland barnaby what is it oh what is it tell us all all there is to tell sister is that our army is clean cut to pieces and that those who are not killed or prisoners are making off with what speed they may as for me i should have thrown away my coat and picked up some old duds and got off to bristol and so aboard ship and away but for dad barnaby cried my mother what hath happened to him where is he i said mother he replied very slowly and looking in her face strangely that i would look after him didnt i well when we marched out of bridgwater at nightfall nothing would serve but he must go too i think he compared himself with moses who stood afar off and held up his arms never was there any man more eager to get at the enemy than dad if he had not been a minister what a soldier he would have made go onquick barnaby i can go sister no quicker than i can that is quite sure where is he my son asked my mother barnaby jerked his thumb over his left shoulder he is over there and he is safe enough for the present well after the battle was over and it was no use going on any longer monmouth and lord grey having already run away run away run away run away sister aboard ship the captain stands by the crew to the last and if they strike he is prisoner with them ashore the general runs away and leaves his men to find out when they will give over fighting we fought until there was no more ammunition and then we ran with the rest now i had not gone far before i saw lying on the moor at my very feet the poor old dad oh he was quite pale and i thought he was dead so i was about to leave him when he opened his eyes what cheer dad he said nothing so i felt his pulse and found him breathing but what cheer dad i asked him again get up if thou canst and come with me he looked as if he understood me not and he shut his eyes again now when you run away the best thing is to run as fast and to run as far as you can yet i could not run with dad lying in the road half dead so while i tried to think what to do because the murdering dragoons were cutting us down in all directions there came galloping past a pony harnessed to a kind of gocart where i suppose there had been a barrel or two of cider for the soldiers the creature was mad with the noise of the guns and i had much ado to catch him and hold the reins while i lifted dad into the cart when i had done that i ran by the side of the horse and drove him off the road across the moor which was rough going but for dear life one must endure much to north marton where i struck the road to taunton and brought him safe so far take me to him barnaby said my mother take me to him why mother he said kindly i know not if tis wise for look youif they catch us me they will hang or shoot though dad they may let go for he is sped alreadyand for a tender heart like thine twould be a piteous sight to see thy son hanging from a branch with a tight rope round his neck and thy husband dead on a handcart barnaby take me to himtake me to him oh is it true is it true oh captain barnaby is it really true then why are the bells aringing clash clash clash the bells rang out louder and louder one would have thought the whole town was rejoicing yet there were a thousand lads in the army belonging to taunton town alone and i know not how many ever came home again they are ringing said barnaby because king monmouths army is scattered and the rebellion is all over well we have had our chance and we are undone now must we sing small again madam he said earnestly addressing susan if i remember right they were your hands that carried the naked sword and the bible sir they were my hands i am proud of that day and they were your scholars who worked the flags and gave them to the duke that day when you walked in a procession they were my scholars she said proudly then madam seeing that we have if all reports be true a damned unforgiving kind of king my advice to you is to follow my example and run hoist all sail madam and fly to some portany port fly false colours when hanging flogging branding and the like amusements set in i think they will remember the maids of taunton that is my advice madam sir said susan bravely though her cheek grew pale when he spoke of floggings and brandings i thank you whither should i fly needs must i stay here and bear whatever affliction the lord may lay upon me and since our protestant hero is defeated methinks it matters little what becomes of any of us why barnaby shook his head king monmouth is defeated that is most true but we who survive have got ourselves to look after sister get a basket and put into it provisions what will you have barnaby everything that you can find cold bacon for choice and bread and a bottle of drink if you have any andall you can lay hands upon with your good leave madam oh sir take alltake all i would to god that everything i have in the world could be used for the succour of these my friends and with that she began to weep and to cry i filled a great basket with all that there was in the house and he took it upon his arm and then we went away with many tears and fond farewells from this kind soul who had done so much for the cause and was now about to pay so heavy a penalty for her zeal outside in the street the people recognised barnaby for one of monmouths captains and pressed round him and asked him a thousand questions but he answered shortly we were drubbed i tell you king monmouth hath run away we have all run away how should i know how many are killed every man who doth not wish to be hanged had best run away and hide the game is upfriend we are sped what more can i say how do i know in the devils name whose fault it was how can i tell madam if your son is safe if he is safe make him creep into a hidingplaceand so on to a hundred who crowded after him and questioned him as to the nature and meaning of the defeat seeing that no more news could be got from him the people left off following us and we got out of the town on the east side where the road leads to ilminster but it is a bad road and little frequented here barnaby looked about him carefully to make sure that no one was observing us and then finding that no one was within sight he turned to the right down a grassy lane between hedges tis this way that i brought him he said poor old dad he can now move neither hand nor foot and his legs will no more be any use to him yet he seemed in no pain though the jolting of the cart must have shaken him more than a bit the lane led into a field and that field into another and a smaller one with a plantation of larches on two sides and a brook shaded with alders on a third side in one corner was a linney with a thatched roof supported on wooden pillars in front and closed in at back and sides it was such a meadow as is used for the pasture of cattle and the keeping of a bull at the entrance of this meadow barnaby stopped and looked about him with approbation here he said slowly is a hidingplace fit for king monmouth himself a road unfrequented the rustics all gone off to the warsthough now i doubt not having had their bellyfull of fighting i suppose there were once cattle in the meadow but they are either driven away by the clubmen for safety or they have been stolen by the gipsies no troopers will this day come prying along this road or if they do search the wood which is unlikely they will not look in the linney here can we be snug until we make up our minds what course is best barnaby i said take us to my father without more speech i have laid him he went on upon the bare ground in the linney but it is soft and dry lying and the air is warm though last night it rained and was cold he looks happy mother and i doubt if he hath any feeling left in his limbs once i saw a man shot in the backbone and never move afterwards but he lived for a bit here he is alas lying motionless on his back his head bare his white hair lying over his face his eyes closed his cheek white and no sign of life in him except that his breast gently heaved was my father then certain words which he had uttered came back to my memory what matters the end were the words he said if i have freedom of speech for a single day he had enjoyed that freedom for three weeks my mother threw herself on her knees beside him and raised his head ah my heart she cried my dear heart my husband have they killed thee speak my dearspeak if thou canst art thou in pain can we do aught to relieve thee oh is this the end of all but my father made no reply he opened his eyes but they did not move he looked straight before him but he saw nothing and this until the end was the burden of all he spoke no word to show that he knew anyone or that he was in pain or that he desired anything he neither ate nor drank yet for many weeks longer he continued to live chapter xxiii in hiding thus we began our miserable flight thus in silence we sat in the shade of the linney all the morning outside the blackbird warbled in the wood and the lark sang in the sky but we sat in silence not daring so much as to ask each other if those things were real or if we were dreaming a dreadful dream still and motionless lay my fathers body as if the body of a dead man he felt no painof that i am assured it makes me sick even to think that he might have suffered pain from his wound he had no sense at all of what was going on yet once or twice during the long trance or paralysis into which he had fallen he opened his lips as if to speak and he breathed gentlyso that he was not dead barnaby for his part threw himself upon his face and laying his head upon his arm fell asleep instantly the place was very quiet at the end of the meadow was a brook and there was a wood upon the other side we could hear the prattling of the water over the pebbles outside the linney a great elmtree stretched out its branches presently i saw a squirrel sitting upon one and peering curiously at us not at all afraid so still and motionless we were i remember that i envied the squirrel he took no thought even for his daily bread he went not forth to fight and the hedgesparrows no more afraid than if the linney was empty hopped into the place and began picking about among the straw and so the hours slowly passed away and by degrees i began to understand a little better what had happened to us for at the first shock one could not perceive the extent of the disaster and we were as in a dream when we followed barnaby out of the town the great and splendid army was destroyed that gallant hero the duke was in flight those of the soldiers who were not killed or taken prisoners were running hither and thither trying to escape my father was wounded stricken to death as it seemed and deprived of power to move to feel or to think while i considered this i remembered again how he had turned his eyes from gazing into the sky and asked me what it mattered even if the end would be death to him and ruin unto all of us and i do firmly believe that at that moment he had an actual vision of the end and really saw before his eyes the very things that were to come to pass and that he knew all along what the end would be yet he had delivered his soulwhy then he had obtained his prayerand by daily exhortation had doubtless done much to keep up the spirit of those in the army who were sober and godly men did he also like sir christopher have another vision which should console and encourage him did he see the time to follow when a greater than the duke should come and bring with him the deliverance of the country there are certain gracious words with which that vision closes the last which he did expound to us the vision i mean of the basket of summer fruit did those words ring in his mind and comfort him even in the prospect of his own end then my thoughts which were swift and yet beyond my control left him and considered the case of barnaby he had been a captain in the green regiment he would be hanged for certain if he were caught my sweetheart my robin had also been a captain in the dukes army all the dukes officers would be hanged if they were caught but perhaps robin was already deaddead on the battlefieldhis face white his hands stiff blood upon him somewhere and a cruel wound upon his dear body oh robin yet i shed no tears humphrey who had been one of the dukes chyrurgeons he would also be surely hanged if he were caught whysince all would be hangedwhy not hang mother and me as well and so an end about noon barnaby began to stir then he grunted and went to sleep again presently he moved once more then he rolled over on his broad back and went to sleep again it was not until the sun was quite low that he awoke sitting up suddenly and looking about him with quick suspicion as one who hath been sleeping in the country of an enemy or where wild beasts are found then he sprang to his feet and shook himself like a dog sister he said thou shouldst have awakened me earlier i have slept all the day well we are safe so far here he looked cautiously out of the linney towards the wood and the road so far i say we are safe i take it we had best not wait until tomorrow but budge tonight for not only will the troopers scour the country but they will offer rewards and the gipsiesay and even the countryfolkwill hasten to give information out of their greedy hearts we must budge this very night whither shall we go barnaby he went on as if he had not heard my question we shall certainly be safe here for tonight but for tomorrow i doubt best not run the chance for today their hands are full they will be hanging the prisoners some they will hang first and try afterwards some they will try first and hang afterwards what odds if they are to be hanged in the end the cider orchards never had such fruit as they will show this autumn if the king prove revengefulas to judge by his sour face he will be here he cursed the king his sour face his works and ways his past his present and his future in round language which i hope his wounded father did not hear we must lie snug for a month or two somewhere until the unlucky monmouth men will be suffered to return home in peace ay twill be a month and more i take it before the country will be left quiet a month and moreand dad not able to crawl where shall we lie snug barnaby that sister is what i am trying to find out how to lie snug with a couple of women and a wounded man who cannot move twas madness of the poor old dad to bring thee to the camp child for now we cannotany of uspart company and if we stay together twill maybe bring our necks to the halter leave us barnaby i said oh leave us to do what we can for the poor sufferer and save thyself ta ta ta sisterknowest not what thou sayest let me consider there may be some way of safety as for provisions now we have the basket fullenough for two days saywhat the plague did dad the poor old man want with women when fighting was on hand when the fighting is done i grant you women with the tobacco and punch are much in place those are pretty songs now that i used to sing about women and drink barnaby is this a time to be talking of such things as drink and singing all times are good nevertheless all company is not fitting wherefore sis i say no more barnaby knowest thou aught of robin or of humphrey i know nothing they may be dead they may be wounded and prisoners much i fear knowing the spirit of the lads that both are killed nay i saw humphrey before the fight and he spoke to me what did humphrey say i asked why he hung his head and looked so glum seeing that we were at last going forth to meet the kings army this i said because i knew humphrey to be a lad of mettle though his arm is thin and his body is crooked i go heavy barnaby he said speaking low lest others should hear because i see plainly that unless some signal success come to us this our business will end badly then he began to talk about the thousands who were to have been raised all over the country how he himself had brought to the duke promises of support gathered all the way from london to bradford orcas and how his friends in holland even promised both men and arms but none of these promises had been kept how dad had brought promises of support from all the nonconformists of the west but hardly any save at taunton had come forward and how the army was melting away and no more recruits coming in and then he said that he had been the means of bringing so many to the duke that if they died their deaths would lie upon his conscience and he spoke lovingly of robin and of thee sister and so we parted and i saw him no more as for what he said i minded it not a straw many a croaker turns out in the long run to be brave in the fight doubtless he is dead and robin too both are dead i take it sis thou hast lost thy sweetheart cry a little my dear he added kindly twill ease the pain at thy heart tis natural for a woman to cry i cannot cry barnaby i wish i could the tears rise to my eyes but my throat is dry try a prayer or two sister twas wont to comfort the heart of my mother when she was in trouble a prayer brother i have done nothing but pray since this unfortunate rebellion began a prayer oh i cannot pray if i were to pray now it would be as if my words were echoed back from a wall of solid rock we were praying all yesterday we made the sabbath into a day of prayer without ceasing and this morning when you opened the door we were praising and thanking god for the mercy of the great victory bestowed upon us and at that time the poor brave men they were brave enough to the end said barnaby the poor brave men lying cold and dead upon the field among them maybe robin and the prisoners huddled together somewhere and men hanging already upon the gibbets we were praising godand my father lying on the ground stricken to death and thou a fugitive and all of us ruined prayer how could i pray from such a pit of woe childmy mother lifted her pale facein the darkest hour pray without ceasing even if there happen a darker hour than this in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made knownwith thanksgiving my daughter alas i could not obey the apostolic order twas too much for me so we fell into silence when the sun had quite gone down barnaby went forth cautiously presently he came back there is no one on the road he said we may now go on our way the air of taunton is dangerous to us it breeds swift and fatal diseases i have now resolved what to do i will lift my father upon the cart again and put in the pony four or five miles souwest or thereabouts is black down which is a nomansland thither will we go and hide in the combs where no one ever comes except the gipsies how shall we live barnaby that he said we shall find out when we come to look about us there is provision for two days the nights are warm we shall find cover or make it with branches there is water in the brooks and dry wood to burn there we may perhaps be safe when the country is quiet we will make our way across the hills to bradford orcas where no one will molest you and i can go off to bristol or lyme or wherever there are ships to be found when sailors are shipwrecked they do not begin by asking what they shall do on dry land they ask only to feel the stones beneath their feet we must think of nothing now but of a place of safety barnaby are the open hills a proper place for a wounded man why child for a choice between the hills and what else may happen if we stay here give me the hills even for a wounded man but indeedhe whispered so that my mother should not hear himhe will die death is written on his face i know not how long he will live but he must die never did any man recover from such evil plight he harnessed the pony to the cart which was little more than a couple of planks laid side by side and laid father upon them just as he had brought him from taunton my mother made a kind of pillow for him with grass tied up in her kerchief and so we hoped that he would not feel the jogging of the cart the stream said barnaby comes down from the hills let us follow its course upwards it was a broad stream with a shallow bed for the most part flat and pebbly and on either side of the stream lay a strip of soft turf broad enough for the cart to run upon so that as long as that lasted we had very easy going my mother and i walking one on each side so as to steady the pillow and keep the poor head upon it from pain but whether we went easy or whether we went rough that head made no sign of feeling aught and lay just as in the linney as if dead i cannot tell how long we went on beside that stream twas in a wild uncultivated country the ground ascended the stream became narrower and swifter presently the friendly strip of turf failed altogether and then we had trouble to keep the cart from upsetting i went to the ponys head and barnaby going behind the cart lifted it over the rough places and sometimes carried his end of it the night was chilly my feet were wet with splashing in the brook and i was growing faint with hunger when barnaby called a halt we are now he said at the head of the stream in half an hour or thereabouts it will be break of day let us rest mother you must eat something come sister tis late for supper and full early for breakfast take some meat and bread and half a cup of cider it is all i remember of that night chapter xxiv the camp in the comb our campingplace when i awoke in the morning i found to be near the head of a most beautiful comb or valley among the black down hills i knew it not at the time but it was not far from that old roman stronghold which we had passed on our way to taunton called castle ratch the hills on the somerset side are of a gentle or gradual slope and the valley was not deep but yet where we lay so grown over with trees as to afford a complete shelter and hidingplace while at our feet the brook took its rise in a green quagmire and began to make its way downwards among ferns and bushes and through a wild uncultivated country beyond which the farms and fields began the birds were singing the sun was already high and the air was warm though there was a fresh breeze blowing the warmth and sweetness filled my soul when i awoke and i sat up with joy until suddenly i remembered why we were here and who were here with me then my heart sank like a lump of lead in water i looked around my father lay just as he had been lying all the day before motionless white of cheek and as one dead save for the slight motion of his chest and the twitching of his nostril as i looked at him in the clear morning light it was borne in upon me very strongly that he was indeed dead inasmuch as his soul seemed to have fled he saw nothing he felt nothing if the flies crawled over his eyelids he made no sign of disturbance yet he breathed and from time to time he murmuredbut as one that dreameth beside him lay my mother sleeping worn out by the fatigues of the night barnaby had spread his coat to cover her so that she should not take cold and he had piled a little heap of dead leaves to make her a pillow he was lying at her feet head on arm sleeping heavily what should be done i wondered when next he woke first i went down the comb a little way till the stream was deep enough and there i bathed my feet which were swollen and bruised by the long walk up the comb though it was in the midst of so much misery there was a pleasure of dabbling my feet in the cool water and afterwards of walking about barefoot in the grass i disturbed an adder which was sleeping on a flat stone in the sun and it lifted its venomous head and hissed but did not spring upon me then i washed my face and hands and made my hair as smooth as without a comb it was possible when i had done this i remembered that perhaps my father might be thirsty or at least able to drink though he seemed no more to feel hunger or thirst so i filled the tin pannikinit was barnabyswith water and tried to pour a little into his mouth he seemed to swallow it and i gave him a little more until he would swallow no more observe that he took no other nourishment than a little water wine or milk or a few drops of broth until the end so i covered his face with a handkerchief to keep off the flies and left him then i looked into the basket all that there was in it would not be more than enough for barnabys breakfast unless his appetite should fail him by reason of fear though in truth he had no fear being captured or of anything else there was in it a piece of bacon a large loaf of bread a lump of cheese a bottle of cider nothing more when these provisions were gone what next could we venture into the nearest village and buy food or to the first farmhouse then we might fall straight into the jaws of the enemy who were probably running over the whole country in search of the fugitives could we buy without money could we beg without arousing suspicions if the people were wellinclined to the protestant cause we might trust them but how could we tell that so in my mind i turned over everything except the one thing which might have proved our salvation and that you shall hear directly also which was a very strange thing i quite forgot that i had upon me tied by a string round my waist and well concealed barnabys bag of goldtwo hundred and fifty pieces thus there was money enough and to spare i discovered next that our pony had run away in the night the cart was there but no pony to drag it well it was not much but it seemed an additional burden to bear i ventured a little way up the valley following a sheeptrack which mounted higher and higher i saw no sign anywhere of mans presence that i take it is marked in woods by circles of burnt cinders by trees felled by bundles of broom or fern tied up or by shepherds huts here there was nothing at all you would have said that the place had never been visited by man presently i came to a place where the woods ceased the last of the trees being much stunted and blown over from the west and then the top of the hill began not a sharp pico or point but a great open plain flat or swelling out here and there with many of the little hillocks which people say are ancient tombs and no trees at all but only bare turf so that one could see a great way off but there was no sign of man anywhere no smoke in the comb at my feet no shepherd on the hill at this juncture of our fortunes any stranger might be an enemy therefore i returned but so far well pleased barnaby was now awake and was inspecting the basket of provisions sister he said we must go upon half rations for breakfast but i hope unless my skill fails to bring you something better for supper the bread you shall have and mother the bacon may keep till tomorrow the cider you had better keep against such times as you feel worn out and want a cordial though a glass of nantz were better if nantz grew in the woods he looked around as if to see whether a miracle would not provide him with a flask of strong drink but seeing none shook his head as for me he went on i am a sailor and i understand how to forage therefore yesterday foreseeing that the provisions might give out i dropped the shank of the ham into my pocket now you shall see he produced this delicate morsel and sitting down began to gnaw and to bite into the bone with his strong teeth exactly like a dog this he continued with every sign of satisfaction for a quarter of an hour or so when he desisted and replaced the bone in his pocket we throw away the bones he said the dogs gnaw them and devour them think you that it is for their amusement not so but for the juices and the nourishment that are in and around the bone for the marrow and for the meat that still will stick in odd corners he went down to the stream with the pannikin and drank a cup or two of water to finish what they called a horses mealnamely the food first and the water afterwards and now he added i have breakfasted it is true that i am still hungry but i have eaten enough to carry me on for a while many a poor lad cast away on a desert shore would find a shank of a ham a meal fit for a king aye and a meal or two after that i shall make a dinner presently off this bone and i shall still keep it against a time when there may be no provision left then he looked about him shading his eyes with his hand let us consider he said the troopers i take it are riding along the roads whether they will ride over these hills i know not but i think they will not because their horses cannot well get up these combs certainly if they do it will not be by the way we came we are here therefore hidden away snug why should we budge nowhere is there a more deserted part of the country than black down on whose side we are and i do not think further that we should find anywhere a safer place to hide ourselves in than this comb where i dare to say no one comes unless it be the gipsies or the broomsquires all the year round and now they are all laden with the spoil of the armyfor after a battle this gentry swoop down upon the field like the great birds which i have seen abroad upon the carcases of drowned beasts and plunder the dead next they must go into town in order to sell their booty then they will be fain to drink about till all is spent so they will leave us undisturbed therefore we will stay here sister first i will go and try the old tricks by which i did often in the old time improve the fare at home next i will devise some way of making a more comfortable restingplace thank the lord for fine weather so far he was gone a couple of hours during that time my mother awoke her mind was broken by the suddenness of this trouble and she cared no more to speak sitting still by the side of her husband and watching for any change in him but i persuaded her to take a little bread and a cup of cider when barnaby came back he brought with him a blackbird a thrush and two woodpigeons he had not forgotten the tricks of his boyhood when he would often bring home a rabbit a hare or a basket of trout so that my chief terror that we might be forced to abandon our hidingplace through sheer hunger was removed but barnaby was full of all kinds of devices he then set to work with his great knife cutting down a quantity of green branches which he laid out side by side with their leaves on and then bound them together cleverly interlacing the smaller shoots and branches with each other so that he made a long kind of hurdle about six feet high this which by reason of the leaves was almost impervious to the wind he disposed round the trunks of three young trees growing near each other thus he made a small threecornered inclosure again he cut other and thicker branches and laid them over and across this hurdle and cut turf which he placed upon the branches so that here was now a hut with a roof and walls complete said i not that barnaby was full of devices there he said when all was ready is a house for you it will have to rain hard and long before the water begins to drop through the branches which make the roof and the slabs of turf well tis a shelter not so comfortable as the old cottage perhaps but nearly as commodious if it is not a palace it will serve us to keep off the sun by day and the dew by night next he gathered a great quantity of dry fern dead leaves and heather and these he disposed within the hut so that they made a thick and warm carpet or covering nay at night they even formed a covering for the feet and prevented one from feeling cold when all was done he lifted my father gently and laid him with great tenderness upon this carpet within the rude shelter this shall be a warmer night for thee than the last dad he said there shall be no jolting of thy poor bones what mother we can live here till the cold weather comes the wind will perhaps blow a bit through the leaves tonight but not much and tomorrow i will see to that be easy in your mind about the provisionsalas my poor mother was thinking of anything in the world except the provisionsthere are rabbits and birds in plenty we can catch them and eat them bread we must do without when what we have is gone and as for strong drink and tobaccohe sighed heavilythey will come again when better times are served out in these labours i helped as much as i was able and particularly in twisting the branches together and thus the whole day passed not tediously and without any alarms the labour being cheered by the hopefulness of barnabys honest face no one to look at that face could believe that he was flying for his life and would be hanged if he was caught after sunset we lit a fire but a small one only and well hidden by the woods so that its light might not be seen from below then barnaby dexterously plucked and trussed the birds and roasted them in the embers so that had my heart been at rest i should have had a most delicious supper and i confess that i did begin to pluck up a little courage and to hope that we might yet escape and that robin might be living after supper my mother prayed and i could join with more of resignation and something of faith alas in times of trial how easily doth the christian fall from faith the day before prayer seemed to me a mockery it was as if all prayer were addressed to a deaf god or to one who will not hear for our prayers had all been for safety and victory and we were suddenly answered with disaster and defeat after supper barnaby sat beside the embers and began to talk in a low voice twill be a sorrowful barleymow song this year he said a dozen brave lads from bradford alone will be dead not all dead barnaby oh not all i know not some are prisoners some are dead some are running away then he began to sing in a low voice heres a health to the barleymow i remember sister when i would run a mile to hear that song though my father flogged me for it in the morning tis the best song ever written he went on singing in a kind of whisper well drink it out of the nipperkin boys robinpoor robin he is deadwas a famous hand at singing it but humphrey found the words too rustical humphreywho is now dead toowas ever for fine words like mr boscorel well drink it out of the jolly brown bowl i think i see him nowpoor robin well he is no more he used to laugh in all our faces while he sang it well drink it out o the river my boys heres a health to the barleymow the river the well the pipe the hogshead the half hogshead the anker the halfanker the gallon the pottle the quart the pint the halfpint the quarter pint the nipperkin the jolly brown bowl my boys heres a health to the barleymow he trolled out the song in a melodious whisper oh barnaby how didst thou love good companionship with singing and drinking twill be lonely for thee sister at bradford when thou dost return sir christopher i take it will not long hold up his head and madam will pine away for the loss of robin and mother looks as if she would follow after so white and wan is she if she would speak or complain or cry it would comfort her poor soul twas a sad day for her when she married the poor old dad poverty and hard work and now a cruel endpoor mother barnaby you tear my heart nay child tis better to talk than to keep silence better have your heart torn than be choked with your pain thou art like unto a man who hath a wounded leg and if he doth not consent to have it cut off though the anguish be sharp he will presently bleed to death say to thyself therefore plain and clear robin is dead i have lost my sweetheart nonobarnabyi cannot say those cruel words oh i cannot say them i cannot feel that robin is truly dead put the case that he is living then he is either a prisoner or he is in hiding if a prisoner he is as good as dead because the dukes officers and the gentlemen who joined him they will never forgivethat is quite certain if i were a prisoner i should feel my neck already tightened if he is not a prisoner where is he to hidewhither betake himself i can get sailors duds and go abroad before the mast and ten to one nobody will find me out because dye see i can talk the sailors language and i know their manners and customs but robinwhat is robin to do if he is alive and this i say is doubtful best say to thyself i have lost my sweetheart so wilt thou all the sooner recover thy cheerfulness barnaby you know not what you say alas if my robin is deadif my boy is truly deadthen i ask for nothing more than swift deathspeedy deathto join him and be with him if he escape he will make for bradford orcas and hide in the corton woods that is quite certain they always make for home i would that we were in that friendly place so that you could go live in the cottage and bring provisions with tobacco and drink to us unsuspected and unseen when we have rested here a while we will push across the hills and try to get there by night but it is a weary way to drag that wounded man howeverhe broke off and said earnestlymake up thy mind child to the worst tis as if a shipwrecked man should hope that enough of the ship would float to carry him home withal make up thy mind we are all ruined and lostallallall thy father is dyingthy lover is deadthou art thyself in great danger by reason of that affair at taunton everything being gone turn round therefore and make thyself as comfortable as possible what will happen we know not therefore count every day of safety for gain and every meal for a respite he was silent for a while leaving me to think over what he had said here indeed was a philosopher things being all lost and our affairs in a desperate condition we were to turn round and make ourselves as comfortable as we could this i suppose is what sailors are wont to do certainly they are a folk more exposed to misfortune than others and therefore perhaps more ready to make the best of whatever happens barnaby i said presently how can i turn round and make myself comfortable the evening is still he said without replying see there is a bat and there another if it were not for the trouble in therehe pointed to the huti should be easy in my mind and contented i could willingly live here a twelvemonth why compared with the lot of the poor devils who must now be in prison what is ours they get the foul and stinking clink with bad food in the midst of wounded men whose hurts are putrefying with jail fever and with the whippingpost or the gallows to come we breathe sweet air we find sufficient foodtomorrow if i know any of the signs thou shalt taste a roasted hedgehog dish fit for a king i found at the bottom of the comb a pot left by some gipsies thou shalt have boiled sorrel and mushrooms to thy supper if we stay here long enough there will be nuts and blackberries and whortleberries pity a thousand pities there is not a drop of drink i dream of punch and hipsy think upon what remains even if thou canst not bear to think of what is lost hast ever seen a tall ship founder in the waves they close over her as she sinks and in an instant it is as if that tall ship with all her crew had never been in existence at all the army of monmouth is scattered and ruined well it is with us amidst these woods just as if there had been no army it has been a dream perhaps who can tell sometimes all the past seems to have been a dream it is all a dreampast and future there is no past and there is no future all is a dream but the present we have let us be content therewith he spoke slowly and with measured accents as one enchanted sometimes barnaby was but a rough and rude sailor at other times as these he betrayed signs of his early education and spoke as one who thought it is ten years and more since last i breathed the air of the hills i knew not that i loved so much the woods and valleys and the streams some day if i survive this adventure i will build me a hut and live here alone in the woods why if i were alone i should have an easy heart if i were driven out of one place i could find another i am in no hurry to get down among men and towns let us all stay here and be happy but there is dadwho lives not yet is not dead sister be thankful for thy safety in the woods and think not too much upon the dead we lived in this manner the weather being for the most part fine and warm but with showers now and then for a fortnight or thereabouts no one coming up the comb and there being still no sign of mans presence in the hills our daily fare consisted of the wild birds snared by barnaby such creatures as rabbits hedgehogs and the like which he caught by ingenious ways and trout from the brook which he caught with a twisted pin or by tickling them with his hand there were also mushrooms and edible leaves such as the nettle wild sorrel and the like of which he knew these we boiled and ate he also plucked the halfripe blackberries and boiled them to make a sour drink and one which like the cider loved by our people would grip his throat because he could not endure plain cold water and he made out of the bones of the birds a kind of thin broth for my father of which he daily swallowed a teaspoonful or so so that we fared well if not sumptuously the bread to be sure which barnaby left for mother and me was coming to the last crust and i know not how we should have got more without venturing into the nearest village now as i talked every night with my brother i found out what a brave and simple soul it wasalways cheerful and hopeful talking always as if we were the most fortunate people in the world instead of the most miserable and yet by keeping the truth before me preventing me from getting into another fools paradise as to our safety and robins escape such as that into which i had fallen after the army marched out of taunton i understand now that he was always thinking how to smooth and soften things for us so that we might not go distracted with anxiety and grief finding work for me talking about other thingsin short the most thoughtful and affectionate brother in all the world as for my mother he could do nothing to move her she still sat beside her wounded husband watching all day long for any sign of consciousness or change seeing that barnaby was so good and gentle a creature i could not understand how it was that in the old days he used to get a flogging most days for some offence or other so that i had grown up to believe him a very wicked boy indeed i put this question to him one night he put it aside for a while replying in his own fashion i remember dad he said before thou canst sister he was always thin and tall and he always stooped as he walked but his hair which now is white was brown and fell in curls which he could not straighten he was always mighty grave no one i am sure ever saw him laugh i have never seen him so much as smile except sometimes when he dandled thee upon his knee and thou wouldst amuse him with innocent prattle all his life he hath spent in finding out the way to heaven he did find the wayi suppose he hath truly discovered itand a mighty thorny and difficult way it is so that i know not how any can succeed in reaching port by such navigation the devil of it is that he believes there is no other way and he seemed never so happy as when he had found another trap or pitfall to catch the unwary and send them straight to hell for my part barnaby went on slowly i could never love such a life let others if they will find out rough and craggy ways that lead to heaven for my part i am content to jog along the plain and smooth high road with the rest of mankind though it brings us in the end to a lower place inhabited by the baser sort well i dare say i shall find mates there and we will certainly make ourselves as comfortable as the place allows let my father therefore find out what awaits him in the other world let me take what comes in this some of it is sweet and some is bitter some of it makes us laugh and sing and dance and some makes us curse and swear and bellow out as when one is lashed to the hatches and the cat falls on his naked back sometimes sister i think the naked negroes of the guiney coast the happiest people in the world do they trouble their heads about the way to heaven not they what comes they take and they ask no more has it made dad the happier to find out how few are those who will sit beside him when he hath his harp and crown not so he would have been happier if he had been a jolly ploughboy whistling to his team or a jolly sailor singing over his pannikin of drink of a saturday night he tried to make me follow in his footsteps he flogged me daily in the hope of making me take like himself to the trade of proving out of the holy bible that most people are surely damned the more he flogged the less i yearned after that trade till at last i resolved that come what would i would never thump a pulpit like him in conventicle or church then if you will believe me sister i grew tired of flogging which when it comes every day wearies a boy at fourteen or fifteen more than you would think now one day while i was dancing to the pipe and tabor with some of the village girls as bad luck would have it dad came by child of satan he roared seizing me by the ear which i verily thought he would have pulled off then to the girls your laughter shall be turned into mourning and so lugged me home and sent me supperless to bed with the promise of such a flogging in the morning as should make all previous floggings seem mere fleabites or joyous ticklings in comparison this decided me so in the dead of night i crept softly down the stairs cut myself a great hunch of bread and cheese and ran away and went to sea barnaby was it well doneto run away well sister tis done and if it was ill done tis by this time no doubt forgotten now remember i blame not my father before all things he would save my soul alive that was why he flogged me he knew but one way and along that way he would drive me so he flogged me the harder i blame him not yet had i remained he would doubtless be flogging me still now remember again that ever since i understood anything i have always been enraged to think upon the monstrous oppression which silenced him and brought us all to poverty and made my mother a gentlewoman born work her fingers to the bone and caused me to choose between being a beggarly scholar driven to teach brats and endure flouts and poverty or to put on an apron and learn a trade wherefore when i found that monmouth was going to hoist his flag i came with him in order to strike a blow and i hoped a good blow too at the oppressors you have struck that blow barnaby and where are we he laughed we are in hiding some of the kings troopers did i make to bite the dust they may hang me for it if they will they will not bring those troopers back to life wellsister i am sleepy good night we might have continued this kind of life i know not how much longer certainly till the cold nights came the weather continued fine and warm the hut kept off dews at night we lay warm among the heather and the ferns barnaby found a sufficiency of food my father grew no worse to outward seeming and we seemed in safety then an ill chance and my own foolishness marred all one day in the afternoon barnaby being away looking after his snares and gins i heard lower down the comb voices as of boys talking this affrighted me terribly the voices seemed to be drawing nearer now if the children came up as high as our encampment they could not fail to see the signs of habitation there was the hut among the trees and the iron pot standing among the grey embers of last nights fire the cart stood on one side we could not possibly remain hidden if they should come up so far and find us they would certainly carry the report of us down to the village i considered therefore what to do and then ran quickly down the comb keeping among the trees so as not to be seen after a little i discovered a little way off a couple of boys about nine years of age they were common village boys rosy faced and wholesome they carried a basket and they were slowly making their way up the stream stopping now to throw a stone at a squirrel and now to dam the running water and now to find a nut or filbert ripe enough to be eaten by the basket which they carried i knew that they were come in search of whortleberries for which purpose they would have to get quite to the end of the comb and the top of the hill therefore i stepped out of the wood and asked them whence they came and whither they were going they told me in plain somersetshire the language which i love and would willingly have written this book in it but for the unfortunate people who cannot understand it that they were sent by their parents to get whortleberries and that they came from the little village of corfe two miles down the valley this was all they had to say and they stared at me as shyly as if they had never before encountered a stranger i clearly perceive now that i ought to have engaged them in conversation and drawn them gently down the valley in the direction of their village until we reached the first appearance of a road when i could have bidden them farewell or sent them up the hill by another comb but i was so anxious that they should not come up any higher that i committed a great mistake and warned them against going on boys i said beware if you go higher up the comb you will certainly meet wild men who always rob and beat boys here they trembled though they had not a penny in the world ay boys and sometimes have been known to murder them turn backturn backand come no farther the boys were very much frightened partly at the apparition of a stranger where they expected to find no one and partly at the news of wild and murderous men in a place where they had never met with anyone at all unless it might have been a gipsy camp after gazing at me stupidly for a little while they turned and ran away as fast as their legs could carry them down the comb i watched them running and when they were out of sight i went back again still disquieted because they might return when i told barnaby in the evening he too was uneasy for he said the boys would spread abroad the report that there were people in the valley what people could there be but fugitives sister he said tomorrow morning must we change our quarters on the other side of the hills looking south or to the east in neroche forest we may make another camp and be still more secluded for tonight i think we are in safety what happened was exactly as barnaby thought for the lads ran home and told everybody that up in the comb there were wild men who robbed and murdered people that a lady had come out of the wood and warned them to go no farther lest they should be robbed and murdered they were certain it was a lady and not a countrywoman nor was it a witch nor a fairy or elf of whom there are many on black down no it was a lady this strange circumstance set the villagers atalking they talked about it at the inn whither they nightly repaired illustration boys i said beware if you go up higher you will certainly meet wild men in ordinary times they might have talked about it to their hearts content and no harm done but in these times talk was dangerous in every little village there are one or two whose wits are sharper than the rest and therefore they do instigate whatever mischief is done in that village at corfe the cobbler it was who did the mischief for he sat thinking while the others talked and he presently began to understand that there was more in this than his fellows imagined he knew the hills there were no wild men upon them who would rob and murder two simple village boys gipsies there were and broomsquires sometimes and hedgetearers but murderers of boysnone and who was this gentlewoman then he guessed the whole truth there were people lying hidden in the comb if people hidden they were monmouths rebels a reward would be given for their capture fired with this thought he grasped his cudgel and walked off to the village of orchard portman where as he had heard there was lying a company of grenadiers sent out to scour the country he laid his information and received the promise of reward he got that reward in short but nothing prospered with him afterwards his neighbours who were all for monmouth learned what he had done and shunned him he grew moody he fell into poverty who had been a thriving tradesman and he died in a ditch the judgments of the lord are sometimes swift and sometimes slow yet they are always sure who can forget the dreadful end of tom boilman as he was called the only wretch who could be found to cut up the limbs of the hanged men and dip them in the cauldrons of pitch for he was struck dead by lightningan awful instance of the wrath of god early next morning about five of the clock i sat before the hut in the shade barnaby was up and had gone to look at his snares suddenly i heard steps below and the sound as of weapons clashing against each other then a man came into sighta fellow he was with a leathern apron who stood gazing about him there was no time for me to hide because he immediately saw me and shouted to them behind to come on quickly then a dozen soldiers all armed ran out of the wood and made for the hut gentlemen i cried running to meet them whom seek you who are you asked one who seemed to be a sergeant over them why are you in hiding then a thought struck me i know not if i was wise or foolish sir i replied my father it is true was with the duke of monmouth but he was wounded and now lies dead in this hut you will suffer us to bury our dead in peace dead is he that will we soon see so saying he entered the hut and looked at the prostrate form he lifted one hand and let it drop it fell like the hand of one who is recently dead he bent over the body and laid his hand upon the forehead it was cold as death the lips were pale as wax and the cheeks were white he opened an eye there was no expression of light in it humph he said he seems dead how did he come here my mother and i drove him here for safety in yonder cart the pony hath run away that may be so that may be so he is dressed in a cassock what is his name he was dr comfort eykin an ejected minister and preacher in the dukes army a prize if he had been alive then a sudden suspicion seized him he had in his hand a drawn sword he pointed it at the breast of the dead man if he be truly dead he said another wound will do him no harm whereforehe made as if he would drive the sword through my fathers breast and my mother shrieked and threw herself across the body so he said with a horrid grin i find that he is not dead but only wounded my lads here is one of monmouths preachers but he is sore wounded oh i cried for the love of god suffer him to die in peace ay ay he shall die in peace i promise you so much meanwhile madam we will take better care of him in ilminster jail than you can do here the air is raw upon these hills the fellow had a glib tongue and a mocking manner you have none of the comforts which a wounded man requires they are all to be found in ilminster prison whither we shall carry him there will he have nothing to think about with everything found for him madam your father will be well bestowed with us at that moment i heard the footsteps of barnaby crunching among the brushwood fly barnaby fly i shrieked the enemy is upon us he did not fly he came running he rushed upon the soldiers and hurled this man one way and that man another swinging his long arms like a pair of cudgels had he had a cudgel i believe he would have sent them all flying but he had nothing except his arms and his fists and in a minute or two the soldiers had surrounded him each with a bayonet pointed and such a look in every mans eye as meant murder had barnaby moved surrender said the sergeant barnaby looked around leisurely well he said i suppose i must as for my name it is barnaby eykin and for my rank i was captain in the green regiment of the dukes valiant army stop said the sergeant drawing a paper from his pocket captain eykin he began to read has been a sailor rolls in his walk height about five foot five very broad in the shoulders long in the arms of great strength that is so said barnaby complacently legs short and figure stumpy what cried barnaby stumpy legs short and figure stumpy repeated the sergeant reading that is so set down is it then said barnaby looking down at his limbs twas a pity that with such legs as these i did not deny my name call these short brother chapter xxv ilminster clink how can i telloh how can i sit down to tell in cold blood the story of all that followed some parts of it for very pity i must pass over all that has been told or written of the bloody assize is most true and yet not half that happened can be told there are things i mean which the historian cannot for the sake of pity decency and consideration for living people relate even if he hath seen them you who read the printed page may learn how in one place so many were hanged in another place so many how some were hung in gemmaces so that at every crossroad there was a frightful gibbet with a dead man on it how some died of smallpox in the crowded prisons and some of fever and how judge jeffreys rode from town to town followed by gangs of miserable prisoners driven after him to stand their trial in towns where they would be known how the wretched sufferers were drawn and quartered and their limbs seethed in pitch and stuck up over the whole country how the women and boys of tender years were flogged through markettownsyou i say who read these things on the cold page presently even if you be a stickler for the right divine and hold rebellion as a mortal sin feel your blood to boil with righteous wrath the hand of the lord was afterwards heavy upon those who ordered these things nay at the very time this is a most remarkable judgment and one little known when this inhuman judge was thundering at his victimsso that some went mad and even dropped down dead with fearhe was himself as humphrey hath assured me suffering the most horrible pain from a dire disease so that the terrors of his voice and of his fiery eyes were partly due to the agony of his disease and he was enduring all through that assize in his own body pangs greater than any that he ordered as for his miserable end and the fate that overtook his master that we know and candid souls cannot but confess that here were truly judgments of god visible for all to see and acknowledge but no pen can truly depict what the eye saw and the ear heard during that terrible time and think you if it was a terrible and a wretched time for those who had no relations among the rebels and only looked on and saw these bloody executions and heard the lamentations of the poor women who lost their lovers or their husbands what must it have been for me and those like me whose friends and all whom they lovedyea all allwere overwhelmed in one common ruin and expected nothing but death our own misery i cannot truly set forth sometimes the memory of it comes back to me and it is as if long afterwards one should feel again the sharpness of the surgeons knife oh since i must write down what happened let me be brief and you who read it if you find the words cold where you would have looked for fire if you find no tears where there should have been weeping and wailing remember that in the mere writing have been shed again but these you cannot see the tears which belonged to that time and in the writing have been renewed but these you cannot hear the sobbings and wailings and terrors of that dreadful autumn the soldiers belonged to a company of grenadiers of trelawnys regiment stationed at ilminster whither they carried the prisoners first they handcuffed barnaby but on his giving his parole not to escape they let him go free and he proved useful in the handling of the cart on which my unhappy father lay and though the soldiers talk was ribald their jests unseemly and their cursing and swearing seemed verily to invite the wrath of god yet they proved honest fellows in the main they offered no rudeness to us nor did they object to our going with the prisoners nay they even gave us bread and meat and cider from their own provisions when they halted for dinner at noon barnaby walked sometimes with the soldiers and sometimes with us with them he talked freely and as if he were their comrade and not their prisoner with us he put in a word of encouragement or consolation such as mother we shall find a way out of this coil yet or sister we shall cheat tom hangman look not so gloomy upon it or again he reminded us that many a shipwrecked sailor gets safe ashore and that where there are so many they cannot hang all would the king he asked hang up the whole county of somerset but he had already told me too much in his heart i knew he had small hope of escape yet he preserved his cheerfulness and walked towards his prison to outward seeming as insensible of fear and with as unconcerned a countenance as if he were going to a banquet or a wedding this cheerfulness of his was due to a happy confidence in the ordering of things rather than to insensibility a sailor sees men die in many ways yet himself remains alive this gives him something of the disposition of the oriental who accepts his fate with outward unconcern whatever it may be perhaps i know not there may have been in his mind that religious assurance of which he had told me did barnaby at this period when death was very near unto him really believe that there was one religion for landsmen and another for sailorsone way to heaven for ministers another for seamen indeed i cannot tell yet how otherwise account for his courage and cheerfulness at all timeseven in the very presence of death brother he asked the sergeant we have been lying hid for a fortnight and have heard no news tell me how go the hangings why captain the fellow replied with a grin in this respect there is little for the rebels to complain of they ought to be satisfied so far with the attentions paid to them lord feversham hanged twenty odd to begin with captain adlan and three others are trussed up in chains for their greater honour and in order to put the rest in good heart one of them ran a race with a horse being promised his life if he should win when he had beaten the horse his lordship who was ever a merry man ordered him to be hanged just to laugh at him and hanged he was ay said barnaby thus do the indians in america torture their prisoners first and kill them afterwards there are two hundred prisoners laying in weston zoyland church the sergeant went on they would have been hanged too but the bishop interfered now they are waiting to be tried lord what signifies trial except to give them longer rope ay ay and how go things in bridgwater and taunton from weston to bridgwater there is a line of gibbets already in taunton twenty i believe have swungtwenty at least the drums beat the fifes played and the trumpets sounded and colonel kirke drank to the health of every man such was his condescension before he was turned off twould have done your heart good captain only to see the brave show ay ay said barnaby unmoved very like very like perhaps i shall have the opportunity of playing first part in another brave show if all goes well hath the duke escaped we heard yesterday that he is taken somewhere near the new forest so that he will before long lay his lovely head upon the block captain your friends have brought their pigs to a pretty market they have brother they have replied barnaby still with unmoved countenance yet many a man hath recovered from worse straits than these i listened with sinking heart much i longed to ask if the sergeant knew aught of robin but i refrained lest merely to name him might put the soldiers on the lookout for him should he happily be in hiding next the sergeant told us which terrified me greatly that there was no part of the country where they were not scouring for fugitives that they were greatly assisted by the clergy who he said were redhot for king james that the men were found hiding as we had hidden in linneys in hedges in barns in woods that they were captured by treacheryby information laid and even most cruel thing of all by watching and following the mens sweethearts who were found taking food to them he said also that at the present rate they would have to enlarge their prisons to admit ten times their number for they were haling into them not only the men who had followed monmouth but also those who had helped him with money arms or men the sergeant was a brutal fellow yet there was about him something of good nature and even of compassion for the men he had captured but he seemed to take delight in speaking of the sufferings of the unfortunate prisoners the soldiers he told us were greatly enraged towards the rebelsnot i suppose on account of their rebellion because three years later they themselves showed how skindeep was their loyalty but because the rustics whom they thought contemptible had surprised and nearly beaten them and this roused in them the spirit of revenge captain said the sergeant tis pity that so lusty a gentleman as thou shouldst die hast thou no friends at court no nor any who would speak for thee tis pity yet a man can die but once with such a thick neck as thine bespeak if so much grace be accorded thee a long rope and a high gallows else when it comes to the quarteringhe stopped and shook his headbut therei wish you well out of it captain in the evening just before sunset we arrived at ilminster after a sad and weary march of ten miles at least but we could not leave the prisoners until we knew how and where they were bestowed and during all this time my mother who commonly walked not abroad from one sabbath to the next was possessed with such a spirit that she seemed to feel no weariness when we rode all night in order to join the duke she complained not when we rode painfully across the hills to taunton she murmured not nor when we carried our wounded man up the rough and steep comb no nor on this day when she walked beside her husbands head careful lest the motion of the cart should cause him pain but he felt nothing poor soul he would feel nothing any more ilminster is a goodly town rich and prosperous with its spinners and weavers this evening however there was no one in the streets except the troopers who swaggered up and down or sat drinking at the tavern door there is a broad open place before the market which stands upon great stone pillars outside the market is the clink whither the soldiers were taking their prisoners the troopers paid not the least heed to our mournful little processiona wounded man a prisoner in scarlet and lace but the cloth tattered and stained and the lace torn they were only two more men on their way to death what doth a soldier care for the sight of a man about to die mother said barnaby when we drew near the prison gates come not within i will do all that i can for him go now and find a decent lodging and sister hark ye the lads in our army were rough but they were as lambs compared with these swaggering troopers keep snug therefore and venture not far abroad i whispered in his ear that i had his bag of money safe so that he could have whatever he wanted if that could be bought then the prison gates were closed and we stood without it would have been hard indeed if the wife and daughter of dr comfort eykin could not find a lodging among godly people of whom there are always many in every town of somerset we presently obtained a room in the house of one martha prior widow of the learned and pious joshua prior whilom preacher and ejected minister her case was as hard as our own this poor woman had two sons only and both had gone to join the duke one already risen to be a master sergemaker and one a draper of the town of her sons she could hear no news at all whether they were alive or dead if they were already dead or if they should be hanged she would have no means of support and so must starve or eat the bread of charity i learned afterwards that she never did hear anything of them so that it is certain that they must have been killed on the battlefield or cut down by the dragoons in trying to escape but the poor soul survived not long their loss the church of ilminster stands upon a rising ground on the north of the church is the grammar school and on the other three sides are houses of the better sort of which mrs prior had one the place which surrounds the churchyard and hath no inn or alehouse in it is quiet and retired the soldiers came not thither except once or twice with orders to search the houses and with a private resolution to drink everything that they might lay their hands upon so that for two poor women in our miserable circumstances we could not have a more quiet lodging despite our troubles i slept so well that night that it was past seven in the morning when i awoke the needs of the body do sometimes overcome the cares of the spirit for a whole fortnight had we been making our beds on the heather and therefore without taking off our clothes and that day we had walked ten miles at least with the soldiers so that i slept without moving or waking all the night in the morning i dressed quickly and hurried to the jail not knowing whether i might be admitted or should be allowed speech of barnaby outside the gate however i found a crowd of people going into the prison and coming out of it some of them women like ourselves were weepingthey were those whose brothers or lovers husbands or sons were in those gloomy walls others there were who brought for such of the prisoners as had money to buy them eggs butter white bread chickens fruit and all kinds of provisions some brought wine cider and ale some tobacco the warders who stood at the gates made no opposition to those who would enter i pressed in with a beating heart prepared for a scene of the most dreadful repentance and gloomy forebodings what i saw was quite otherwise the gates of the prison opened upon a courtyard not very big where the people were selling their wares and some of the prisoners were walking about and some were chaffering with the women who had the baskets on the righthand side of the yard was the clink itself on the left hand were houses for the warders or officers of the prison in general a single warder constable or headborough is enough for a town such as ilminster to keep the peace of the prison which is for the most part empty save when they enforce some new act against nonconformists and fill it with them or with quakers now however so great was the press that instead of two there were a dozen guards and while a stout cudgel had always been weapon enough now every man went armed with pike and cutlass to keep order and prevent escapes six of them occupied the gatehouse other six were within in a sort of guardhouse where they slept on the left hand of the court the ground floor of the clink we found to be a large room at least forty feet each side in bigness on one side of it was a great fireplace where though it was the month of july there was burning a great fire of welsh coal partly for cooking purposes because all that the prisoners ate was cooked at this fire and partly because a great fire kept continually burning sweetens the air and wards off jail fever on another side was a long table and several benches thick wooden pillars supported the joists of the rooms above the windows were heavily barred but the shutters had been taken down and there was no glass in them in spite of fire and open windows the place was stifling and smelt most horrible never have i breathed so foul an air there lived in this room about eighty prisoners later on the numbers were doubled some were smoking tobacco and drinking cider or ale some were frying pieces of meat or smoked herrings over the fire and the tobacco the ale the wine the cooking and the people themselvesnearly all country lads unwashed who had slept since sedgemoor at least in the same clothes without once changingmade so foul an air that jail fever putrid throats and smallpox all of which afterwards broke out should have been expected sooner they were all talking laughing and even singing so that in addition to the noisome stench of the place there was such a din as one may hear at sherborne fair of an evening i expected as i have said a gloomy silence with the rattling of chains the groans of those who looked for death and perhaps a godly repentance visible upon every countenance yet they were all laughing except a few who sat retired and who were wounded i say that they were all laughing they had nothing to expect but death or at the best to be horribly flogged to be transported to be fined branded and ruined yet they laughed what means this hardness and indifference in men could they not think of the women they had left at home i warrant that none of them were laughing among thema pipe of tobacco in his lips and a mug of strong ale before him on the table his hat flung backwardssat barnaby his face showing apparently complete satisfaction with his lot when he saw us at the door he rose and came to meet us welcome he said this is one of the places where king monmouths men are to receive the honour due to them courage gentle hearts be not cast down everywhere the prisons are full and more are brought in every day our very numbers are our safety they cannot hang us all and hark here he whispered sister we now know that colonel kirke hath been selling pardons at ten pounds twenty pounds and thirty pounds apiece wherefore we are well assured that somehow or other we shall be able to buy our release there are plenty besides colonel kirke who will sell a prisoner his freedom where is your father asked my mother he is bestowed above where it is quieter except for the groaning of the wounded go upstairs and you will find him and there is a surprise for you besides you will find with him one you little expect to see oh barnaby is there new misery for me is robin a prisoner robin is not here sis and as for misery why that is as you take it to be sure the man above is in prison but no harm will happen to him why should it he did not go out with monmouths men but go upstairsgo upstairs and see for yourselves chapter xxvi sir christopher i know not whom i expected to find in consequence of barnabys words as we went up the dark and dirty stairs which led to the upper room robin was not a prisoner whythenbut i knew not what i thought all being strange and dreadful at the top of the stairs we found ourselves in a room of the same size as the lower chamber but not so high and darker being a gloomy place indeed insomuch that it was not for some minutes that one could plainly discern things it was lighted by a low long window set very close with thick bars the shutters thrown open so that all the light and air possible to be admitted might come in it had a great fireplace but there was no fire burning and the air of the room struck raw though outside it was a warm and sunny day the roof was supported as in the room below by means of thick square pillars studded with great nails set close together for what purpose i know not every part of the woodwork in the room was in the same way stuck full of nails on the floor lay half a score mattresses the property of those who could afford to pay the warders an exorbitant fee for the luxury at ilminster as i am told at newgate the chief prison of the country the same custom obtains of exacting heavy fees from the poor wretches clapped into ward it is i suppose no sin to rob the criminal the debtor the traitor or the rebel for those who had nothing to pay there were only a few bundles of straw and on these were lying half a dozen wretches whose white faces and glazed eyes showed that they would indeed cheat tom the hangman though not in the way that barnaby hoped these were wounded either in the sedgemoor fight or in their attempt to escape my father lay on a pallet bed his face showed not the least change his eyes were closed and you would have thought him dead and beside him also on a pallet sat to my astonishment none other than sir christopher himself he rose and came to meet us smiling sadly madam he said taking my mothers hand we meet in a doleful place and we are indeed in wretched plight i cannot bid you welcome i cannot say that i am glad to see you there is nothing that i can say of comfort or of hope except which you know already that we are always in the hands of the lord sir christopher said my mother it was kind and neighbourly in you to come but you were always his best friend look at his poor white face she only thought upon her husband you would think him dead more than a fortnight he hath lain thusmotionless i think he feels no pain husband if thou canst hear me make some signif it be but to open one eye no she cried day after day have i thus entreated him and he makes no answer he neither sees nor hears yet he doth not die wherefore i think that he may yet recover speech and sit up again and presently perhaps walk about and address himself again unto his studies she waited not for any answer but knelt down beside him and poured some drops of milk into the mouth of the sick man sir christopher looked at her mournfully and shook his head then he turned to me and kissed me without saying a word oh sir i cried how could you know that my father would be brought unto this place with what goodness of heart have you come to our help nay child he replied gravely i came because i had no choice but to come like your father and your brother alice i am a prisoner you sir you a prisoner why you were not with the duke that is most true and yet a prisoner why after the news of sedgemoor fight i looked for nothing else they tried to arrest mr speke but he has fled they have locked up mr prideaux of ford abbey mr trenchard has retired across the seas why should they pass me over nay there were abundant proofs of my zeal for the duke my grandson and my grandnephew had joined the rebels your father and brother rode over to lyme on my horses with my grandson rode off a dozen lads of the village what more could they want moreover i am an old soldier of lord essexs army and to finish they found in the windowseat a copy of monmouths declarationwhich indeed i had forgotten or i might have destroyed it alas alas i cried wringing my hands your honour too a prisoner since the sergeant spoke to barnaby about the interest of friends i had been thinking that sir christopher whose power and interest i fondly thought must be equal to those of any lord in the land would interpose to save us all and he was now a prisoner himself involved in the common ruin one who stands upon a bridge and sees with terror the last support carried away by the raging flood feels such despair as fell upon my soul oh sir i cried again it is line upon linewoe upon woe he took my hand in his and held it tenderly my child he said to an old man of seventyfive what doth it matter whether he die in his bed or whether he die upon a scaffold through the pains of death as through a gate we enter upon our rest it is dreadful i cried again i cannot endure it the shame and ignominy of this death he said i shall i trust regard lightly we have struck a blow for freedom and for faith well we have been suffered to fail the time hath not yet come yet in the end others shall carry on the cause and religion shall prevail shall we murmur who have been gods instruments alas alas i cried again to me sweet child it is not terrible to contemplate my end but it is sad to think of thee and of thy grave and bitter loss hast thou heard news of robin and of humphrey oh sirare they also in prisonare they here no but i have news of them i have a letter brought to me but yesterday read it my child read it he pulled the letter out of his pocket and gave it to me then i read aloud and thus it ran honoured sir and grandfather i am writing this letter from the prison of exeter where with humphrey and about two hundred or more of our poor fellows i am laid by the heels and shall so continue until we shall all be tried it is rumoured that lord jeffreys will come down to try us and we are assured by report that the king shows himself revengeful and is determined that there shall be no mercy shown after sedgemoor fight they hanged as you will have heard many of the prisoners at weston zoyland at bridgwater and at taunton without trial if the king continue in this disposition it is very certain that though the common sort may be forgiven the gentlemen and those who were officers in the rebel army will certainly not escape therefore i have no hope but to conclude my life upon the gallowsa thing which i confess i had never looked to do but i hope to meet my fate with courage and resignation humphrey is with me and it is some comfort though i know not why that we shall stand or fall together for if i was a captain in the army he was a chyrurgeon that he was also a secret agent of the exiles and that he stirred up the dukes friends on his way from london to sherborne that they know not or it would certainly go hard with him what do i say since they will hang him things cannot very well go harder when the fight was over and the duke and lord grey fled there was nothing left but to escape as best we might i hope that some of the bradford lads will make their way home in safety they stood their ground and fought valiantly nay if we had been able to arm all who volunteered and would have enlisted and if our men had all shown such a spirit as your valiant lads of bradford orcas then i say the enemy must have been cut to pieces when we had no choice left but to run i took the road to bridgwater intending to ride back to that place where perhaps our forces might be rallied but this proved hopeless there i found however humphrey and we resolved that the safest plan would be to ride by way of taunton and exeter leaving behind us the great body of the kings army and so escape to london if possible where we should certainly find hidingplaces in plenty until the pursuit should be at an end our plan was to travel along byways and bridlepaths and that by night only hiding by day in barns linneys and the like we had money for the charges of our journey humphrey would travel as a physician returning to london from the west as soon as we had gotten out of the insurgents country i was to be his servant thus we arranged the matter in our minds and already i thought that we were safe and in hiding somewhere in london or across the seas in the low countries again well to make short my story we got no further than exeter where we were betrayed by a rascal countryman who recognised us caused us to be arrested and swore to us thereupon we were clapped into jail where we now lie hond sir humphrey i am sorry to write is much cast down not because he dreads death which he doth not any more than to lie upon his bed but because he hath he says drawn so many to their ruin he numbers me among thosethough indeed it was none of his doing but by my own free will that i entered upon this business which contrary to reasonable expectation hath turned out so ill wherefore dear sir since there is no one in the world whose opinion and counsel humphrey so greatly considers as your own i pray you of your goodness send him some words of consolation and cheer that will i right readily said sir christopher at least the poor lad cannot accuse himself of dragging me into the clink i hear continued robins letter that my mother hath gone with mr boscorel to london to learn if aught can be done for us if she do not return before we are finished bid her think kindly of humphrey and not to lay these things to his charge as for my dear girl my alice i hear nothing of her miss blake who led the maids when they gave the flags to the duke is i hear clapped into prison alice is not spoken of i am greatly perturbed in spirit concerning her and i would gladly if that might be compassed have speech with her before i die i fear she will grieve and weep but not more than i myself at leaving her poor maid i hear also nothing concerning her father who was redhot for the cause and therefore i fear will not be passed over or forgotten nor do i hear aught of barnaby who i hope hath escaped on shipboard as he said that he should do if things went ajar where are they all the roads are covered with rough men and it is not fit for such as alice and her mother to be travelling i hope that they have returned in safety to bradford orcas and that my old master dr eykin hath forgotten his zeal for the protestant duke and is already seated again among his books if that is so tell alice honoured sir that there is no hour of the day or night but i think of her continually that the chief pang of my approaching fate is the thought that i shall leave her in sorrow and that i cannot say or do anything to stay her sorrow comfort her i cannot save with words which will come better from the saintly lips of her father i again pray thee to assure her of my faithful love tell her that the recollection of her sweet face and steadfast eyes fills me with so great a longing that i would fain die at once so as to bring nearer the moment when we shall be able to sit together in heaven my life hath been glorified if i may say so in humility by her presence in my heart which drove away all common and unclean things of such strength is earthly love nay i could not i now perceive be happy even with the joys of heaven if she were not by my side where is she my heart my love pray god she is in safety and now sir i have no more to say the prison is a hot and reeking place at night it is hard to bear the foulness and the stench of it humphrey says that we may shortly expect some jail fever or smallpox to break out among us in which case the work of the judges may be lightened the good people of this ancient city are in no way afraid of the kings vindictiveness but send in of their bounty quantity of provisionsfruit eggs fresh meat salted meat ale and ciderevery day for the poor prisoners which shows which way their opinions do lean even although the clergy are against us honoured sir i am sure and certain that the miscarriage of our enterprise was caused by the conduct of those who had us in hand in a year or two there shall be seen but not by us another uprising under another leader with another end so no more i send to thee dear and honoured sir my bounden duty and my grateful thanks for all that i owe to your tender care and affection pray my mother for me to mourn no more for me than is becoming to one of her piety and virtue alas it is thinking upon her and upon my poor lost alice that my heart is wellnigh torn in pieces but tell humphrey through no faultnothrough no fault of his from thy dutiful and obedient grandson r c i read this all through then i folded up the letter and returned it to sir christopher as he took it the tears came into his dear and venerable eyes and rolled down his cheeks my dearmy dear he said it is hard to bear everyone who is dear to thee will go there is an end of all unless some way of which we know nothing be opened unto us why i said if we were all dead and buried and our souls together in heaven patience my dear said the old man oh must they all dieall my heart will burst oh sir will not one suffice for all will they not take me and hang me and let the rest go free child he took my hand between his own god knows that if one life would suffice for all it should be mine nay i would willingly die ten times over to save thy robin for thee he is not dead yet however nor is he sentenced there are so many involved that we may hope for a large measure of mercy nay more his mother hath gone to london as he says in his letter with my soninlaw philip boscorel to see if aught can be done even to the selling of my whole estate to procure the enlargement of the boys i know not if anything can be done but be assured philip boscorel will leave no stone unturned oh can money buy a pardon i have two hundred gold pieces they are barnabys then my dear they must be used to buy pardon for barnaby and thy fatherthough i doubt whether any pardon need be bought for one who is brought so low beside the bed my mother sat crouched watching his white face as she had done all day long in our hidingplace i think she heeded nothing that went on around her being wrapped in her hopes and prayers for the wounded man then sir christopher kissed me gently on the forehead they say the king is unforgiving my dear expect not therefore anything say to thyself every morning that all must die to know the worst brings with it something of consolation robin must die humphrey must die your brother barnaby must die your fatherbut he is wellnigh dead alreadyand i myself all must die upon the scaffold if we escape this noisome jail in thinking of this remember who will be left my dear if thou art as a widow and yet a maiden i charge thee solemnly that thou forget thine own private griefs and minister to those who will have none but thee to help them live not for thyself but to console and solace those who like thyself bereaved will need thy tender cares chapter xxvii before the assize then we sat down and waited twas all that we could do day after day we went to the prison where my mother sat by my father whose condition never changed in the least being always that of one who slept or if his eyes were open was unconscious and though he might utter a few rambling words had no command of his mind or of his speech wherefore we hoped that he suffered nothing twas a musket ball had struck the surgeon said in his backbone between the shoulders whereby his powers of motion and of thought were suspended i know not whether anyone attempted to remove the ball or whether it was lodged there at all because i am ignorant of such matters and to me whether he had been struck in the back or no it was to my mind sure and certain that the lord had granted my fathers earnest prayer that he should again be permitted to deliver openly the message that was upon his soul nay had given him three weeks of continual and faithful preaching the fruits of which could we perceive them should be abundant that prayer granted the lord i thought was calling him to rest therefore i looked for no improvement one other letter came from robin inclosing one for me with which because i could not leave my mother at such a time i was forced to stay my soul as the lover in the canticle stayeth his soul with apples i have that letter still it hath been with me always it lay hanging from my neck in the little leathern bag in which i carried the dukes ring i read it again and again until i knew it by heart yet still i read it again because even to look at my lovers writing had in it something of comfort even when things were at their worst and egyptian darkness lay upon my soul but this letter i cannot endure to copy out or suffer others to read it because it was written for mine own eye in such a time of trouble oh my love he said oh my tender heart and then a hundred prayers for my happiness and tears for my tears and hopes for the future which would be not the earthly life but the future reserved by merciful heaven for those who have been called and chosen as for the sharp and painful passage by which we must travel from this world to the next robin bade me take no thought of that at all but to think of him either as my lover walking with me as of old beside the stream at home or as a spirit waiting for me to join him in the heavenly choir and so ending with as many farewells the letter being written when he expected the judges to arrive and the assize to begin as showed his tender love for me noi cannot write down this letter for the eyes of all to read there are things which must be kept hidden in our own hearts and without doubt every woman to whom good fortune hath given a lover such as robin with a heart as fond and a pen as ready though he could never like humphrey write sweet verses hath received an epistle or two like unto mine for its love and tenderness but i hope without the sadness of impending death it was four weeks after we were brought to ilminster that the news came to us of the coming trials there were five judgesbut the world knows but of one namely george lord jeffreys chief justice of englandand now indeed we began to understand the true misery of our situation for everyone knew the character of the judge who though a young man still was already the terror alike of prisoners witnesses and juries it promised to be a black and bloody assize indeed since this man was to be the judge the aspect of the prison by this time was changed the songs and merriment the horseplay and loud laughter by which the men had at first endeavoured to keep up their hearts were gone the country lads pined and languished in confinement their cheeks grew pale and their eyes heavy then the prison was so crowded that there was barely room for all to lie at night and the yard was too small for all to walk therein by day in the morning though they opened all the shutters the air was so foul that in going into it from the open one felt sick and giddy and was sometimes fain to run out and drink cold water oh the terrible place for an old man such as sir christopher yet he endured without murmuring the foulness and the hardness comforting the sick still reproving blasphemies and setting an example of cheerfulness the wounded men all died i believe which as the event proved was lucky for them it would have saved the rest much suffering if they had all died as well and to think that this was only one of many prisons thus crowded with poor captives at wells philips norton shepton mallet bath bridgwater taunton ilchester somerton langport bristol and exeter there was a like assemblage of poor wretches thus awaiting their trials i said that there was now little singing there was however drinking enough and more than enough they drank to drown their sorrows and to forget the horrid place in which they lay and the future which awaited them when they were drunk they would bellow some of their old songs but the brawling of a drunkard will not communicate to his companions the same joy as the music of a merry heart while we were expecting to hear that the judge had arrived at salisbury the fever broke out in the prison of ilminster at wells they were afflicted with the smallpox but at ilminster it was jail fever which fell upon the poor prisoners everybody hath heard of this terrible disorder which is communicated by those who have it to those who go among themnamely to the warders and turnkeys and even to the judges and the juries on the first day after it broke outwhich was with an extraordinary virulencefour poor men died and were buried the next morning after this no day passed but there were funerals at the churchyard and the mounds of their gravesthe graves of these poor countrymen who thought to fight the battles of the lordstood side by side in a long row growing continually longer wethat is good mrs prior and myselfsat at the window and watched the funerals praying for the safety of those we loved so great was the fear of infection in the town that no one was henceforth allowed within the prison nor were the warders allowed to come out of it this was a sad order for me because my mother chose to remain within the prison finding a garret at the house of the chief constable and i could no longer visit that good old man sir christopher whose only pleasure left had been to converse with me daily and as i now understand by the refreshment the society of youth brings to age to lighten the tedium of his imprisonment henceforth therefore i went to the prison door every morning and sent in my basket of provisions but was not suffered to enter and though i could have speech with my mother or with barnaby they were on one side the bars and i on the other illustration i was standing at the wicket waiting for my basket to be taken in it was at this time that i made the acquaintance of mr george penne this creaturea villain as i afterwards discovered of the deepest dyewas to external appearance a grave and sober merchant he was dressed in brown cloth and laced shirt and carried a goldheaded stick in his hand he came to ilminster about the end of august or the beginning of september and began to inquire particularly into the names and the circumstances of the prisoners pretending such was his craftiness a great tenderness for their welfare he did the same thing we heard afterwards wherever the monmouth prisoners were confined at ilminster the fever being in the jail he did not venture within but stood outside and asked of any who seemed to know who were the prisoners within and what were their circumstances he accosted me one morning when i was standing at the wicket waiting for my basket to be taken in madam he said you are doubtless a friend of some poor prisoner your father or your brother may unhappily be lying within now i was grown somewhat cautious by this time wherefore fearing some kind of snare or trap i replied gravely that such indeed might be the case then madam he said speaking in a soft voice and looking full of compassion if that be so suffer me i pray you to wish him a happy deliverance and this indeed from the bottom of my heart sir i said moved by the earnestness of his manner i know not who you may be but i thank you such a wish i hope will not procure you the reward of a prison sir i wish you a good day so he bowed and left me and passed on but next day i found him in the same place and his eyes were more filled with compassion than before and his voice was softer i cannot sleep madam he said for thinking of these poor prisoners i hear that among them is none other than sir christopher challis a gentleman of great esteem and well stricken in years and there is also the pious and learnedbut most unfortunatedr comfort eykin who rode with the army and preached daily and is now i hear grievously wounded and bedridden sir i said dr comfort eykin is my father it is most true that he is a prisoner and that he is wounded he heaved a deep sigh and wiped a tear from his eyes it is now certain he said that lord jeffreys will come down to conduct the trials nay it is reported that he has already arrived at salisbury breathing fire and revenge and that he hath with him four other judges and a troop of horse what they will do with so many prisoners i know not i fear that it will go hard with all but as happens in such cases those who have money and know how to spend it may speedily get their liberty how are they to spend it why madam it is not indeed to be looked for that you should know but when the time comes for the trial should i as will very likely happen be in the way send for me and whatever the sentence i warrant we shall find a way to scape iteven if it be a sentence of death send for memy name is george penne and i am a wellknown merchant of bristol it was then that barnaby came to the other side of the wicket we could talk but could not touch each other all is well sis he said dad is neither better nor worse and sir christopher is hearty though the prison is like the tween decks of a ship with yellow jack aboardjust as sweet and pleasant for the air and just as merry for the crew barnaby i said the judges are now at salisbury ay ay i thought they would have been there before we shall be tried they tell me at wells which it is thought will be taken after other towns so there is still a tidy length of rope sis this continual smoking of tobacco to keep off infection doth keep a body dry cider will serve but let it be a runlet at least he called you sister madam said mr penne curiously have you brother as well as father in this place alas sir i have not only my father my mother and my brother in this place but my fatherinlaw as i hoped soon to call him and in exeter jail is my lover and his cousin oh sir if you mean honestly madamhe laid his hand upon his breasti assure you i am all honesty i have no other thought i swear to you than to save if possible the lives of these poor men he walked with me to my lodging and i there told him not only concerning our own people but also all that i knew of the prisoners in this jailthey were for the most part poor and humble men he made notes in a book which caused me some misgivings but he assured me again and again that all he desired was to save their lives and i now understand that he spoke the truth indeed but not the whole truth your brother for instance he said oh madam twere a thousand pities that so brave a young man so stout withal should be hanged drawn and quartered and your lover at exeter doubtless a tall and proper youth and the other whom you have named dr humphrey challis and your grandfather as i hope he will be sir christopher and your own fatherwhy madam he grew quite warm upon it if you will but furnish some honest merchanti say not myself because i know not yet if you would trust mebut some honest merchant with the necessary moneys i will engage that they shall all be saved from hanging to be sure these are all captains and officers and to get their absolute pardon will be a great matterperhaps above your means yet sir christopher hath a good estate i am told this george penne was it is true a bristol merchant engaged in the west india trade that is to say he bought sugar and tobacco and had shares in ships which sailed to and from bristol and the west indies and sometimes made voyages to the guinea coast for negroes but in common with many bristol merchants he had another trade and a very profitable trade it is namely what is called kidnapping that is buying or otherwise securing criminals who have been pardoned or reprieved on condition of going to the plantations they sell these wretches for a term of years to the planters and make a great profit by the transaction and foreseeing that there would presently be a rare abundance of such prisoners the honest mr george penne was going from prison to prison finding out what persons of substance there were who would willingly pay for their sentence to be thus mitigated in the event though things were not ordered exactly as he could have wished this worthy man his true worth you shall presently hear made a pretty penny as the saying is out of the prisoners what he made out of us and by what lies you shall learn but by illfortune for him he gat not the fingering of the great sums which he hoped of us and now the newsfrom winchester first and from dorchester afterwardsfilled the hearts of all with a dismay which it is beyond all power of words to tell for if an ancient lady of good repute though the widow of a regicide such a woman as lady lisle seventy years of age could be condemned to be burnedand was in fact beheadedfor no greater offence than harbouring two rebels herself ignorant of who they were or whence they came what could any hope who had actually borne arms and again at dorchester thirty who pleaded not guilty were found guilty and condemned to be hanged and nearly three hundred who pleaded guilty were sentenced to be hanged at the same time it was not an idle threat intended to terrify the rest because thirteen of the number were executed on the following monday and eighty afterwards among those who were first hanged were many whom we knew the aged and pious mr sampson larke the baptist minister of lyme for instance was one colonel holmes whom the king had actually pardoned was another and young mr hewlingwhose case was like that of robin this terrible news caused great despondency and choking in the prison where also the fever daily carried off one or two oh my poor heart fell and i almost lost the power of prayer when i heard that from dorchester the judge was riding in great state driving his prisoners before him to exeter where there were two hundred waiting their trial and among them robinalas alasmy robin chapter xxviii benjamin it was the evening of september the sixteenth about nine of the clock i was sitting alone in my lodging downstairs i heard the voice of the poor widow mrs prior who had received us she was praying aloud with some godly friends for the safety of her sons these young men as i have said were never more heard of and were therefore already doubtless past praying for i who ought to have been praying with them held robins last letter in my hands i knew it by heart but i must still be reading it again and again thinking it was his voice which was indeed speaking to me trying to feel his presence near me to hear his breath to see his very eyes in the night waking or sleeping i still would hear him calling to me aloud my heart my life my love he would cry i heard him i say quite plainly by special mercy and grace this power was accorded to me because i have no doubt that in his mind while lying in his noisome prison he did turn his thoughts yea and the yearnings of his fond heart to the maid he loved but now the merciless judge who had sentenced three hundred men to one common doomthree hundred menwas such a sentence ever knownhad left dorchester and was already perhaps at exeter ohperhaps robin had by this time stood his trial what place was left for prayer for if the poor ignorant clowns were condemned to death how much more the gentlemen the officers of monmouths army perhaps he was already executedmy lover my boy my robintaken out and hanged and now a cold and senseless corpse then the wailings and prayers of the poor woman below added to the distraction of these thoughts made me feel as if i was indeed losing my senses at this time it was blow upon blowline upon line the sky was blackthe heavens were deaf is therecan there bea more miserable thing than to feel that the very heavens are deaf the mercy of the lordhis kindly hearkening to our cries and prayersthese we believe as we look for the light of day and the warmth of the sun nay this belief is the very breath of our life so that there is none but the most hardened and abandoned sinner who doth not still feel that he hath in the lord a father as well as a judge to lose that belieftwere better to be a lump of senseless clay the greatest misery of the lost soul even greater than his continual torment of fire and his neverending thirst and the gnawing of remorse must be to feel that the heavens are deaf to his prayersdeaf for ever and for ever at this time my prayers were all for safety safety good lord give them safety save them from the executioner give them safety thus as barnaby said the shipwrecked mariner clinging to the mast asks not for a green pleasant and fertile shore but for landonly for land i sat there musing sadly the bible on the table and a lighted candle i read not in the bible but listened to the wailing of the poor soul below and looked at the churchyard without the moonlight falling upon the fresh mounds which covered the graves of the poor dead prisoners suddenly i heard a voicea loud and harsh voiceand footsteps i knew both footsteps and voice and i sprang to my feet trembling because i was certain that some new disaster had befallen us then the steps mounted the stairs the door was opened and benjaminnone other than benjaminappeared what did he here he was so big with so red a face that his presence seemed to fill the room and with himwhat did this meancame madam herself who i thought to have been at exeter alas her eyes were red with weeping her cheeks were thin and wasted with sorrow her lips were trembling alice she cried holding out her hands child these terrible things are done and yet we live alas we live are our hearts made of stone that we still live as for me i cannot die though i lose allallall dear madam what hath happened more misery more disaster oh tell me tell me oh my dear they have been triedthey have been tried and they are condemned to dieboth robinmy son robinand with him humphrey who dragged him into the business and alone ought to suffer for both but there is now no justice in the land nono more justice can be had else humphrey should have suffered for all there was something strange in her eyesshe did not look like a mother robbed of her children she gazed upon me as if there was something else upon her mind as if the condemnation of her son was not enough robin will be hanged she went on he hath been the only comfort of my life since my husband was taken from me when he was left an infant in my arms robin will be hanged like any common gipsy caught stealing a sheep he will be hanged and drawn and quartered and those goodly limbs of his will be stuck upon poles for all to see truly i looked for nothing less barnaby bade me look for nothing less than this but at the news i fell into a swoon so one who knoweth beforehand that he is to feel the surgeons knife and thinks to endure the agony without a cry is fain to shriek and scream when the moment comes when i recovered i was sitting at the open window madam applying a wet cloth to my forehead have no fear benjamin was saying she will do what you command her so only that he may go free is there no way but that she asked none and then he swore a great oath my eyes being opened and my sense returned i perceived that mrs prior was also in the room and i wondered in such moments the mind finds relief in trifles that benjamins face should have grown so red and his cheeks so fat thou hast been in a swoon my dear said madam but tis past why is benjamin here i asked he looked at madam who cast down her eyes i knew not why benjamin is now our only friend she replied without looking up it is out of his kindnessyeshis kindness of heart that he hath come i do not understand if robin is to die what kindness can he show tell her benjamin said madam tell her of the trials at exeter his lordship came to exeter benjamin began on the evening of september the thirteenth escorted by many country gentlemen and a troop of horse i had the honour of riding with him the trials began the day before yesterday the fourteenth pray good sir asked the poor woman who had lost her sons did you observe my boys among the prisoners how the devil should i know your boys he replied turning upon her roughly so that she asked no more questions if they were rebels they deserve hanginghere she shrieked aloud and fled the room the trials began with two fellows who pleaded not guilty but were quickly proved to have been in arms and were condemned to death one of them being sent out to instant execution the rest who were brought up that dayamong whom were robin and humphreypleaded guilty being partly terrified and partly persuaded that it was their only chance of escape so they too were condemnedtwo hundred and forty in allevery man jack of them to be hanged drawn and quartered and their limbs to be afterwards stuck on poles for the greater terror of evildoershe said these words with such a fire in his eyes and in such a dreadful threatening voice as made me tremble then they were all taken back to jail where they will lie until the day of execution and the lord have mercy upon their souls the terrible judge jeffreys himself could not look more terrible than benjamin when he uttered the prayer with which a sentence to death is concluded benjamin were you in the court to see and hear the condemnation of your own cousins i was i sat in the body of the court in the place reserved for counsel could you say nothing that would help them nothing not a word from anyone could help them considerone of them was an officer and one a surgeon in the army the ignorant rustics whom they led may some of them escape but the officers can look for no mercy madam i cried i must see robin before he dies though god knows there are those here who want my services daily yet i must see robin he will not die easy unless he can see me and kiss me once madam made no reply for a week said benjamin they are safe i do not think they will be executed for a week at least but it is not wise to reckon on a reprieve even for an hour the judge may at any time order their execution i will go tomorrow that will be seen said benjamin my dear said madam my nephew benjamin is a friend of the judge lord jeffreys say rather a follower and admirer of that great learned and religious man one who is yet but a member of the outer bar must not assume the style and title of friend to a man whose next step must be the woolsack heavens he called the inhuman wretch who had sentenced an innocent old woman of seventy to be burned alive and five hundred persons to be hanged and one knows not how many to be inhumanly floggedgreat and religious if interest can save any madam said softly benjamin can command that interest and he is on the side of mercy especially where his cousins are concerned i now observed that madam who had not formerly been wont to regard her nephew with much affection behaved towards him with the greatest respect and submission madam he replied you know the goodness of my heart what man can do shall be done by me not only for robin but for the others who are involved with him in common ruin but there are conditions with which i have taken pains to acquaint you madam sighed heavily and looked as if she would speak but refrained and i saw the tears rolling down her cheeks what conditions benjamin i asked him conditions for trying to save your own cousins and your own grandfather conditions why you should be moving heaven and earth for them instead of making conditions it needs not so much exertion he replied with an unbecoming grin first alice i must own child that the two years or thereabouts since i saw thee last have added greatly to thy charms at which i rejoice oh what have my charms to do with the business much as thou wilt presently discover but let me remind you both that there threatennay there are actually overhanging disasters the like of which never happen save in time of civil war and of rebellion my grandfather is in prison and will be tried on a charge of sending men and horses to join monmouth nay the dukes proclamation was found in his house he will be certainly condemned and his estates confiscated so there will be an end of as old a family as lives in somerset then there is thy father child who was preacher to the army and did make mischief in stirring up the fanatical zeal of many think you that he can escape then there is thy brother barnaby who was such a fool as to meddle in what concerned him not and now will hang therefor what can we expect are men to go unpunished who thus rebel against the lords anointed is treasonrank treasonthe setting up of a pretender prince who is now lying headless in his coffin as the rightful heir to be forgiven we must not look for it alas madam had i been with you instead of that conceited fanatical crookback humphrey whom i did ever detest none of these things should have happened humphrey i said has more worth in one finger than you in all your great body benjamin my dear my dear do not anger benjamin oh do not anger our only friend she may say what she pleases my time will come listen then they must all be hanged unless i can succeed in getting them pardoned naybutforgive my rudeness benjamin they are your own cousinsit is your own grandfather what need of conditions oh what does this mean are you a man of flesh and blood my conditions childwhy did he laughwill assure you that such is truly the nature of my composition if money is wantedi thought of my bag of gold and of mr pennes hintshow much will suffice i know not if it comes to buying them off more thousands than could be raised on the bradford orcas estates put money out of mind then benjamin save them if thou canst his lordship knows that i have near relations concerned in the rebellion yet he assured me if his own brothers were among the prisoners he would hang them all nay then benjamin i say no more tell me what are these conditions and if we can grant or contrive them we will comply i had no thought of what was meant by his conditions nor did i even guess until the morning when madam told me oh madam is there anything in the worldanything that we would not do to save them madam looked at me with so much pity in her eyes that i wondered it was pity for me and not for her son that i read in that look why did she pity me i understood not my dear she said there are times when women are called upon to make sacrifices which they never thought to make which seem impossible to be even asked oh there are no sacrifices which we would not gladly make what can benjamin require that we should not gladly do for him nay he is robins cousin and your nephew and sir christophers grandson he will if need be join us in making these sacrifices i will said benjaminagain why did he laughi will join you in making one sacrifice at least with a willing heart i will tell her tomorrow said madam no i cannot tell her tonight let us first rest go sir leave us to our sorrow it may be that we may yet think the sacrifice too great even for the lives and the safety of those we love go sir for tonight and return tomorrow surely child said madam presently when he was gone and we were alone we are the most unhappy women in the world nay i replied there have been other women before us who have been ruined and widowed by civil wars and rebellions if it be any comfort to think that others have suffered like ourselves then we may comfort ourselves but the thought brings no consolation to me hagar said madam was a miserable woman because she was cast out by the man she loved even the father of her son but she saved her son rachel was unhappy until the lord gave her a son jephthahs daughter was unhappymy dear there is no case except hers which may be compared with oursand jephthahs daughter was happy in one circumstance that she was permitted to die ah happy girl she died that was all her sacrificeto die for the sake of her father but what is ours so she spoke in riddles or dark sayings of which i understood nothing nevertheless before lying down i did solemnly and in her presence and hearing aloud upon my knees offer unto almighty god myselfmy very lifeif so that robin could be saved and then with lighter heart than i had known for long i lay down and slept at midnight or thereabouts madam woke me up child she said i cannot sleep tell me truly is there nothing that thou wouldest refuse for robins sake nothing verily ah madam can you doubt it even if it were a sacrifice of which he would not approve believe me madam there is nothing that i would not do for robins safety child if we were living in the days of persecution wouldest thou hear the mass and adopt the catholic religion to save thy lovers life oh madam the lord will never try us above our strength sleep my child sleep and pray that as thy temptation so may be thy strength chapter xxix on what conditions in the morning i awoke with a lighter heart than i had known for a long time benjamin was going to release our prisoners i should go to meet robin at the gate of his prison all would be well except that my father would never recover we should return to the village and everything would go on as before oh poor fond wretch how was i deluded and oh miserable day that ended with such shame and sadness yet began with so much hope madam was already dressed she was sitting at the window looking into the churchyard she had been crying alas how many women in somersetshire were then weeping all day long madam i said we now have hope we must not weep and lament any more oh to have at last a little hopewhen we have lived so long in despairit makes one breathe again benjamin will save our prisoners for us oh after all it is benjamin who will help us we did not use to love benjamin because he was rude and masterful and wanted everything for himself and would never give up anything yet you see he had after all a good heart madam groaned and he cannot forget though he followeth not his grandfathers opinions that he is his honours grandsonthe son of his only daughterand your nephew and first cousin to robin and second cousin once removed to humphrey and barnaby playfellows of old why these are ties which bind him as if with ropes he needs must bestir himself to save their lives and since he says that he can save them of course he must have bestirred himself to some purpose weep no more dear madam your son will be restored to us we shall be happy againthanks to benjamin child she replied my heart is broken it is broken i say oh to be lying dead and at peace in yonder churchyard never before did i think that it must be a happy thing to be dead and at rest and to feel nothing and to know nothing but madam the dead are not in their graves there lie only the bodies their souls are above then they still think and remember oh can a time ever come when things can be forgotten will the dead ever cease to reproach themselves she wrung her hands in an ecstasy of grief though i knew not what should move her so indeed she was commonly a woman of sober and contained disposition entirely governed both in her temper and her words what was in her mind that she should accuse herself then while i was dressing she went on talking being still full of this strong passion i shall have my boy back again she said yes he will come back to me and what will he say to me when i tell him all yet i must have him back oh to think of the hangman tying the rope about his neckshe shuddered and trembledand afterwards the cruel knifeshe clasped her hands and could not say the wordsi see the comely limbs of my boy oh the thought tears my heartit tears me through and through i cannot think of anything else day or night and yet in the prison he is so patient and so cheerful i marvel that men can be so patient with this dreadful death before them she broke out again into another passion of sobbing and crying then she became calmer and tried to speak of things less dreadful when first i visited my boy in prison she said humphrey came humbly to ask my pardon poor lad i have had hard thoughts of him it is certain that he was in the plot from the beginning yet had he not gone so far should we have sat down when the rising began but he doth still accuse himself of rashness and calls himself the cause of all our misfortunes he fell upon his knees in the sight of all to ask forgiveness saying that it was he and none other who had brought ruin upon us all then robin begged me to raise him up and comfort him which i did putting aside my hard thoughts and telling him that being such stubborn protestants our lads could not choose but join the duke whether he advised it or whether he did not nay i told him that robin would have dragged him willy nilly and so i kissed him and robin took him by the hand and solemnly assured him that his grandfather had no such thought in his mind nay i said my father and barnaby would certainly have joined the duke humphrey or not never were any men more eager for rebellion i have been to london she went on tis a long journey and i effected nothing for the mind of the king i was assured is harder than the nether millstone my brotherinlaw philip boscorel went with me and i left him there but i have no hope that he will be able to help us his old friends being much scattered and many of them dead and some hostile to the court and in illfavour so i returned seeing that if i could not save my son i could be with him until he died the day before yesterday he was triedif you call that a trial when hundreds together plead guilty and are all alike sentenced to death have you seen him since the trial i went to the prison as soon as they were brought back from court some of the peoplefor they were all condemned to deathevery onewere crying and lamenting and there were many women among themtheir wives or their mothersand these were shrieking and wringing their hands so that it was a terrible spectacle but some of the men called for drink and began to carouse so that they might drown the thought of impending death my dear i never thought to look upon a scene so full of horror as for our own boys robin was patient and even cheerful and humphrey leading us to the most quiet spot in that dreadful place exhorted us to lose no time in weeping or vain laments but to cheer and console our hearts with the thought that deatheven violent deathis but a brief pang and life is but a short passage and that heaven awaits us beyond humphrey should have been a godly minister such is the natural piety and goodness of his heart so he spoke of the happy meeting in that place of blessedness where earthly love would be purged of its grossness and our souls shall be so glorified that we shall each admire the beauty and the excellence of the other then robin talked of thee my dear and sent thee a loving message bidding thee grieve for him but not without hopeand that a sure and certain hopeof meeting again there are other things he bade me tell thee but now i cannotoh i must not nay madam but if they are words that he wished me to hear why they were of his constant loveandno i cannot tell them well i said fret not thy poor heart with thinking any more of the prison for benjamin will surely save him and then we shall love benjamin all our lives he will perhaps save him and yetshe turned her headoh how can i tell herwe shall shed many more tears how can i tell her how can i tell her so she broke off again but presently recovered and went on talking in time of great trouble the mind wanders backwards and forwards and though one talks still it is disjointedly so she went back to the prison the boys have been well though the prison is full and the air is foul yet there hath been as yet no fever for which they are thankful they had no money the soldiers who took them prisoners having robbed them of their money and indeed stripped them as well to their shirts telling them that shirts were good enough to be hanged in yet the people of exeter have treated the prisoners with great humanity bringing them daily food and drink so that there has been nothing lacking the time however doth hang upon hands in a place where there is nothing to do all day but to think of the past and to dread the future one poor prisoner i was told had gone distracted with the terror of this thought child every day that i visited my son while he talked with me always cheerful and smiling my mind turned continually to the scaffold and the gibbet then she returned to the old subject from which she could in no way escape i saw the hangman i saw my son hanging to the shameful treeoh my son my sontill i could bear it no longer and would hurry away from the prison and walk about the town over the fieldsyea all night longto escape the dreadful thought oh to be blessed with such a son and to have him torn from my arms for such a death if he had been killed upon the field of battle twould have been easier to bear but now he dies dailyhe dies a thousand deaths in my mind my childshe turned again to the churchyardthe rooks are cawing in their nests the sparrows and the robins hop among the graves the dead hear nothing all their troubles are over all their sins are forgiven i comforted her as well as i could indeed i understood not at all what she meant thinking that perhaps all her trouble had caused her to be in that frame of mind when a woman doth not know whether to laugh or to cry and then taking my basket i sallied forth to provide the days provisions for my prisoners barnaby i said when he came to the wicket i have good news for thee what good news that i am to be flogged once a year in every markettown in somersetshire as will happen to young tutchin no nonot that kind of news but freedom brother hope for freedom he laughed who is to give us freedom benjamin hath found a way for the enlargement of all ben boscorel what will he stir finger for the sake of anybody then sis if i remember ben aright there will be something for himself but if it is upon ben that we are to rely we are truly well sped on ben quotha my brother he told me so himself ware hawks sister if ben is a tone end of the rope and the hangman at the other i think i know who will be stronger well child believe ben if thou wilt thy father looks strange this morning he opened his eyes and seemed to know me i wonder if there is a change tis wonderful how he lasts there are six men sickened since yesterday of the fever three of them brought in last week are already dead as for the singing that we used to hear it is all over and if the men get drunk they are dumb drunk sir christopher looks but poorly this morning i hope he will not take the fever he staggered when he arose which is a bad sign tell mother barnaby what benjamin hath undertaken to do nay that shall i not because look you i believe it not there is some trick or lie at the bottom unless ben hath repented and changed his disposition which used to be two parts wolf one part bear and the rest fox if there were anything left it was serpent well sister i am no grumbler but i expect this job to be over in a fortnight or so when they say the wells assizes will be held then we shall all be swinging and i only hope that we may carry with us into the court such a breath of jail fever as shall lay the judge himself upon his back and end his days in the next world he will meet the men whom he has sentenced and it will fare worse for him in their hands than with fifty thousand devils so he took a drink of the beer and departed within the prison and for many months i saw him no more on my way home i met benjamin hath madam told you yet of my conditions he asked eagerly not yet she will doubtless tell me presently oh what matter for the conditions it can only be something good for us contrived by your kind heart ben i have told barnaby who will not believe in our good fortune it is indeed something very good for you alice as you will find come with me and walk in the meadows beyond the reach of this doleful place where the air reeks with jail fever and all day long they are reading the funeral service so he led me out upon the sloping sides of a hill where we walked a while upon the grass very pleasantly my mind being now at rest you have heard of nothing he said of late but of the rebellion and its consequences let us talk about london so he discoursed concerning his own profession and his prospects which he said were better than those of any other young lawyer in his own opinion for my practice he said i already have one which gives me an income far beyond my wants which are simple give me plain fare and for the evening a bottle or two of good wine with tobacco and friends who love a cheerful glass i ask no more my course lies clear before me i shall become a kings counsel i shall be made a judge presently i shall become lord chancellor what did i tell thee child long ago well that time has now arrived still i was so foolish being so happy that i could not understand what he meant i am sure benjamin i said that we at home shall ever rejoice and be proud of your success nobody will be more happy to hear of it than robin and i here he turned very red and muttered something you find your happiness in courts and clubs and london i went on as for robin and myself we shall find ours in the peaceful place which we have always decided to have what the devil he cried she will not tell you the conditions she came with me for no other purpose i have borne with her company all the way from exeter for this only go back to her and ask what it is go back i say and make her tell what am i to take all this trouble for nothing his face became purple with sudden rage his eyes grew swiftly fierce and he roared and bawled at me why what had i said benjamin i cried what is the matter how have i angered you go back he roared again tell her that if i presently come and find thee still in ignorance twill be the worse for all tell her that i say it twill else be worse for all chapter xxx a slight thing at the best so i left benjamin much frightened and marvelling both at his violent passion and at the message which he sent to madam she was waiting for me at the lodging madam i said i have seen benjamin he is very angry he bade me go home and ask you concerning his conditions we must not anger our best friend dear madam she rose from her chair and began to walk about wringing her hands as if torn by some violent emotion oh my child she cried alice come to my armsif it is for the last timemy daughter more than ever mine though i must never call thee daughter she held me in her arms kissing me tenderly my dear we agreed that no sacrifice could be too great for the safety of our boy yes we agreed to that let us kiss each other before we do a thing after which we can never kiss each other again no never again why not again madam oh she pushed me from her it is now eight of the clock he will be here at ten i promised i would tell thee before he came and all is in readiness for what madam why even then i guessed not her meaning though i might have done so but i never thought that so great a wickedness was possible no sacrifice should be too great for us she cried clasping her head with her hands and looking wildly about none too great not even the sacrifice of my own sons loveno not that why let us think of the sacrifices men make for their country for their religion abraham was ready to offer his son isaac jephthah sacrificed his daughter king mesha slew his eldest son for a burnt offering thousands of men die every year in battle for their country what have we to offer if we give ourselves it is but a slight thing that we offer at the best surely madam i cried you know that we would willingly die for the sake of robin yes child to dieto die were nothing it is to livewe must livefor robin i understand not madam listen thenfor the time presses and if he arrives and finds that i have not broken the thing to thee he will perhaps ride back to exeter in a rage when i left my son after the trial being very wretched and without hope i found benjamin waiting for me at the prison gates he walked with me to my lodging and on the way he talked of what was in my mind first he said that for the better sort there was little hope seeing that the king was revengeful and the judge most wrathful and in a mood which allowed of no mercy therefore it would be best to dismiss all hopes of pardon or of safety either to these two or to the prisoners of ilminster now when he had said this a great many times we being now arrived at my lodging he told me that there was in my case a way out of the troubleand one way only that if we consented to follow that way which he said would do no manner of harm to either of us or to our prisoners he would undertake and faithfully engage to secure the safety of all our prisoners i prayed him to point out this way and after much entreaty he consented what is the way i asked having not the least suspicion and yet the look in her eyes should have told me what was coming is it true child that long ago you were betrothed to benjamin no madam that is most untrue he says that when you were quite a little child he informed you of his intention to marry you and none but you why that is true indeed and now i began to understand the way that was proposed and my heart sank within me that is true but to tell a child such a thing is not a betrothal he says that only three or four years ago he renewed that assurance so he did but i gave him no manner of encouragement he says that he promised to return and marry you when he had arrived at some practice and that he engaged to become lord chancellor and make you a peeress of the realm all that he said and more yet did i never give him the least encouragement but quite the contrary for always have i feared and disliked benjamin never at any time was it possible for me to think of him in that way that he knows and cannot pretend otherwise madam doth benjamin wish evil to robin because i am betrothed to him he also says in his rude waybenjamin was always a rude and coarse boythat he had warned you long ago that if anyone else came in his way he would break the head of that man yes i remember now that he threatened some violence my dearmadam took my handhis time of revenge is come he says that he has the life of the man whom you love in his own hands and he will he swears break his head for him and so keep the promise made to you by tying the rope round his neck my dear benjamin has always been stubborn and obstinate from his birth stubborn and obstinate was he as a boy stubborn and obstinate is he now he cares for nobody in the world except himself he has no heart he has no tenderness he has no scruples if he wants a thing he will trample on all the world to get it and break all the laws of god i know what manner of life he leads he is the friend and companion of the dreadful judge who goeth about like a raging lion every night do they drink together until they are speechless and cannot stand their delight it is to drink and smoke tobacco with unseemly jests and ribald songs which would disgrace the playhouse or the country fair oh tis the life of a hog that he delights in yet for all that he is like his noble friend full of ambition nothing will do but he must rise in the world therefore he works hard at his professionand madamthe conditionwhat is the condition for heavens sake tell me quickly is itis itoh nonono anything but that my childmy daughtershe laid her hand upon my head it is that conditionthat and none other oh my dear it is laid upon thee to save usit is to be thy work aloneand by such a sacrifice as i think no woman ever yet had to make nay perhaps it is better not to make it after all let all die together and let us live out our allotted lives in sorrow i thought of it all night and it seemed better sobetter even that thou wert lying in thy grave his condition oh he must be a devil thus to barter for the lives of his grandfather and his cousinsno human being surely would do such a thing the condition my dear is that thou must marry himnow this very morningand this once done he will at once take such stepsi know not what they may be but i take it that his friend the judge will grant him the favoursuch steps i say as will release unto us all our prisoners at first i made no answer if not she added after a while they shall all be surely hanged i remained silent it is not easy at such a moment to collect ones thoughts and understand what things mean i asked her presently if there was no other way none she said there was no other way what shall i do what shall i do i asked god it seems hath granted my daily prayer but how oh what shall i do think of what thou hast in thy power but to marry himto marry benjaminoh to marry him how should i live how should i look the world in the face my dear there are many other unhappy wives there are other husbands brutal and selfish there are other men as wicked as my nephew thou wilt swear in church to love honour and obey him thy love is already hate thy honour is contempt thy obedience will be the obedience of a slave yet death cometh at length even to a slave and to the harsh taskmaster oh madam miserable indeed is the lot of those whose only friend is death she was silent leaving me to think of this terrible condition what would robin say what would humphrey say nay what would his honour himself say why child she replied with a kind of laugh it needs not a wizard to tell what they would say for one and all they would rather go to the gallows than buy their lives at such a price thy brother barnaby would mount the ladder with a cheerful heart rather than sell his sister to buy his life that we know already nay we know more for robin will never forgive his mother who suffered thee to do such a thing so shall i lose what i value more than lifethe love of my only son yet would i buy his life at such a price my dear if you lose your lover i lose my son yet we will save him whether he will or no she took my hands and pressed them in her own my dear it will be worse for me than for you you will have a husband it is true whom you will loathe yet you will not see him perhaps for half the day at least and perhaps he will leave thee to thyself for the other half but for me i shall have to endure the loss of my sons affections all my life because i am very sure and certain that he can never forgive me think my dear shall they all dieallthink of father and brother and of your motheror will you willingly endure a life of misery with this man for husband in order that they may live oh madam i said as for the miseryany other kind of misery i would willingly endure but it is marriagemarriage yet who am i that i should choose my sacrifice oh if good works were of any avail then would the way to heaven be opened wide for me by such an act and such a life oh what will robin say of me what will he think of me will he curse me and loathe me for being able to do this thing should i do it is it right doth god command it yet to save their dear livesonly to set them freeto send that good old man back to his hometo suffer my father to die in peacei must do iti must do it yet robin could never forgive me oh he told me that betrothal was a sacrament i have sworn to be his yet to save his life i cannot hesitate if it is wrong i pray that robin will forgive me tell himoh tell him that it is i who am to die instead of him perhaps the lord will suffer me to die quickly tell him that i loved him and only him that i would rather have died that for his life alone i would not have done this thing because he would not have suffered it but it is for allit is for all oh he must forgive me some day you will send me a message of forgiveness from him but i must go away and live in london far from all of you never to see him or any one of you againnot even my own mother it is too shameful a thing to do and you will tell his honour who hath always loved me and would willingly have called me his granddaughter it was not that i loved not robingod knoweth that but for allfor him and robin and allto save his grey hairs from the gallows and to send him back to his home oh tell him that my dearmy dear she replied but could say no more then for a while we sat in silence with beating hearts i am to purchase the lives of five honest men i said presently by my own dishonour i know very well that it is by my dishonour and my sin that their lives are to be bought it doth not save me from dishonour that i am first to stand in the church and be married according to the prayer book nay does it not make the sin greater and the dishonour more certain that i shall first swear what i cannot ever performto love and honour that man yes girlyes said madam but the sin is mine more than yours oh let me bear the sin upon myself you cannot it is my sin and my dishonour nay it is a most dreadful wicked thing that i am to do it is all the sins in one i do not honour my parents in thus dishonouring myself i kill myselfthe woman that my robin loved i steal the outward form which belonged to robin and give it to another i live in a kind of adultery it is truly a terrible sin in the sight of heaven yet i will do iti must do it i love him so that i cannot let him die rather let me be overwhelmed with shame and reproach if only he can live said i not my dear that we two could never kiss each other again when two men have conspired together to commit a crime they consort no more together it is said but go apart and loathe each other so it is now with us so i promised to do this thing the temptation was beyond my strength yet had i possessed more faith i should have refused and then great indeed would have been my reward alas how was i punished for my want of faith well it was to save my lover love makes us strong for evil as well as strong for good and all the time to think that we never inquired or proved his promises to think that we never thought of doubting or of asking how he a young barrister should be able to save the lives of four active rebels and one who had been zealous in the cause that two women should have been so simple is now astonishing when the clock struck ten i saw benjamin walking across the churchyard it was part of the brutal nature of the man that he should walk upon the graves even those newlymade and not covered up with turf he swung his great burly form and looked up at the window with a grin which made madam tremble and shrink back but for me i was not moved by the sight of him for now i was strong in resolution suppose one who hath made up her mind to go to the stake for her religion as would doubtless have happened unto many had king james been allowed to continue in his course do you think that such a woman would begin to tremble at the sight of her executioner not so she would arise and go forth to meet him with pale face perhaps because the agony is sharp but with a steady eye benjamin opened the door and stood looking from one to the other well he said to madam roughly you have by this time told her the condition i have told heralas i have told her and already i repent me that i have told her doth she consent she does it shall be as you desire ha benjamin drew a long breath said i not sweethearthe turned to methat i would break the head of any who came between us what have i not broken the head of my cousin when i take away his girl very well then and that to good purpose very well then it remains to carry out the condition the condition i said i understand to be this if i become your wife benjamin you knowing full well that i love another man and am already promised to him tatata he said that you are promised to another man matters not one straw that you love another man i care nothing what i promise sweetheart that i will soon make thee forget that other man and as for loving any other man after marrying me that dye see my pretty will be impossible oh thou shalt be the fondest wife in the three kingdoms nay if such a thing cannot move your heart i say no more if i marry you then all our prisoners will be enlarged i swearhe used a great round oath very horrid from the lips of a christian mani swear that if you marry me the threerobin humphrey and barnabyshall all save their lives and as for sir christopher and thy father they also shall be enlarged can i say aught in addition i suspected no deceit i understood and so did madam that this promise meant the full and free forgiveness of all yet there was something of mockery in his eyes which should have made us suspicious but i for one was young and ignorant and madam was countrybred and truthful benjamin i cried falling on my knees before him think what it is you ask think what a wicked thing you would have me doto break my vows who am promised to your cousin and would you leave your grandfather to perish all for a whim about a silly girl benjamin you are playing with us you cannotyou could not sell the livesthe very lives of your grandfather and your cousins for such a price as this the play has gone far enough benjamin tell us that it is over and that you never meant to be taken seriously and we will forgive you the anguish you have caused us get up he said get up i say and stop this folly he then began to curse and to swear playing is it you shall quickly discover that it is no play but serious enough to please you all puritans though you be playing get up i say and have done then i said there is not in the whole world a more inhuman monster than yourself oh my dearmy dear do not anger him cried madam all is fair in love my pretty said benjamin with a grin before marriage call me what you pleaseinhuman monsteranything that you please after marriage my wife will have to sing a different tune oh benjamin treat her kindly madam cried i mean not otherwise kindness is my nature i am too kind for my own interests obedience i expect and good temper and a civil tongue with such respect as is due to one who intends to be lord chancellor come child no more hard words thou shalt be the happiest woman i say in the world what monmouths rebellion was only contrived to make thy happiness instead of a dull country house thou shalt have a house in london instead of the meadows thou shalt have the parks instead of skylarks the singers at the playhouse in due course thou shalt be my lady oh stopstop i must marry you since you make me but the partner in your ambitions will i never be my dear madam whispered speak him fair be humble to him remember he holds in his hands the lives of all yes benjamin overheard her the lives of all the man who dares to take my girl from meminedeserves to die yet so clement so forgiving so generous am i that i am ready to pardon him he shall actually save his life if therefore it is true that before marriage you love that man and are promised to him come to church with me out of your great love to him in order to save his life but if you love him not then you can love me and therefore can come to please yourself willy nilly what am i to be thwarted in such a trifle willy nilly i say i will marry thee comewe waste the time he seized my wrist as if he would have dragged me towards the door benjamin cried madam be merciful she is but a girl and she loves my poor boybe merciful oh it is not yet too late she snatched me from his grasp and stood between us her arms outstretched it is not too late they may die and we will go in sorrow but not in shame they may die go murderer of thy kith and kin go send thy grandfather to die upon the scaffold but at least leave us in peace no madam i said with your permission if there be no other way i will save their lives well then benjamin said sulkily there must be an end of this talk and no further delay else by the lord i know not what may happen will tom boilman delay to prepare his cauldron of hot pitch if we wait much longer robins arms and legs will be seething in that broth doth the judge delay with his warrant already he signs italready they are putting up the gibbet on which he will hang come i say benjamin was sure of his prey i suppose because we found the clergyman waiting for us in the church ready with surplice and book the clerk was standing beside him also with his book open at the service for marriage while they read the service madam threw herself prostrate on the communion steps her head in her hands as one who suffers the last extremities of remorse and despair for sin too grievous to be ever forgiven let us hope that sometimes we may judge ourselves more harshly than heaven itself doth judge us the clerk gave me away and was the only witness of the marriage besides that poor distracted mother twas a strange wedding there had been no banns put up the bride was pale and trembling the bridegroom was gloomy the only other person present wept upon her knees while the parson read through his ordered prayer and psalm and exhortation there was no sign of rejoicing so said benjamin when all was over now thou art my wife they shall not be hanged therefor come wife we will this day ride to exeter where thou shalt thyself bear the joyful news of thy marriage and their safety to my cousins they will own that i am a loving and a careful cousin he led me thus talking out of church now as we left the churchyard there passed through the gatesoh baleful omenfour men carrying between them a bier upon it was the body of another poor prisoner dead of jail fever i think that even the hard heart of benjaminnow my husbandoh merciful heavens he was my husbandquailed and was touched with fear at meeting this most sure and certain sign of coming woe for he muttered something in his teeth and cursed the bearers aloud for not choosing another time my husband theni must needs call him my husbandtold me brutally that i must ride with him to exeter where i should myself bear the joyful news of their safety to his cousins i did not take that journey nor did i bear the news nor did i ever after that moment set eyes upon him again nor did i ever speak to him again his wife i remained i suppose because i was joined to him in church but i never saw him after that morning and the reason why you shall now hear at the door of our lodging which was you know hard by the church stood mr boscorel himself what means this he asked with looks troubled and confused what doth it mean benjamin what hath happened in the name of god sir said benjamin you know my character you will acknowledge that i am not one of those who are easily turned from their purpose truly the occasion is not favourable for a wedding but yet i present to you my newlymarried wife thy wife child he thy husband why thou art betrothed to robin hath the world gone crazy do i hear aright is thisthisthisa time to be marrying hast thou not heard hast thou not

alice consented and i with her he will save them through his great friendship with judge jeffreys benjamin to save their lives sirrahhe turned to his son with great wrath in his facewhat villainy is

challis and barnaby eykin they will be sold by him and transported to jamaica or elsewhere for a term of years they were already saved cried madam he knew then when they were tried and sentenced that their lives were already spared oh child poor child oh alice oh my daughter what misery have we brought upon thee benjamin said nothing on his face lay a scowl of obstinacy as for me i was clinging to madams arm this man was my husbandand robin was already savedand by lies and villainy he had cheated us they were already saved mr boscorel continued benjamin knew iti sent him a letter that he might tell his cousins my sonalasi say again my only sonmy only sonmy son is a villain no one shall take my girl said benjamin sullenly what all is fair in love he has not told you either what hath happened

there is much more about that same time thy father breathed his last he too is dead he too hath his freedom benjamin knew of this as well alice my childthe kindly tears of compassion rolled down his face i have loved thee always my dear and it is my son who hath wrought this wickednessmy own sonmy only sonhe shook his cane in benjamins face oh villain he cried oh villain benjamin made no reply

punishment will be exemplary the judgments of god descend upon the most hardened get thee gone out of my sight let me never more behold thee until thou hast felt the intolerable pangs of remorse get thee hence i say begone i go not said benjamin without my loving wife i budge not i say without my tender and loving wife come my dear he advanced with outstretched hands but i broke away and fled shrieking as i ran mr boscorel stood before his son and barred the way raising his right hand back boy back he said solemnly back i say before thou reachest thy most unhappy wife first shalt thou pass over thy fathers body chapter xxxi the vision of consolation i ran so fast being then young and strong that benjamin i am sure could not have overtaken me had he tried because he was already gross of body and short of breath in consequence of his tippling i have since heard that he did not follow me nor did he dare to push aside his father but he laughed and said let her run let her run i warrant i shall find her and bring her back thinking i suppose that i had run from him as a girl in play runs from her companions i ran also so long fear lending me strength that the sun was getting even into the afternoon before i ventured to stop i looked round from time to time but saw no one following me i do not remember by what road track or path i went pasture fields and plantations i remember twice i crossed a stream on steppingstones once i saw before me a village with a church tower but this i avoided for fear of the people when i ventured to stop i was in a truly wild and desolate countryour county of somerset hath in it many such wild places given over to forests fern and heather presently i remembered the place though one forest is much like another and i knew that i had been in this part before on that day when we rode from lyme to taunton and again on the day when we walked prisoners with the soldiers to ilminster i was on the black down hills again when therefore i understood where i was i began to recover a little from the first horror which had driven me to fly like one possessed of an evil spirit and seeing that no one was in pursuit i began to collect my senses and to ask myself whither i was going and what i should do i was then near that ancient inclosure called castle ratch from whose walls one looks down upon the broad vale of taunton dean in the distance i thought i could discern the great tower of st marys church but perhaps that was only my imagination i sat down therefore upon the turf under these ancient walls and set myself to consider my condition which was indeed forlorn first i had no friends or protectors left in the whole world because after what i had done i could never look upon robin or even humphrey again nor could i importune madam because she would not anger her son i represented him in my mind as most unforgiving nor could i seek the help of mr boscorel because that might help his son to find me out and everybody knows that a husband may command the obedience of his wife and sir christopher was dead and my father was dead and my mother was dead and i could not even weep beside their coffins or follow their bodies to the grave a woman without friends in this world is like unto a traveller in a sandy desert without a bottle of water yet was i so far better than some of these poor friendless creatures because i had concealed upon me a bag containing all the money which barnaby had given metwo hundred and fifty gold piecessave a little which we had expended at taunton and ilminster this is a great sum and by its help i could i thought with satisfaction live for a long time perhaps all my life if i could find some safe retreat among godly people no friends why there was susan blake of tauntonshe who walked with the maids when they gave monmouth the bible the sword and the flags i resolved that i would go to her and tell her all that had happened out of her kindness she would take me in and help me to find some safe hidingplace and perhaps some honest way of living so as to save his money against barnabys return from the plantations then i thought i would find out the valley where we had lived for a fortnight and rest for one night in the hut and in the early morning before daybreak walk down the comb and so into taunton while as yet the town was still sleeping and this i did it was very easy to find the head of the comb and the source of the stream where we had made our encampment close by beneath the trees was barnabys hut no one had been there to disturb or destroy it but the leaves upon the boughs which formed its sides were now dead within it the fern and the heath which had formed my bed were still dry outside the pot hung over the black embers of our last fire and to my great joy in the basket which had contained our provisions i found a large crust of bread it was to be sure dry and hard but i dipped it in the running water of the stream and made my supper with it for dessert i had blackberries which were by this time ripe and are nowhere bigger or sweeter than on black down there were also filberts and nuts now ripe of which i gathered a quantity so that i had breakfast provided for me as well as supper when i had done this i was so tired and my head was so giddy with the terror of the day that i lay down upon the fern in the hut and there fell fast asleep and so continued until far into the night now in my sleep a strange thing happened unto me for my own part i account it nothing less than a vision granted unto me by mercy and special grace of heaven those who read of it may call it what they please it was in this wise there appeared before my sleeping eyes but they seemed wide open as it were a broad and open champaign presently there came running across the plain in great terror shrieking and holding her hands aloft a girl whose face at first i could not see she ran in this haste and terrible anguish of fear because there followed after her a troop of dogs barking and yelping behind the dogs rode on horseback one whose face i saw not any more than that of the girl he cursed and swore i knew the voice but could not tell being in a dream to whom it belonged and cracked a horrid whip and encouraged the dogs lashing the laggards in his eyes though his face was in some kind of shadow there was such a look as i remembered in benjamins when he put the ring upon my fingera look of resolute and hungry wickedness which made me tremble and shake now as i looked the dogs still gained upon her who ran and yelped as if in a few moments they would spring upon her and tear her flesh from her bones then suddenly between her who ran and those who pursued there arose an awful form he was clad in white and in his hand he bore a sword and he turned upon that hunter a face filled with wrath lightnings shot from his eyes and a cloud of thunder lay upon his brow at the sight of that face the dogs stopped in their running cowered and fell dead and at the dreadful aspect of that face the hunters horse fell headlong and his rider falling also with a shriek of terror broke his neck and so lay prostrate and dead then this dreadful minister of gods wrath turned from him to the flying figure and lo his face was now transformed his eyes became soft and full of love he smiled graciously a crown of glory was upon his head white robes flowed downward to his feet his fiery sword was a palm branch he was the angel of consolation have no more fear he said though the waves of the sea rise up against thee and the winds threaten to drown thee in the deep among the ungodly and the violent thou shalt be safe in all times of peril the lord will uphold thee earthly joy shall be thine be steadfast unto the end and then i looked again those blessed words ringing in my ears and behold i saw then which i had not seen before that the flying figure was none other than myself that he who cruelly hunted after with the dogs and the whip was none other than my husband and that the angel of wrath who became the angel of consolation was none other than my father himself but he was glorified oh the face was his facethat anyone could see but it was changed into somethingi know not whatso far brighter and sweeter than the earthly face that i marvelled then the vision disappeared and i awoke so bright and clear had it been that i seemed to see it still though i was sitting up with my eyes open and it was night then it slowly vanished henceforth however i was assured of two things first that no harm would happen unto me but that i should be protected from the malice of my enemies whatever they might design indeed i had but one enemyto wit the man who had that morning sworn to love and cherish me and next that i had seen with mortal eyes what indeed hath been vouchsafed to few the actual spiritual bodythe glorified body like to the earthly but changedwith which the souls of the elect are clothed so i arose now without the least fear it was night but in the east there showed the first grey of the dawn and the birds were already beginning to twitter as if they were dreaming of the day the wind was fresh and i was lightly clad but the splendour of the vision made me forget the cold oh i had received a voice from heaven how could i henceforth fear anything nay there was no room even for grief though those terrible things had fallen upon me and i was now alone and friendless and the world is full of ungodly men it must have been about halfpast four in the morning it grew light quickly so that not only the trees became visible but the black depths between them changed into glades and underwood and i could see my way down the comb beside the stream then without waiting for the sun to rise which he presently did in great warmth and splendour i started hoping to get into taunton before the people were up and the streets became crowded but i did not know the distance which must have been seven miles at least because it was nearly eight oclock when i reached the town having followed the course of the stream through three villages which i have since learned must have been those of pitminster trull and wilton it was market day and the streets were full of country peoplesome of them farmers with bags of corn in their hands going to the cornmarket and some with carts full of fresh fruit and other things their faces were heavy and sad and they talked in whispers as if they were afraid they had indeed good cause for fear for the prison held over five hundred unfortunate men waiting for their trial and the terrible judge was already on his way with his carts filled with more prisoners rumbling after him already colonel kirke had caused i know not how many to be hanged and the reports of what had been done at dorchester and exeter sufficiently prepared the minds of the wretched prisoners at taunton for what was about to be done there among them was the unfortunate captain hucker the sergemaker who had looked for a peerage and was now to receive a halter there was also among them that poor man mr simon hamlyn who was hanged only for riding into taunton in order to dissuade his son from joining monmouth this the mayor of taunton pointed out to the bloodthirsty judge but in vain the whole five hundred prisoners were in the end sentenced to death and one hundred and fortyfive actually suffered to the great indignation of those who looked on even of the kings party nay at one of the executions when nineteen were hanged at the same time and a great fire was made so that the sufferers might actually see before their death the fire that was to burn their bowels the very soldiers wept saying that it was so sad a thing they scarce knew how to bear it three years later the hard heart of the king met with its proper punishment the soldiers were among the crowd some leaning against bulkheads some drinking at the alehouses some haggling for the fruit some were also exercising upon castle green they looked goodnatured and showed in their faces none of the cruelty and rage which belonged to their officers but what a doleful change from the time when monmouths soldiers filled the town and all hearts were full of joy and every face shone with happiness what a change indeed as i passed among the crowd one caught me by the arm it was a little old woman her face all wrinkled and puckered she was sitting on a stool beside a great basketful of apples and plums and a short pipe of tobacco within her lips mistress she whispered taking the pipe from her mouth thou wert with the maids the day of the flags i remember thy pretty face what dost thou here abroad among the people the air of taunton town is unwholesome there may be others who will remember thee as well as i take an old womans advice and get thee gone how fares it with thy father the worthy dr eykin alas i said he died in ilminster jail tis pity but he was old and pious he hath gone to glory whither will those poor lads in the clink go when they are hanged get thee gone get thee gone the air is already foul with dead mens bodies they tell strange stories of what hath been done by women for the safety of their brothers get thee gone pretty maid lest something worse than prison happen to thee and judge jeffreys is coming hither like the devil having much wrath i could not tell her that nothing would happen to me because i was protected by a heavenly guard i was in the town forty years agone the old woman went on when blake defended it and we were wellnigh starved but never have i seen such things as have been done here since the duke was routed get thee gonehaste away as from the mouth of hellget thee gone poor child illustration as i passed through the crowd one caught me by the arm so i left her and went on my way hanging my head in hopes that no one else would recognise me fortunately no one did though i saw many faces which i had seen in the town before they were then tossing their caps and shouting for monmouth but were now gloomily whispering as if every man feared that his own turn would come next over the great gateway of the castle was stuck up a high row of heads arms and legs of rebels blackened with pitcha horrid sight unto this end had come those brave fellows who went forth to dethrone the king no one noticed or accosted me and i arrived safely at susans house the door seemed shut but when i pushed i found that it was openthe lock having been broken from its fastening barnaby did that i remembered i went in shutting it after me no doubt susan was with her children in the schoolroom strange that she should not repair her lock and that at a time when the town was full of soldiers who always carry with them their riotous and lawless followers twas unlike her orderly housekeeping there was no one in the back parlour where susan commonly took her meals and conducted the morning and evening prayers the dishes were on the table as if of last nights supper or yesterdays dinner this was also unlike a tidy housewife i opened the door of the front parlour though it was already past the hour for school there were no children in the room the lessonbooks and copyingbooks and slates lay about the floor what did this untidy litter mean then i went upstairs and into the bedrooms of which there were threenamely two on the floor above and one a garret no one was in them and the beds had not been made there remained only the kitchen no one was there the house was quite empty i observed also that the garden which was wont to be kept with the greatest neatness now looked neglected the ripe plums were dropping from the branches trained upon the wall the apples lay upon the grass the flowerbeds were cumbered with weeds grass grew in the walks the lawn which had been so neat and trim was covered with long grass what had happened where was susan then i seemed to hear her voice above thanking god for the victory as she had done when barnaby burst in upon us and methought i heard her singing a hymn with the children as she had done while we all sat embroidering the flags oh the pretty flags and oh the pretty sight of the innocents in white and blue carrying those flags the house was filled with the sounds of bygone happiness had i stayed another moment i am certain that i should have seen the ghosts of those who filled the rooms in the happy days when the army was in the town but i did not stay not knowing what to do or whither to fly i ran quickly out of the house thinking only to get away from the mournful silence of the empty and deserted rooms then as i stepped into the street i met face to face none other than mr george penne the kindhearted gentleman who had compassionated the prisoners at ilminster chapter xxxii the man of samaria tis no other than the fair maid of ilminster said mr penne with surprise madam with submission is it safeis it prudentfor one who walked with the maids of taunton on a certain memorable day to venture openly into the streets of this city at such a time judge jeffreys doth approach to hold his court thy friends are in prison or in hiding the maids are scattered all i sought shelter i said at the house of susan blake the schoolmistress how you have not heard then miss susan blake is dead she is dead she died in dorchester jail whither she was sent being specially exempted from any pardon twas fever carried her off she is dead alas the waste of good lives she might have bought her freedom after a while and thenbutwell tis useless to lament these mishaps alas alas i cried wringing my hands then am i in evil plight indeed all all are deadall my friends are dead madam he replied very kindly not all your friends if i may say so i have i assure you a most compassionate heart i bleed for the sufferings of others i cannot rest until i have brought relief this is my way oh i take not credit to myself therefor it is that i am so constituted i am not proud or uplifted on this account only tell me your case entrust your safety to me you may do so safely if you reflect for one moment becauseseeone word from me and you would be taken to prison by yon worthy clergyman who is none other than the rev mr walter harte the vicar of taunton no one is more active against the rebels and he would rejoice in committing thee on the charge of having been among the maids a word from me would i say cause you to be hauled to jail but observe i do not speak that wordgod forbid that i should speak that word oh sir i said this goodness overwhelms me then madam for greater privacy let us go back into the house and converse there so we went back into the empty house and sat in the back parlour as for the nature of your trouble madam he began i hope you have no dear brothers or cousins among those poor fellows in taunton jail no sir my only brother is at ilminster and my cousins are far away in new england that is well one who like myself is of a compassionate disposition cannot but bewail the grievous waste in jail fever smallpox scarlet fever or putrid throat to say nothing of the hangings which now daily happens in the prison what doth it avail to hang and quarter a man when he might be usefully set to work upon his majestys plantations it is a most sinful and foolish waste i sayhe spoke with great sincerity and warmthand a robbing of the pockets of honest merchants indeed sir i said your words prove the goodness of your heart let my deeds rather than my words prove that how fare the prisoners with whom you are most concerned alas sir christopher is dead and my father hath also died of his wound soindeed more waste they are dead more waste but one was old had sir christopher been sent to the plantations his value would have been but small though indeed a ransombut he is dead and your father being woundedbut they are dead and so no more need be said there are however others if i remember aright there is my brother in ilminster prison and yes the two young gentlemenchallis is their namein exeter i have seen them and conversed with them strong young men especially one of them tis sad indeed to think that they may be cut off in the very bloom of their age when they would command so high a price in jamaica or barbadoes i ventured to beg before their trial that they would immediately begin to use whatever interest they might be able to command in order to get their sentence which was certain commuted many will be suffered to go abroadwhy not these young gentlemen but they have no interest they assured me and therefore i fear that they will die tis most sad they cannot hang allthat is quite true but then these young gentlemen were officers in the army and therefore an example will be made of them if they have no interest at court well sir i told him pleased to find him of such a kindly and thoughtful disposition you will be glad to hear that they are already pardoned and have been presented by the king to a gentleman at court aha sayest thou so his eyes glittered and he rubbed his hands this is indeed joyful news one of them mr robin challis is a goodly lad like to whom there are few sent out to the plantations he will certainly fetch a good price the other mr humphrey who is somewhat crooked will go for less who hath obtained the gift of these young gentlemen it is a person named mr nipho mr jerome nipho i know him well he is a good catholici mean a papistand is much about the court he is lucky in having had many prisoners given to him and now madam i hope you will command my services in what way sir in this way i am as i have told youhere he wagged his head and winked both his eyes and laughed pleasantlyone of those foolish busybodies who love to be still doing good to their fellowcreatures to do good is my whole delight unfortunately the opportunities are rare of conferring exemplary benefit upon my fellowmen but here the way seems clear he rubbed his hands and laughed again repeating that the way was clear before him so that i believed myself fortunate in falling in with so virtuous a person oh sir i cried would that the whole world would so live and so act truly if it did we should have the prisons cleared there should be no more throwing away of good lives in hanging no more waste of stout fellows and lusty wenches by fever and smallpox all should go to the plantationsall now madam to our business which is the advantage of these young gentlemen know therefore that mr jerome nipho with all those who have received presents of prisoners straightway sells them to persons who engage to transport them across the seas to his majestys plantations in jamaica virginia or elsewhere there they are bound to work for a certain term of years call it not work however he added quickly say rather that they are invited every day to exercise themselves in the cotton and the sugar fields the climate is delightful the sky is seldom clouded there are never any frosts or snows it is always summer the fruits are delicious they have a kind of spirit distilled from the sugar canes which is said to be finer and more wholesome than the best nantz the food is palatable and plentiful though plain the masters or employers call them rather friends are gentlemen of the highest humanity and the society is composed of sober merchants wealthy planters and gentlemen like your brother who have had the misfortune to differ in opinions from the government why sir i said i have always understood that the transported prisoners are treated with the greatest inhumanity forced to work in heat such as we never experience driven with the lash and halfstarved so that none ever come back he shook his head gently see now he said how prejudices arise who could have thought that the plantations should be thus regarded tis true that there are estates cultivated by convicts of another kindi mean robbers highwaymen petty thieves and the like bristol doth every year send away a shipload at least of such nay tis reported that rather than hang murderers and the like the bristol merchants buy them of the magistrates but this is out of the kindness of their hearts madam he thrust his hand into his bosom and looked me in the face i myself am sometimes engaged in that trade i myself buy these unhappy prisoners and send them to estates where i know they will be treated with the greatest kindness do i look like a dishonest man madam as for my name it is george penne and i am known to every man of credit in bristol do i talk like one who would make money out of his neighbours sufferings nay if that is so let us part at once and say no more madam your humble servantno harm is done your humble servant madam he put his hat under his arm and made as if he would go but i begged him to remain and to advise me further in the matter then i asked him if transported persons ever came home again surely he replied some of them come home laden with gold some possessed of places both of honour and of profit who return to visit their friends and then go back to the new country it is a very eldorado or land of gold to those who are willing to work and for those who have money and choose to buy exemption from work it is only an agreeable residence in cheerful society for a certain term of years have you by chance madam any friends who can influence mr jerome nipho no sir i have none then will i myself communicate with that gentleman understand madam that i shall have to pay him so much a head for every prisoner that i shall be engaged to place every man on board ship that the prisoners will then be taken across the seas and again sold but in the case of those who have money a ransom can be procured by means of which they will not have to work so far he had spoken in the belief that i was at taunton on my brothers business or that of my friends i told him therefore that certain events had occurred which would prevent me from seeing the prisoners at exeter and because i could not forbear from weeping while i spoke he very earnestly begged me to inform him fully in every particular as to my history adding that his benevolence was not confined to the unhappy case of prisoners but that it was ready to be extended in any other direction that happy chance might offer therefore being as you have seen so friendless and so ignorant and so fearful of falling into my husbands hands and at the same time so grateful to this good man for his kindly offers indeed i took him for an instrument provided by heaven for the safety promised in my vision of the night that i told him everything exactly concealing nothing nay i even told him of the bag of gold which i had tied round my waista thing which i had hitherto concealed because the money was not mine but barnabys but i told it to mr penne while i related my history he interrupted me by frequent ejaculations showing his abhorrence of the wickedness with which benjamin compassed his design and when i finished he held up his hands in amazement good god he cried that such a wretch should live that he should be allowed still to cumber the earth what punishment were fitting for this devil in the shape of a man madam your case is indeed one that would move the heart of nero himself what is to be done nay that i know not for if i go back to our village he will find me there and if i find out some hidingplace he will seek me out and find me i shall never know rest or peace again for of one thing am i resolvedi will dieyea i will indeed diebefore i will become his wife more than i am at present i cannot but commend that resolution madam but to be plain with you there is no place in the world more unsafe for you than taunton at this time therefore if you please i will ride with you to bristol without delay sir i cannot ask this sacrifice of your business my business lies at bristol i can do no more here until judge jeffreys hath got through his hangings of which i fear there may be many and so more sinful waste of good convicts let us therefore hasten away as quickly as may be as for what shall be done afterwards that we will consider on the way did ever a woman in misfortune meet with so good a man the samaritan himself was not of better heart well to be brief half an hour afterwards we mounted and rode to bristol by way of bridgwater this town was even more melancholy than taunton taking three days the weather being now wet and rainy so that the ways were bad now as we rode alongmr penne and iside by side and his servant behind armed with a blunderbuss our conversation was grave turning chiefly on the imprudence of the people in following monmouth when they should have waited for the gentry to lead the way i found my companion whom i held to be my benefactor sober in manners and in conversation no drunkard no user of profane oaths and towards me a woman whom he had so to say in his own power he behaved always with the greatest ceremony and politeness so that i hoped to have found in this good man a true protector when we reached bristol he told me that for my better safety he would lodge me apart from his own house and so took me to a house in broad street near st johns gate where there was a most respectable old lady of grave aspect though red in the cheeks i have brought you madam he said to the house of a lady whose virtue and piety are well known sir said the old lady this house is well known for the piety of those who use it and everybody knows that you are all goodness no said mr penne no man is good we can but try our best in this house however madam you will be safe i beg and implore you not at present to stir abroad for reasons which you very well know this good woman has three or four daughters in the house who are sometimes i believe merry sir said the old lady children will be foolish true true he replied laughing take care then that they molest not madam no sir they shall not then madam for the moment i leave you rest and be easy in your mind i have i think contrived a plan which will answer your case perfectly in the evening he returned and sent me word very ceremoniously that he desired the favour of a conversation with me as if there could be anything in the world that i desired more madam he said i have considered carefully your case and i can find but one advice to give what is it sir we might he went on find a lodging for you in some quiet welsh town across the channel at chepstow for instance or at newport you might find a home for a while but the country being greatly inflamed with dissensions there would everywhere be the danger of some fanatical busybody inquiring into your historywhence you came why you left your friendsand so forth and again in every town there are women saving your presence madam whose tongues tittletattle all day long short work they make of a stranger so that i see not much safety in a small town then again you might find a farmhouse where they would receive you but your case is not that you wish to be hidden for a time as one implicated in the monmouth business not so you desire to be hidden all your life or for the whole life of the man who if he finds you may compel you to live with him and to live forhow long sixty years perhaps in a dull and dirty farmhouse among rude boors would be intolerable to a person of your manners and accomplishments then sir in the name of heavenfor i began to be wearied with this lengthy setting up of plans only to pull them down againwhat shall i do you might go to london at first i thought that london offered the best hope of safe retreat there are parts of london where the gentlemen of the robe are never seen and where you might be safe thus about the eastern parts of the city there are never any lawyers at all there you might be safe but yetit would be a perpetual risk your face madam if i may say so is one which will not be quickly forgotten when it hath once been seenyou would be persecuted by wouldbe lovers you would go in continual terror knowing that one you fear was living only a mile away from you you would have to make up some story to maintain which would be troublesome and presently the time would come when you would have no more money what then would you do pray sir if you can tell me what you think i should do since there are so many things that i cannot do madam i am going to submit to you a plan which seems to me at once the safest and the best you have you tell me cousins in the town of boston which is in new england yes i have heard my father speak of his cousins i have myself visited that place and have heard mention of certain eykins as gentlemen of substance and reputation i propose madam that you should go to these cousins and seek a home among them leave england you would have me leave this country and go across the ocean to america that is my advice nay madamhe assumed a most serious mannerdo not reject this advice suddenly sleep upon it you are not going among strangers but among your own people by whom the name of your pious and learned father is doubtless held in great honour you are going from a life at best of danger and continual care to a place where you will be certainly free from persecution madam sleep upon it chapter xxxiii on board the jolly thatcher i lay awake all night thinking of this plan the more i thought upon it the more i was pleased with it to fly from the country was to escape the pursuit of my husband who would never give over looking for me because he was so obstinate and masterful i should also escape the reproaches of my lover robin and break myself altogether from a passion which was now through my own rashness become sinful i might also break myself from the loathing and hatred which i now felt towards my wicked husband and might even in time and after much prayer arrive at forgiving him at that timeyea and for long afterwardsi did often surprise myself in such a fit of passion as i verily believe would have made me a murderess had opportunity or the evil one sent that man my way yea not once or twice but many times have i thus become a murderess in thought and wish and intentioni confess this sin with shame though i have long since repented of it to have been so near unto itnay to have already committed it in my imagination covers me with shame and now when i sometimes my lord the master of my affections doth allow it visit the prison of ilchester and find therein some poor wretch who hath yielded to temptation and sudden wrath which is the possession by the devil and so hath committed what i only imagined my heart goes forth to that poor creature and i cannot rest until i have prayed with her and softened her heart and left her to go contrite to the shameful tree nay since as you shall hear i have been made to pass part of my life among the most wicked and profligate of my sex i am filled with the thought that the best of us are not much better than the worst and that the worst of us are in some things as good as the best so that there is no room for pride and selfsufficiency but much for humiliation and distrust of ones own heart well if i would consent to fly from the country across the seas i should find kith and kin who would shelter me there should i learn to think about other thingspoor wretch as if i could ever forget the villageand robin oh that i should have to tryeven to tryto forget robin i was to learn that though the skies be changed the heart remains the same how i fledand whitheryou shall now hear mr george penne came to see me next morning sleek and smiling and courteous madam he said may i know your decision if you have yet arrived at one sir it is already made i have slept upon it i have prayed upon it i will go that is well it is also most opportune because a ship sails this very day it is most opportune i sayeven providential she will drop down the channel with the coming tide you will want a few things for the voyage it will be winter when we arrive and the winters in that country are cold i must buy some thicker clothing will there be any gentlewoman on board surelyhe smiledsurely there will be i am told more than one gentlewoman on board that ship there will be in fact a large and a cheerful company of that you may be assured well since that is settled a great load of care is removed because i have heard that your husband rode into taunton with judge jeffreys that he learned from someonei know not from whomof your presence in the town and of your departure with me it must have been the marketwoman doubtless the marketwomani have often asked myself whether this was a falsehood or notand he is even now speeding towards bristol hoping to find you pray heaven that he hath not learned with whom you fled oh i cried let us go on board the ship at once let us hasten nay there is no hurry for a few hours but stay withindoors everything that is wanted for the voyage shall be put on board for you as for your meals you will eat withhere he paused for a momentwith the rest of the company under the care of the captain for your berth it will be as comfortable as can be provided next as to the money you have i understand two hundred pounds and more i took the bag from my waist and rolled out the contents there were in all two hundred and fortyfive pounds and a few shillings the rest had been expended at ilminster he counted it carefully and then replaced the money in the bag the eykins of boston in new england he said are people of great credit and substance there will be no necessity for you to take with you this money should you wish it to be expended to the advantage of your brother and your friends take it all kind sir take it all if so be it will help them in their need nay that will not do either he replied smiling his hand still upon the bag for first the captain of your ship must be paid for his passage next you must not go among strangers though your own kith and kin with no money at all in purse therefore i will set aside by your good leave fifty pounds for your private purse so fifty pounds a letter to my correspondent at boston which i will write will cause him to pay you this money on your landing this is a safer method than to carry the money in a bag or purse which may be stolen but if the letter be lost another can be written we merchants indeed commonly send three such letters of advice in case of shipwreck and loss of the bags this done and the expenses of the voyage provided there remains a large sum which judiciously spent will i think insure for your friends from the outset the treatment reserved for prisoners of distinction who can afford to paynamely on their arrival they will be bought as it is termed by worthy merchants who having been previously paid by me will suffer them to live where they please without exacting of them the least service or work their relatives at home will forward them the means of subsistence and so their exile will be softened for them if you consent thereto madam i will engage that they shall be so received with the help of this money if i consented indeed with what joy did i give my consent to such laying out of my poor barnabys money everything now seemed turning to the best thanks to my new and benevolent friend at his desire therefore i wrote a letter to barnaby recommending him to trust himself and to advise robin and humphrey to trust themselves entirely to the good offices of this excellent man i informed him that i was about to cross the seas to our cousins in new england in order to escape the clutches of the villain who had betrayed me and then i told him how his money had been bestowed and bade him seek me when he should be released from the plantations wherever they might send him at the town of boston among his cousins the letter mr penne faithfully promised to deliver nota benethe letter was never given to barnaby at the same time he wrote a letter for me to give to his correspondent at boston telling me that on reading that letter his friend would instantly pay me the sum of fifty pounds thus was the business concluded and i could not find words i told him to express the gratitude which i felt for so much goodness towards one who was a stranger to him i begged him to suffer me to repay at least the charges to which he had been put at the inns and the stabling since he took me into his own care and protection but he would take nothing money he said as payment for such services as he had been enabled to render would be abhorrent to his nature should good deeds be bought was it seemly that a merchant of credit should sell an act of common christian charity what he asked are we to see a poor creature in danger of being imprisoned if she is recognisedand of being carried off against her will by a husband whom she loathes if he finds herare we to see such a woman and not be instantly fired by every generous emotion of compassion and indignation to help that woman at the mere cost of a few days service and a few guineas spent i was greatly movedeven to tearsat these words and at all this generosity and i told him that i could not sufficiently thank him for all he had done and that he should have my prayers always i hope i may madam he said smiling strangely when the ship hath sailed you will remember perhaps the fate of susan blake and whatever may be your present discomfort on board a rolling ship say to yourself that this is better than to die in a noisome prison you will also understand that you have fallen into the hands of a respectable merchant who is much more lenient than judge jeffreys and will not consent to the wasting of good commercial stuff in jails and on gibbets nay sir i said what doth all this mean nothing madam nothing i was only anxious that you should say to yourself thus and thus have i been saved from a jail such was mr pennes humanity understand it oh dear sir i repeat that my words are not strong enough to express my gratitude now madam no doubt your gratitude runs high whether tomorrow can i ever forget tomorrow tomorrow surely sir well madam we will wait until tomorrow meantime lie snug and still all day and in the afternoon i will come for you two hundred and fortyfive poundstis not a great sum but a good days worka good days work added to the satisfaction of helping a most unfortunate young gentlewomanmost unfortunate what did the good man mean by still talking of the morrow at halfpast twelve the good woman of the house brought me a plate of meat and some bread so she saidher face was red and i think she had been drinkinghe hath determined to put you on board with the rest i hear hush if you have heard say nothing he thinks he can buy my silence come madam though indeed some would rather take their chance with judge jeffreysthey say he is a man who can be moved by the face of a womanthan withwell as for my silence thereit is usual madam to compliment the landlady and though i confess you are not of the kind which do commonly frequent this house yet one may expect alas my good woman i have nothing mr penne has taken all my money what you had money and you gave it to mr penne you gave it to him nay indeedwhy in the place where thou art going she was silent for suddenly we heard mr pennes step outside and he opened the door come he said roughly the captain says that he will weigh anchor in an hour the tide servescome i hastened to put on my hat and mantle farewell i said taking the old womans hand i have nothing to give thee but my prayers mr penne who is all goodness will reward thee for thy kindness to me he all goodness asked the old woman he why if there is upon the face of the whole earth come child mr penne seized my hand and dragged me away the woman he said hath been drinking it is a bad habit she hath contracted of late i must see into it and speak seriously to her but a good nature at heart come we must hasten you will be under the special care of the captain i have provided a box full of warm clothing and other comforts i think there is nothing omitted that may be of use come he hurried me along the narrow streets until we came to a quay where there were a great number of ships such as i had never before seen on one of them the sailors were running about clearing away things coiling ropes tossing sacks and casks aboard with such a yohoing and noise as i never in my life heard before tis our ship said mr penne then he led me along a narrow bridge formed by a single plank to the deck of the ship there stood a gentleman of a very fierce and resolute aspect armed with a sword hanging from a scarlet sash and a pair of pistols in his belt captain said mr penne are all aboard ay we have all our cargo and a pretty crew they are is this the last of them send her forard madam said mr penne suffer me to lead you to a place where until the ship sails and the officers have time to take you to your cabin you can rest and be out of the way it is a rough assemblage but at sailing one has no choice gathered in the forepart of what they call the waist there was a company of about a hundred people some were young some old some were men some women some seemed mere children all alike showed in their faces the extreme of misery apprehension and dismay who are these i asked they will tell you themselves presently madam farewell with that mr penne left me standing among this crowd of wretches and without waiting for my last words of gratitude hurried away immediately i saw him running across the plank to the quay then the boatswain blew a shrill whistle the plank was shoved over some ropes were cast loose and the ship began slowly to move down the river with the tide now beginning to run out and a wind from the northeast i looked about me what were all these people why were they going to new england then as the deck was now clearer and the sailors i suppose at their stations i ventured to walk towards the afterpart of the ship with the intention to ask the captain for my cabin as i did so a man stood before me armed with a great cane which he brandished threatening with a horrid oath to lay it across my back if i ventured any further aft prisoners forard he cried back you go orby the lord prisoner i said i am no prisoner i am a passenger passenger why as for that you are all passengers all who are these then he informed me with plainness of speech who and what they wereconvicts taken from the prisons branded in the hand and sentenced to transportation but i am a passenger i repeated mr penne hath paid for my passage to new england he hath paid the captain the ship is bound for barbadoes not new england tis my duty not to stir from this spot but heres the matetell him this was a young man armed like the captain with pistols and sword sir i said i am a passenger brought on board by mr penne by whom my passage hath been paid to new england by mr george penne you say the same he hath engaged a cabin for me and hath purchased clothesand is it possible said the mate that you do not know where you are and whither you are going i am going under the special care of the captain to the city of boston in new england to my cousin mr eykin a gentleman of credit and substance of that town he gazed at me with wonder i will speak to the captain he said and left me standing there presently he returned come with me he said you are alice eykin said the captain who had with him a paper from which he read that is my name on a certain day in july your father being a preacher in the army of the duke of monmouth you walked with a procession of girls bearing flags which you presented to that rebel it is true sir you have been given by the king to some great lord or other i know not whom and by him sold to the man penne who hath put you on board this ship the jolly thatcher port of london to be conveyed with a hundred prisoners all rogues and thieves to the island of barbadoes where you will presently be sold as a servant for ten years after which period if you choose you will be at liberty to return to england then indeed the captain before me seemed to reel about and i fell fainting at his feet chapter xxxiv the good samaritan this was indeed the truth i had parted with my money on the word of a villain i put myself into his power by telling him the whole of my sad story and on the promise of sending me by ship to my cousins in new england he had entered my name as a rebel sold to himself afterwards i learned that he made it appear as if i was one of the hundred given to mr jerome nipho all of whom he afterwards bought and sent to the plantations and he had then shipped me on board a vessel on the point of sailing with as vile a company of rogues vagabonds thieves and drabs as were ever raked together out of the streets and the prisons when i came to my senses the captain gave me a glass of cordial and made me sit down on a guncarriage while he asked me many questions i answered him all truthfully concealing only the reason of my flight and of my visit to taunton where i told him truly i hoped to see my unhappy friend miss susan blake of whose imprisonment and death i knew nothing madam said the captain stroking his chin your case is indeed a hard one yet your name is entered on my list and i must deliver your body at st michaels port barbadoes or account for its absence this must i do i have no other choice as for your being sold to mr george penne by mr jerome nipho this may very well be without your knowing even that you had been given to that gentleman by the king they say that the maids of taunton have all been given away mostly to the queens maids of honour and must either be redeemed at a great price or be sold as you have been on the other hand there may be villainy and in this case it might be dangerous for you to move in the matter lest you be apprehended and sent to jail as a rebel and so a worse fate happen unto you illustration when i came to my senses the captain gave me a glass of cordial he then went on to tell me that this pretended merchant this mr george penne was the most notorious kidnapper in the whole of bristol that he was always raking the prisons of rogues and sending them abroad for sale on the plantations that at this time he was looking to make a great profit because there were so many prisoners that all could not be hanged but most must be either flogged and sent about their business or else sold to him and his like for servitude as for any money paid for your passage he went on i assure you madam upon my honour that nothing at all has been paid by him nor has he provided you with any change of clothes or provisions of any kind for the voyage nor hath he asked or bargained for any better treatment of you on board than is given to the rogues below and that madam he added is food of the coarsest and planks for sleep of the hardest the letter which you have shown me is a mere trick i do not think there is any such person in boston it is true however that there is a family of your name in boston and that they are substantial merchants i make no doubt that as he hath treated you so he will treat your friends and that all the money which he has taken from you will remain in his own pocket then i cried what am i to do where look for help tis the damnedest villain cried the captain swearing after the profane way of sailors when next i put in at the port of bristol if the monmouth scare be over i will take care that all the world shall know what he hath done but indeed he will not care the respectable merchants have nothing to say with himhe is now an open catholic who was formerly concealed in that religion therefore he thinks his fortune is at the flood but what is to be done madam indeed sir i know not he considered a while his face was rough and coloured like a ripe plum with the wind and the sun but he looked honest and he did not like mr penne pretend to shed tears over my misfortunes those who join rebellions he said but not unkindly generally find themselves out in their reckoning in the end what the deuce have gentlewomen to do with the pulling down of kings i warrant now you thought you were doing a grand thing and so you must needs go walking with those pretty fools the maids of taunton well tis past praying for george penne is such a villain that keelhauling is too good for him flogged through the fleet at spithead he should be madam i am not one who favours rebels yet you cannot sleep and mess with the scum down yonder twould be worse than inhumantheir talk and their manners would kill you there is a cabin aft which you can have the furniture is mean but it will be your own while you are aboard you shall mess at my table if you will so honour me you shall have the liberty of the quarterdeck i will also find for you if i can among the women aboard one somewhat less villainous than the rest who shall be your grumeta as the spaniards sayyour servant that isto keep your cabin clean and do your bidding when we make barbadoes there is no help for it but you must go ashore with the rest and take your chance this was truly generous of the captain and i thanked him with all my heart he proved as good as his word for though he was a hard man who duly maintained discipline flogging his prisoners with rigour he treated me during the whole voyage with kindness and pity never forgetting daily to curse the name of george penne and drink to his confusion the voyage lasted six weeks at first we had rough weather with heavy seas and rolling waves happily i was not made sick by the motion of the ship and could always stand upon the deck and look at the waves a spectacle to my mind the grandest in the whole world but i fear there was much suffering among the poor wretchesmy fellowprisoners they were huddled and crowded together below the deck they were all seasick there was no doctor to relieve their sufferings nor were there any medicines for those who were ill fever presently broke out among them so that we buried nine in the first fortnight of our voyage after this the weather growing warm and the sea moderating the sick mended rapidly and soon all were well again i used to stand upon the quarterdeck and look at them gathered in the waist below never had i seen such a company they came i heard principally from london which is the rendezvous or headquarters of all the rogues in the country they were all in ragshad any one among them possessed a decent coat it would have been snatched from his back the very first day they were dirty from the beginning many of them had cuts and wounds on their heads gotten in their fights and quarrels and these were bound about with old clouts their faces were not freshcoloured and rosy like the faces of our honest country lads but pale and sometimes covered with red blotches caused by their evil lives and their hard drinking on their foreheads was clearly set the seal of satan never did i behold wickedness so manifestly stamped upon the human countenance they were like monkeys for their knavish and thievish tricks they stole everything that they could lay hands upon pieces of rope the sailors knives when they could get them even the marlinspikes if they were left about when they were caught and flogged they would make the ship terrible with their shrieks being cowards as prodigious as they were thieves they lay about all day ragged and dirty on deck in the place assigned to them stupidly sleeping or else silent and dumpish except for some of the young fellows who gambled with cardsi know not for what stakesand quarrelled over the game and fought it was an amusement among the sailors to make these lads fight on the forecastle promising a pannikin of rum to the victor for this miserable prize they would fight with the greatest fury and desperation even biting one another in their rage while the sailors clapped their hands and encouraged them pity it is that the common sort do still delight themselves with sport so brutal on shore these fellows would be rejoicing in cockfights and bullbaitings on board they baited the prisoners there were among the prisoners twenty or thirty women the sweepings of the bristol streets they too would fight as readily as the men until the captain forbade it under penalty of a flogging these women were to the full as wicked as the men nay their language was worse insomuch that the very sailors would stand aghast to hear the blasphemies they uttered and would even remonstrate with them saying nan or pollthey were all polls and nanstis enough to cause the ship to be struck with lightning give over now wilt sink the ships company with your foul tongue but the promise of a flogging kept them from fighting men i think will brave anything for a moments gratification but not even the most hardened woman will willingly risk the pain of the whip the captain told me that of these convicts of whom every year whole shiploads are taken to virginia to jamaica and to barbadoes not one in a hundred ever returns for he said the work exacted from them is so severe with so much exposure to a burning sun and the fare is so hard that they fall into fevers and calentures and besides the dangers from the heat and the bad food there is a drink called rum or arrack which is distilled from the juice of the sugarcane and another drink called mobbie distilled from potatoes which inflames their blood and causes many to die before their time moreover the laws are harsh and there is too much flogging and branding and hanging so that some fall into despair and in that condition of mind die under the first illness which seizes on them captain i said you forget that i am also to become one of these poor wretches the captain swore lustily that on his return he would seek out the villain penne and break his neck for him then he assured me that the difference between myself and the common herd would be immediately recognised that a rebel is not a thief and must not be so treated and that i had nothing to fearnay that he himself would say what he could in my favour but he entreated me with the utmost vehemence to send home an account of where i was and what i was enduring to such of my friends as might have either money to relieve me from servitude or interest to procure a pardon alas i had no friends mr boscorel i knew full well would move heaven and earth to help me but he could not do that without his son finding out where i was and this thought so moved me that i implored the captain to tell no one who i was or what was my history and for greater persuasion i revealed to him those parts of my history which i had hitherto concealed namely my marriage and the reason of that rash step and my flight madam he said i would that i had the power of revenging these foul wrongs for them i swear i would kidnap both mr george penne and mr benjamin boscorel and look you i would make them mess with the scum and the sweepings whom we carry forard and i would sell them to the most inhuman of the planters by whom they would be daily beaten and cuffed and flogged or better still would cause them to be sold at havana to the spaniards where they would be employed as are the english prisoners commonly by that cruel people namely in fetching water under negro overseers i leave you to imagine how long they would live and what terrible treatment they would receive so it was certain that i was going to a place where i must look for very little mercy unless i could buy it and where the white servant was regarded as worth so many years of work not so much as a negro because he doth sooner sink under the hardships of his lot while the negro continues frolick and lusty and marries and has children even though he has to toil all day in the sun and is flogged continually to make him work with the greater heart among the women on board was a young woman not more than eighteen or thereabout who was called deb she had no other name her birthplace she knew not but she had run about the country with some tinkers whose language she said is called shelta by those people this she could still talk they sold her in bristol after which her history is one which i learn is common in towns when the captain bade her come to the cabin and ordered her to obey me in whatsoever i commanded she looked stupidly at him shrinking from him if he moved as if she was accustomed which was indeed the case to be beaten at every word i made her first clean herself and wash her clothes this done she slept in my cabin and as the captain promised became my servant at first she was not only afraid of illtreatment but she would wilfully lie she purloined things and hid them she told me so many tales of her past life all of them different that i could believe none yet when she presently found out that i was not going to beat her and that the captain did never offer to cuff or kick her which the poor wretch expected she left off telling falsehoods and became as handy obliging and useful a creature as one could desire she was a great strapping girl blackeyed and with black hair as strong as any man and a goodlooking creature as well to those who like great women this deb when i say she ceased to be afraid of me began to tell me her true history which was i suppose only remarkable because she seemed not to know that it was shameful and wicked she lived as the people among whom she had been brought up lived without the least sense or knowledge of god indeed no heathen savage could be more without religion than the tinkers and gipsies on the road they have no knowledge at all they are born they live they die they are buried in a hedgeside and are forgotten it was surprising to me to find that any woman could grow up in a christian country so ignorant and so uncared for in the end as you shall hear she showed every mark of penitence and fell into a godly and pious life my captain continued in the same kindness towards me throughout the voyagesuffering me to mess at his table where the provisions were plain but wholesome and encouraging me to talk to him seeming to take pleasure in my simple conversation in the mornings when with a fair wind and full sail the ship ploughed through the water while the sun was hot overhead he would make me a seat with a pillow in the shade and would then entreat me to tell him about the rebellion and our flight to black down or he would encourage me in serious talk though his own conversation with his sailors was overmuch garnished with profane oaths listening with grave face and sometimes he would ask me questions about the village of bradford orcas my mother and her wheel sir christopher and the rector showing a wonderful interest in everything that i told him it was strange to see how this man hard as he was with the prisoners whom it was necessary to terrify otherwise they might mutiny could be so gentle towards me a stranger and a costly one too because he was at the expense of maintaining me for the whole voyage and the whole time being of good manners never rude or rough or offering the least freedom or familiaritya thing which a woman in my defenceless position naturally fears he could not have shown more respect unto a queen the lord will surely reward him therefor one evening at sunset when we had been at sea six weeks he came to me as i was sitting on the quarterdeck and pointed to what seemed a cloud in the west tis the island of barbadoes he said tomorrow if this wind keeps fair we shall make the port of st michaels which some call the bridge and then madam alashe fetched a deep sighi must put you ashore and part with the sweetest companion that ever sailed across the ocean he said no more but left me as if he had other things to say but stifled them presently the sun went down and darkness fell upon the waters the wind also fell and the sea was smooth so that there was a great silence tomorrow i thought we shall reach the port and i shall be landed with these wretches and sent perhaps to toil in the fields but yet my soul was upheld by the vision which had been granted to me upon the black down hills and i feared nothing this i can say without boasting because i had such weighty reasons for the faith that was in me the captain presently came back to me madam he said suffer me to open my mind to you sir i told him there is nothing which i could refuse you saving my honour i must confess he said i have been torn in twain for love of you madam ever since you did me the honour to mess at my table nay hear me out and i have been minded a thousand times to assure you first that your marriage is no marriage and that you have not indeed any husband at all next that since you can never go back to your old sweetheart tis better to find another who would protect and cherish you and thirdly that i am readyay and longingnow to become your husband and protector and to love you with all my heart and soul sir i said i thank you for telling me this which indeed i did not suspect but i am alas as you know already marriedeven though my marriage be no true oneand can never forget the love which i still must bear to my old sweetheart wherefore i may not listen to any talk of love if he replied you were a woman after the common pattern you would right gladly cast aside the chains of this marriage ceremony but madam you are a saint therefore i refrained he sighed i confess that i have been dragged as by chains to lay myself at your feet well that must not be he sighed again yet i would save you madam from the dangers of this place the merchants and planters do for the most part though gentlemen of good birth lead debauched and ungodly lives and i fear that though they may spare you the hardships of the field they may offer you other and worse indignities i answered in the words of david the lord hath delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the philistines nay but there is a way you need not land at all it is but a scratch of the pen and i will enter your name among those who died upon the voyage there will be no more inquiry any more than after the other names and then i can carry you back with me to the port of london whither i am bound after taking in my cargo for a space i was sorely tempted then i reflected it would be i remembered by consenting to the captains treachery towards his employers nothing less that i could escape this lot no sir i said i thank you from my heart for all your kindness and for your forbearance but we may not consent together unto this sin again i thank you but i must suffer what is laid upon me he knelt at my feet and kissed my hands saying nothing more and presently i went to my cabin and so ended my first voyage across the great atlantic ocean in the morning when i awoke we were beating off carlisle bay and i felt like unto one of those christian martyrs of whom i have read whom they were about to lead forth and cast unto the lions chapter xxxv the white slave when we dropped anchor in the port or road of carlisle bay we were boarded by a number of gentlemen who welcomed the captain asked him the news and drank with him i meantime kept in my cabin knowing that i must shortly come forth and presently i heard the boatswains pipe and the order to all the prisoners to come on deck then one knocked softly at my door it was the captain madam he said with a troubled voice it is not too late suffer me i pray you to enter your name as one of those who died on the voyage it is no great deception the villain penne will alone be hurt by it and i swear to take you home and to place you until better times with honest and godfearing people in london oh sir i replied tempt me not i pray you let me go forth and take my place among the rest he entreated me again but finding that he could not prevail he suffered me to come out yet such was his kindness to the last that he would not place me with the rest but caused his men to give me a chair on the quarterdeck then i saw that we were all to be sold the prisoners were drawn up standing in lines one behind the other the men on one side and the women on the other the hardships of the voyage had brought them so low that what with their rags and dirt and their dull scowls and savage faces and their thin pale cheeks they presented a forbidding appearance indeed three or four gentlemen they were i found planters of the island were examining them ordering them to lift up their arms stretch out their legs open their mouths and in short treating them like so many cattle at which the women laughed with ribald words but the men looked as if they would willingly if they dared take revenge faugh cried one of the planters here is a goodly collection indeed the island is like to become the dustheap of great britain where all the rubbish may be shot captain how long before these bags of bones will drop to pieces well sweet ladies and fair gentlemenhe made a mock bow to the prisonersyou are welcome after the voyage a little exercise will do you good you will find the air of the fields wholesome and the gentlewomen i assure you will discover that the drivers and overseers will willingly oblige any who want to dance with a skippingrope there were now twenty or thirty gentlemen all of them merchants and planters on board and a man stepped forward with a book and pencil in hand who was i perceived the salesman gentlemen he said this parcel of servants he called them a parcel as if they were a bale of dry goods is consigned to my care by mr george penne of bristol their owner they are partly from that city and partly from london though shipped at the port of bristol a tedious voyage following after a long imprisonment in newgate and bridewell hath it is true somewhat reduced them but there are among them as you will find on examination many lusty fellows and stout wenches and i doubt not that what you buy today will hereafter prove good bargains they are to be sold without reserve and to the highest bidder robert bullhe read the first name on the listrobert bull shoplifter stand forth robert bull there arose from the deck where he had been lying a poor wretch who looked as if he could hardly stand wasted with fever and privation his eyes hollow yet they looked full of wicked cunning the planters shook their heads come gentlemen said the salesman we must not judge by appearances he is at present no doubt weak but not so weak as he looks i warrant a smart cut or two of the whip would show another man who bids for robert bull he was sold after a little parley for the sum of five pounds then the speaker called another naming his offence as a qualification no pillory could be more shameful yet the men looked dogged and the women laughed the sale lasted for three or four hours the prisoners being knocked down as they say for various sums the greatest price being given for those women who were young and strong the reason i have been told is that the women make better servants endure the heat more patiently do not commonly drink the strong spirit which destroys the men and though they are not so strong do more work illustration this i did and so stood before them all bareheaded last of all the man called my name alice eykin rebel stand forth alice eykin rebel do not go down among them said the captain let them see at once that yours is no common case stand here he led me to the top of the ladder or steps which they call the companionleading from the waist to the quarterdeck madam he said it will be best to throw back your hood this i did and so stood before them all bareheaded oh ye who are women of gentle nurture think of such a thing as this to stand exposed to the curious gaze of rough and ribald men to be bought and sold like a horse or an ox at the fair at first my eyes swam and i saw nothing and should have fallen but that the captain placed his hand upon my arm and so i was steadied then my sight cleared and i could look down upon the faces of the men below there was no place whither i could fly and hide it would be more shameful still because it might make them laugh to burst into tears why i thought why had i not accepted the captains offer and suffered my name to be entered as one of those who had died on the voyage and been buried in the sea down in the waist the gentlemen gazed and gasped in astonishment it was no new thing for the planters to buy political prisoners oliver cromwell sent over a shipload of irishmen first and another shipload of those engaged in the rising of penruddock and grove among them were gentlemen divines and officers of whom a few yet survived on the island but as yet no gentlewoman at all had been sent out for political reasons wherefore i suppose they looked so amazed and gazed first at me and then at one another and then gasped for breath alice eykin gentlemen said the salesman who had a tongue which as they say ran upon wheels is a young gentlewoman the daughter i am informed of the rev comfort eykin doctor of divinity deceased formerly rector of bradford orcas in the county of somerset and sometime fellow of his college at oxford a very learned divine she hath had the misfortune to have taken part in the monmouth rebellion and was one of those maids of taunton who gave the duke his flags as you have heard by the latest advices therefore she is sent abroad for a term of ten years gentlemen there can be no doubt that her relations will not endure that this young ladyas beautiful as she is unfortunate and as tender as she is beautifulshould be exposed to the same hard treatment as the rogues and thieves whom you have just had put up for sale they will i am privately assuredi heard this statement with amazementgladly purchase her freedom after which unless she is permitted to return the society of our colony will rejoice in the residence among them of one so lovely and so accomplished meantime she must be sold like the rest did monmouth make war with women for his followers asked a gentleman of graver aspect than most i for one will have no part or share in such traffic are english gentlewomen because their friends are rebels to be sent into the fields with the negroes your wife would be jealous said another and then they all laughed i understood not until afterwards that the buying and selling of such a person as i appeared to be is a kind of gambling that is to say the buyer hopes to get his profit not by any work that his servant should do but by the ransom that his friends at home should offer and so they began to bid with jokes rude and unseemly and much laughter while i stood before them still bareheaded ten pounds one began twelve cried another fifteen said a third and so on the price continually rising and the salesman with honeyed tongue continually declaring that my friends as he very well knew would consent to give any ransomanyso only that i was set free from servitude until for sixty pounds no one offering a higher price i was sold to one whose appearance i liked the least of any he was a gross fat man with puffed cheeks and short neck who had bought already about twenty of the servants be easy he said to one who asked him how he looked to get his money back it is not for twice sixty pounds that i will consent to let her go what is twice sixty pounds for a lovely piece like this then the captain who had stood beside me saying nothing interfered madam he said you can put up your hood again and harkee sir he spoke to the planter remember that this is a pious and virtuous gentlewoman andhere he swore a round oathif i hear when i make this port again that you have offered her the least freedomyou shall answer to me for it gentlemen all he went on i verily believe that you will shortly have the greatest windfall that hath ever happened to you compared with which the salisbury rising was but a fleabite for the trials of the monmouth rebels were already begun when i left the port of bristol and though the judges are sentencing all alike to death they cannot hang them alltherefore his majestys plantations and barbadoes in particular will not only have whole cargoes of stout and ablebodied servants compared with whom these poor rogues are like so many worthless weeds but there will also be many gentlemen and perhaps gentlewomenlike madam herewhose freedom will be bought of you so that i earnestly advise and entreat you not to treat them cruelly but with gentleness and forbearance whereby you will be the gainers in the end and will make their friends the readier to find the price of ransom moreover you must remember that though gentlemen may be flogged at whippingposts and beat over the head with canes as is your habit with servants both black and white when the time of their deliverance arrives they will be no longer slaves but gentlemen again and able once more to stand upon the point of honour and to run you through the body as you will richly deserve for your barbarity and in the same way any gentlewomen who may be sent here have brothers and cousins who will be ready to perform the same act of kindness on their behalf remember that very carefully gentlemen if you please the captain spoke to all the gentlemen present but in the last words he addressed himself particularly unto my new master it was a warning likely to be very serviceable the planters being one and all notoriously addicted to beating and whipping their servants and i have no doubt that these words did a great deal towards assuring for the unfortunate gentlemen who presently arrived such consideration and good treatment as they would not otherwise have received the island of barbadoes as many people know is one of the caribby islands it is as to size a small place not more than twenty miles in length by fifteen in breadth but in population it is a very considerable place indeed for it is said to have as many people in it as the city of bristol it is completely settled and of the former inhabitants not one is left they were the people called indians or caribs and how they perished i know not the island had four ports of which the principal is that of st michael or the bridge or bridgetown in carlisle bay the heat by day is very great and there is no winter but summer all the year round there is however a cool breeze from the sea which moderates the heat a great number of vessels call here every year there is said to be one every day but this i cannot believe they bring to the island all kinds of european manufactures and take away with them cargoes of muscovada sugar cotton ginger and logwood the island hath its shores covered with plantations being the people say already more thickly cultivated than any part of england with fewer waste places commons and the like the fruits which grow here are plentiful and delicioussuch as the pineapple the pappau the guava the bonannow and the likebut they are not for the servants and the slaves the fertility of the country is truly astonishing and the air though full of moisture whereby knives and tools of all kinds quickly rust and spoil is considered more healthy than that of any other west indian island but for the poor creatures who have to toil in the hot sun the air is full of fatigue and thirst it is laden with fevers calentures and sunstrokes death is always in their midst and after death whatever awaits them cannot i think be much worse than their condition on the island after the sale was finished the captain bade me farewell with tears in his eyes and we were taken into boats and conveyed ashore i for my part sitting beside my purchaser who addressed no word at all to me i was however pleased to find that among the people whom he had bought was the girl deb who had been my maid if a woman who is a convict may have a maid who is a sisterconvict when we landed we walked from the quay or landingplace to a great building like a barn which is called a barracoon in which are lodged the negro slaves and servants before they go to their masters but at this time it was empty hither came presently a certain important person in a great wig and a black coat followed by two negro beadles each carrying a long cane or stick after commanding silence this officer read to us in a loud voice those laws of the colony which concern servants and especially those who like ourselves are transported for various offences i forget what these laws were but they seemed to be of a cruel and vindictive nature and all ended with flogging and extension of the term of service i remember for instancebecause the thought of escape from a place in the middle of the ocean seemed to me madthat by the law if any one should be caught endeavouring to run away he should be first flogged and then made to serve three years after his term was expired and that no ship was allowed to trade with the island or to put in for water unless the captain had given security with two inhabitants of the island in the sum of l sterling not to carry off any servant without the owners consent when these laws had been read the officer proceeded further to inform us that those who were thus sent out were sent to work as a punishment that the work would be hard not light and that those who shirked their work or were negligent in their work would be reminded of their duties in the manner common to plantations that if they tried to run away they would most certainly be caught because the island was but small and that when they were caught not only would their term of years be increased but that they would most certainly receive a dreadful number of lashes he added further that as nothing would be gained by malingering sulking or laziness so on the other hand our lot might be lightened by cheerfulness honesty and zeal a more surly illconditioned crew i think he must have never before harangued they listened and on most faces i read the determination to do no more work than was forced from them this is i have learned how the plantation servants do commonly begin but the most stubborn spirit is not proof against the lash and starvation therefore before many days they are as active and as zealous as can be desired and the white men even in the fields will do double the work that can be got out of the black then this officer went away followed by his beadles who cast eyes of regret upon us as if longing to stay and exercise their wands of office upon the prisoners backs this done we were ordered to march out my masters horse was waiting for him led by a negro and two of his overseers also mounted and carrying whips in their hands waited his commands he spoke with them a few minutes and then rode away they brought a long cart with a kind of tilt to it drawn by two asses here they call them assinegoes and invited me courteously to get into it it was loaded with cases and boxes and a negro walked beside the beasts then we set out upon our march first walked the twenty servantsmen and womennewly bought by the master after them or at their side rode the overseers roughly calling on the laggards to quicken their pace and cracking their whips horribly then came the cart in which i sat the sun was high in the heavens for it was not more than three of the clock the road was white and covered with dust and the distance was about six or seven miles and we went slowly so that it was already nigh unto sunset when we arrived at the masters estate thus was i a gentlewoman born sold in the island of barbadoes for a slave sixty pounds the price i fetched oh even now when it is all passed long since i remember still with shame how i stood upon the quarterdeck my hood thrown back while all those men gazed upon me and passed their ribald jests and cried out the money they would give for me chapter xxxvi the first day of servitude thus began my captivity thus i began to sit beside the waters of babylon more wretched than the daughters of zion because they wept together while i wept alone i looked for no release or escape until the lord should mercifully please to call me away by opening the gate of death for even if i were releasedif by living out the ten years of servitude i could claim my freedom of what use would it be to me whither could i fly where hide myself yet you shall hear if you will read how a way terrible at first and full of peril was unexpectedly opened and in what strange manner was wrought my deliverance we arrived at our new masters estatewhich was as i have said about seven miles from the porttowards sundown we were marched rather driven to a kind of village consisting of a double row of huts or cottages forming a broad street in the middle of which there were planted a large number of the fruittrees named here bonannows they are a kind of plantain the green fruit was hanging in clusters as yet unripe but the leaves which are also the branches being for the most part blown into long shreds or rags by the wind had an untidy appearance the cottages looked more like pigsties for size and shape they were built of sticks withs and plantainleaves both for sides and for roof chimneys had they none nor windows some of them had no door but an opening only thus are housed the servants and slaves of a plantation the furniture within is such as the occupants contrive sometimes there is a hammock or a pallet with grass mats and rugs there are some simple platters and basins in each hut there are two three or four occupants here let me in brief make an end of describing the buildings on this estate which were i suppose like those of every other if you were to draw a great square in which to lay down or figure the buildings you would have in one corner the street or village of the people next to the village lies the great pond which serves for drinkingwater as well as for washing the negroes are fond of swimming and bathing in it and they say that the water is not fouled thereby which i cannot understand in the opposite corner you must place the ingenio or house where the sugarcanes are brought to be crushed and ground and the sugar is made there are all kinds of machines with great wheels small wheels cogs gutters for running the juice and contrivances which i cannot remember some of the ingenios are worked by a windmill others by horses and assinegoes there is in every one a still where they make that fiery spirit which they call killdevil near the ingenio are the stables where there are horses oxen assinegoes and the curious beast spoken of in holy writ called the camel it hath been brought here from africa and is much used for carrying the sugar the open space around the ingenio is generally covered and strewed with trash which is the crushed stalk of the cane it always gives forth a sour smell as if fermenting which i cannot think to be wholesome in the fourth corner is the planters house considering that these people sometimes grow so rich that they come home and buy great estates it is wonderful that they should consent to live in houses so mean and paltry they are of wood with roofs so low that one can hardly stand upright in them and the people are so afraid of the cool wind which blows from the east that they have neither doors nor windows on that side but will have them all towards the west whence cometh the chief heat of the sunnamely the afternoon heat their furniture is rude and they have neither tapestry nor wainscoted walls nor any kind of ornament yet they live always in the greatest luxury eating and drinking of the best some of the housesmy masters among themhave an open verandah as they call it in somersetshire we should call it a linney running round three sides of the house with coarse canvas curtains which can be let down so as to keep out the sun or drawn up to admit the air but their way of livingthough they eat and drink of the bestis rude even compared with that of our farmers at home and a thriving tradesman say of taunton would scorn to live in such a house as contenteth a wealthy planter of barbadoes behind the house is always a spacious garden in which grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables and all round the buildings on every side stretched the broad fields of sugarcanes which when they are in their flower or blossom of grey and silver wave in the wind more beautifully than even a field of barley in england on the approach of our party and hearing the voices of the overseers a gentlewoman so at least she seemed came out of the house and stood upon the verandah shading her eyes and looking at the gang of wretches she was dressed splendidly in a silken gown and flowered petticoat as if she was a very great lady indeed over her head lay a kerchief of rich black lace round her neck was a gold chain when she slowly descended the steps of the verandah and walked towards us i observed that she was of a darker skin than it is customary to find at home it was indeed somewhat like the skin of the gipsy people her features were straight and regular her hair was quite black her eyes were also black and large shaped like almonds on her wrists were heavy gold bracelets and her fingers were loaded with rings she seemed about thirty years of age she was a woman of tall and fine presence and she stood and moved as if she was a queen she presently came forth from the verandah and walked across the yard towards us let me look at themyour new batch she said speaking languidly and with an accent somewhat foreign how many are there where do they come from who is this one for instance she took the girl named deb by the chin and looked at her as if she were some animal to be sold in the market a stout wench truly what was she over there the overseer read the name and the crimes of the prisoner madam this was the only name by which i knew her pushed her away disdainfully well she said she will find companions enough here i hope she will work without the whip hark ye girl she added with i think kindly intent it goes still to my heart when i hear that the women have been trounced but the work must be done remember that and who are thoseand those she pointed with contempt to the poor creatures covered with dirt and dust and in the ragged miserable clothes they had worn all the voyage street sweepings rogues and thieves all let them know she said grandly what awaits those who skulk and those who thieve and whom have we hereshe turned to meis this some fine city madam fresh from bridewell this prisoner said the overseer is described as a rebel in the late monmouth rising a rebel truly she asked with curiosity were monmouths soldiers women we heard by the last ship something of this madam i know not why you must needs become a rebel but this look you is no place for gentlewomen to sit down and fold their arms madam i replied i look for nothing less than to work being now a convict though i was never tried and condemnedi know not by whomto transportation in his majestys plantations let me look at your hands she said sharply why of what use are these little fingers they have never done any work and your faceprithee turn back your hood i obeyed and her eyes suddenly softened indeed i looked not for this sign of compassion and my own tears began to flow tis a shame she cried tis a burning shame to send so young a womanand a gentlewoman and one with such a faceto the plantations have they no bowels child who put thee aboard the ship i was brought on board by one mr penne who deceived me promising that i should be taken to new england where i have cousins we will speak of this presently meantimesince we must by the law find you some work to docan you sew yes madam i can perform any kind of needlework from plain sewing to embroidery what mean they she cried again by sending a helpless girl alone with such a crew the very spaniards of whom they talk so much would blush for such barbarity well they would send her to a convent where the good nuns would treat her kindly madam or miss thou art bought and the master may not by law release you but there is a way of which we will talk presently meanwhile thou canst sit in the sewingroom where we may find thee work i thanked her she would have said more but there came forth from the house with staggering step the man who had bought us he had now put off his wig and his scarlet coat and wore a white dressinggown and a linen nightcap he had in his hand a whip which he cracked as he walked child said madam quickly pull down your hood hide your face he hath been drinking and at such times he is dangerous let him never set eyes upon thee save when he is sober he came rolling and staggering and yet not so drunk but he could speak though his voice was thick oho he cried here are the new servants stand up every man and woman stand up i say here he cracked his whip and they obeyed trembling but madam placed herself in front of me let me look at ye he walked along the line calling the unhappy creatures vile and foul names o shame thus to mock their misery what he cried you think you have come to a country where there is nothing to do but lie on your backs and eat turtle and drink mobbie what you shall find out your mistake here he cracked his whip again you shall work all day in the field not because you like it but because you must for your food it shall be loblollie and for your drink water from the pond what i say those who skulk shall learn that the newgate cat is tender compared with her brother of barbadoes tremble therefore ye devils all tremble they trembled visibly all were now subdued those of them who swaggeredthe daredevil reckless bladeswhen first we sailed were now transformed into cowardly trembling wretches all halfstarved and some reduced with fevers with no more spirit left than enabled them still to curse and swear the feeblest of mortals the lowest of human wretches has still left so much strength and will that he can sink his immortal soul lower stilla terrible power truly then madam drew me aside gently and led me to a place like a barn where many women white and black sat sewing and a great quantity of little black babies and naked children played about under their charge the white women were sad and silent the blacks i saw with surprise were all chattering and laughing the negro is happy if he have enough to eat and drink whether he be slave or free madam sat down upon a bench and caused me to sit beside her tell me she said kindly what this means when did women begin to rebel if men are such fools as to go forth and fight let them but for women indeed i told her i did not fight then nothing would do but i must tell her all from the beginningmy name my family and my history but i told her nothing about my marriage so she said you have lost father mother brothers lover and friends by this pretty business and all because they will not suffer the king to worship in his own way well tis hard for you to be plain it may be harder than you think or i can help you have been bought for sixty pounds and that not for any profit that your work will bring to the estate because such as you are but a loss and a burden but only in the hope that your friends will pay a great sum for ransom madam i have indeed no friends left who can do this for me if so it is indeed unfortunate for presently the master will look for letters on your behalf and if none come i know not what he may threaten or what he may do but thinktry to find some one consider your lot here must be hard at best whereas if you are released you can live where you please you may even marry whom you please because beautiful young gentlewomen like yourself are scarce indeed in barbadoes tis christian charity to set you free remember child that money will do here what i suppose it will do anywhereall are slaves to money you have six months before you in which to write to your friends and to receive an answer if in that time nothing comes i tell thee again child that i know not what will happen as for the life in the fields it would kill thee in a week perhaps if the lord so wills i replied helplessly that may be best friends have i none now nor any whom i could ask for helpsave the lord alone i will ask for work in the fields perhaps he may forget thee she saidmeaning the master but no a man who hath once seen thy face will never forget thee my dear he told me when he came home that he had bought a woman whose beauty would set the island in flames pray heaven he come not near thee when he is in liquor hide that face child hide that face let him never see thee oh there are dangers worse than labour in the fieldsworse than whip of overseer she sprang to her feet and clasped her hands you talk of the lords will what hath the lord to do with this place here is nothing but debauchery and drinking cruelty and greed why have they sent here a woman who prays then she sat down again and took my hand tender maid she said thy face is exactly such as the face of a certain sainttis in a picture which hangs in the chapel of the convent where the good nuns brought me up long ago before i came to this placelong ago yes i forget the name of the saint thou hast her face she stood in the picture surrounded by soldiers who had red hair and looked like devilsenglish devils the nuns said her eyes were raised to heaven and she prayed but what was done unto her i know not because there was no other picture now she sits upon a throne in the presence of the mother of god the tears stood in her great black eyesi take it that she was thinking of the days when she was young well we must keep thee out of his way while he is sober he listens to reason and thinks continually upon his estate and his gains when he is drunk no one can hold him and reason is lost on him she presently brought me a manchet of white bread and a glass of madeira wine and then told me that she would give me the best cottage that the estate possessed and for my better protection another woman to share it with me i thanked her again and asked that i might have the girl called deb which she readily granted and so my first day of servitude ended in thus happily finding a protector as for the cottage it was a poor thing but it had a door and a window with a shutter the furniture was a pallet with two thick rugs and nothing more my condition was desperate indeed but yet had i considered i had been so far most mercifully protected i was shipped as a convict it is true by a treacherous villain but on the ship i found a compassionate captain who saved me from the company among whom i must otherwise have dwelt i was sold to a drunken and greedy planter but i found a compassionate woman who promised to do what she could and i had for my companion the woman who had become a most faithful maid to me upon the voyage and who still continued in her fidelity and her love greater mercies yetand also greater troubleswere in store as you shall see chapter xxxvii by the waters of babylon thus delivered from the slavery of the fields i began to work an unprofitable servant among those who made and mended the garments of the servants and negroes on an estate so large as this there is always plenty to be done by the sempstresses and needlewomen thus to every woman is given by the year four smocks two petticoats and four coifs besides shoes which are brought from england by the ships those who wait in the house have in addition six smocks and three waistcoats to the men are given six shirts and to every man and woman a rug or gown of thick stuff to cast about them when they come home hot so that they may not catch colda thing which throws many into a fever all these things have to be made and mended on the estate as for the children the little blacks they run about without clothing their black skin sufficing the women who are engaged upon the work of sewing are commonly those of the white servants who are not strong enough for the weeding and hoeing in the fields or are old and past hard work yet the stuff of which the smocks and shirts are made is so coarse that it tore the skin from my fingers which when madam saw she brought me fine worknamely for herself she was also so good as to provide me with a change of clothes of which i stood sadly in need and excused my wearing the dress of the other women i hope that i am not fond of fine apparel more than becomes a modest woman but i confess that the thought of wearing this livery of servitude this coarse and common dress of smock petticoat and coif all of rough and thick stuff like canvas with a pair of shoes and no stockings filled my very soul with dismay none of the many acts of kindness shown me by madam was more gratefully received than her present of clothesnot coarse and rough to the skin nor ugly and common befitting prisoners and criminals but soft and pleasant to wear and fit for the heat of the climate twas no great hardship certainly to rise early and to sit all day with needle and thread in a great room wellaired the company to be sure was not what one would have chosen nor was the language of the poor creatures who sat with meprison and bridewell birds or negro slavessuch as my poor mother would have desired her daughter to hear the food was coarse but i was often at the house when the master was away and there madam would constantly give me something from her own table a dish of chocolata rightly called the indian nectar made so thick and strong that a spoon stands upright in it or a glass of madeira if my cheeks looked paler than ordinary in this country the great heat of the air seems to suck out and devour the heat of the body so that those of european birth if they are not nourished on generous diet presently fall into a decline or wasting away as is continually seen in the case of white servants both men and women who die early and seldom last more than five or six years briefly madam seemed to take great pleasure in my conversation and would either seek me in the workroom or would have me to the house asking questions as to my former life for herself i learned that she was born in cuba and had been brought up by nuns in a convent but how or why she came to this place i knew not nor did i ask other gentlewomen of the island i never saw and i think there were none who visited her nor did she show kindness to the women servants except to myself treating them all as is the fashion in that country as if they were so many black negroes not condescending to more than a word or a command and if this were disobeyed they knew very well what to expect from her but to me she continued throughout to be kind and gracious thinking always how she could lighten my lot in this employment therefore i continued with such contentment as may be imagined which was rather a forced resignation to the will of the lord than a cheerful heart but i confess that i looked upon the lot of the other women with horror and was thankful indeed that i was spared the miseries of those who go forth to the fields they begin at six in the morning and work until eleven when they come home to dinner at one oclock they go out again and return at sunset which in this country is nearly always about halfpast six but let no one think that work in the fields at barbadoes may be compared with work in the fields at home for in england there are cloudy skies and cold wintry days in plenty but in barbadoes save when the rain falls in prodigious quantities the skies have no clouds but are clear blue all the year round the sun burns with a heat intolerable so that the eyes are wellnigh blinded the head aches the limbs fail and but for fear of the lash the wretched toiler would lie down in the nearest shade and a terrible thirst all this was told me by the girl deb seizes the throat all day long which nothing can assuage but rest for the least skulking the whip is laid on and if there be a word of impatience or murmuring it is called stark mutiny for which the miserable convict man or woman is tied up and flogged with a barbarity which would be incredible to any were it not for the memory of certain floggings in our own country besides the lash they have also the pillory and the stocks and the overseers carry in addition to their whip a heavy cane with which they constantly belabour the slaves both white and black i say slaves because the white servants are nothing less save that the negroes are far better off and receive infinitely better treatment than the poor white creatures indeed the negro being the absolute property of his master both he and his children to illtreat him is like the wanton destruction of cattle on a farm whereas there is no reason in making the convicts last out more than the ten years of their servitude or even so long because many of them are such poor creatures when they arrive and so reduced by the miseries of the voyage and so exhausted by the hard labour to which they are put that they bring no profit to the master but quickly fall ill and die like rotten sheep like rotten sheep i say they die without a word of christian exhortation and like brute creatures who have no world to come are they buried in the ground again the food served out to these poor people is not such as should be given to white people in a hot climate there is nothing but water to drink and that drawn from ponds because in barbadoes there are few springs or rivers it is true that the old hands who have learned how to manage contrive to make plantain wine and get by hook or by crook mobbie which is a strong drink made from potatoes or killdevil which is the new spirit distilled from sugar then for solid food the servants are allowed five pounds of salt beef for each person every week and this so hard and stringy that no boiling will make it soft enough for the teeth sometimes instead of the beef they have as much salt fish for the most part stinking with this a portion of ground indian corn which is made into a kind of porridge and called loblollie this is the staple of the food and there are no rustics at home who do not live better and have more nourishing food i do not deny that the convicts are for the most part a horrid crew who deserve to suffer if any men ever did but it was sad to see how the faces of the people were pinched with hunger and wasted with the daily fatigues and how their hollow eyes were full of despair whatever their sins may have been they were at least made in gods own image no criminal however wicked should have been used with such barbarity as was wreaked upon the people of this estate the overseers were chosen being themselves also convicts for their hardness of heart nay did they show the least kindness towards the poor creatures whom they drove they would themselves be forced to lay down the whip of office and to join the gang of those who toiled and over them was the master jealous to exact the last ounce of strength from the creatures whom he had bought did the good people of bristol who buy the sugar and molasses and tobacco of the indies know or understand the tears of despair and the sweat of agony which are forced with every pound of sugar they would abhor the trade which makes them rich the companion of my sleepinghut the girl deb was a great strapping wench who bid fair to outlast her ten years of servitude even under the treatment to which with the rest she was daily subjected and partly because she was strong and active partly because she had a certain kind of beauty the kind which belongs to the rustic and is accompanied by goodhumour and laughter she would perhaps have done well as some of the women do and ended by marrying an overseer but for events which presently happened yet strong as she was there was no evening when she did not return worn out with fatigue her cheeks burning her limbs weary yet happy because she had one more day escaped the lash and had the night before her in which to rest if it is worth noting the women were from the outset the most willing workers and the most eager to satisfy their taskmasters the men on the other hand went sullen and downcast thinking only how to escape the overseers whip and going through the work with angry and revengeful eyes i think that some great mutiny might have happened upon this estatesome wild revengeso desperate were these poor creatures and so horrible were the scourgings they endured and the shrieks and curses which they uttered let me not speak of these things there are other things which make residence in barbadoes even to the wealthy full of annoyances and irritations the place is filled with cockroaches great spiders horrid scorpions centipedes and lizards there are ants which swarm everywhere and there are clouds of flies and at night there are moskeetos and merrywings which by their bites have been known to drive newcomers into fever or else into a kind of madness in the evenings after supper there reigned a melancholy silence in the village the people for the most part taking rest with weary limbs sometimes there would be a quarrel with horrid oaths and curses and perhaps some fighting but these occasions were rare from the house there came often the noise of singing drinking and loud talking when other planters would ride over for a drinking bout there was also sometimes to be heard the music of the theorbo upon which madam played very sweetly singing spanish songs so that it seemed a pity for music so sweet to be thrown away upon this selfish crew it made me think of humphrey and of the sweet and holy thoughts which he would put into rhymes and then fit the rhymes with music which seemed to breathe those very thoughts alas in the village of bradford orcas there would be now silence and desolation the good old squire dead my father dead the young men sent to the plantations no one left at all but the rector and madam his sisterinlaw and i alas a slave perchance at that moment the rector might be slowly drawing his bow across the strings of his violoncello thinking of those who formerly played with him or perhaps he would be sorrowfully taking out his cases and gazing for a little consolation upon the figures of his goddesses and his nymphs only to think of the place and of those who once lived there tore my poor heart to pieces one evening when there was a great noise and talking at the house while we were sitting upon our beds with no other light than that of the moon madam herself came to the cottage child she said nothing will do but that the gentlemen must see thy beauty nay no harm shall happen while i am there so much they know but he hath so bragged about thy beauty and the great price he will demand for ransom that the rest are mad to see thee i swear that not the least rudeness shall be offered thee they are drinking it is true but they are not yet drunk come so i arose and followed her first she took me to her own room where she took off my hood and threw over me a long white lace mantilla which covered my head and fell over my shoulders and below the waist she sighed as she looked at me poor innocent she said if money could buy that face there is not a man in the room but would give all he hath and count it gain canst thou play or sing i told her that i had some knowledge of the theorbo therefore she brought me hers and bade me sing to the gentlemen and then retire quickly so i followed her into the living or keeping room where a dozen gentlemen were sitting round the table a bowl of punch was on the table and every man had his glass before him and a pipe of tobacco in his hand some of their faces were flushed with wine gentlemen said madam our prisoner hath consented to sing one song to you after which she will ask permission to bid you goodnight so they all clapped their hands and rapped the table and i being indeed terrified but knowing very well that to show fear would be the worst thing i could do touched the strings and began my song i sang the song which humphrey made and which he sang to the officers at taunton when the duke was there when i finished i gave back the theorbo to madam curtsied to the gentlemen and quickly stepped back to madams room while they all bellowed and applauded and roared for me to come back again but i put on my hood and slipped out to the cottage where i lay down beside deb and quickly fell asleep it is a great happiness in these hot latitudes that when a newcomer hath once got over the trouble of the merrywings he falleth asleep the moment he lies down and so sleeps through the whole night but in the morning madam came to see me while i was sewing well child she said laughing thou hast gotten a lover who swears that he will soon have thee out of this hell a lover i cried naythat may god forbid tis true young mr anstiss it is while thou wast singing he gazed on thy pretty face and listened as one enchanted i wonderbut nothou hast no eyes for such things and when thou wast gone he offered the master four times the sum he paid for theeyea four timesor six timessaying that he meant honourably and that if any man dared to whisper anything to the contrary he would cut his throat alas madam i must never marryeither this mr anstiss or any other tuttut this is foolish maids nonsense granted you have lost your old lover there are plenty more suppose he hath lost his old sweetheart there are plenty moreas i doubt not he hath already proved mr anstiss is a very pretty young gentleman but the master would not listen saying that he waited for the ladys friends and so passed six weeks or thereabouts for the only count of time i kept was from sunday to sunday on that day we rested the negroes who are no better than heathens danced the white servants lay about in the shade and drank what they could in one cottage only on that godless estate were prayers offered and then happened that great event which in the end proved to be a change in my whole life and brought happiness out of misery and joy out of suffering though at first it seemed only a dreadful addition to my trouble thus is the course of things ordered for us and thus the greatest blessings follow upon the most threatening juncture what this was i will tell in a few words it was about the third week in september when i embarked and about the third week in november when the ship made her port therefore i take it that it was one day about the beginning of the year when madam came to the workroom and told me that a ship had arrived carrying a cargo of two hundred rebels and more sent out to work upon the plantations like myself for the term of ten years she also told me that the master was gone to the bridge in order to buy some of them not she said that he wanted more hands but he expected that there would be among them persons of quality who would be glad to buy their freedom he still she told me looked to make a great profit out of myself and was thinking to sell me unless my friends in england speedily sent proposals for my ransom to the young planter who was in love with me this did not displease me i have not thought it necessary to tell how mr anstiss came often to the estate and continually devised schemes for looking at me going to the ingenio whence he could see those who sat in the workroom and even sending me letters vowing the greatest extravagance of passioni say i was not displeased because there was in this young gentlemans face a certain goodness of disposition clearly marked so that even if i became his property i thought i might persuade him to relinquish thoughts of love even if i had to trust myself entirely to his honour and tell him all but as you shall hear this project of the masters was brought to naught as for the rebels i was curious to see them some i might recognise to some i might perhaps be of a little use at the outset in guarding them against dangers i did not fear or think it likely that there would be any among them whom i might know or who might know me yet the thing which i least suspected and the least feareda thing which one would have thought so unlikely as to make the event a miraclenay call it rather the merciful ordering of allthat thing i say actually happened the newlybought servants arrived at about five in the evening i looked out of the workroom to see them why i seemed to know their facesall their faces they were our brave west country lads whom i had last seen marching gallantly out of taunton town to victory and glory as they believed nowpale with the miseries of the voyage thin with bad food and disease hollowcheeked and holloweyed in rags and dirt barefooted covered with dust grimy for want of washing their beards grown all over their faceswith hanging heads stood these poor fellows there were thirty of them some had thrown themselves on the ground as if in the last extremity of fatigue some stood with the patience that one sees in brute beasts who are waiting to be killed and in a group together stood threeoh merciful heaven was this misery also added to my cupthey were robin barnaby and humphrey robins face heavy and pale betrayed the sorrow of his soul he stood as one who neither careth for nor regardeth anything my heart fell like lead to witness the despair which was visible in his attitude in his eyes in his brow but barnaby showed still a cheerful countenance and looked about him as if he was arriving a welcome guest instead of a slave do you know any of them child madam asked oh madam i cried they are my friendsthey are my friends oh help themhelp them how can i help them she replied coldly they are rebels and they are justly punished let them write home for money if they have friends and so they can be ransomed to make them write the more movingly the master hath resolved to send them all to work in the fields the harder they work he says the more they will desire to be free again in the fields oh robinmy poor robin chapter xxxviii humphreys narrative with these wordsoh robin robinthe history as set down in my mistresss handwriting suddenly comes to an end the words are fitting because her whole heart was full of robin and though at this time it seemed to the poor creature a sin still to nourish affection for her old sweetheart i am surenay i have it on her own confessionthat there was never an hour in the waking day when robin was not in her mind though between herself and her former lover stood the dreadful figure of her husband i suppose that although she began this work with the design to complete it she had not the courage even when years had passed away and much earthly happiness had been her reward to write down the passages which follow wherefore and for another reasonnamely a confession which must be made by myself before i die i have taken upon myself to finish that part of alice eykins history which relates to the monmouth rising and its unhappy consequences you have read how thanks to my inexperience and ignorance of conspiracies and belief in mens promises we were reduced to the lowest point of disgrace and poverty alice did not tell because till afterwards she did not know that on sir christophers death his estate was declared confiscated and presently bestowed upon benjamin by favour of lord jeffreys so that he whose ambition it was to become lord chancellor was already which he had not expected the lord of the manor of bradford orcas but of this hereafter i have called her my mistress truly all my life she hath been to me more than was ever laura to petrarch or even beatrice to the great florentine the ancients represented every virtue by a goddess a grace or a nymph nay the arts were also feminine yet subject to the informing influence of the other sex as the muses had apollo for their director and chief to my mind every generous sentiment every worthy thought all things that are gracious all things that lift my soul above the common herd belong not to me but to my mistress in my youth it was she who encouraged me to the practice of those arts by which the soul is borne heavenwardsi mean the arts of poetry and of music it was she who listened patiently when i would still be prating of myself and encouraged the ambitions which had already seized my soul so that if i turned a set of verses smoothly it was to alice that i gave them and for her that i wrote them when we played heavenly music together the thoughts inspired by the strain were like the italian painters vision of the angels which attend the virgini mean that sweet and holy as the angels are they fall far short of the holiness and sweetness of her whom they honour so whatever my thoughts or my ambitions amidst them all i saw continually the face of alice always filled with candour and with sweetness that quality which enables a woman to think always about others and never about herself was given to alice in large and plenteous measure if she talked with me her soul was all mine if she was waiting on madam or upon sir christopher or upon the rector or on her own mother she knew their inmost thoughts and divined all their wants nay long afterwards in the daily exercise of work and study at the university of oxford in the foreign schools of montpellier padua and leyden it was alice who though far away encouraged me i could no longer hear her voice but her steadfast eyes remained in my mind like twin stars that dwell in heaven this is a wondrous power given to a few women that they should become as it were angels sent from heaven lent to the earth a while in order to fill mens minds with worthy thoughts and to lead them in the heavenly way the romish church holds that the age of miracles hath never passed which i do also believe but not in the sense taught by that church saints there are among us still who daily work miracles turning earthly clay into the jasper and the precious marble of heaven again the great poet milton hath represented his virtuous lady unharmed among the rabble rout of comus protected by her virtue alone pity that he hath not also shown a young man led by that sweet lady encouraged warned and guarded along that narrow way beset with quag and pitfall along which he must walk who would willingly climb to higher place and all this apart from earthly love as in the case of those two italian poets more i confess i would have had and presumptuously longed for itnay even prayed for it with such yearnings and longings as seemed to tear my very heart asunder but this was denied to me in september ten weeks after the fight of sedgemoor we being by that time well tired of exeter prison were tried by lord jeffreys it was no true trial for we were all advised to plead guilty upon which the judge bellowed and roared at us abusing us in such language as i never thought to hear from the bench and finally sentenced us all to death a great deal has been said of this roaring of the judge but i am willing to excuse it in great measure on the ground of the disease from which he was then suffering i myself who had heard that he was thus afflicted saw the drops of agony upon his forehead and knew that if he was not bawling at us he must have been roaring on his own account so we were marched back to prison and began to prepare for the last ceremony which is i think needlessly horrible and barbarous to cut a man open while he is still living is a thing not practised even by the savage turk at this gloomy time my cousin robin set a noble example of fortitude which greatly encouraged the rest of us nor would he ever suffer me to reproach myself as i was continually tempted to do with having been the cause of the ruin which had fallen upon the whole of our unfortunate house nay he went further and insisted and would have it that had i remained in holland he himself would have joined the duke and that i was in no way to blame as an inciter to this unfortunate act we knew by this time that sir christopher had been arrested and conveyed to ilminster jail and that with him were dr eykin grievously wounded and barnaby and that alice with her mother was also at ilminster mr boscorel for his part was gone to london in order to exert whatever interest he might possess on behalf of all with him went madam robins mother but she returned before the trial much dejected so that we were not encouraged to hope for anything from that quarter madam began to build some hopes at this time from benjamin because he who had accompanied the judges from london was the boon companion every night of lord jeffreys himself but it is one thing to be permitted to drink and sing with a great man at night and another thing to procure of him the pardon of rebels and those not the common sort but leaders and captains that benjamin would attempt to save us i did not doubt because in common decency and humanity he must needs try to save his grandfather and his cousins but that he would effect anythingthat indeed i doubted whether he did make an attempt i know not he came not to the prison nor did he make any sign that he knew we were among the prisoners what he contrived the plot which he laid and the villainy with which he carried it out you have already read well i shall have much more to say about benjamin for the moment let him pass i say then that we were lying in exeter jail expecting to be called out for execution at any hour we were sitting in the courtyard on the stone bench with gloomy hearts robinhumphreylads both cried a voice we knew it was the rector mr boscorel himself who called us courage lads he cried yet looked himself as mournful as man can look i bring you good newsi have this day ridden from ilminster there is other news not so goodgood news i say for you shall live and not die i have so far succeeded that the lives are spared of robin challis captain in the rebel cavalry barnaby eykin captain of the green regiment and humphrey challis chyrurgeon to the duke yet must you go to the plantationspoor ladsthere to stay for ten long years well we will hope to get your pardon and freedom long before that time is over yet you must perforce sail across the seas lad cried robin catching my hand cease to tear thy heart with reproaches see none of us will die after all on the scaffold none said mr boscorel on the scaffold none he repeated and what saith my grandfather sir robin asked he is also enlarged i hope at least and how is the learned dr eykin and alicemy alicewhere is she young men said the rector prepare for tidings of the worstyes of the very worst cruel news i bring to you boys and for myselfhe hung his headcruel news shameful news alas you know already what he had to tell us worse than the death of that good old man sir christopher worse than the death of the unfortunate dr eykin and his muchtried wife there was the news of alices marriage and of her flight and at hearing this we looked at each other in dismay and robin sprang to his feet and cried aloud for vengeance upon the villain who had done this thing it is my own son said mr boscorel yet spare him not he deserves all that you can call him and more shameful news i had to tell you where the poor child hath found a retreat or how she fares i know not robin ask me not to curse my own sonwhat is done will bring its punishment in due time doubt it not but of punishment we need not speak if there were any wayany way possibleout of it but there is none it is a fatal blow death itself alone can release her consider humphrey consider you are not so distracted as your cousin consider i say that unhappy girl is benjamins lawful wife if he can find her he may compel her to live with him she is his lawful wife i say it is a case in which there is no remedy it is a wickedness for which there is no help until one of the twain shall die there was indeed no help or remedy possible i will not tell of the madness which fell upon robin at this news nor of the distracted things he said nor how he wept for alice at one moment and the next cursed the author of this wickedness there was no remedy yet mr boscorel solemnly promised to seek out the poor innocent girl forced to break her vows for the one reason which could excuse hernamely to save the lives of all she loved they were saved already mr boscorel added he knew that they were saved he had seen me he had the news that i brought from london he knew it and he lied unto her there is no single particular in which his wickedness can be excused or defended yet i say curses are of no avail the hand of god is heavy upon all sinners and will presently fall upon my unhappy soni pray that before that hand shall fall his heart may be touched with repentance but robin fell into a melancholy from which it was impossible to arouse him he who while death upon the scaffold seemed certain was cheerful and brave now when his life was spared sat heavy and gloomy speaking to no one or if he spoke then in words of rage and impatience mr boscorel remained at exeter visiting us daily until the time came when we were removed he brought with him one day a smoothtongued gentleman in sober attire who was he told us a west indian merchant of bristol named george penne you have read and know already how great a villain was this man this gentleman said mr boscorel is able and willing for certain considerations to assist you in your exile you have been given among many others by the king to one mr jerome nipho who hath sold all his convicts to this gentleman in his turn he is under bonds to ship you for the plantations where you will be sold again to the planters sirs mr penne looked from one to the other of us with compassionate eyes i have heard your melancholy case and it will be to my great happiness if i may be able in any way to soften the rigours of your exile be it known to you that i have correspondents in jamaica barbadoes and virginia and that for certain sums of money thesemy friendswill readily undertake to make your servitude one merely in name in other words as i have already informed his reverence i have bought you in the hope of being useful to you i wish i could thus buy all unhappy prisoners and i can on paying my friends what they demand secure to you freedom from labour subject only to the condition of remaining abroad until your term is expired or your friends at home have procured your pardon as for the price humphrey said mr boscorel that shall be my care it is nearly certain that sir christophers estates will be confiscated seeing that he died in prison under the charge of high treason though he was never tried therefore we must not look to his lands for any help what this gentleman proposes is however so great a thing that we must not hesitate to accept his offer gratefully i must have said mr penne seventy pounds for each prisoner i hear that there is a third young gentleman of your party now in the same trouble at ilminster i shall therefore ask for two hundred guineastwo hundred guineas in all it is not a large sum in order to secure freedom those who cannot obtain this relief have to work in the fields or in the mills under the hot sun of the spanish main they are subject to the whip of the overseer they have wretched food they are worse treated than the negroes because the latter are slaves for life and the former for ten years only by paying two hundred guineas only you will all be enabled to live at your ease meanwhile your friends at home will be constantly endeavouring to procure your pardon i myself though but a simple merchant of bristol city can boast some influence which i will most readily exert to the utmost in your behalf say no more sir said mr boscorel interrupting him the bargain is concluded these young gentlemen shall not be subjected to any servitude i will pay you two hundred guineas i would sirmr penne laid his hand which was large white and soft the hand of a liar and a traitor upon his treacherous hearti would to heaven sir he said that i could undertake this service for less if my correspondents were men of tender hearts the business should cost you nothing at all but they are men of business they say that they live not abroad for pleasure but for profit they cannot forego any advantage that may offer as for me this job brings me no profit upon my honour gentlemen profit from such a source i should despise every guinea that you give me will be placed to the credit of my correspondents who will i am assured turn a pretty penny by the ransom of the prisoners but that we cannot help and as for mei say it boldly in the presence of this learned and pious clergymani am richly rewarded with the satisfaction of doing a generous thing that is enough i hope for any honest man the fellow looked so benevolent and smiled with so much compassion that it was impossible to doubt his word besides mr boscorel had learned many things during the journey to london among others that it would be possible to buy immunity from labour for the convicts therefore he hesitated not but gave him what he demanded taking in return a paper which was to be shown to mr pennes correspondents in which he acknowledged the receipt of the money and demanded in return a release from actual servitude this paper i put carefully in my pocket with my notebook and my case of instruments it was so far as my memory serves me about six weeks after our pardon was received when we heard that we were to be marched to bristol there to be shipped for some port or other across the ocean at taunton we were joined by a hundred poor fellows as fortunate as ourselves and at bridgwater by twenty more whose lives had been bought by colonel kirke fortunate we esteemed ourselves for everywhere the roads were lined with legs heads trunks and arms boiled and blackened in pitch stuck up for the terror of the country well you shall judge how fortunate we were when we reached bristol we found mr penne upon the quay with some other merchants he changed colour when he saw us but quickly ran to meet us and whispered that we were on no account to betray his goodness in the matter of ransom otherwise it might be the undoing of us all and perhaps cause his own imprisonment he also told me that the ship was bound for barbadoes and we should have to mess with the other prisoners on the voyage but that it would all be made up to us when we arrived he further added that he had requested his correspondents to entertain us until money should arrive from england and to become our bankers for all that we should want and with that he clasped my hand tenderly and with a god be wi ye he left us and we saw him no more chapter xxxix for ten years it was a numerous company gathered together on the deck of the ship by their dress they were country lads by their pale cheeks they were prison birds like ourselves by their dismal faces they were also like ourselves rebels condemned to the plantations alas how many of these poor fellows have returned to their homes and how many lie in the graves of jamaica virginia and barbadoes as for preparations for a voyage not one of us could make any either of clothes or of provisions there was not among the whole company so much as a change of clothes nay there was not even a razor and our faces were already bristling horribly with the beards which before long made us look like so many heyducs among them i presently discerned to my great surprise and joy none other than barnaby his coat of scarlet was now so ragged and stained that neither colour nor original shape could be discerned his ruffles and cravat of lace were gone and the scarlet sash which had formerly carried his hanger was gone also in a word he was in rags and covered with the dust of the road yet his jolly countenance showed a satisfaction which contrasted greatly with the dejection of his companions he sniffed the scent of tar and ropes with a joy which was visible to all and he contemplated the ship and her rigging with the air of one who is at home then he saw us and shouted to us while he made his way roughly through the rest what cheer ho humphrey brave lad of bolusesnever did any man grasp the hand of friend with greater vigour this is better i say than the accursed prison where one got never a breath of fresh air here one begins to smell salt water and tarred rope which is a downright wholesome smell already i feel hearty again i would willingly drink a tankard or two of black beer what robin what we are not going to be hanged after all lift up thy head therefore is this a time for looking glum we shall live to hang judge jeffreys yetwhat thy looks are but poorly lad is it the prison or is it thy disappointment that villain benjamin hark ye robinsome mens faces look black when they threaten but barnabys grew broader as if the contemplation of revenge made him the happierhark ye this is my business no one shall interfere with me in this benjamin is my affair no one but i myself must kill benjamin not you humphrey because he is your cousin not you robin because you must not kill alices husband even to get back your own sweetheart barnaby spoke wisdom here in spite of robins vows he could not get alice for himself by killing her husband unworthy though he was benjamin he went on may call her wife but if he seek to make her his wife if i know sis aright he will meet his match as for her safety i am certain that she is safe for why wherever there are folks of her religious kidney there will she find friends cheer up robin soon or late i will kill this fine husband of hers but robin shook his head barnaby then asked if i knew whither we were bound i told him barbadoes according to the information given me by mr penne why said barnaby rubbing his hands this is brave news indeed there is no place i would sooner choose tis a small island to begin with give me a small island so that the sea runneth all round about and is everywhere within easy reach where there is the sea there are boats where there are boats there are the means of escape cheer up my lads i know the spanish main right well give me a tight boat i care not how small and a keg of water and i will sail her anywhere ha we are bound to barbadoes are we this is truly brave news i asked him next what kind of place it was it is a hot place he replied a man is always thirsty and there is plenty to drink except water which is said to be scarce but the merchants and the planters want none they have wine of the best of spain and of france and of madeira cider and strong ale they import from england and drinks they make in the countryperino and mobbiei remembergrippo and plantain wine and killdevil tis a rare country for drink and many there be who die of too much hold up thy head robin we will drink damnation to benjamin yet but tis i who shall kill him courage i say what our turn will come i told him then what had been done with mr george pennenamely the ransom bought by the rector for us all and the letter which i carried to mr pennes correspondent why he said with some discontent we shall not be long upon the island after all and perhaps the money might have been better bestowed but twas kindly done of the rector as for the banishment i value it not a farthing one place is as good as another and for my own part i love the west indies we shall have our choice among them all because where there are boats and the open sea a man can go whithersoever pleaseth him best the voyage outhe glanced round himwill i fear be choking workthe rations will be short there will be neither drink nor tobacco and at nights we shall lie close a more melancholy company i never saw patience my lads our turn will come well twas a special mercy that we had with us one man at least who preserved his cheerfulness for the rest of the company were as melancholy as king james himself could have desired indeed to look back upon the voyage is to recall the most miserable time that can be imagined first of all as i have said we were wholly unprepared for a voyage having nothing at all with us then we had bad weather at the outset which not only made our people ill but caused the biscuit to be mostly spoiled so that before the end of the voyage a few peas with the sweepings of the biscuitroom and sometimes a little tough beef was all our diet and for drink nothing not so much as a pannikin of beer but water and that turbid and not too much of it as for me i kept my health chiefly by the method common among physiciansnamely by watching the symptoms of others but mostly was i concerned with the condition of robin for the poor lad taking so much to heart the dreadful villainy which had been practised upon alice never once held up his head and would talk and think of nothing else but of that poor maid where is she he asked a hundred times where hath she found a shelter and a hidingplace how shall she escape the villain who will now do what he pleases since we are out of his way and no help for hernot any until she die or until he dies and we cannot even send her a letter to console her poor heart humphrey it drives me mad to think that every day carries us further from her if i could but be with her to protect her against her husband humphrey barnaby said well i could not get her back to me over the dead body of her husband but to protect herto stand between her and the man she hath sworn to obey there is no more dangerous condition of the mind than that which we call despair it is i take it a disease and that of the most dangerous kind i have observed many men in that condition with some the devil enters into them finding all the doors open and unguarded nay he even receives a warm welcome with others it is as if the body itself was left without its armoura cheerful and hopeful mind being certainly an armour against disease capable of warding off many of those invisible arrows which are always flying about the air and striking us down with fevers agues calentures and other pains and grievous diseases i marvel that more of the men on board were not sick for to begin with the water soon became thick and swarmed with wriggling creatures difficult to avoid in drinking and then though during the day we were allowed to be on deck where the air was fresh even if the sun was hot at night we were terribly crowded below and lay too close for health or for comfort however we finally made carlisle bay and the port of st michaels or the bridge and i must say this for barnaby that he maintained throughout the whole voyage his cheerfulness and that he never ceased to make his plans for escape drawing on a paper which he procured a rough chart of the spanish main with as many islands as he could remember of these there are hundreds some desolate and safe for fugitives some with neither water nor green trees and some with springs and woods wild fruit land turtles on the shore fish in the sea and everything that man can desire we made the land after i know not how many weeks one day in the forenoon barbadoes said barnaby pointing to a little cloud far away on the horizon well of this job i am wellnigh sick tomorrow if the wind holds we shall have sailed round the island and shall beat up for carlisle bay well it is lucky for us that we have this letter of mr pennes we will goi know the place wellto the sign of the rock and turtle kept by old mother rosemary if she lives still or if she be dead by one of her daughtersshe had fifty daughters at least all buxom mulatto girls there we will put off these filthy rags have a wash in a tub of fresh water get shaved and then with smooth chins and clean shirts we will sit down to a dinner such as the old woman knows how to make a potatopudding and scots collops with rhenish wine and afterwards a cool cup of beverage which is nothing in the world but squeezed limes with sugar and water fit for such a womanly stomach as yours doctor with this and a pipe of tobacco and perhaps a song and when your worship hath gone to bed a dance from one of the girlsi say my lad with this i shall be ready to forget sedgemoor and to forgive judge jeffreys when we are tired of barbadoes we will take boat and sail away i know one island at least where they care nothing for king james thither will we go my lad well what we found at our port and how we fared was not quite as barnaby expected and hoped as you shall hear but i must admire the cunning of the man penne who not only took from alicepoor childall her brothers money amounting to two hundred and fifty pounds or thereabouts which you have read on the pretext of bestowing it for the advantage of all but also received two hundred guineas from mr boscorel on the same pretence this made in all four hundred and fifty pounds and not one pennynot a single pennyof this great sum did the man spend upon the purpose for which it was given him you have heard how the merchants and planters came aboard the ships which put in with servants and slaves and how these are put up for sale one at a time as was the sale described by alice just such was ours though i take it our lads were not so miserable a company as were those on board her ship pale of cheek they looked and dejected and some were sick with various disorders caused by the confinement of the prison or the sufferings of the voyage they put us up one after the other and we were sold i forget what i myself fetched and indeed it matters not save that many jests were passed at our expense and that when one was put upas robin for instancewho had been a captain in the rebel army the salesman was eloquent in praise of his rich and illustrious family who would never endure that this unfortunate man should continue in servitude but barnaby put his tongue in his cheek and laughed when the sale was concluded we were bundled into boats and taken ashore to the barracoon of which you have heard from alice here the same officer who read to her party the laws concerning servants and their duties and the punishments which await transgressors read them also to ourselves faith barnaby whispered there will be a great scoring of backs before many days are done unless their bark is worse than their bite this business despatched i thought it was time to present my letter therefore i stepped forward and informed the officer who by reason of his gown and wig and the beadles who were with him i judged to be some lawyer that with my cousin and another i held a letter which should hold us free from servitude ay ay he said where is that letter so i gave it to him twas addressed to one jonathan polwhele and enjoined him to receive the three prisoners named humphrey challis robin challis and barnaby eykin to pay for them such sums as would reasonably be required to redeem them from servitude and to advance them such moneys as they would want at the outset for maintenance the whole to be accounted for in mr jonathan polwheles next despatches to his obedient much obliged servant g p sir said the officer when he had read the letter through this epistle is addressed to one jonathan polwhele there is no merchant or planter of that name on the whole island he gave me back the letter if this he said is all you have to show there is no reason why you and your friends should not march with the rest truly we had nothing else to show not only was there no one named polwhele on the island but there never had been any one of that name therefore it was plain that we had been tricked and that the man george penne was a villain alas poor barnaby where now were his cool cups and his pipe of tobacco then the officer beckoned to a gentlemana sober and grave personstanding near and spoke to him gentlemen said the merchant permit me to read this letter so it is in the handwriting of mr george penne which i know well there is here some strange mistake the letter is addressed to mr jonathan polwhele but there is no one of that name in the place i am myself mr pennes correspondent in this island my name gentlemen is sefton not polwhele sir i said do you know mr penne i have never seen him he consigns to my care once or twice a year a cargo of transported servants being rogues and thieves sent here instead of to the gallows he ships them to my care i say as he hath shipped the company arrived this morning and i sell them for him taking for my share a percentage as agreed upon and remitting to him the balance in sugar and tobacco is there no letter from him there is a letter in which he advises me of so many rebels consigned to me in order to be sold some among them he says were captains and officers in monmouths army and some are of good family among whom he especially names robin and humphrey challis but there is not a word about ransom sir i said knowing nothing as yet of alice and her money two hundred guineas have been paid to mr penne by the rev philip boscorel rector of bradford orcas in the county of somerset for our ransom nothing is said of this he replied gravely plainly gentlemen without despatches from mr penne i cannot act for you you have a letter it is written by that gentleman it is addressed to mr polwhele it says nothing about barbadoes and would serve for jamaica or virginia so great a sum as two hundred guineas cannot have been forgotten i exhort you therefore to patience until other letters arrive why two hundred guineas would have gone far to redeem you all three and to maintain you for a great while gentlemen i am grieved for you because there is for the present no help for it but that you must go with the planter who hath bought you and obey his orders i will however send to mr penne an account of this charge and i would advise that you lose no time in writing to your friends at home heart up lad cried barnaby for i turned faint upon this terrible discovery and would have fallen but he held me up patience our turn will come write that letter said the merchant again write that letter quickly so that it may go with the next vessel otherwise the work is hard and the heat is great so he turned and left us courage man said barnaby to every dog his day if now for five minutes only i could have my thumb on mr pennes windpipe and my fingers round his neck and i thought to spend the evening joyfully at mother rosemarys courage lad i have seen already he whispered a dozen boats in the bay any one of which will serve our turn but robin paid no heed whatever happened he stood up when his name was called and was sold without showing any emotion when we found that we had been tricked he seemed as if he neither heard nor regarded when all was ready we were marched twenty in number along a white and dusty road to our estate by great good fortunerather by providencewe were all bought by the same master he was it is true a bad man but to be bought all together was a happiness which we could not expect he bought us all because he understood that we belonged to the same family and that one of position in the hope of receiving substantial ransom this man rode with us accompanied by two overseers these were themselves under the same sentence who cracked their whips continually and cursed us if we lagged their bark was worse we afterwards found than their bite for it was only in the masters presence that they behaved thus brutishly and in order to curry favour with him and to prevent being reduced again to the rank of those who served in the field there was no doubt from the very outset that we were afflicted with a master whose like i would hope is not to be found upon the island of barbadoes briefly he was one whose appearance voice and manner all alike proclaimed him openly to all the world as a drunkard a profligate and a blasphemer a drunkard he was of that kind who are seldom wholly drunk and yet are never sober who begin the day with a glass and go on taking more glasses all day long with small ale for breakfast strong ale and madeira for dinner a tankard in the afternoon and for supper more strong ale and madeira and before bed another tankard as for compassion or tenderness or any of the virtues which a man who holds other men in slavery ought to possess he had none of them let me speak of him with no more bitterness than is necessary we have i think all forgiven him and he hath long since gone to a place where he can do no more harm to any but awaiteth judgmentperhaps in the sure and certain hope of which the funeral service speaksbut this is open to doubt when we were arrived at the estate the master dismounted gave his horse to a negro and ordered us to be drawn up in line he then made a short speech he said that he had bought us rebels and villains as we were and that he meant to get his moneys worth out of us or he would cut us all to pieces other things he told us which i pass over because they were but repetitions of this assurance he then proceeded to examine us in detail when he came to me he cursed and swore because he said he had been made to pay for a sound proper man and had got a crookback for his bargain i told him that with submission he might find the crookback who was a physician a more profitable bargain than many a stronger man what he roared thou art a physician eh wouldst slink out of the fieldwork and sit idle among bottles and boluses johnhe turned to one of the overseerspay particular attention i command thee to this learned physician if he so much as turn round in his work make his shoulders smart ay ay sir said the overseer and what art thou sirrah he turned next to barnaby another learned physician no doubtor a divine a bishop likely or a dean at the least as for what i was said barnaby that is neither here nor there for what i am i suppose i am your servant for ten years or until our pardons are sent us thou art an impudent dog i dare swear returned the master i remember now thou wast a captain in the rebel army once a sailor well take care lest thou taste the cat gentlemen who are made to taste the cat said barnaby are apt to remember the taste of it when their time is up what he cried you dare to threaten take thatand that and so began to belabour him about the head i trembled lest barnaby should return the blows but he did not he only held up his arm to protect his head and presently when the master desisted he shook himself like a dog i promise you i shall remember the taste of that wood he said quietly the master looked as if he would renew the cudgelling but thought better of it then without more violence we were assigned our quarters a cottage or hut was given to us we were served with a hammock and a rug each a pannikin basin spoon and platter for each a monmouth cap two shirts common and coarse two pairs of canvas breeches and a pair of shoes for eachso that we looked for all the world like the fellows who live by loading and unloading the ships in the port of bristol yet the change after the long voyage was grateful they served us next with some of the stuff they call loblollie and then the night fell and we lay down in our hammocks which were certainly softer than the planks of the ship and then fell fast asleep in spite of the humming and the biting of the merrywings and so slept till the break of day chapter xl with the hoe before it was daylight we were aroused by the discordant clang of a bell work was about to begin in these latitudes there is little twilight the day begins as it ends with a kind of suddenness i arose being thus summoned and looked out long rays of light were shooting up the sky from the east and though the stars were still visible the day was fast breaking in a few moments it became already so light that i could see across the yardor what the italians would call the piazzawith its ragged bonannowleaves the figures of our fellowslaves moving about the huts and hear their voices alas sad and melancholy are the voices of those who work upon his majestys plantations two old negresses went about among the newcomers carrying a bucketful of their yellow mess which they distributed among us and giving us to understand that this bowl of yellow porridge or loblollie made out of indian corn was all we should have before dinner they also gave us to understand in their broken english which is far worse than the jargon talked by some of our country people that we should have to prepare our own meals for the future and that they would show us how to make this delectable mess eat it said barnaby a pig is better fed at home eat it robin lest thou faint in the sun perhaps there will be something better for dinner heigho only to think of mother rosemarys where i thought to lie last night patience lads one would not seem to dwell too long on the simple fare of convicts therefore i will say once for all that our rations consisted of nothing at all but the indian meal and of salt beef or salt fish the old hands and the negro slaves know how to improve their fare in many ways and humane masters will give their servants quantities of the fruits such as grow here in great abundanceas plantains lemons limes bonannows guavas and the like and many of the black slaves have small gardens behind their huts where they grow onions yams potatoes and other things which they cultivate on sundays they are all great thieves also stealing whenever they can poultry eggs and fruit so that they grow fat and sleek while the white servants daily grow more meagre and fall into diseases by reason of the poorness of their food then as to drink there are many kinds of drink apart from the wines of spain portugal canary madeira and france made in the country itself such as mobbie which is a fermented liquor of potatoes and perino from the liquor of chewed cassavy root punch which is water and sugar left to work for ten days rum which is distilled in every ingenio and is a spirit as strong as brandy and said to be more wholesome those who have been long in the island even the servants though without a penny know how and where to get these drinks and since there is no consoler to the common sort so good as strong drink those who are able to drink every day of these things become somewhat reconciled to their lot come out ye dogs of rebels and traitors it was the loud and harsh voice of the master himself who thus disturbed us at our breakfast twas his custom thus to rise early and to witness the beginning of the days work and twas his kindly nature which impelled him thus to welcome and encourage his newlybought slaves come out i say ye shall now show of what stuff ye are made instead of pulling down your lawful king ye shall pull up your lawful master and make him rich if ye never did a days work in your lives ye shall now learn the how by the must come forth i say ye lazy guzzling skulkers ay ay said barnaby leisurely scraping his bowl we are like indeed to be overfed here he rolled sailor fashion out of the hut barnaby i said for gods sake say nothing to anger the master there is no help but in patience and in hope so we too went forth the master redfaced as he was looked as if he had been drinking already so he cried here is the learned physician your health doctor and here is the gallant captain who was once a sailor the air of the fields captain will remind you perchance of the quarterdeck this young gentleman looks so gallant and gay that i warrant he will ply the hoe with a light and frolick heart your healths gentlemen hark ye now you are come of a good stock i hear therefore have i bought you at a great price looking to get my money back and more some planters would suffer you to lie at your ease cockered up with bonavist and madeira till the money comes as for me i shall now show you what you will continue to do unless the money comes therefore you will at once i doubt not ask for paper and pen and presently write sixty pounds apiece gentlemennot one penny lesswill purchase your freedom till then the fields and no difference between white and black but one whip for both we made no reply but took the hoes which were given out to us and marched with the rest of the melancholy troop there were as many blacks as whites we were divided into gangs with every gang a driver armed with a whip and over all the overseers who by their severity showed their zeal for the master the condition of slavery hath in it something devilish both for those who are slaves and those who are masters the former it drives into despair and fills with cunning dishonesty treachery and revenge why the black slaves have been known to rise in rebellion and while they had the power have inflicted tortures unheardof upon their masters the latter it makes cruel and unfeeling it tempts them continually to sins of all kinds it puts into their power the lives the bodiesnay the very soulsof the poor folk whom they buy i do maintain and conceal not my opinion that no man ought in a christian country to be a slave except for a term of years and then for punishment i have been myself a slave and i know the misery and the injustice of the condition but it is idle to hope that the planters will abandon this means of cultivating their estates and it is certain that in hot countries no man will work except by compulsion the whip carried by the driver is a dreadful instrument long thick and strongly plaited with a short handle it is coiled and slung round the shoulders when it is not being used to terrify or to punish and i know well that its loud crack produces upon the mind a sensation of fear and of horror such as the thunder of artillery or the sight of the enemy charging could never cause even to a coward the fellows are also extremely dexterous in the use of it they can inflict a punishment not worse than the flogging of a schoolboy or with no greater outward show of strength they will cut and gash the flesh like a russian executioner with the cruel instrument which they call the knout for slight offences such as laziness or carelessness in the field the former is administered but for serious offences the latter one sad execution i cannot call it less i myself witnessed what the poor wretch had done i know not but i can never forget his piercing shrieks as the whip cut into the bleeding flesh this is not punishment it is savage and revengeful cruelty yet the master and the overseers looked on with callous eyes they marched us to a field about half a mile from our village or camp and there drawing us up in line set us to work our task was with the hoe to dig out square holes each of the same depth and size in which the sugar canes are planted a small piece of old cane being laid in each these holes are cut with regularity and exactness in long lines and equally distant from each other it is the drivers business to keep all at work at the same rate of progress so that no one should lag behind no one should stop to rest or breathe no one should do less than his neighbours the poor wretches with bent bodies streaming with their exertions speedily become afflicted with a burning thirst their legs tremble their backs grow stiff and ache their whole bodies become full of pain and yet they may not rest nor stand upright to breathe a while nor stop to drink until the driver calls a halt from time to time the negroesmen and women alikewere dragged out of the ranks and laid on the ground three or four at a time to receive lashes for not making the holes deep enough or fast enough at home one can daily see the poor creatures flogged in bridewell every day there are rogues tied to the cartwheel and flogged wellnigh to death but a ploughman is not flogged for the badness of his furrow nor is a cobbler flogged because he maketh his shoon ill and our men do not shriek and scream so wildly as the negroes who are an ignorant people and have never learned the least selfrestraint it was horrid also to see how their bodies were scarred with the marks of old floggings and branded with letters to show by whom they had been bought as for our poor fellows who had been brave recruits in monmouths army they trembled at the sight and worked all the harder yet some of them with the tears in their eyes to think that they should be brought to such a dismal fate and to herd with these poor ignorant black people twas the design of the master to set us to the very hardest work from the beginning so that we should be the more anxious to get remission of our pains for it must not be supposed that all the work on the estate was so hard and irksome as that with the hoewhich is generally kept for the strongest and hardest of the negroes men and women there are many other employments some are put to weed the canes some to fell wood some to cleave it some to attend the ingenio the boilinghouse the stillhouse the curinghouse some to cut the maize some to gather provisions of bonavist maize yams potatoes cassavy and the like some to the smiths forge some to attend to the oxen and sheep some to the camels and assinegoes and the like so that had the master pleased he might have set us to work better fitted to english gentlemen well his greediness and cruelty were defeated as you shall presently see as for the domestic economy of the estate there were on it five hundred acres of land of which two hundred were planted with sugar eighty for pasture one hundred and twenty for wood thirty for tobacco five for ginger and as many for cottonwool and seventy for provisionsviz corn potatoes plantains cassavy and bonavistwith a few for fruit there were ninetysix negroes two or three indian women with their children and twentyeight christian servants of whom we were three at eleven oclock we were marched back to dinner at one we went out again the sun being at this time of the day very fierce though january is the coldest month in the year we worked till six oclock in the evening when we returned this said robin with a groan is what we have now to do every day for ten years heart up lads said barnaby our time will come give me time to turn round as a body may say why the harbour is full of boats let me get to the port and look round a bit if we had any money nowbut that is past praying for courage and patience doctor you hoe too fast no one looks for zeal follow the example of the black fellows who think all day long how they shall get off with as little work as possible as for their lash i doubt whether they dare to lay it about us though they may talk because you see even if we do not escape we shall some time or other through the rectors efforts get a pardon and then we are gentlemen again and when that moment arrives i will make this master of ours fight willynilly and i will kill him dye see before i go home to kill benjamin he then went on to discourse either with the hope of raising our spirits or because it cheered his mind just to set them forth upon his plans for the means of escape a boat he said i can seize there are many which would serve our purpose but a boat without victuals would be of little use one would not be accused of stealing yet we may have to break into the store and take therefrom some beef or biscuit but where to store our victuals we may have a voyage of three or four hundred knots before us that is nothing for a tight little boat when the hurricane season is over we have no compass eitheri must lay hands upon a compass the first saturday night i will make for the port and cast about lift up your head robin why man all bad times pass if only one hath patience it was this very working in the fields by which the master thought to drive us into despair which caused in the long run our deliverance and that in the most unexpected manner chapter xli on conditions this servitude endured for a week during which we were driven forth daily with the negroes to the hardest and most intolerable toil the masters intention being so to disgust us with the life as to make us write the most urgent letters to our friends at home since as we told him two hundred guineas had been already paid on our account though none of the money was used for the purpose he supposed that another two hundred could easily be raised wherefore while those of the new servants who were common country lads were placed in the ingenio or the curinghouse where the work is sheltered from the scorching sun we were made to endure every hardship that the place permitted in the event however the mans greed was disappointed and his cruelty made of none avail in fact the thing i had foreseen quickly came to pass when a man lies in a lethargy of despair his body no longer fortified by a cheerful mind presently falls into any disease which is lurking in the air diseases of all kinds may be likened unto wild beasts invisible always on the prowl seeking whom they may devour the young fall victims to some the weak to others the drunkards and gluttons to others the old to others and the lethargic again to others it was not surprising to me therefore when robin coming home one evening fell to shivering and shaking chattering with his teeth and showing every external sign of cold though the evening was still warm and the sun had that day been more than commonly hot also he turned away from his food and would eat nothing therefore as there was nothing we could give him we covered him with our rugs and he presently fell asleep but in the morning when we awoke behold robin was in a high fever his hands and head burning hot his cheek flushed red his eyes rolling and his brain wandering i went forth and called the overseer to come and look at him at first he cursed and swore saying that the man was malingering that is to say pretending to be sick in order to avoid work that if he was a negro instead of a gentleman a few cuts with his lash should shortly bring him to his senses that for his part he liked not this mixing of gentlemen with negroes and that finally i must go and bring forth my sick man or take it upon myself to face the master who would probably drive him afield with the stick sir i said what the master may do i know not murder may be done by any who are wicked enough for my part i am a physician and i tell you that to make this man go forth to work will be murder but indeed he is lightheaded and with a thousand lashes you could not make him understand or obey well he grumbled but he followed me into the hut the man hath had a sunstroke he said i wonder that any of you have escaped well we can carry him to the sickhouse where he will die when a new hand is taken this way he always dies perhaps he will not die i said if he is properly treated if he is given nothing but this diet of loblollie and salt beef and nothing to drink but the foul water of the pond and no other doctor than an ignorant old negress he will surely die good lord man said the fellow what do you expect in this country it is the masters loss not mine carry him between you to the sickhouse so we carried robin to the sickhouse at home we should account it a barn being a great place with a thatched roof the windows open without shutter or lattice the door breaking away from its hinges within there was a black lying on a pallet groaning most piteously the poor wretch for something that he had done i know not what had his flesh cut to pieces with the whip with him was an old negress mumbling and mouthing we laid robin on another pallet and covered him with a rug now man said the overseer leave him there and come forth to your work nay i said he must not be left i am a physician and i must stay beside him if he were your son i would not suffer you to stay with him man i cried hast thou no pity pity the fellow grinned pity quotha pity is this a place for pity why if i showed any pity i should be working beside you in the fields it is because i have no pity that i am overseer look herehe showed me his left hand which had been branded with a redhot iron this was done in newgate seven years ago and more three years more i have to serve that done i may begin to show some pity not before pity is scarce among the drivers of barbadoes as well ask the beadle for pity when he flogs a prentice let me go to the master then best not best not let this man die and keep yourself alive the morning is the worst time for him because last nights drink is still in his head likely as not you will but make the sick mans case and your own worse leave him in the sickhouse and go back to him in the evening the man spoke with some compassion in his eyes just then however a negro boy came running from the house and spoke to the overseer why he said nothing could be more pat you can speak to the master if you please he is in pain and madam sends for dr humphrey challis go doctor if you cure him you will be a lucky man if you cannot cure him the lord have mercy upon you whereas if you suffer him to die he added with a grin and a whisper every man on the estate will fall down and worship you let him die let him die i followed the boy who took me to that part of the house which fronts the west and north it was a mean house of wood low and small considering how wealthy a man was the master of it on three sides however there was built out a kind of loggia as the italians call it of wood instead of marble forming a cloister or open chamber outside the house they call it a verandah and part of it they hang with mats made of grass so as to keep it shaded in the afternoon and evening when the sun is in the west the boy brought me to this place pointed to a chair where the master sat and then ran away as quickly as he could it was easy to understand why he ran away because the master at this moment sprang out of his chair and began to stamp up and down the verandah roaring and cursing he was clad in a white linen dressinggown and linen nightcap on a small table beside him stood a bottle of beer newly opened and a silver tankard when he saw me he began to swear at me for my delay in coming though i had not lost a moment sir i said if you will cease railing and blaspheming i will examine into your malady otherwise i will do nothing for you what he cried you dare to make conditions with me you dog you fair words i said fair words i am your servant to work on your plantation as you may command i am not your physician and i promise you sir upon the honour of a gentleman and without using the sacred name which is so often on your lips that if you continue to rail at me i will suffer you to die rather than stir a little finger in your help suffer the physician to examine the place said a womans voice what good is it to curse and to swear the voice came from a hammock swinging at the end of the verandah it was made i observed of a land of coarse grass loosely woven the man sat down and sulkily bade me find a remedy for the pain which he was enduring so i consented and examined his upper jaw where i soon found out the cause of his pain in a goodsized tumour formed over the fangs of a grinder such a thing causes agony even to a person of cool blood but to a man whose veins are inflamed with strong drink the pain of it is maddening you have got a tumour i told him it has been forming for some days it has now nearly or quite reached its head it began about the time when you were cursing and insulting certain unfortunate gentlemen who are for a time under your power take it therefore as a divine judgment upon you for your cruelty and insolence he glared at me but said nothing the hope of relief causing him to receive this admonition with patience if not in good part besides my finger was still upon the spot and if i so much as pressed gently i could cause him agony unspeakable truly the power of the physician is great the pain i told him is already grown almost intolerable but it will be much greater in a few hours unless something is done it is now like unto a little ball of redhot fire in your jaw in an hour or two it will seem as if the whole of your face was a burning fiery furnace your cheek will swell out until your left eye is closed your tortures which now make you bawl will then make you scream you now walk about and stamp you will then lie down on your back and kick no negro slave ever suffered half so much under your accursed lash as you will suffer under this tumourunless something is done doctor it was again the womans voice from the hammock you have frightened him enough strong drink i went on pointing to the tankard will only make you worse it inflames your blood and adds fuel to the raging fire unless something is done the pain will be followed by delirium that by fever and the fever by death sir are you prepared for death he turned horribly pale and gasped do something for me he said do something for me and that without more words nay but i will first make a bargain with you there is in the sickhouse a gentleman my cousinrobin challis by nameone of the newlyarrived rebels and your servant he is lying sick unto death of a sunstroke and fever caused by your hellish cruelty in sending him out to work on the fields with the negroes instead of putting him to light labour in the ingenio or elsewhere i say his sickness is caused by your barbarity wherefore i will do nothing for you at alldo you hear nothing nothingunless i am set free to do all i can for him yea and i must have such cordials and generous diet as the place can afford otherwise i will not stir a finger to help you otherwiseendure the torments of the damned rave in madness and in fever die and go to your own place i will not help you so that is my last word upon this i really thought the man had gone stark staring mad for at the impudence of a mere servant though a gentleman of far better family than his own daring to make conditions with him he became purple in the cheeks and seizing his great stick which lay on the table he began belabouring me with all his might about the head and shoulders but i caught up a chair and used it for a shield while he capered about striking wildly and swearing most horribly at this moment the lady who was in the hammock stepped out of it and walked towards us slowly like a queen she was without any doubt the most beautiful woman i had ever seen she was dressed in a kind of dressinggown of flowered silk which covered her from head to foot her head was adorned with the most lovely glossy black ringlets a heavy gold chain lay round her neck and a chain of gold with pearls was twined in her hair so that it looked like a coronet her fingers were covered with rings and gold bracelets hung upon her bare white arms her figure was tall and full her face inclined to the spanish being full and yet regular with large black eyes though i was fighting with a madman i could not resist the wish that i could paint her and i plainly perceived that she was one of that race which is called quadroon being most likely the daughter of a mulatto woman and a white father this was evident by the character of her skin which had in it what the italians call the morbidezza and by a certain dark hue under the eyes why she said speaking to the master as if he had been a petulant schoolboy you only make yourself worse by all this fury sit down and lay aside your stick and you sirshe addressed herself to meyou may be a great physician and at home a gentleman but here you are a servant and therefore bound to help your master in all you can without first making conditions i know too well i replied he bought me as his servant but not as his physician i will not heal him without my fee and my fee is that my sick cousin be attended to with humanity take him away cried the master beside himself with rage clap him in the stocks let him sit there all day long in the sun he shall have nothing to eat or to drink in the evening he shall be flogged if it was the duke of monmouth himself he should be tied up and flogged where the devil are the servants a great hulking negro came running you have now i told him quietly permitted yourself to be inflamed with violent rage the pain will therefore more rapidly increase when it becomes intolerable you will be glad to send for me the negro dragged me away but i made no resistance and led me to the courtyard where stood the stocks and a whippingpost he pointed to the latter with a horrid grin and then laid me fast in the former fortunately he left me my hat otherwise the hot sun would have made an end of me i was however quite easy in my mind i knew that this poor wretch who already suffered so horribly would before long feel in that jaw of his as it were a ball of fire he would drink in order to deaden the pain but the wine would only make the agony more horrible then he would be forced to send for me this in fact was exactly what he did i sat in those abominable stocks for no more than an hour then madam herself came to me followed by the negro fellow who had locked my heels in those two holes he is now much worse she said he is now in pain that cannot be endured canst thou truly relieve his suffering certainly i can but on conditions my cousin will die if he is neglected suffer me to minister to his needs give him what i want for him and i will cure youri did not know whether i might say your husband so i changed the words intomy master after that i will cheerfully endure again his accursed cruelty of the fields she bade the negro unlock the bar come she said let us hear no more about any bargains i will see to it that you are able to attend to your cousin nay there is an unfortunate young gentlewoman here a rebel and a servant like yourselffor the last week she doth nothing but weep for the misfortunes of her friendsmeaning you and your company i will ask her to nurse the sick man she will desire nothing better being a most tenderhearted woman and as for you it will be easy for you to look after your cousin and your master at the same time then madam i replied take me to him and i will speedily do all i can to relieve him i found my patient in a condition of mind and body most dangerous i wondered that he had not already fallen into a fit so great was his wrath and so dreadful his pain he rolled his eyes his cheeks were purple he clenched his fists he would have gnashed his teeth but for the pain in his jaws make yourself easy said madam this learned physician will cause your pain to cease i have talked with him and put him into a better mind the master shook his head as much as to say that a better mind would hardly be arrived at without the assistance of the whippingpost but the emergency of the case prevented that indulgence briefly therefore i took out my lancet and pierced the place which instantly relieved the pain then i placed him in bed bled him copiously and forbade his taking anything stronger than smallbeer freedom from pain and exhaustion presently caused him to fall into a deep and tranquil sleep after all this was done i was anxious to see robin madam i said i have now done all i can he will awake at noon i dare say give him a little broth but not much there is danger of fever you had better call me again when he awakes warn him solemnly that rage revenge cursing and beating must be all postponed until such time as he is stronger i go to visit my cousin in the sickhouse where i await your commands sir she said courteously i cannot sufficiently thank your skill and zeal you will find the nurse of whom i spoke in the sickhouse with your cousin she took with her some cordial and will tell me what else you order for your patient i hope your cousin may recover but indeedshe stopped and sighed you would say madam that it would be better for him and for us all to die perhaps so but we must not choose to die but rather strive to live as more in accordance with the word of god the white servants have been hitherto the common rogues and thieves and sweepings of your english streets she said sturdy rogues are they all who fear naught but the lash and have nothing of tenderness left but tender skins they rob and steal they will not work save by compulsion they are far worse than the negroes for laziness and drunkenness i know not why they are sent out or why the planters buy them when the blacks do so much better serve their turn and they can without reproach beat and flog the negroes while to flog and beat the whites is by some accounted cruel all this madam is doubtless true but my friends are not the sweepings of the street no but you are treated as if you were it is a new thing having gentlemen among the servants and the planters are not yet accustomed to them they are a masterful and a wilful folk the planters of barbadoes from childhood upwards they have their own way and brook not opposition you have seen into what a madness of wrath you threw the master by your opposition believe me sir the place is not wholesome for you and for your friends the master looks to get a profit not from your labour but by your ransom sirshe looked me very earnestly in the faceif you have friends at homeif you have any friends at allentreat themcommand themimmediately to send money for your ransom it will not cost them much if you do not get the money you will most assuredly die with the life that you will have to live all the white servants die except the very strongest and lustiest whether they work in the fields or in the garden or in the ingenio or in the stables they die they cannot endure the hot sun and the hard fare they presently catch fever or a calenture or a cramp and so they die this young gentlewoman who is now with your cousin will presently fall into melancholy and die there is no help for her or for youbelieve me sirthere is no hope but to get your freedom she broke off here and never at any other time spoke to me again upon this subject in three weeks time indeed we were to regain our freedom but not in the way madam imagined before i go on to tell of the wonderful surprise which awaited me i must say that there was after this day no more any question about the fieldwork for me in this island then there was a great scarcity of physicians nay there were none properly qualified to call themselves physicians though a few quacks the sick servants on the estates were attended by the negresses some of whom have i confess a wonderful knowledge of herbsin which respect they may be likened to our countrywomen who for fevers agues toothache and the like are as good as any physicians in the world it was therefore speedily rumoured abroad that there was a physician upon my masters estate whereupon there was immediately a great demand for his services and henceforth i went daily with the masters consent to visit the sick people on the neighbouring estatesnay i was even called upon by his excellency the lieutenantgovernor himself mr steed for a complaint from which he suffered and i not only gave advice and medicines but i also received a fee just as if i had been practising in london but the fees went to my master who took them all and offered me no better diet than before that however mattered little because wherever i went i asked for and always received food of a more generous kind and a glass or two of wine so that i fared well and kept my health during the short time that we remained upon the island i had also to thank madam for many a glass of madeira dish of cocoa plate of fruit and other things not only for my patient robin but also for myself and for another of whom i have now to speak when therefore the master was at length free from pain and in a comfortable sleep i left him with madams permission and sought the sickhouse in a most melancholy mood because i believed that robin would surely die whatever i should do and i confess that having had but little experience of sunstroke and the kind of fever which followeth upon it and having no books to consult and no medicine at hand i knew not what i could do for him and the boasted skill of the physician one must confess availeth little against a disease which hath once laid hold upon a man tis better for him so to order the lives of his patients while they are well as to prevent disease just as those who dwell beside an unruly river as i have seen upon the great river rhone build up a high levee or bank over which it cannot pass in the sickhouse the floor was of earth without boards there was no other furniture but two or three wooden beds on each a coarse mattress with a rug and all was horribly filthy unwashed and foul beside the pallet where robin lay there knelt praying a woman with her head in her hands heavens there was then in this dark and heathenish place one woman who still remembered her maker robin was awake his restless eyes rolled about his hands clutched uneasily at his blanket and he was talking alas the poor brain disordered and wandering carried him back to the old village he was at home again in imagination though we were so far away yea he had crossed the broad atlantic and was in fair somerset among the orchards and the hills and only to hear him talk the tears rolled down my cheeks alice he said alas he thought that he was again with the sweet companion of his youth alice the nuts are ripe in the woods we will tomorrow take a basket and go gather them benjamin shall not come to spoil sport besides he would want to eat them all himself humphrey shall come and you and i that will be enough then his thoughts changed again oh my dear he saidin a moment he had passed over ten years and was now with his mistress a child no longer my dear thou hast so sweet a face nowhere in the whole world is there so sweet a face i have always loved thy face not a day but it has been in my mindalways my love my sweetheart my soul my life my dear we will never leave the country we want no grandeur of rank and state and town we will always continue here old age shall find us lovers still death cannot part us oh my dear save for a little whileand then sweet heaven will unite us again to love each other for ever and for ever oh robin robin robin i knew that voice oh heavens was i dreaming was i too wandering were we all back in somerset for the voice was none other than the voice of alice herself chapter xlii alice alice i cried she rose from her knees and turned to meet me her face was pale her eyes were heavy and they were full of tears alice i saw you when you came here a week ago she said oh humphrey i saw you and i was ashamed to let you know that i was here ashamed my dear ashamed but howwhywhat dost thou here how could i meet robins eyes after what i had done it was done for him and for his mother and for all of us poor child there is no reason to be ashamed and now i meet him and he is in a fever and his mind wanders he knows me not he is sorely stricken alice i know not how the disease may end mind and body are sick alike for the mind i can do nothing for the body i can do but little yet with cleanliness and good food we may help him to mend but tell me child in the name of heaven how camest thou in this place but before anything she would attend to the sick man and presently she brought halfadozen negresses who cleaned and swept the place and sheets were fetched and a linen shirt in which we dressed our patient with such other things as we could devise for his comfort then i bathed his head with cold water continually changing his bandages so as to keep him cool and i took some blood from him but not much because he was greatly reduced by bad food and hard work when he was a little easier we talked but heavens to think of the villainy which had worked its will upon this poor child as if it was not enough that she should be forced to fly from a man who had so strangely betrayed her and as if it was not enough that she should be robbed of all her moneybut she must also be put on board falsely and treacherously as one like ourselves sentenced to ten years servitude on the plantations for indeed i knew and was quite certain that none of the maids of taunton were thus sent abroad it was notorious before we were sent away that with the exception of susan blake who died of jailfever at dorchester all the maids were given to the queens ladies and by them suffered to go free on the payment by their parents of thirty or forty pounds apiece and as for alice she was a stranger in the place and it was not known that she had joined that unfortunate procession so that if ever a man was kidnapper and villain that man was george penne it behoves a physician to keep his mind under all circumstances calm and composed he must not suffer himself to be carried away by passion by rage hatred or even anxiety yet i confess that my mind was clean distracted by the discovery that alice herself was with us a prisoner like ourselves i was i say distracted nor could i tell what to think of this event and its consequences for to begin with the poor child was near those who would protect her but what kind of protection could be given by such helpless slaves then was she beyond her husbands reach he would not it was quite certain get possession of her at this vast distance so far she was safe but then the master who looked to make a profit by her as he looked to make a profit by usthrough the ransom of her friends she had no friends to ransom her there was but one the rector and he was her husbands father the time would come when the avarice of the master would make him do or threaten something barbarous towards her then she had found favour with madam this beautiful mulatto woman whom alice innocently supposed to be the masters wife and there was the young planter who wished to buy her with the honourable intention of marrying her in short i knew not what to think or to say because at one moment it seemed as if it was the most providential thing in the world that alice should have been brought here and the next moment it seemed as if her presence only magnified our evils nay she said when i opened my mind to her seeing that the world is so large what but a special ruling of providence could have brought us all to this same island out of the whole multitude of islesand then again to this same estate out of so many humphrey your faith was wont to be stronger i believenay i am quite surethat it was for the strengthening and help of all alike that this hath been ordained first it enables me to nurse my poor robinmine alas no longer yet must i still love him as long as i have a heart to beat love him always child i said this is no sin to love the companion of thy childhood thy sweetheart from whom thou wast torn by the most wicked treacherybut could say no more because the contemplation of that sweet face now so mournful yet so patient made my voice to choke and my eyes to fill with tears said i not that a physician must still keep his mind free from all emotion all that day i conversed with her we agreed that for the present she should neither acknowledge nor conceal the truth from madam upon whose goodwill we now placed all our hopes that is to say if madam questioned her she was to acknowledge that we were her former friends but if madam neither suspected anything nor asked her anything she should keep the matter to herself she told me during this day all that had happened unto her since i saw her last when we marched out of taunton among other things i heard of the woman called deb who was now working in the canefields she was one of a company whose duty it was to weed the canes in the evening this woman when the people returned came to the sickhouse she was a great strapping woman stronger than most men she was dressed like all the women on the estate in a smock and petticoat with a thick coif to keep off the sun and a pair of strong shoes she came to help her mistress as she fondly called alice she wanted to sit up and watch the sick man so that her mistress might go to sleep but alice refused then this faithful creature rolled herself up in her rug and laid herself at the door so that no one should go in or out without stepping over her and so she fell asleep then we began our night watch and talked in whispers sitting by the bedside of the fevered man presently i forgot the wretchedness of our condition the place where we were our hopeless helpless lot our anxieties and our fears in the joy and happiness of once more conversing with my mistress she spoke to me after the manner of the old days but with more seriousness about the marvellous workings of the lord among his people and presently we began to talk of the music which we loved to play and how the sweet concord and harmony of the notes lift up the soul and of pictures and painting and mr boscorels drawings and my own poor attempts and my studies in the schools and so forth as if my life was indeed but just beginning and instead of the monmouth cap and the canvas breeches and common shirt i was once more arrayed in velvet with a physicians wig and a goldheaded cane lastly she prayed entreating merciful heaven to bestow health of mind and enlargement of body to the sick man upon the bed and her brother and her dear friend meaning myself and to all poor sufferers for religion and she asked that as it had been permitted that she should be taken from her earthly lover by treachery so it might now be granted to her to lay down her life for his so that he might go free and she die in his place through the open window i saw the four stars which make the constellation they call the crucero being like a cross fixed in the heavens the night was still and there was no sound save the shrill noise of the cigala which is here as shrill as in padua slave and master bondman and free were all asleep save in this house where robin rolled his heavy head and murmured without ceasing and alice communed with her god surely surely i thought here was no room for doubt this my mistress had been brought here by the hand of god himself to be as an angel or messenger of his own for our help and succourhaply for our spiritual help alone seeing that no longer was there any help from man chapter xliii barnaby hears the news the master my patient got up from his bed in a few days somewhat pale and weak after his copious bloodletting and the drastic medicines with which i purged the grossness of his habit and expelled the noxious humours caused by his many intemperances these had greatly injured what we callbecause we know not what nor what else to call itthe pure volatile spirit and so to speak turned sour the humor radicalisthe sweet oil and balsamical virtues of the body i gave him such counsel as was fitting for his case admonishing him urgently to abstain from strong liquors except in their moderate use to drink only after his meals to keep his head cool and sober and above all things to repress and govern his raging temper which would otherwise most certainly catch him by the throat like some fierce and invisible devil and throw him into a fit and so kill him i told him also what might be meant by the wise man who certainly thought of all the bearings which his words could have when he said that one who is slow to wrath is of great understandingnamely that many men do throw away their lives by falling into excessive fits of rage but i found that the words of holy scripture had little authority over him for he lived without prayer or praise trampled on the laws of god and gave no heed at all to the flight of time and the coming of the next world for a day or two he followed my injunctions taking a tankard of small ale to his breakfast the same quantity with his dinner a pint of madeira for his supper and a sober glass or two before going to bed but when he grew well his brother planters came round him again the drinking was renewed and in the morning i would find him again with parched throat tongue dry and shaking hand ready to belabour to curse and to rail at everybody if one wanted an example for the young how strong drink biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder here was a case the sight of which might have caused all young men to forswear drunkenness alas there are plenty of such examples to be seen in every part of england yet the younger men still continue to drink and that i think worse than their fathers this man however who was not yet fiveandthirty in the very prime of strong and healthy manhood had his fingerjoints swollen and stony from taking much wine he commonly ate but little meat craving continually for more drink and his understanding which was by nature i doubt not clear and strong was now brutish and stupid thinking over this man and of the power even unto death which he possessed over his servants and slaves the words came into my mind it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink nay more and this i say knowing that many godly men will not agree with me i am fully persuaded that there is no man in the whole world so good and so strong in virtue and religion that he should be suffered to become the master or despot over any other man even over a company of poor and ignorant blacks or a gang of transported thieves when i think of those unhappy people driven forth in the morning heavyeyed and downcast to the hard days work and when i remember how they crept home at night after being driven cursed and beaten all day long and when i think upon their drivers overseers and masters and of their hard and callous hearts i am moved to cry aloud if any would hear me that to be a slave is wretched indeed but that to own and to drive slaves should be a thing most dangerous for any who would continue members of christs church when i told barnaby the surprising news that his sister was not only safe but a servant like ourselves upon the same estate i looked that he would rejoice on the contrary he fell into a strange mood swearing at this ill stroke as he called it he said that he never had the least doubt as to her safety seeing there were so many in the west country who knew and respected her father and would willingly shelter her then he dwelt upon certain evilsof which i confess i had thought littlewhich might befall her and lastly he set forth with great plainness the increased dangers in escaping when one has to carry a woman or a wounded mana thing he pointed out which had caused his own capture after sedgemoor then he opened up to me the whole business of our escape last saturday night he said while you were sleeping i made my way to the port and having a shilling or so left i sought out a tavern there is one hard by the bridge a houseofcall for sailors where i had the good fortune to find a fellow who can do for us all we wantif his money hold out which i doubt he is a carver by trade and a convict like ourselves but is permitted by his master to work at his trade in the town he hath been it is true branded in the hand but lord what signifies that he was once a thiefwellhe is now an honest lad again who asks for nothing but to get home again john nuthall is his name go on barnaby we are already in such good company that another rogue or two matters little this man came here secretly last night while you were in the sickhouse he is very hot upon getting away and because i am a sailor and can navigate a craft which he cannot do he will take with him not only myself but also all my party now listen humphrey he hath bought a boat of a guinea man in the harbour and because to prevent the escape of servants every boat is licensed and her owner has to give security to the governors officers he hath taken this boat secretly up a little creek of which he knows and hath there sunk her three feet deep the masts the sails the oars and the other gear he hath also safely bestowed in a secret place but we cannot sail without water provisions nor without a compass at least if our party is to consist of sister robin you john nuthall and myselffive in allwe shall have to load the boat with provisions and i must have a compass i looked for a boatful with ourselves and john nuthall now we have sis as well and the boat is but small where shall we get provisions and where shall we lay our hands upon the money to buy what we want he could talk of nothing else because his mind was full of his plan yet it seemed to me a most desperate enterprise thus to launch a small boat upon the wide ocean and in this cockleshell to brave the waves which are often fatal to the tallest ships tut man said barnaby we are not now in the season of the tornadoes and there is no other danger upon these seas i would as lief be in an open boat as in a brigantine sharks may follow us but they will not attack a boat calamaries they talk of big enough to lay their arms round the boat and so to drag it under but such monsters have i never seen any more than i have seen the great whale of norway or the monstrous birds of the southern seas there is only one danger humphrey my lad here he laid his hand upon mine and became mighty serious if we are taken we shall be floggedall of us thirtynine lashes they will lay on and they will brand us for myself i value not their thirtynine lashes a brass farthing nor their branding with a hot iron which can but make a man jump for a day or two to me this risk against the chance of escape matters nothing why when i was cabinboy i got daily more than thirtynine lasheskicks cuffs and ropesendings nay i remember when we sat over the latin syntax together my daily ration must have been thirtynine more or less and dads arm was stronger than you would judge to look at him if they catch me let them lay on their thirtynine and be damned to them but you and robin i doubt think otherwise i would not willingly be flogged barnaby if there were any way of escapeeven by death so i thought so i thought and as for robin if he recoverswhich i doubthe too if i know him would rather be killed than be flogged that comes of oxford said barnaby and then there is sis humphrey my lad it goes to my heart to think of that poor girl stripped to be lashed like a black slave or a bristol drab barnaby she must never run that dreadful risk then she must remain behind and here she runs that risk every day what prevents yon drunken sotthe taste of that cudgel still sticks in my gizzardi say what prevents him from tying her up today or tomorrow or every day barnaby i say that she must never run that risk for if we are caught i stopped before we are caught you would say humphrey we are of the same mind there but who is to kill her not robin for he loves her not you because you have too great a kindness for her not i because i am her brother what should i say to my mother when i meet her after we are dead and she asks me who killed alice barnaby if she is to die let us all die together ay he replied though i have i confess no great stomach for dying yet since we have got her with us it must be done tis easy to let the water into the boat and so in three minutes with no suspicion at all and my mother never to know anything about it she would have said her last prayers and we should be all sinking together with never a gasp left i took him after this talk to the sickhouse where alice was beginning her second night of nursing barnaby saluted his sister as briefly as if her presence was the thing he most expected the room was lit by a horn lanthorn containing a great candle which gave enough light to see robin on the bed and alice standing beside him the woman called deb was sitting on the floor wrapped in her rug sis said barnaby i have heard from humphrey how thou wast cozened out of thy money and enticed on board ship well this world is full of villains and i doubt whether i shall live to kill them all one i must kill and one i must cudgel patience therefore and no more upon this head well sis dost love to be a servant surely not barnaby wouldst like to get thy freedom again i know not the meaning of thy words brother madam says that those who have interest at home may procure pardons for their friends in the plantations also that those whose friends have money may buy their freedom from servitude i am sure that mr boscorel would willingly do this for robin and for humphrey but for myselfhow can i ask him how can i ever let him know where i am and in what condition ay ay but i meant not that way child wilt thou trust thyself to us she looked at robin i cannot leave him she said no no we shall wait until he is deador perhaps better but he only added this to please his sister when he is better sis thou wilt not be afraid to trust thyself with us i am not afraid of any danger even of death with you if that is the danger in your mind barnaby good then we understand each other there are other dangers for a young and handsome womanand maybe worse dangers hast any money at all by chance nay the man penne took all my money barnaby for five or six minutes without stopping spoke upon this topic after the manner of a sailor my turn will come he added no money child tis a great pity had we a few gold pieces now some women have rings and chains but of course nay brother chains i never had and as for rings there were but two that ever i hadone from robin the day that i was plighted to him and one from the man who made me marry him and put it on in the church the former did i break and throw away when i agreedfor your dear livesbarnaby oh for the lives of all i know i know said barnaby patiencepatience oh i shall get such a chance some day the other i threw away when i fled from my husband at the church door ay ay if we only had a little money tis pity that we should fail for want of a little money why said alice i had quite forgotten i have something that may bring money she pulled from her neck a black ribbon on which was a little leathern bag tis the ring the duke gave me at ilchester long ago i have never parted with it god grant he said when he gave it to me that it may bring thee good luck will the ring help barnaby i took it first from her hand why i said it is a sweet and costly ring jewels i know and have studied if i mistake not these emeralds must be worth a great sum but how shall we dispose of so valuable a ring in this place and without causing suspicion give it to me barnaby took it looked at it and laid it bag and all in his pocket there are at the port merchants of all kinds who will buy a ships cargo of sugar one minute and the next will sell you a red herring they will also advance money upon a ring as for suspicion there are hundreds of convicts and servants here tis but to call the ring the property of such an one and no questions will be asked my friend john nuthall the carver shall do this for us and now sis i think that our business is as good as done have no fear we shall get away first get robin well and thenhere barnaby gazed upon her face with affection and with pity but sister understand rightly tis no childs play of hide and seek tis life or deathlife or death if we fly we must never come back again understand that well since we are in the lords hands brother why should we fear take me with you let me die if you must die and if you live i am content to live with you so that my husband never find me out chapter xliv a scare there is between the condition of the mind and that of the body an interdependence which cannot but be recognised by every physician so greatly has this connection affected some of the modern physicians as to cause doubts in their minds whether there be any life at all hereafter or if when the pulse ceases to beat the whole man should become a dead and senseless lump of clay in this they confuse the immortal soul with the perishable instruments of brain and body through which in life it manifests its being and betrays its true nature whether of good or ill thus the condition in which robin now lay clearly corresponded as i now understand with the state of his mind induced by the news that alice to save his life had been betrayed into marrying his cousin for at the hearing of that dreadful news he was seized with such a transport of rage not against that poor innocent victim but against his cousin as threatened to throw him into madness and on recovering from this access he presently fell into a kind of despair in which he languished during the whole voyage so also in a corresponding manner after a fever the violence of which was like to have torn him to pieces he fell into a lethargy in which though his fever left him he continued to wander in his mind and grew as i could not fail to mark daily weaker in his body refusing to eat though alice brought him dainty broth of chicken delicate panadas of bread and butter fruit boiled with sugar and other things fit to tempt a sick mans appetite provided by the goodness of madam this lady was in religion a romanist by birth she was a spanish quadroon to escape the slavery to which the colour of her grandmother doomed her she escaped from cuba and found her way to jamaica where she met with our master and whether she was lawfully married unto him i will not after her kindness to alice and her faithfulness to myself as regards robin so much as ask robin therefore though the fever left him did not mend on the contrary as i have said he grew daily weaker so that i marvelled at his lasting so long and looked to see him die as so many die in the early morning when there is a sharpness or eagerness in the air and the body is exhausted by long sleep yet he died not and now you shall hear how through the duke of monmouths ring we escaped from our servitude god grant said the duke that it bring thee good luck this was a light and unconsidered prayer forgotten as soon as uttered meant only to please the ear of a child and yet in a manner most marvellous to consider it proved the salvation of us all what better luck could that ring cause than that we should escape from the land of egyptthe house of bondage i have disposed of the ring barnaby told me a few days later that is to say john nuthall has secretly pledged it with a merchant for twenty guineas he said that the ring belongs to a convict but many of them have brought such precious things with them in order to buy their freedom he owns that the stones are fine and very willingly gave the money on their security then nothing remains i said but to get away john nuthall has bought provisions and all we want little by little so as to excite no suspicion they are secretly and safely bestowed and half the money still remains in his hands how goes robin he draws daily nearer to his grave we cannot depart until either he mends or dies tis another disaster barnaby ay but of disaster we must not think robin will die yet our own case may be as bad if it comes to scuttling the ship cheer up lads many men die but the world goes on poor robin every man for himself and the lord for us all sis will cry but even if robin recovers he cannot marry her a consideration which ought to comfort her and for himsince nothing else will serve himit is best that he should die better make an end at once than go all his life with hanging head for the sake of a woman as if there are not plenty women in the world to serve his turn i know not what ails him that he does not get better the air is too hot for him he hath lost his appetite barnaby i cried moved to a sudden passion of pity such as would often seize me at that time saw one ever ruin more complete than ours had we been fighting for spain and the accursed inquisition we could not have been more heavily punished and we were fighting on the lords side we weredad was with us too and see how he was served the lord it seems doth not provide his servants with arms or with ammunition or with commanders otherwise the duke this day would be in st jamess palace wearing his fathers crown and you would be a court physician with a great wig and a velvet coat instead of a monmouth cap and a canvas shirt and i should be an admiral but what doth it profit to ask why and wherefore let us first get clear of the wreck well i wish we were to take robin with us twill be a poor business going back to bradford orcas without him we waited therefore day after day for robin either to get better or to die and still he lingered seemingly in a waste or decline but such as i had never before seen and i know not what would have happened to him whether he would have lived or died but then there happened a thing which caused us to wait no longer it was this the master having according to his daily custom gone the round of his estatethat is to say having seen his servants all at work under their drivers some planting with the hoe some weeding some cutting the maize some gathering yams potatoes cassavy or bonavist for provisions some attending the ingenio or the stillhousedid unluckily take into his head to visit the sickhouse what was more unfortunate this desire came upon him after he had taken a morning dram and that of the stiffest not indeed enough to make him drunk but enough to make him obstinate and wilful when i saw him standing at the open door i perceived by the glassiness of his eyes and the unsteadiness of his shoulders that he had already begun the days debauch he was now in a most dangerous condition of mind later in the day when he was more advanced in drink he might be violent but he would be much less dangerous because he would afterwards forget what he had said or done in his cups so sir doctor he said i have truly a profitable pair of servantsone who pretends to cure everybody and so escapes work and your cousin who pretends to be sick and so will do none a mighty bargain i made truly when i bought you both with submission sir i said i have within the last week earned for your honour ten guineas worth of fees well that is as it may be how do i know what hath gone into your own pocket where is this malingering fellow make him sit up sit up i say ye skulking dog sit up sir i said still speaking with the greatest humility nobody but the lord can make this man sit up and indeed robin did not comprehend one word that was said i gave fifty pounds for him only a month ago am i to lose all that money i ask fifty pounds because i was told that he was a gentleman and would be ransomed by his family hark ye doctor you must either cure this man for meor else by the lord you shall have his ransom added to your own if he dies i will double your price mark that i said nothing hoping that he would depart as for alice she had turned her back upon him at his first appearance as madam had ordered her to do so that he might not notice her unfortunately he did not depart but came into the room looking about him certainly he was not one who would suffer his servants to be negligent even in the smallest things here is fine work he said sheets of the besta pillow what hath a servant to do with such luxuries my cousin is a gentleman i told him and accustomed to lie in linen the rug which is enough for him in health must have a sheet to it as well now that he is sick humph and whom have we here who art thou madam i wish to know alice turned i am your honours servant she said i am employed in this sickhouse when i am not in the sewingroom a servant oh madam i humbly crave your pardon i took you for some fine lady i am honoured by having such a servant all the rest of my women servants go in plain smock and petticoat but here he smiled to so lovely a girl as alice eykinfair alice sweet alicewe must give the bravest and daintiest to thee my dear nothing can be denied those dainty cheeks those white hands were never made to adorn a common coif mistress alice we must be better acquainted this is no fit place for you not the sickhouse but the best room in my house shall be at thy service sir i ask for nothing but to sit retired and to render such service as is in my power to sit retired why that cannot be longer suffered twould be a sin to keep hidden any longer this treasurethis marvel i say of beauty and grace my servant nay tis itis the whole islandwho are thy servants thou to render service tis for me madam to render service to thy beauty he took off his hat and flourished it making a leg then sir said alice suffer me i pray to go about my business which is with this sick man and not to hear compliments he caught her hand and would have kissed it but she drew it back nay coy damsel he said i swear i will not go without a kiss from thy lips kiss me my dear she started back and i rushed between them at that moment madam herself appeared what do you here she cried catching his arm what has this girl to do with you come away come away and leave her in peace go back to the house woman he roared breaking from her and flourishing his stick so that i thought he was actually going to cudgel her go back or it will be the worse for you what am i master here or you go back i say then a strange thing happened she made no reply but she turned upon him eyes so full of authority that she looked like a queen he shifted his feet made as if he would speak and finally obeyed and went out of the place to his own house with the greatest meekness soberness and quietness presently madam came back i blame thee not child she said it is with him as i have told thee when he begins to drink the devil enters into him dost think he came here to see the sick man no but for thy fair eyes inflamed with love as well as with drink at such times no one can rule him but myself and even i may fail keep snug therefore perhaps he may forget thee again but indeed i know not she sighed and left us chapter xlv barnaby the avenger the man did not come back during the whole day i remained with alice in fear but he molested us not when the sun set and the field hands returned i was in two minds whether to tell barnaby what had happened or not but when i saw his honest face streaked with the dust of the days work and watched him eating his lump of salt beef and basin of yellow porridge with as much satisfaction as if it had been a banquet of all the dainties i could not bear without greater cause to disturb his mind tonight he told me when there was no more beef and the porridge was all eaten there is a great feast at the bridge i would we had some of their sherris and madeira the governor of nevis landed yesterday and is entertained today by our governor all the militia are feasting officers and men nobody will be on the lookout anywhere and it is a dark night with no moon what a chance for us could we make our escape tonight there may never again happen such a chance for us how goes robin and so after a little more talk we lay down in our hammocks and i for one fell instantly asleep having no fear at all for alice first because the master would be now at the bridge feasting and too drunk for anything but to sleep and next because she had with her the woman deb as stout and lusty as any man the master was not at the bridge with the rest of the planters and gentlemen perhaps the drink which he took in the morning caused him to forget the great banquet however that may be he was most unluckily for himself drinking at home and alone yet dressed in his best coat and wig and with his sword all of which he had put on for the governors banquet after a while the devil entered into him finding easy admission so to speak all doors thrown wide open and even a welcome in that deboshed and profligate soul about eight oclock therefore prompted by the evil one the master rose and stealthily crept out of the house it was a dark night but he needed no light to guide his footsteps he crossed the court and made straight for the sickhouse he pushed the door open and stood for a little looking within by the light of the horn lanthorn he saw the girl whose image was in his mind the sight might have caused him to return repentant and ashamed for she was on her knees praying aloud beside the bedside of the sick man as he stood in the door the woman named deb who lay upon the floor asleep woke up and raised her head but he saw her not then she sat up watching him with suspicion but his eyes were fixed on the figure of alice then she sprang to her feet for now she knew that mischief was meant and she stood in readiness prepared with her great strong arms to defend her mistress but he thought nobody was in the house but alice and the sick man he saw nothing but the girl at the bedside i say that i was sleeping i was awakened at the sound of a shrieki knew the voicei sprang from the hammock god of mercy i cried it is alice barnaby awakeawake i say it is the cry of alice then i rushed to the sickhouse there i saw aliceshrieking and crying for help and before her the master struggling and wrestling with the woman deb she had her arms round his neck and made as if she was trying to throttle him nay i think that she would have throttled him so strong she was and possessed of such a spirit and by the light of the lanthorn gleaming upon the blade i saw that his sword had either fallen from his hand or from the scabbard and now lay upon the floor stand back cried barnaby pushing me aside leave go of him woman let me deal with him the thing was done in a moment merciful heavens to think that thus suddenly should the soul of man be called to its account i had seen the poor fellows shot down and cut to pieces on sedgemoor but then they knew that they were going forth to fight and so might be killed there was time before the battle for a prayer but this man had no timeand he was more than half drunk as well he lay at our feet lifeless barnaby standing over him with a broken sword in his hand for a while no one spoke or moved but the woman called deb gasped and panted and even laughed as one who is well pleased because she hath had her revenge then madam herself clad in a long white nightdress and with bare feet suddenly pushed us aside and fell upon her knees beside the wounded man she lifted his head the face was pale and the eyes closed she laid it gently down and looked round you have killed him she said speaking not in a rage or passion but quietly you have killed him tomorrow you will hang you will all hang we said nothing doctor she turned to me tell me if he is dead or living she snatched the lanthorn and held it while i made such examination as was possible i opened his waistcoat and laid back his shirt the sword had run straight through him and broken off short perhaps by contact with his ribs the broken point remained in the wound and the flesh had closed around it so that save for a drop of blood or two oozing out there was no flow it needs no great knowledge to understand that when a man hath six inches of steel in his body which cannot be pulled out and when he is bleeding inwardly he must die still as physicians use i did not tell her so madam i said he is not dead he is living while there is life there is hope oh she cried why did he buy you when he could have had the common sort you will hangyou will hang every one that shall we presently discover said barnaby humphrey we have now no choice leftwhat did i tell thee about the chances of the night we must go this night as for this villain let him bleed to death go said madam whither unhappy men will you go there is no place in the island where you can hide but with bloodhounds they will have you out you can go nowhere in this island but you will be found and hanged unless you are shot like rats in a hole come humphrey said barnaby we will carry robin this poor woman must go too she will else be hanged for trying to throttle him well she can lend a hand to carry robin madam by your leave we will not hang nor will we be shot in thein thethe cavecave that i know of your bloodhounds will never find us madam i said it is true that we shall attempt to escape for what hath happened i am truly sorry yet we may not suffer such a thing as was this night attempted without resistance else should we be worse than the ignorant blacks the master will perhaps live and not die listen and take heed therefore doctor she said do not leave me stay with me or he will die doctor stay with me and i will save your life i will swear that you came at my call stay with mei will save alice as well i will save you both you shall be neither flogged nor hanged i swear it i will say that i called you for help when it was too late only this man and this woman shall hang who are they a rogue and barnaby laughed aloud doctor she said if you stay he will perhaps recover and forgive you all barnaby laughed again madam i told her better death upon the gallows than any further term of life with such a man oh she cried he will die where he is lying that may be i know not i gave her certain directions bidding her above all watch the man and cause him to lie perfectly quiet and not to speak a word even in a whisper and to give him a few drops of cordial from time to time come said barnaby we lose time which is precious madam if your husband recoverand for my part i care nothing whether he recover or whether he diebut if he should recover tell him from me captain barnaby eykin that i shall very likely return to this island and that i shall then the lord helping kill him in fair duello to wipe out the lash of the cudgel which he was good enough once to lay about my head if he dies of this trifling thrust with his own sword he must lay that to the account of my sister enough said barnaby we will now make our way to the woods and the cave this said barnaby went to the head of robins bed and ordered deb to take the foot and so between them they carried him forth with them while alice followed and i went last we heard long afterwards through one mr anstissthe same young gentleman who loved alice and would have married herwhat had happened when we were gone an hour or thereabouts afterwards madam woke up one of the overseers telling him what had happened and bidding him be ready at daybreak with the bloodhounds horses and loaded guns to follow in pursuit and bring us back there would be they thought no difficulty at all in catching us because we were encumbered by a sick man and two women there was however more difficulty than they expected for the footsteps led the bloodhounds to the seashore and here the trace was lost nor could it ever be afterwards recovered and though the hue and cry was out over all the island and the woods and the ravines and caves where runaway negroes hide were searched we were never found therefore since no boat at all was missing the guineaman had sailed away it was certain that we could not have escaped by sea it was fortunate indeed that barnaby dropped no hint about the sea otherwise there would have been despatched some of the boats of the port in search of us and in that case the scuttling of the ship might have been necessary for had we been caught we should certainly have been hanged for murder after being flogged for attempted escape for the master died he lay speechless until the day broke then he became conscious and presently breathed his last in great anguish of body and terror of mind what hath since become of madam and of that miserable family of servants and slaves i know not certain it is that they could not find a more barbarous or a more savage master in place of him whom barnaby slew if they were to search the whole of the spanish main and the islands upon it chapter xlvi a perilous voyage in this way unexpected and tragical arrived our chance of escape we walked to carlisle bay by way of the seashore so that we might be met by none and in order that the bloodhounds if they should use them in the morning might be thrown off the track on the march that stout and lusty wench who carried one end of the bed neither called for a halt nor complained of the burden she carried all the way it was nigh unto midnight when we arrived at the creek in which the boat lay sunk this was within a stones throw of john nuthalls cottage where were bestowed the mast sails oars and gear with such provisions as he had gotten together for the voyage the man was sleeping when barnaby called him but he quickly got up and in less than an hour we had the boat hauled out of the water the provisions hastily thrown in the mast stepped our sick man and the women placed in the bows the stern and middle of the boat being encumbered with our provisions we had pushed down the muddy and stinking creek we had hoisted sail and we were stealing silently out of carlisle bay under a light breeze three or four ships were lying in the bay but either there was no watch kept aboard or which is more probable it was no ones business to hail a small sailboat going out probably for fishing at dawn besides the night was so dark that we may very well have escaped notice however that might be in a quarter of an hour we were well out at sea beyond the reach of the guns of carlisle bay no longer visible to the ships in port and without any fear of being seen until daybreak the wind which sometimes drops altogether in the night still continued favourable though very light my lads said barnaby presently drawing a long breath i verily believe that we have given them the slip this time in the morning they may go forth if they please with their bloodhounds to hunt for us let them hunt if any inquiry is made for us at the bridge no boat will be missing and so no suspicion will be awakened they will then i suppose search for us among the caves and ravines of which i have heard where there are hidingplaces in plenty but no water to drink so that the poor devils who run away and seek a refuge there are speedily forced to come out for water and so are caught or shot down well they will hunt a long time before they find us this boat makes a little water but i think not much if she proves watertight and the breeze holds by daylight we should be well to the south of the island courage therefore all will be well yet how goes robin he was lying as easily as we could manage for himone rug over him and another under him alice sat on one side of him and the woman they called deb on the other then because the boat sometimes shipped a little water when she dipped in the waves barnaby rigged a tarpaulin round the bows to prevent this and but this was not till next day over the tarpaulin he made out of a rug and a spare spar a low tilt which unless the weather grew bad should shelter those three by night from dew and spray and by day from the sun overhead and the glare and heat of the water deb he said softly art afraid no sirnot while my mistress is here meaning alice if we are taken we shall all be flogged well nigh unto death and very likely hanged as well i am not afraid sir we may spring a leak said barnaby and so go all to the bottom and be devoured art not afraid to die no sirnot if i may hold my mistress by the hand so that she may take me whither she goeth herself good said barnaby as for me i expect i shall have to go alone or with john nuthall here well there will be a goodly company of us go to sleep my girl in the morning we will serve around the first ration with perhaps if all be well a dram of cordial in the dim light of the stars i watched all night the three figures in the bow robin lay white and motionless alice sat covered with her hood bending over him and deb from whose head her coif had fallen lay head on arm sound asleep she had no fear any more than a common soldier has when he goes into action because he trusts his captain thus began our voyage in an open boat twenty feet long with a company of three sound men two women and a sick man for arms in case we needed them we had none at all if any ship crossed our track and should call upon us to surrender we could not deny that we were escaped convicts because the dress of all but one proclaimed the fact who in such a climate would choose to wear a coarse shirt and canvas breeches with a monmouth cap except it was a servant or a slave who had no choice but must take what is given him but we should not surrender come what might if we could neither fight nor fly we could sink said barnaby in the dead of night whispering in my ear lad tis agreed between us we will have that clear sooner than be taken we will scuttle the ship and so sink all together if tis accounted murder the blame shall lie between us a little before daybreak the breeze freshened and the waves began to rise but not so high as to threaten the boat which proved indeed a most gallant little craft dancing over the waters as if she enjoyed being driven by the breeze some boats as sailors will tell you being always apt to compare these craft with living creatures come thus frolic and sprightly from their makers hands while others built of the same material and on the same lines are on the contrary and always remain heavy and lumpish just as some children are lively and gay while others born of the same parents are dull and morose then the sun rose seeming to leap out of the water a most glorious ball of fire which instantly warmed the cool air and began to burn and scorch our hands and faces in these hot latitudes one understands what the ancients meant when they spoke of the dreadful sungod who both gives and destroys life and is so beneficial and yet so terrible we who live in a cold country are sometimes greatly comforted by the sun but are never burned we feel his warmth but understand not his power then barnaby began to gaze curiously all round the horizon we had no glass or telescope but his eyes were to him as good as any telescope is to most men thank the lord he said drawing breath it was rare for barnaby thus openly to give praise there is no sail in sight to be sure we have the day before us but yethere he began to talk as some men use when they desire to place before their own minds clearly the position of affairs very well thenbarbadoes laying thirty miles and more noreast by northvessels bound for the island from bristol commonly sailing round the northvery well thenwe are out of their track yetthen againsome are driven south by stress of weather ay there is our danger yet again if one should see us would she bear down upon us i greatly doubt it the wind will continuethat is pretty sure if they were to discover that we had gone by boat would they sail after us why what boat could they send and whither would they steer and what boat have they that can sail faster than this little craft yet we are pretty low down in the water humphrey ladhe turned upon me his broad and sunburnt face full of cheerfulnesswe are not within many hours of scuttling yet a tight boat a fair wind a smooth sealet us hope for the best how goes robin there was no change in robin either for better or for worse sis said barnaby art sleeping still sis wake up and let us eat and drink and be jolly what alice i say whywe have escaped we are far away at sea let us laugh and sing if there were room in this cockle i would dance also she lifted her head and threw back her hood ah what a mournful face was there oh brother she said canst thou laugh and sing hast thou forgotten last night why no he replied one must not forget last night because it was the night of our escape all else i own i can forget let it not stick in thy gizzard my dear that the man frightened thee rejoice rather that he thus afforded me a chance of giving him a taste of his own cold iron nay brother she said shaking her head then she looked round her we are a long way from the land she said when will they send out a ship to bring us back why dye see barnaby replied give us twelve hours more and they may send out all their fleet if they have one and sail the wide world round for us and yet not capture us and now let us overhaul the provisions and examine the ships stores alice pulled her hood down again and said no more the woman they called deb was now wide awake and staring about her with the greatest satisfaction come john nuthall barnaby went on we are hungry and thirsty where is the list i made for thee thou art our purser our supercargo our cook and our steward thou art also bosn and carpenter and half the crew where is my list i say give it me and we will examine our stores look up sis never cry over what is done and over what a villain hath received a lesson and thou hangest thy head therefor look up i say there is now hope for all thou shalt merrily dance at my wedding yet then he read the list and examined each parcel or box with great care a hundred and a half of bread a soft cheese plantains a keg of water nine gallons six bottles of canary not one broken a compass a halfhour glass a spare rug tis over robins legs flint and steel a bit of tarpaulin a hatchet and hammer a saw some nails a spar or two a coil of rope and yarn a lump of tobacco we can chew it though i would rather put it into a pipe candlesfaugh they are run together in a lump they will serve to caulk something presently we had in fact no light during our voyage but the tallow proved useful wheni think it was the next daythe boat started a leak this was all our store twas not much for six people but barnaby hoped that the voyage would be short if he should be disappointed who would not put up with short rations for a day or two for the sake of freedom and now he said when everything was stowed according to his mind we will have breakfast our provisions are no great things but after the accursed loblollie a bit of bread and cheese will be a feast a feast indeed it was and our captain gratified us further by opening a flask of canary which raised all our hearts strange that men should be able to recover their spirits which should be independent of the creature comforts by a dram of wine as for barnaby i thought he would have kissed the bottle it is now three months and more he said that we have had nothing save a sup of killdevil fresh from the still and now we are mercifully permitted to taste again a glass of canary tis too much he sighed drinking his ration well we have but a few bottles and the voyage may be longer than we hope therefore we must go upon short allowance but fear not sis there shall always be enough for robin poor lad he then proceeded to tell us what he intended and whither he would steer we have no chart he said what then i can draw one as good as they are made to steer by in these seas he could not draw one because he had no paper or pencil but he carved one with the point of his knife on the seat and marked out our course upon it day by day see he said here is barbadoes our course all night hath been souwest she now makes five knots an hour it is now eight i take it and we must therefore be about forty miles from barbadoes tomorrow morning we should make the grenadilloes which are a hundred and fifty miles from carlisle bay hark ye there may be a bristol vessel sailing from great grenada to barbadoes or the other way that would be the devil but such ships are rare and there is no trade between the two islands well we shall give grenada as wide a berth as may be here he considered a little therefore twill be our wiser plan to bear more to the south once south of grenada i take it there will be no more danger off the main of south america the sea is covered with islands they are no mans land inhabitants have they none navigators for the most part know them not english french and spanish ships come never to these islands my purpose therefore is to put in at great margaritos or tortuga for rest and fresh water and so presently make the dutch island of curacao and after that then my lad we shall take ship to some country where a sailor may get a berth and a physician may find patients it must be to holland first but never fear we shall get back to england some time and perhaps fight another battle with a different tale to tell afterwards as the day advanced the coast of barbadoes continually receded until before sunset the island lay like a purple cloud low down in the horizon the northeast breeze blew steadily but the sun caused a most dreadful heat in the air and our eyes smarted from the glare of the water and the spray that was blown upon us it was at this time that barnaby constructed the tilt of which i have spoken the sea lay spread out round us in a broad circle of which we were the centre and the cloudless blue sky lay over us like unto a roof laid there for us alone it is only in a ship one doth feel thus alone in the centre of creation even as if there were nothing but the sea around the sky above and our boat in the centre thus must the patriarch noah have felt when his ark floated upon the vast face of the water and even the tops of the high hills were hidden and covered over all day barnaby scanned the horizon anxiously but there came into sight no sail or ship whatever to us who sometimes see the vessels lying in a crowded port and hear how they bring argosies from every land it seems as if every part of the ocean must be covered with sails driving before the wind from whatever quarter it may blow but he who considers the mappa mundi will presently discover that there are vast expanses of sea where never a sail is seen unless it be the fugitive sail of the pirate or the bark canoe of the native we were now nearing such a lonely sea or part of the ocean barnaby knew what these planters did not how to steer across the unknown water to a port of safety beyond at midday our captain served out another drink of water and to robin i gave a sop of bread in canary which he seemed to suck up and to swallow with readiness in such a voyage where there is nothing to do but to keep the ship on her course and to watch the horizon for a strange sail one speedily falls into silence and sits many hours without speech sometimes falling asleep lulled by the ripple of the water as the boat flies through it i have said nothing about the man john nuthall he was a plain honestlooking man and we found him throughout all this business faithful brave and patient obedient to barnaby and of an even temper and contented with his share that he had formerly been a thief in his native country cannot be denied but i hope that we shall not refuse to any man the right of repentance barnaby divided the crewnamely himself john nuthall and meinto three watches of eight hours each of which each man kept two at a stretch thus beginning the day at noon which was the only time we knew for certain barnaby would himself but this was after the first two days lie down and sleep till sunset or a little later then john nuthall lay down and took his turn of sleep till barnaby thought it was two oclock in the morning when he woke him and i took his place but for the first day or two barnaby slept not at all and the whole of the voyage he slept as a good watchdog sleepsnamely with one eye open at sunset he gave out another pannikin of cold water to each of us a ration of bread and cheese and a dram of wine then he commanded john nuthall to lie down and sleep while i took the tiller and he himself held the ropes then the night fell once more upon us presently while we sat there in silence alice rose up from her seat and came aft and sat down beside me humphrey she whispered think you that he is truly dead she was speaking not of robin but of the master i know not my dear i can think of nothing but of that mans sudden end and of what may happen to us say something to comfort me humphrey you always had some good word to say like manna for refreshment my soul is low in the dusti cannot even pray why my dear what could i say tis true that the man was struck down and that suddenly and yet to think that my brotherthat barnabyshould have killed him why said barnaby if some one had to kill him why not i as well as another what odds who killed him oh she said that a man should be called away at such a moment when his brain was reeling with wine and wicked thoughts he was not dead i told her though i knew very well what would be the end when we came away many a man recovers who hath had a swordthrust through the body he may now be on the mendwho can tell yet i knew i say very well how it must have ended consider my dear he tempted the wrath of god if any man ever did if he is destroyed on his own head be itnot on ours if he recover he will have had a lesson which will serve him for the rest of his life if he doth not recover he may have time left him for something of repentance and of prayer why alice if we get safely to our port we ought to consider the punishment of this sinner which was in selfdefence as one may truly say the very means granted by providence for our own escape how else should we have got away how else should we have resolved to venture all even to carrying robin with us all this i repeat i said to encourage her because if i know aught of wounds a man bleeding inwardly of a swordthrust through his vitals would have short time for the collecting of his thoughts or the repentance of his sins being as truly cut off in the midst of them as if he had been struck down by a thunderbolt a man may groan and writhe under the dreadful torture of such a wound but there is little room for meditation or for repentance then i asked her if she was in fear as to the event of the voyage i fear nothing she told me but to be captured and taken back to the place whence we came there to be put in prison and flogged that is my only fear humphrey we have suffered so much that this last shame would be too great for me to bear oh to be tied up before all the men and flogged like the black womentwould kill me humphrey alice i said very earnestly art thou indeed brave enough to endure death itself rather than this last barbarity oh deathdeath she cried clasping her hands what is death to me who have lost everything nay but consider my dear to die at seait means to sink down under the cold water out of the light of day to be choked for want of air perhaps to be devoured quick by sharks to lie at the bottom of the water the seaweed growing over your bones to be rolled about by the troubled waves humphrey these are old wives tales why if it had been lawful i would have killed myself long ago but i must not lose heaven as well as earth a brief pang it is to die and then to be happy for ever what do i care whether the seaweed covers my bones or the cold clay oh humphrey humphrey why should i care any longer to live my dear i said if we escape in safety there may yet be happiness in store no man knoweth the future she shook her head happiness i told her doth not commonly come to man in the way which he most desires and prays for if he doth obtain the thing for which he hath so ardently prayed he presently finds that the thing bringeth not the joy he so much expected or it comes too late as is the case often with honours and wealth when one foot is already in the grave i mean my dear that we must not despair because the thing which most we desired is taken from us perhaps we ought not to desire anything at all except what the lord shall provide but that is a hard saying and if men desired nothing it is certain they would no longer work i talked thus at length to divert her mind from her troubles to thee poor child i said have been given afflictions many and greatthe loss of godly parents a husband whom thou must avoid and the deprivation of earthly love yet since thou art so brave alice i will tell theei thought not to tell thee anything of this what humphrey what briefly alice thou shalt not be taken alive howunless you kill me we are agreed my dearbarnaby and ithat if we cannot escape any boats which may pursue us the boat shall be sunk and so we shall all drown together indeed alice i confess that i am not myself so much in love with life as to return to that captivity and intolerable oppression from which we have gotten away therefore be assured we will all drown rather than go back oh she sighed but with relief now shall i fear nothing i have not lost everything since i have thee stilland barnaby alas my head has been so full of what madam saidthat we should be certainly caught and all of us flogged to be flogged who would not rather dieshe shivered and trembled to be floggedhumphrey i could not bear the shame she trembled and shivered as she repeated this confession of fear fear not my dear i said there are those on the boat who love thee too well to suffer that extreme of barbarity put that fear out of thy mind think only that we may have to die but that we shall not be taken to die indeed is very likely our fate for we have but a quarter of an inch of frail wood between us and the seas if a storm should arise we fill with water and go down if the wind should drop we should be becalmed and so perish miserably of hunger and thirst if barnaby steer not aright humphrey said barnaby fill not her innocent head with rubbish tis not the time of tornadoes and there will be no storm the wind at this season never drops therefore we shall not lie becalmed and as for my steering aright why with a compassam i a lubber brother she said if i am not to be flogged the rest concerns me little let us say no more about it i am now easy in my mind robin sleeps humphrey he hath slept since the sun went down and this afternoon he looked as if he knew me also he took the bread sopped in canary eagerly as if he relished it these seas said barnaby are full of sharks i knew not what he meant because we were speaking of robin sharks have got their senses as well as humans he went on still i understood him not when a man on board a ship is going to die the sharks find it out and they follow that ship until he does die and is flung overboard then they devour his body and go away unless there is more to follow i have looked for sharks and there are none following the boat wherefore though i am not a doctor i am sure that robin will not die i know not at all i said how that may be there are many things believed by sailors which are superstitionsfond beliefs nourished by the continual presence of perils on the other hand the senses of man are notoriously as far below those of creatures as his intellect is above them yet a skilful man may read the premonition of death in a sick mans face therefore i know not but a shark may have a sense like unto the eye of a hawk or the scent of a hound with which to sniff the approach of death afar off let us comfort ourselves alice with barnabys assurance tis a well proved and tried thing said barnaby and sailors let me tell thee master doctor have no superstitions or idle beliefs well that may be as to robins disease i can pronounce nothing upon it nay had i the whole library of padua to consult i could learn nothing that would help me first the mind falls into a languishing and spiritless condition that causeth the body to lie open to attacks of any disease which may be threatening then the body being ill at ease works upon the mind and causes it to wander beyond control so that the soul which is bound up with body and mind cannot show herself or manifest her will it is the will which shows the presence of the soul the will which governs body and mind alike but if i know aught of disease if a change comes upon robin it will either swiftly cure or swiftly kill humphrey she whispered if he recover how shall i meet his face how shall i reply when he asks me concerning my faith my dear he knows all twas that knowledge the pity of it and the madness of it believe me which threw him into so low a condition i have looked daily for reproaches in thy kind eyes humphrey i have found none truly but from robinoh i dare not think of meeting those eyes of his reproach thee will he never alice sorrow and love i doubt not will lie in his eyes all his life what thou hast done was for him and for thy father and thy brother and for all of us but oh the pityand the villainy fear not to meet the poor lads eyes alice i long to see the light of reason in those dear eyesand yet i fear humphrey i am married but against my will i am a wife and yet no wife i am resolved that come what may i will never never go to my husband and i love my robin stilloh she sobbed i love my robin still if we die i told her you shall go down with your arm round his neck and so you shall die together then we sat silent a while my dear i said lie down and take some sleep i cannot sleep humphrey for the peace of mind which hath fallen me upon if robin now come to his senses again i shall not fear him and the night it is so peacefulso cool and so peaceful the wind had dropped till there was barely enough to fill the sail and only enough way on the boat to make a soft murmur of the water along her sides the sea is so smooth the sky is so bright and so full of stars can there be anywhere a peace like this alas if we could sail still upon a silent and peaceful ocean but we must land somewhere there will be men and where there are men there is wickedness with drink and wrath and evil passionssuch as we have left behind us humphreyoh my brother humphreyit would be sweet if the boat would sink beneath us now and so with robins hand in mine we could all go together to the happy land where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage from beneath the tilt there came a voicei verily believe it was an answer sent straight from heaven to comfort this poor faithful soul aliceit was the voice of robin in his right mind at last alice he said we will continue to love each other yet without sin oh robin robin she moved quickly to his side and fell upon her knees robin thou wilt recover stay i interposed robin will first have a cup of cordial i have been sleeping he said i know not what hath happened we are in a boat it seems and on the open sea unless i am still dreaming we are slaves to a planter in barbadoes and this is alicewho was in england and i know not what it means you have been ill robin i told him you have been nigh unto death many things have happened of which we will speak but not now alice is at your side and barnaby is navigating the boat drink this cup of winesosleep now and in the morning if it please heaven you shall be so strong that you shall hear everything ask no more questions but sleep give him your hand alice she obeyed me sitting at his side and taking his hand in hers and so continued for the rest of the night robin sleeping peacefully in a word he was restored the fresh seabreeze brought him back to life and reason and though he was still weak he was now as sound in his mind as any man could desire to be and in the morning we told him all that had been done whereat he marvelled alice might love him still that was most true yet between them stood her husband why there was another man in the boat who also loved a girl he could never wed his passion i swear was full of constancy tenderness and patience would robin be as patient when the day broke again we were still sailing over a lonely sea with never a sail in sight and never a sign of land and now robin was sitting up his face pale and his hands thin but the light of reason was in his eyes and on his lips such a smile of tenderness as we were wont to see there in the days of old said i not cried barnaby that he would recover trust the sharks for commonsense and again an open sea with never a sail in sight praise the lord therefore but alice when the sun rose above the waves threw back her hood and burst forth into singing o lord how glorious is thy grace and wondrous large thy love at such a dreadful time and place to such as faithful prove the tears came into my eyes only to see the change that had fallen upon her gracious smiling countenance it was not truly the sweet and happy face that we remembered before her troubles fell upon her but that face graver with the knowledge of evil and of pain and now it was like unto such a face as one may see in many an altarpiece in italy glorified with gratitude and love then the woman called deb fell to weeping and blubbering for very joy that her mistress looked happy again twas a faithful loving creature humphrey said alice forgive me that i murmured things that are done cannot be undone robin is restored to us with three such brothers who should not be content to live i hope now that we shall get safely to our port but if we die we shall die contented in each others arms going through the vale of misery she added softly we will use it as a well chapter xlvii tortuga i take it said barnaby on the third morningthe weather continuing fine and the sea clear of shipsthat we are now clear out of the track of any british vessels we may fall into the hands of the spaniard but he is mild and merciful of late compared with his temper a hundred years ago tis true we have given him many lessons in humanity we should now before nightfall make the islands of testigos but i think they are only rocks and sandy flats such as they call keys where we need not land seeing that we should get nothing by so doing except to go out of the way and so make the rations shorter robintwas at breakfast when he served out a dram of wine to every onei drink to thy better health lad thou hast cheated the devil nay sis look not so angryi meant thou wilt not go to heaven this bout up heart then and get strong we will find thee another sweetheart who shall make thee lift up thine head again what is there but one woman in the world i was saying then he went on that we shall presently make the islands of testigos there followeth thereafter to one who steereth west a swarm of little islands twas here that the pirates used to lie in the good old days snug and retired with their girls and their drink ay and plenty of both a happy time they had barnaby wagged his head and sighed south of this archipelago which i will some day visit in order to search for treasure there lieth the great and mountainous island of margaritos this great island we shall do well to keep upon our south and so bear away to the desert island of tortuga where we shall find water for certainand that i have been told the best springwater that flows turtles we may also find and fish we may catch and when we have recovered our strength with a few days rest ashore we will once more put to sea and make for the island of curacao and the protection of the dutchmen it needs not to tell much more about the voyage in which we were favoured by heaven with everything that we could desirea steady breeze from the best quarter a sea never too rough provisions in sufficiency the absence of any ships and above all the recovery of robin i say then that we sighted and presently passed the group of islets called the testigos that we coasted along the great island of margaritos where we landed not because barnaby feared that certain smoke which we saw might betoken the presence of the spaniard whom in spite of his new character for mildness he was anxious to avoid tis strange thus to sail along the shore of a great island whereon are no inhabitants or if any a few sailors put in for water for turtle and for cocoanuts to see afar off the forests climbing round the mountain sides the waterfalls leaping over the precipices and to think of the happy life one might lead in such a place far from men and their ways i confess since my mistress will never see this page that my thoughts for a whole day while we sailed along the shores of margaritos turned upon those pirates of whom barnaby spoke they lived here at ease and in great happiness tis of such a life that a man sometimes dreams but if he were suffered so to lie in sloth farewell heaven farewell future hopes farewell our old talk of lifting the soul above the flesh let us henceforth live the lives of those who are content since they can have no more with a few years of love and wine and revelry it is in climates like that of the west indies that such a temptation seizes on men the most strongly for here everything is made for mans enjoyment here is no cold no frost no snow or ice here eternal summer reigns and the world seems made for the senses and for nothing else of these confessions enough twas impossible that in such a luxurious dream the image of alice could have any part we landed therefore on the desert island of tortuga where we remained for several days hauling up our boat and covering her with branches to keep off the sun here we lived luxuriously upon turtle fresh fish the remains of our bread and what was left of our canary setting up huts in which we could sleep and finding water of the freshest and brightest i ever saw here robin mended apace and began to walk about with no more help from his nurses we were minded as i have said to sail as far as the island of curacao but an accident prevented this one day when we had been ashore for ten days or thereabouts we were terrified by the sight of a small vessel rigged in the fashion of a ketchthat is with a small mizzenbeating about outside the bay which is the only port of tortuga she will put in here said barnaby that is most certain now from the cut of her she is of new england build and from the handling of her she is undermanned and i think that we have nothing to fear from her unless she is bound for barbadoes or for grenada or jamaica presently the vessel came to anchor and a small boat was lowered into which three men descended they were unarmed she is certainly from new england said barnaby well they are not from barbadoes in quest of us otherwise they would not send ashore three unarmed men to capture four desperate men that is certain and as we cannot hide our boat though we might hide ourselves i will een go forth and parley with these strangers this he did we watching from a safe place the conversation was long and earnest and apparently friendly presently barnaby returned to us there offers he said a chance which is perhaps better than to make for curacao where after all we might get scurvy treatment these men in a word are privateers or since we are at war with none they are pirates they fitted out a brigantine or bilander i know not which and designed to sail round cape horn to attack the spaniard on the south seas on the way they took a prize which you now see in the bay ten men were sent aboard to navigate her as a tender to their ship but they fell into bad weather off brazil and their ship went down with all hands now they are bound for providence only seven hands left and they will take us aboard and carry us to that island for our services truly i think we should go they have provisions in plenty with madeira wine and providence is too far for the arm of king james to reach what say ye all alice what sayest thou truly brother i say nothing then we will agree and go with them we went on board taking with us a good supply of turtle clear water and cocoanuts being all that the isle afforded honest fellows we found our pirates to be they belonged to the island of providence in the bahamas which has long been the rendezvous of english privateers ten years before this the spaniards plucked up courage to attack and destroy the settlement when those who escaped destruction found shelter in some of the adjacent islands or on the mainland of virginia now some of them have come back again and this settlement or colony is reestablished thither therefore we sailed it seemed as if we were become a mere shuttlecock of fortune beaten and driven hither and thither upon the face of the earth chapter xlviii the island of providence it was some time in the month of march ad that we landed in providence the settlementfrom which the spaniards had now nothing to fearthen consisted it is now i learn much larger of no more than one hundred and fifty people in all the men being all sailors and ready to carry on again the old trade of privateer or pirate as you please to call it when they should be strong enough to buy or hire a ship and to equip her we stayed on the island for two years and a quarter or thereabouts it is one of an archipelago for the most part i believe desert the settlement was as i have said but a small one living in scattered houses there were plenty of these to spare which had belonged to the former settlement if one only took the trouble to clear away the creeping plants and cut down the trees which had grown up round them since the spaniards came and destroyed the colony such a house built of wood with a shingle roof we found convenient for us and after we had cleared the ground round it and repaired it we lived in it some of the people helped us to a porker or two and some chickens they also gave us some salt beef and maize to start with that we had little money only what was left over from the sale of alices ring made no difference to us here because no one had any at all and at this time there was neither buying nor selling on the islanda happy condition of things which will not i take it last long so great is the fertility of the ground here and such is the abundance which prevails that we very shortly found ourselves provided with all that we wanted to make life pleasant work there was for us but easy and pleasant worksuch as weeding our patches of vegetables and fruit in the early mornings or going to fish or planting maize or attending to our pigs poultry and turkeys and for the rest of the time sitting in the shade conversing it is none too hot in this place though one would not in the summer walk abroad at noon nor is it ever too cold all the fruits which flourish under the tropics grow here with those also which belong to the temperate zone here are splendid forests where you can cut the mahoganytree and build your house if you please of that lovely wood here we ourselves grew for our own use maize tobacco coffee cocoa plantains pines potatoes and many other fruits and vegetables barnaby soon grew tired of this quiet life and went on board a schooner bound for new england promising that we should hear from him after two years we did receive a letter from him as you shall immediately learn when he was gone we carried on a quiet and peaceful life books paper and pen there were none upon this island nor were there any clothes so that the raggedness of our attire we were dressed in the sailors clothes our friends the privateers gave us became incredible i made some kind of guitar on which we played and in the evening we would have very good playing and singing together of such pieces and songs as we could remember i made verses too for amusement and alice learned them we found our brothersettlers a rough but honest folk to whom we taught many arts how to procure seasalt how to make wine from pineapples how to cure the tobaccoleafthings which greatly added to their comfort and seeing that there was no church on the island we every sabbath held a meeting for prayer and exhortation seeing then that we had all that man could desire with perfect freedom from anxiety our liberty a delightful climate plenty to eat and drinkay and of the very bestand that at home there was nothing for us but prison again and to be sent back to the place whence we had escaped we ought every one will acknowledge to have felt the greatest contentment and gratitude for this sure and quiet refuge we did not the only contented members of our household were john nuthall and the woman deb who cheerfully cultivated the garden and fed the poultry and the pigs for we had now everything around us that is wanted to make life pleasant yet we were not contented i could read the signs of impatience in the face whose changes i had studied for so long other women would have shown their discontent in illtemper and a shrewish tongue alice showed hers in silence sitting apart and communing with herself i daresay i also showed my discontent for i confess that i now began to long vehemently for books consider it was more than two years since i had seen a book there were no books at all on the island of providencenot one book except a bible or two and perhaps a book of common prayer i longed therefore for the smell of leather bindings the sight of books on shelves and the holy company of the wise and the ingenious no one again could look upon robin without perceiving that he was afflicted with a constant yearning for that which he could not have what that was i understood very well although he never opened his mind unto me now i confess that at this time i was grievously tormented with the thought that alices marriage having been no true marriagebecause first she was betrayed and deceived and next she had left her husband at the very church porchthere was no reason in the world why she should not disregard that ceremony altogether and contract a marriage after her own heart i turned this over in my mind a long while and indeed i am still of the opinion that there would have been nothing sinful in such an act but the law of the country would not so regard it that is quite true if therefore i had advised these unhappy lovers in such a sense they would have been compelled to live for the rest of their lives on this island and their offspring would have been illegitimate so that though the letter of the law caused a most cruel in justicesummum jus summa injuriait was better that it should be obeyed in the end it was a most happy circumstance that it was so obeyed i have presently to relate the means by which this injustice was removed as for my own share in it i shall neither exaggerate nor shall i extenuate it i shall not defend it i will simply set it down and leave judgment to a higher court than the opinion of those who read these pages i must however acknowledge that partly in barbadoes and partly in providence i learned from the negresses who possess many secrets and have a wonderful knowledge of plants and their powers the simple remedies with which they treat fevers agues rheumatisms and other common disorders i say simple because they will with a single cup of liquor boiled with certain leaves or with a pinch of some potent powder gotten from a plant effect a speedier cure than our longest prescriptions even though they contain more than fifty different ingredients had i possessed this knowledge for example while we lay in exeter jail not one prisoner except the old and feeble should have died of the fever this said you will understand presently what it was i did it was then about the month of march in the year that a ship laden with wine and bound from new york to jamaica put in at the port of providence her captain carried a letter for me and this was the first news of the world that came to us since our flight the letter was from barnaby it was short because barnaby had never practised the art of letterwriting but it was pertinent first he told us that he had made the acquaintance at boston i mean the little town boston of new england of his cousins whom he found to be substantial merchants so that here at least the man george penne lied not and zealous upholders of the independent way of thinking that these cousins had given him a hearty welcome for the sake of his father that he had learned from them first that the monmouth business was long since concluded and so great was the public indignation against the cruelties of the bloody assize that no one would again be molested on that account not even those who had been sent abroad should they venture to return he also saidbut this we understood notthat it was thought things would before long improve and now he concluded my cousins finding that i am well skilled and have already navigated a ship with credit have made me captain of their own vessel the pilgrim which sails every year to bristol and back again she will be despatched in the month of august or september come therefore by the first ship which will set you ashore either at new york or at boston and i will give you all a passage home afterwards if you find not a welcome there you may come back with me here a physician may find practice robin may find a farm and sister will be safe from b b at this proposal we pricked up our ears as you may very well believe finally we resolved to agree to it promising each other to protect alice from her husband and to go back to boston with barnaby if we found no reason to stay in england but the woman deb though she wept at leaving her mistress would not go back to the place where her past wickedness might be remembered and john nuthall was also unwilling for the same reason to return and as this honest couple had now a kindness for each other i advised them to marry and remain where they were there was on the island no minister of religion nor any magistrate or form of government whatever yet all were honest therefore i ventured to hear their vows of fidelity and prayed with them while i joined their handsa form of marriage to my mind as binding and as sacred as any wanting the assistance of a priest so we handed over to them all our property which was already as much theirs as ours and left them in that sunny and delightful place if the man was a repentant thief the woman was a repentant magdalen and so they were well matched i hope and believe that being well resolved for the future they will lead a godly and virtuous life and will be blessed with children who will never learn the reason why their parents left their native country there is little trade at providence but many vessels touch at the port because it lies between the english possessions in america and those in the west indies they put in for water for fruit and sometimes if they are shorthanded for men most of them in the place being sailors therefore we had not to wait long before a vessel put in bound from jamaica to new york we bargained with the captain for a passage agreeing that he should find us provisions and wine and that we would pay him by means of barnaby on our reaching boston which is but a short distance from new york strange to say though we had been discontented with our lot when we sailed away alice fell to weeping we had murmured and our murmuring was heard we should now be permitted to live out what was left to us of life in england and we should die and be buried among our own folk yet there are times when i remember the sweet and tranquil life we led in the island of providence its soft and sunny air the cool seabreeze the shade of its orange groves and the fruits which grew in such abundance to our hands chapter xlix home in one thing alone the villain penne spoke the truth the eykin family of boston i say again of new england was one of the most considerable in the placegreat sticklers for freedom and for religion but indeed it is a most godfearing town and severe towards transgressors they received us with so much kindness that nothing could surpass it we were treated as christian martyrs at the least and towards alice of whose cruel lot they had heard from barnaby they showed but that no one could help an affection quite uncommon they generously furnished us all with apparel becoming our station and with money for our daily occasions they approved of our going with barnaby but in the event of our finding no welcome or means of a livelihood at home and if alice should be molested by her husband they engaged us to return to new england here they said robin might become a farmer if he had no inclination for trade they would joyfully receive alice to live with them and i myself would certainly find practice as a physician while barnaby should continue to command their ship when i considered the many conveniences which exist in boston it is already though young better provided with everything than barbadoes the excellence of the climate the books which are there the printing press which hath already been established the learned ministers the college the schools and the freedom of religion i should have been nothing loth to remain there but i was constrained first to go home i found also which astonished me so great a love of liberty that the people speak slightingly of the english at home who tamely suffer the disabilities of the nonconformists and the prerogative of the crown and they ask why when the country had succeeded in establishing a commonwealth they could not keep it it certainly cannot be denied as they argue that israel acted against the declared will of the lord in seeking a king so we left them but in how changed a condition did we now cross the ocean instead of huddling in a noisome and stinking dungeon unclean for want of water ill fed and with no change of raiment we had now comfortable cabins clothes such as become a gentleman and food of the best and barnaby who had then sat humbly in the waist where the prisoners were confined now walked the quarterdecka laced kerchief round his neck lace ruffles at his wrist a scarlet coat on his back a sword at his side and gold lace in his hat the captain of the ship the winds were contrary and it was not until the last days of october that we arrived at bristol here we lay for a few days while barnaby transacted his business resolving to remain in retirement for fear of accidents until our captain should be ready to ride with us to bradford orcas the first news we learned was joyful indeed it was that the prince of orange himself was about to invade england with intent to drive his fatherinlaw from the throne he had indeed already sailed but his fleet was driven back by a storm it was also stated that he had with him a great army of dutch and english and such preparations of arms and ammunition as it was hoped would make such a failure as that of our unhappy duke impossible we also confirmed barnabys information that monmouths men could now go about without fear or molestation as to the position of affairs at bradford orcas we could learn nothing there was one point on which i was curiousnamely as to what barnaby would do in the matter of the villain penne on the one hand it was certain that barnaby would not forget this man nor was he likely to sit down with his arms folded after he had been robbed of so great a sum therefore i was not surprised when the evening before we rode out of bristol he brought a big bag of blue stuff in his hands and poured out the contentsa vast shower of gold piecesinto the lap of his astonished sister alice he said i bring you back your money you will find it all here and mr boscorels money to boot he hath disgorged with that he sat down and laughed but as one who hath a joke in secret and would tell us no more for a day or two after this he would on the road to bradford orcas begin to laugh at intervals rolling about in his saddle shaking his sides choking with laughter insomuch that i presently lost patience with him and as a physician ordered him instantly to make full confidence or i would not answer for it but he would have a fit then he told us what he had done towards five in the afternoon when the autumn day is ended he repaired to the man pennes countinghouse a place easily found on inquiry having with him one of those fellows who bawl at fairs selling medicines and charms drawing teeth letting blood and so forth at the sight of a sea captain many of whom came to this place the worthy merchants servant without suspicion opened the door of the private office or chamber where mr penne transacted his affairs barnaby found him dozing by the fire his wig on the table a silk handkerchief over his head and the candles already lighted he awoke however on the opening of the door friend said barnaby i am captain barnaby eykin commanding the ship pilgrim from bostonat your service i am also brother to the young woman alice eykin whom you robbed twas my money of two hundred and fifty pounds and afterwards kidnapped illustration barnaby holding the pistol to the poor wretchs head so that he should not bellow and call for assistance mr penne looked about him and would have cried out for assistance but barnaby clapped a pistol to his forehead then he sank in his chair and gasped stir not said his enemy i am also one of the three rebels for whose ransom the reverend philip boscorel rector of bradford orcas paid the sum of two hundred and ten poundswhich you have also stolen sir said mr penne upon my honour those moneys were sent to barbadoes upon my honour sir you will therefore said barnaby taking no heed of this assurance pay over to me the sum of four hundred and sixty pounds with interest at five per cent for three years which i have calculated the whole amount is five hundred and twentynine pounds begin by paying this well to make a long story short though the man protested that he had not so much in the world yet he presently opened his strong box and counted out the money all in gold this done he hoped to be let off there now remains said barnaby the punishmentand i forgot sisters ring i ought to have added fifty pounds for that but time presses perhaps i shall come back i did intend to kill thee brother for thy great villany however he then beckoned the man with him who lugged out of his pocket an instrument which made mr penne shake and quake with terror barnaby then informed his victim that as he had been the means of inflicting grievous bodily suffering upon four undeserving people it was meet and right that he himself should experience something which by its present agony should make him compassionate for the future and by its permanence of injury should prevent his ever forgetting that compassion for the rest of his life he therefore he told him intended to draw from his head four of his stoutest and strongest grinders this in a word he did the man with him dragging them out with the pincers barnaby holding the pistol to the poor wretchs head so that he should not bellow and call for assistance his laughter was caused by the remembrance of the twisting of the mans features in this agony and by his moanings and groanings the grinders he had brought away with him in his pocket and showed them in triumph it was late in the afternoon when we rode into bradford orcas the november sun now setting lay upon the woods yellow and red with the autumn leaves not yet fallen as we neared the village the sun went down and a mist began to rise all the doors were closed and no one looked forth to greet us the old cottage where alice was born and where she lived so long was empty still the door was open the shutter hung upon one hinge the honey hives were overturned the thatch was broken the garden was neglected why sis said barnaby thy mother is not there nor dadis hepoor old dad we rode up the village till we came to the church and the manor house beside it alas the house itself was closed which had formerly stood open to all there was no smoke from its chimneys and the grass grew in the courtyard we dismounted and opened the door which was not locked we went into the house all was cold and empty and deserted the twilight falling outside made the rooms dark beside the fireplace stood sir christophers great chair empty his tankard was on the table and his tobaccopipe andstrangethere lay forgotten the unhappy dukes proclamation then a truly wonderful thing happened barnaby says that i must have dreamed it for he saw nothing suddenly sir christopher himself appeared sitting in the chair on his knees lay the bible open beside him stood with upraised forefinger as if commenting on some knotty point the rev dr comfort eykin i declare that i saw them plainly as plainly as i now behold the paper on which i write they were but as shadows in the dark shadows of the empty room and they appeared but for a moment and then vanished and i saw them no more come to the rectory said robin it chokes us to be here listen said alice outside the house from the rectory there came the sound of a violoncello then was the good rector himself there comforting his soul we opened the gardengate and walked softly across the lawn and looked in at the window twas made after the foreign fashion to open upon the lawn beside the fire sat madam her hands clasped thin pale and prematurely aged thus had she sat for three long years still waiting for news of her son the rector laid down his bow crossed the room and sat down to the spinnet on which he played prettily but not with such command as he possessed over the other instrument he playedi caught alices handan air of my own making to which i had set certain words also of my own then while he played we began to sing outside the window alice singing treble or first i the second part and robin the bass as i had taught him in providence island the words of that little song we sang it piano or softly at first and then crescendo or louder as rides the moon in azure skies the twinkling stars beside as when in splendour she doth rise their lesser lights they hide so beside celia when her face we see all unregarded other maidens be when we began softly as i said the rector looked round him playing still and listening he thought the voices were in his own brainechoes or memories of the past madam heard them too and sat up listening as one who listens in a dream when we sang louder madam sprang to her feet and held out her armsbut the rector played the verse quite through then he opened the window for us my son my son cried madam chapter l the great lord chancellor but the prince of orange had already landed we learned this news next day and you may be sure that we were in the saddle again and riding to exeter there to join his standard this we did with the full consent of madam and of alice much as we had suffered already they would not deter us because this thing would have been approved by sir christopher and dr eykin therefore we went as all the world knows this expedition was successful yet was not barnaby made an admiral nor was i made a court physician we got in fact no reward at all except that for barnaby was procured a full pardon on account of the homicide of his late master my second campaign as everybody knows was bloodless to begin with we had an army not of raw country lads armed indifferently and untrained but of veteran troops fifteen thousand strong all well equipped and with the best general in europe at their head at first indeed such was the dread in mens minds caused by lord jeffreys cruelties few came in yet this was presently made up by what followed when without any fighting at all the kings regiments melted away his priests fled and his friends deserted him this was a very different business from that other when we followed one whom i now know to have been a mere tawdry pretender no better fitted to be a king than a vagabond actor at a fair is fit to be a lord alas what blood was wasted in that mad attemptof which i was myself one of the most eager promoters i was then young and i believed all that i was told by the conspirators in holland i took their list of wellwishers for insurgents already armed and waiting only for a signal i thought that the roll of noble names set down for sturdy protestants was that of men already pledged to the cause i believed that the whole nation would rise at the first opportunity to turn out the priests i even believed in the legitimacy of the duke and that against the express statement of his father if king charles was in reality his father and i believed what they told me of his princely virtues his knowledge of the art of war and his heroic valour i say that i believed all these things and that i became a willing and zealous tool in their hands as for what those who planned the expedition believed i know not nor will any one now ever learn what promises were made to the duke what were broken and why he was from the outset save for a few days at taunton so dejected and disappointed as for me i shall always believe that the unhappy manunwise and softheartedwas betrayed by those whom he trusted it is now an old tale though king monmouth will not speedily be forgotten in the west country nor will the memory of the bloody assize the brave lads who followed him are dead and buried some in unhonoured graves hard by the place where they were hanged some under the burning sun of the west indies the duke himself hath long since paid the penalty of his rash attempt all is over and ended except the memory of it it is now common history known to everybody how the prince of orange lingered in the west country his army inactive as if he knew doubtless he was well informed upon this particular that the longer he remained idle the more likely was the kings cause to fall to pieces there are some who think that if king james had risked an action he could not but have gained whatsoever its eventi mean that the blood of his soldiers once roused they would have remained steadfast to him and would have fought for him but this he dared not to risk wherefore the prince did nothing while the kings regiments fell to pieces and his friends deserted him it was in december when the prince came to windsor and i with him once more chyrurgeon in a rebel army while there i rode to londonpartly with the intention of judging for myself as to the temper of the people partly because after so long an absence i wished once more to visit a place where there are books and pictures and partly because there were certain notes and herbs which i desired to communicate to the college of physicians in warwick lane it happened to be the very day when the kings first flightthat namely when he was taken in the isle of sheppeybecame known the streets in the city of london i found crowded with people hurrying to and fro running in bands and companies shouting and crying as if in the presence of some great and imminent danger it was reported and currently believed that the disbanded irish soldiers had begun to massacre the protestants there was no truth at all in the report but yet the bells were ringing from all the towers the crowds were exhorting each other to tear down and destroy the romish chapels to hunt for and to hang the priests and especially jesuits i know not whether they found any and to shout for the prince of orange i stood aside to let the crowds thus religiously disposed run past but there seemed no end to them presently however this was in front of the new royal exchange there drew near another kind of crowd there marched six or eight sturdy fellows bearing stout cudgels and haling along a prisoner round them there ran shrieking hooting and cursing a mob of a hundred men and more they continually made attacks upon the guard fighting them with sticks and fists but they were always thrust back i thought at first that they had caught some poor wretched priest whom they desired to murder but it proved to be a prize worth many priests as they drew nearer i discerned the prisoner he was dressed in the garb of a common sailor with short petticoats which they call slops and a jacket his cap had been torn off leaving the bare skull which showed that he was no sailor because common sailors do not wear wigs blood was flowing down his cheek from a fresh wound his eyes rolled hither and thither in an extremity of terror i could not hear what he said for the shouting of those around him but his lips moved and i think he was praying his guards to close in and protect him never surely was seen a more terrorstricken creature i knew his face once seen i had seen it once it could never be forgotten the red and bloated cheeks which even his fear could not make pale the eyes more terrible than have been given to any other human creature these i could not forgetin dreams i see them still i saw that face at exeter when the cruel judge exulted over our misery and rejoiced over the sentence which he pronounced yea he laughed when he told us how we should swing but not till we were dead and then the knifedelivering his sentence so that no single point of its horror should be lost to us yes it was the face of judge jeffreysnone otherthis abject wretch was that great judge why when we went back to our prison there were some who cast themselves upon the ground and for terror of what was to come fell into mere dementia and now i saw him thus humbled thus disgraced thus threatened thus in the last extremity and agony of terror they had discovered him thus disguised and in hiding at a tavern in wapping and were dragging him to the presence of the lord mayor it is a long distance from wapping to guildhall and they went but slowly because they were beset and surrounded by these wolves who howled to have his blood and all the way he shrieked and trembled for fear sure and certain is the vengeance of the lord this haman this unjust judge was thus suffering at the hands of the savage mob pangs far worse than those endured by the poor rustics whom he had delivered to the executioner i say worse because i have not only read but have myself proved that the rich and the learnedthose that is who live luxuriously and those who have power to imagine and to feel beforehanddo suffer far more in disease than the common ignorant folk the scholar dies of terror before ever he feels the surgeons knife while the rustic bares his limb insensible and callous however deep the cut or keen the pain i make no doubt therefore that the great lord chancellor while they haled him all the way from wapping to guildhall suffered as much as fifty ploughboys flogged at the carttail many thousands there were who desired revenge upon himi know not what revenge would satisfy the implacable because revenge can do no more than kill the body but his worst enemy should be satisfied with this his dreadful fate even barnaby who was sad because he could get no revenge on his own account he wanted a bloody battle with the rout of the kings armies and the pursuit of a flying enemy such as had happened at sedgemoor was satisfied with the justice which was done to that miserable man it is wonderful that he was not killed amidst so many threatening cudgels but his guards prevented that not from any love they bore him but quite the contrary more unforgiving faces one never saw for they intended to hand him over to the lord mayor and that he should be tried for all his cruelties and treacheries and perhaps experience himself that punishment of hanging and disembowelling which he had inflicted on so many ignorant and misled men how he was committed to the tower where he shortly died in the greatest torture of body as well as mind everybody knows chapter li the confession now am i come to the last event of this history and i have to write down the confession of my own share in that event for the othersfor alice and for robinthe thing must be considered as the crown and completion of all the mercies for mewhat is it but you shall hear when the secrets of all hearts are laid open then will alice hear it also what she will then say or what think i know not it was done for her sakefor her happiness have i laid this guilt upon my soul nay when the voice of conscience doth exhort me to repent and to confess my sin then there still ariseth within my soul as it were the strain of a joyful hymn a song of gratitude that i was enabled to return her to freedom and the arms of the man she loved if any learned doctor of divinity or any versed in that science which the romanists love they call it casuistry should happen to read this chapter of confession i pray that they consider my case even though it will then be useless as far as i myself am concerned seeing that i shall be gone before a judge who will i hope even though my earthly affections do not suffer me to separate my sin from the consequences which followed be more merciful than i have deserved while then i stood watching this signal example of gods wrath i was plucked gently by the sleeve and turning saw one whose countenance i knew not he was dressed as a lawyer but his gown was ragged and his bands yellow he looked sunk in poverty and his face was inflamed with those signs which proclaim aloud the habit of immoderate drinking sir he said if i mistake not you are dr humphrey challis the same sir at your service i replied with some misgivings and yet being one of the princes following there needed none i have seen you sir in the chambers of your cousin mr benjamin boscorel my brother learned in the law we drank together though i remember you still passed the bottle it is now four or five years ago i wonder not that you have forgotten me we change quickly we who are the jolly companions of the bottle we drink our noses red and we paint our cheeks purple nay we drink ourselves out of our last guinea and out of our very apparel what then sir a short life and a merry sir yonder is a sorry sight the first law officer of the crown thus to be haled along the streets by a howling mob ought such a thing to be suffered tis a sad and sorry sight i say sir i replied hotly ought such villains as judge jeffreys to be suffered to live he considered a little as one who is astonished and desires to collect his thoughts perhaps he had already taken more than a morning draught i remember now he said my memory is not so good as it was we drink that away as well yes i rememberi crave your forgiveness doctor you were yourself engaged with monmouth your cousin told me as much naturally you love not this good judge who yet did nothing but what the king his master ordered him to do i sir have often had the honour of sitting over a bottle with his lordship when his infirmities allowed though not yet old he is grievously afflicted he had no equal for a song or a jest and would drink so long as any were left to keep him company ha they have knocked him downnow they will kill him no he is again upon his feet those who protect him close in sothey have passed out of our sight doctor shall we crack a flask together i have no money unhappily but i will with pleasure drink at your expense i remembered the mans face now but not his name twas one of bens boon companions well if hard drinking brings men so speedily to rags and poverty even though it be a merry life which i doubt give me moderation pray sir i said coldly to have me excused i am no drinker then doctor you will perhaps lend me until we meet again a single guinea i foolishly complied with this request doctor i thank you he said will you now come and drink with me at my expense sir i say plainly you do not well to refuse a friendly glass i could tell you many things if you would but drink with me concerning my lord jeffreys there are things which would make you laugh come doctor i love not to drink alone your cousin now was always ready to drink with any man until he fell ill how is my cousin ill assuredly he is sick unto death yesterday i went to visit him thinking to drink a glass with him and perhaps to borrow a guinea or two but found him in bed and raving if you will drink with me doctor i can tell you many curious things about your cousin and now i remember you were sent to the plantations your cousin told me so you have returned before your time well the king hath run away you are doubtless safe your cousin hath gotten his grandfathers estate lord jeffreys who loved him mightily procured that grant for him when your cousin wakes at night he swears that he sees his grandfather by his bedside looking at him reproachfully so that he drinks the harder tis a merry life he hath also married a wife and she ran away from him at the church door and he now cannot hear of her or find her anywhere so that he curses her and drinks the harder oh tis always the jolliest dog they say that he is not the lawyer that he was and that his clients are leaving him all mine have left me long since come and drink with me doctor i broke away from the poor toper who had drunk up his wits as well as his money and hurried to my cousins chambers into which i had not thought to enter save as one who brings reproachesa useless burden benjamin was lying in bed an old crone sat by the fire nodding beside her was a bottle and she was i found half drunk her i quickly sent about her business no one else had been attending him yet he was laid low as i presently discovered with that kind of fever which is bred in the villainous air of our prisonsthe same fever which had carried off his grandfather perhaps if there were no foul and stinking wards jails and clinks this kind of fever would be banished altogether and be no more seen so if we could discover the origin and cause of all diseases we might once more restore man to his primitive condition which i take to have been one free from any kind of disease or infirmity designed at first by his creator so to live for ever and after the fall enabled when medicine shall be so far advanced to die of old age after such prolongation of life and strength as yet we cannot even understand cousin i said i am sorry to find thee lying in this condition ay he replied in a voice weak and low not like his old blustering tones curse me and upbraid me if thou wilt how art thou come hither is it the ghost of humphrey art thou dead like my grandfather are we on the plantations of barbadoes indeed i am no ghost benjamin as for curses i have none and as for reproaches i leave them to thy conscience humphrey i am sore afflicted i am now so low that i cannot even sit upright in my bed but thou art a doctorthou wilt bring me back to health i am already better only for seeing thee here i declare that as yet i had no thought no thought at all of what i was to do i was but a physician in presence of a sick man and therefore bound to help him if i could i asked him first certain questions as physicians use concerning his disorder and its symptoms i learned that after attending at the court he was attacked by fits of shivering and of great heat being hot and cold alternately and that in order to expel the fever he had sat drinking the whole eveninga most dangerous thing to do next that in the morning he had been unable to rise from his bed and being thirsty had drunk more winea thing enough of itself to kill a man in such a fever then he lost his head and could tell me no more what had happened until he saw me standing by his bedside in short he had been in delirium and was now in a lucid interval out of which he would presently fall awandering again and perhaps raving and so another lucid interval after which he would die unless something could be done for him i liked not his appearance nor the account which he gave me nor did i like his pulse nor the strange look in his eyesdeath doth often show his coming by such a prophetic terror of the eyes humphrey he said pitifully it was no fault of mine that thou wast sent to the plantations that i know full well cousin i answered him be easy on that score and as for alice he went on all is fair in love i made no reply because at this point a great temptation assailed my soul you have heard how i learned many secrets of the women while i was abroad now while we were in providence island i found a woman of the breed they call half castethat is half indian and half portugueseliving in what she called wedlock with an english sailor who did impart to me a great secret of her own people i obtained from her not only the knowledge of a most potent drug known already to the jesuits but also a goodly quantity of the drug itself this with certain other discoveries and observations of my own i was about to communicate to the college in warwick lane as for this drug i verily believe it is the most potent medicine ever yet discovered it is now some years since it was first brought over to europe by the jesuits and is therefore called pulvis jesuiticus and sometimes peruvian bark when administered at such a stage of the fever as had now been reached by my unhappy cousin it seldom fails to vivify the spirits and so to act upon the nerves as to restore the sinking and to call back to life a man almost moribund remembering this i lugged the packet out of my pocket and laid it on the table be of good cheer cousin i said i have a drug which is strong enough with the help of god to make a dying man sit up again courage then when i had said these words my temptation fell upon me it came in the guise of a voice which whispered in my ear should this man die it said there will be freedom for alice she can then marry the man she loves she will be restored to happiness while he lives she must still continue in misery being cut off from love let him die therefore humphrey said ben in this matter of alice if she will come to me i will make her happy but i know not where she is hidden things go ill with me since that unlucky day i would to god i had not done it nothing hath gone well since and i drink daily to hide her face yet at night she haunts mewith her father who threatens and her mother who weeps and my grandfather who reproaches humphreytell mewhat is it man what mean thy looks for while he spoke that other voice was in my ears also should he die alice will be happy again should he live she will continue in misery at these words which were but my own thoughts yet involuntary i felt so great a pity such an overwhelming love for alice that my spirit was wholly carried away to restore her freedom oh what price was too great for such a gift nayi was seized with the thought that to give her so great a thing even my own destruction would be a light price to pay never until that moment had i known how fondly and truly i loved her why if it were to be done over againbut this matters not i have to make my confession humphrey speak i suppose that my trouble showed itself in my face thou art married to alice i said slowly that cannot be denied so long as thou livest benjamin so long will she be robbed of everything that she desires so long will she be unhappy now if thou shouldst die die i cannot die i must live he tried to raise himself but he was too weak cousin save my life if thou shouldst die benjamin i went on regardless of his words she will be set free it is only by thy death that she can be set free say then to thyself i have done this poor woman so great an injury that nothing but my death can atone for it willingly therefore will i lay down my life hoping thus to atone for this abominable wickedness humphrey do not mock me give megive megive me speedily the drug of which you spoke i diei dieohgive me of thy drug then i took the packet containing the pulvis jesuiticus and threw it upon the fire where in a moment it was a little heap of ashes now benjamin i said i cannot help thee thou must surely die he shrieked he wept he implored me to do somethingsomething to keep him alive he began to curse and to swear no one can now save thee benjamin i told him not all the college of physicians not all the medicines in england thou must die listen and heed in a short time unless thy present weakness causeth thee to expire there will fall upon thee another fit of fever and delirium after which another interval of reason perhaps anotherbut yet thou must surely die prepare thy soul therefore is there any message for alice that thou wouldst send to her being now at the point of death his only answer was to curse and weep alternately then i knelt beside his bed and prayed aloud for him but incessantly he cried for help wearing himself out with prayers and curses benjamin i said when i had thus prayed a while but ineffectually i shall take to alice instead of these curses which avail nothing a prayer for pardon in order to touch her heart and cause her to think of thee with forgiveness as of one who repented at the end this i shall do for her sake i shall also tell thy father that thy death was repentant and shall take to him also a prayer for forgiveness as from thee this will lighten his sorrow and cause him to remember thee with the greater love and to robin too so that he may cease to call thee villain i will carry not these ravings but a humble prayer as from thyself for forgiveness this is my confession i who might have saved my cousin suffered him to die the sick man when he found that prayers or curses would not avail fell to moaning rolling his head from side to side when he was thus quiet i prayed again for him exhorting him to lift up his soul to his judge and assuring him of our full forgiveness but indeed i know not if he heard or understood it was then about four of the clock and growing dark i lit a candle and examined him again i think that he was now unconscious he seemed as if he slept i sat down and watched i think that at midnight or thereabouts i must have fallen asleep when i awoke the candle was out and the fire was out the room was in perfect darkness i laid my hand upon my cousins forehead he was cold and dead then i heard the voice of the watchman in the street past two oclock and a frosty morning the voice i had heard before whispered again in my ear alice is freealice is free thouthouthou alone hast set her free thou hast killed her husband i threw myself upon my knees and spent the rest of that long night in seeking for repentance but then as now the lamentation of a sinner is also mingled with the joy of thinking that alice was free at last and by none other hand than mine this i repeat is my confession i might have saved my cousin and i suffered him to die wherefore i have left the profession in which it was my ambition to distinguish myself and am no longer anything but a poor and obscure person living on the charity of my friends in a remote village two days afterwards i was sitting at the table looking through the dead mans papers when i heard a footstep on the stair it was barnaby who broke noisily into the room where is benjamin he cried where is that villain what do you want with him i want to kill him i am come to kill him look upon the bed barnaby i laid back the sheet and showed him the pale face of the dead man the hand of the lordor that of anotherhath already killed him art thou now content chapter the last in the decline of years when the sixtieth birthday is near at hand and one looks not to live much longer and the future hath no fresh joy to bring with it but only infirmities of age and pain it is profitable and pleasant to look back upon the past to observe the guidance of the unseen hand to repent ones sins and to live over again those seasons whether of sorrow or of joy which we now perceive to have been providentially ordered this have i done both in reading the history of our lives as related by my mistress and in writing this latter part to the former have i added nothing nor have i subtracted anything therefrom because i would not suffer the sweet and candid soul of her whom i have always loved to be tarnished by any words of mine breaking in upon her own as jarring notes in some lovely harmony it is strictly laid upon me to deliver her words just as she hath written them down now after the death of benjamin i took it upon myself being his cousin in the absence of his father to examine the papers which he had left among them i found abundance of songs chiefly in praise of wine and women with tavern bills also there were notes of legal cases very voluminous and i found notes of payment made to various persons engaged in inquiring after his wife in those towns of the west country where her fathers name would procure friends for her but there was no will benjamin had died never looking for so early an end without making any will therefore the estate of bradford orcas with the old house became the property of the rector benjamins father and he being moved to make reparation for his sons sin and out of the great love which he bore to alice conveyed the whole to robin on the day of his marriage thus the confiscated estate returned to the ancient family who had always held it and promise to hold it still so long as the good old stock shall last it is thirty years ago and more king william iii is dead queen anne is dead king george who cannot they say speak english but is a stout protestant sits upon our throne the nonconformists are free save that they cannot enter the universities and are subject to other disabilities which will doubtless be removed in the course of years but english people i think love power beyond all earthly things and so long as the church is in a majority the churchmen will exercise their power and will not part with it to us of bradford orcas it matters little we worship at the parish church every sunday i contemplate as i did fifty years ago the monument of filipa kneeling apart and of her husband and his second wife kneeling together there is a new tablet in the chancel put up to the memory of sir christopher and another to that of dr comfort eykin their bodies lie somewhere among the mounds on the north side of ilminster church forty years ago as you have seen there stood three boys in the garden of the manor house discoursing on their future one wished never to go anywhere but to remain always a country gentleman like his grandfather one would be a great lawyer a judge even the lord chancellor the third would be a great physician lo the end of all the first but after divers miseries perils and wanderings hath attained to his desire the second lies buried in the churchyard of st andrews holborn forgotten long since by his companions who indeed are now with him in the pit and remembered only among his own kin for the great wickedness which he wrought before the lord and as for the third and last no illustrious physician is he but one who lives obscure but content in a remote village in the very cottage where his mistress was born with books and music and the society of the sweetest woman who ever graced this earth for his solace she was always gracious she was gracious in her childhood gracious as a maiden more gracious still is she in these latter days when her hair is grey and her daughters stand about her tall and comely now had i administered that powderthat sovereign remedy the pulvis jesuiticuswhat would have been her lot humphrey said robin a penny for thy thoughts robin i was thinkingit is not a new thing but twenty years old and morethat cousin benjamin never did anything in his life so useful as to die ay poor benjamin that he had at the end the grace to ask our forgiveness and to repent hath in it something of a miracle we have long forgiven him but consider cousin we were saved from the fight we were saved from the sea we were saved from slavery we were enabled to strike the last blow for the protestant religionwhat were all these blessings worth if benjamin still lived to think humphrey that alice would never have been my wife and never a mother and all these children would have remained unborn i say that though we may not desire the death of a sinner we were not human if we rejoiced not at the death of our poor cousin yes that is the thought which will not suffer me to repent a single pinch of the pulvis jesuiticus and he might have been living unto this very day then would alice have lost the crowning blessing of a womans life yeti was it is true a physicianwhose duty it is to save life always to save life even the life of the wretched criminal who is afterwards to die upon the gallows yet again if he had been saved as i write these lines i see my mistress walking down the village street she looks over my gardengate she lifts the latchet and enters smiling gravely and tenderly a sober happiness sits upon her brow the terror of her first marriage has long been forgotten why as i watch her tranquil life busy with her household and her children full of the piety which asks not as her father was wont to ask how and where the mercy of heaven is limited and if indeed it will embrace all she loves as i mark the tender love of husband and of children which lies around her like a garment and prevents all her doings there comes back to me continually a bedroom in which a man lies dying again in memory again in intention i throw upon the fire that handful of pulvis jesuiticus which should have driven away his fever and restored him to health again a great and strong man he was who might have lived till eighty years where then would have been that love where those children where that tranquil heart and that contented mind i will not save his life i say again in my mind i will not save him he shall die humphrey my mistress says leave thy books awhile and walk with me the winter sun is warm upon the hills come it is the day when benjamin
