this story first appeared as a serial early in that on revision it was found desirable partly to rewrite certain chapters and to enlarge upon certain points the structure of the story the characters and the situations remain unaltered the question with which the story deals is not fully answered it is one of those questions which can never be answered from time to time every man must ask himself why the innocent must suffer and do suffer every day and in every generation for the follies and the sins of their forefathers every man must find his own answer or must acknowledge sorrowfully that he can find none i venture to offer in these pages an answer that satisfies myself it substitutes consequence for punishment and puts effect that follows cause in place of penalties and as i hope is made plain it seems to me that i have no less an authority for this view than the greatest of the prophets of israel the consequences of ancestral and paternal actions may be a blessing and a help or they may be a curse and a burden for generations in either case they are consequences which can only affect the body or the mind or the social position of the descendants they may make ambition impossible they may make action impossible they may keep a man down among the rank and file but they cannot do more the prophet defines and limits their power and the consequences whatever they are may be made a ladder for the soul to rise or a weight to drag it down in the pages which follow they are shown as to some a ladder but to others a way of descent w b united university club june the fourth generation chapter i a remote ancestor it was a morning of early march when a northeast wind ground together the dry branches on which as yet there were no signs of coming spring the sky was covered by a grey cloud of one even shade with no gleams of light or streak of blue or abatement or mitigation of the sombre hue the hedges showed as yet no flowers not even the celandine the earth had as yet assumed no early vernal softening there were no tender shoots dolefully the birds cowered on the branches or flew up into the ivy on the wall where they waited for a milder time with such patience as hunger only half appeased would allow those who lived upon berries and buds remembered with anxiety that they had already eaten up all the haws and stripped the currant bushes of all their buds and must now go further afield those who hunt the helpless chrysalis and the slug and the worm and the creeping creatures of the field reflected that in such weather it was impossible to turn over the hard earth in search of the former or to expect that the latter would leave their winter quarters on such a day at such a time which for all created things is far worse than any terrors offered by king frost the human creatures who go abroad wrap themselves in their warmest and hurry about their business in haste to finish it and get under shelter again the south front of the house looked down upon a broad terrace paved with red bricks a balustrade of brick ran along the edge of the terrace a short but nobly designed and dignified flight of stairs led into the garden which began with a broad lawn the house itself of the early eighteenth century was stately and spacious it consisted of two stories only it had narrow and very high windows above the firstfloor windows ran a row of small circular louvres set in the roof which was of a high pitch and of red tiles the chimneys were arranged in artistic groups or stacks the house had somewhat of a foreign appearance it was one of considerable pretension it was a house which wanted to be surrounded by ancient trees by noble gardens and stately lawns and to be always kept deep in the country far away from town houses and streets in the surroundings of a city apart from gardens lawns park and lordly trees it would have been out of place and incongruous the warm red brick of which it was built had long since mellowed with age yellow lichen clung to the walls here and there over one wing that of the west ivy grew covering the whole of that end of the house the gardens were more stately than the house itself they began with a most noble lawn on one side grew two cedars of lebanon sweeping the bare earth with their drooping branches on the other side rose three glorious walnuttrees the space between was a bowlinggreen on which no flowerbeds had ever been permitted beyond the bowlinggreen however were flowerbeds in plenty there were also boxtrees cut into the oldfashioned shapes which one only sees in oldfashioned gardens beyond these was a narrow plantation of shrubs mostly evergreen then stretched out in order the ample kitchengardens the crowded orchard and the glass here also were ranged the beehives in a row for the owners of the house were beemasters as well as gardeners the whole was stately one was filled with admiration and respect for so noble a house so richly set only by walking along the road outside the park and gazing upon the house from a distance there were however certain bounds imposed upon the admiration and respect of the visitor these were called for in fact by the gardens and the lawns and the glass as they must have been in the past as for the garden of the present it was difficult even to guess when the hand of man the spade of the gardener had last touched any part of the place everything was overgrown weeds covered the ground which had once been beds of asparagus and celery the strawberry plants fought for existence with thistles and maintained it by the sacrifice of fruit couch grass and those thistles with shepherdspurse and all the weeds of the field covered and concealed the flowerbeds the lanes and walks were covered ways long since rendered impassable by reason of branches that had shot across them the artificial shapes of the boxtrees formerly so trim and precise showed cloudy and mysterious through the branches which had grown up outside them the bowlinggreen was covered with coarse grass never mown from year to year in the glass houses the doors stood open the glass was broken the vines grew wild pushing their way through the broken panes there could be no respect possible for a garden in such a condition yet the pity of it the pity of it so fine a place as it had been as it might again become if gardeners were once more ordered to restore it to its ancient splendours if one turned from the garden and walked towards the house he would notice first that the stairs of brick leading to the terrace were a good deal battered and broken that many bricks had been displaced that weeds grew between the bricks that in the balustrade there were places where the square brick pillars were broken away that if he mounted the stairs the brick pavement of the terrace showed holes and damaged places here and there that if he looked at the house itself he would discern there as well as in the garden a certain air of neglect and decay the windowframes wanted painting the door wanted painting there were no curtains or blinds visible anywhere one or two panes of glass were broken and not even patched stately even in decay were house and gardens but the spectator shivered as one shivers at the sight of age and decay and death hovering over what should still be rejoicing in the strength of manhood on this morning when the cold of winter ushered in the deceitful spring a man was walking to and fro on the brick terrace he was a man very far advanced in life cold as he was he wore no overcoat he had no wrapper or handkerchief round his neck he wore no gloves when one looked more closely he was not only advanced in years he was full of yearsoverfull running over his great age was apparent in the innumerable lines of his face not in the loss of his hair for his abundant white locks fell flowing uncut and untrimmed upon his shoulders while a full white beard lay over his ample chest his age was shown by the heightening of the cheekbones and the increased prominence of the nose in the sunken mouth and the thin lips and the deepset eyes but though his face had been roughly handled by time his frame seemed to have escaped any touch old as he was he bore himself upright still he walked with a firm if not an elastic step he carried a stick but did not use it he was still six feet four or even more in stature his shoulders were still broad his back was not curved nor was his huge strong body bowed nor were his strong legs bent or weakened nothing could be more anomalous than the difference between the mans face chipped and lined and covered with curves and diagrams like an ordnance survey map and his figure still so strong so erect so vigorous he walked from one end of the terrace to the other rapidly and so to speak resolutely then he turned and walked back he look neither to one side nor to the other he was absorbed in some kind of meditation for his face was set it was a stern face naturally the subject of his thoughts made it perhaps still harder and more stern he wore a kind of shootingjacket a broadbrimmed felt hat stout boots fit for the fields and leggings as if he were going to take out his gun and he carried his stick as if it had been a gun a masterful manthat was apparent at the outset aggressivethat was also apparent at the moment defiantof what of whom evidently a man built originally as a fighting man endowed with great courage and enormous strength probably also with a quick temper retaining still the courage though some of the strength had gone and the fighting temperament though his fighting days were done there was no sound about the placeno clatter of servants over their work no footsteps in the house or outside it no trampling of horses from the stables or sight of gardeners working quietly among the forlorn flowerbeds all was silent and the cold wind whistled and the old man without the common protection from the wintry wind walked methodically and rapidly from east to west and from west to east so he went on all the morning hour after hour untiring over this meaningless exercise he began it at nine and at halfpast twelve he was still marching in this aimless manner turning neither to the right nor to the left and preserving unchanged that fixed expression which might have meant patiencea very old man has to be patientor it might have been as i have called it defiance a man who has known misfortunes sometimes acquires this expression of defiance as one who bids fortune do her very worst and when she can do no more still repeats with courage come what may in the distance half a mile or so away was a clock in a churchtower if one listened from the garden one might hear the striking of the hours without waiting for it and expecting it one would not hear the clock at all a melodious clock at a distance falls in with the general whisper of the atmosphere we call it silence but indeed there is no such thing in nature silence would drive us mad in the country we hear a gentle whisper tuneful and soothing and we say it is the sweet silence of the country but it is notit is the blend of all the country sounds the morning dragged on slowly the beat of the old mans footstep on the terrace was as regular as the ticking of a clock neither in his carriage nor in his pace nor in his face was there the least change he walked like a machine and his face was as expressionless as any face of idol or of an image it was about eleven oclock that another step might have been heard the step of a man on dry branches and among dead leaves the old man on the terrace paid no attention he made as if he heard nothing when the figure of a rustic emerged from the orchard and stood under the walnuttrees the old man of the terrace made as if he saw nothing the rustic was also well advanced in age though far short of the tale of years which belonged to the other he was dressed as one who goes afield he walked as one who has spent his life in the ridges and furrows of the ploughed field he carried a spade over his shoulder standing under the walnuttrees he lowered his spade and laid his hands upon the handle as if to support himself and then he gazed upon the old man of the terrace he did not after the wont of some men pretend to be at work and cast a furtive glance of curiosity on the contrary he made no pretence at all he leaned upon his spade and he gazed boldly and without any shame he marked the steady and firm step of the man his own step was not half so firm or half so steady he marked the bearing of the man his own back was bent and his shoulders lowered he marked the health and strength that still lay in his face his own cheeks were wrinkled and his eyes were dim presently he lifted his spade to his shoulder and he turned away if i go first he said whether he came or whether he departed whether he walked in silence over the coarse grass or snapped the twigs and rustled the dead leaves the old man of the terrace took no notice he neither saw nor heard anything then the east wind continued dry and cold and the birds chirped in discomfort and the branches in the orchard fell to grinding each other and the old man walked on and the quarters struck from the churchtower somewhere not far off at the open door of the house at about halfpast twelve there appeared a young man dressed warmly as was due to the weather he was tallover six feet in height his face resembled that of the old man strikingly he was certainly some close relation he stood at the door looking on while that walk as dismal as monotonous as purposeless as that of prisoners in their yard went on minute after minute hour after hour he stood there not hour after hour but for a full halfhour watching and wondering always and every dayand for all these yearsto give words to his thoughts why this tramp day by day every morning always alone always silent seeing and not seeing dead to outward things apart from the world taking no interest in the world no recluse in a vault could be more lonely no occupation nothing to do nothing to think about good heavens what does he think about no books no newspapers to read no letters to write why the young man was the greatgrandson of this ancient person he was not only the greatgrandson but the heir to the house and the estates which belonged to the house next to this old man he was the head of the family he therefore as a mark of respect and a matter of duty ran down from london occasionally to see that his ancestor was properly cared for and in health he was also in communication with the solicitors who managed the property it was a very curious case from childhood the young man had been told of the strange and eccentric greatgrandfather he lived alone he had no other servant than a woman with her daughter he only saw them when they brought his meals he received no visitors he never went out of the house except to walk every morning whatever the weather for four hours up and down the terrace he never spoke even to his housekeeper if anyone spoke to him he made no reply he never read anythingneither book nor paper his affairs were in the hands of a firm of solicitors in the neighbouring markettown when they wanted his signature to a cheque they drew it and sent it in to him when he signed and returned it when they consulted him concerning business he received their statements in writing and replied with the greatest brevity there was no sign of mental derangement so far as the solicitors the only persons who were able to speak on the subject understood the mans faculties were perfectly sound and his intellect as clear as ever moreover there was no sign upon him of any hallucination any melancholia any mental trouble if he maintained silence his face betrayed no perturbation day after day he presented to the morning sun a calm and cloudless face if he smiled not neither did he sigh now the most remarkable thing was that this eccentricity which might have been explained on the theory of great age and the loss of all his friends and contemporaries had been practised for nearly seventy years as a young man quite a young man he began this life and he had continued it ever since the reason his greatgrandson had always understood was the shock caused by the sudden death of his wife further than this he neither knew nor did he inquire if one grows up in presence of a certain strange line of conduct it becomes accepted without inquiry the old man had become a solitary when this young mans grandfather was a boy his grandfather his father and he himself had always had before them the knowledge if not the sight of this eccentricity there was no curiosity in his mind at all about the possible cause seventy years it is the whole life of the average man and this strange creature had spent the whole time alone in silence in solitude and without occupation it was not the whole span of the mans own life for he was now completing his ninetyfourth year from the distant churchtower came presently the striking of the quarters followed by the stroke of one at that moment an old woman came out she passed in front of the visitor in the doorway and stood watching to catch the eye of the master she said nothing but waited there until he noticed her presence perhaps he was expecting her he stopped the old woman retired her master entered the house taking no notice whatever of the young man as he passed him his eyes looked through him with no gleam of recognition or even of intelligence as to his presence yet this young man the only one of all his descendants paid him a visit once a month or so to see if he was still in health he walked straight into the room which was the single sittingroom and diningroom and livingroom it had been the librarya large room with a north aspect lofty and at all times of the year rather dark and cold a good fire burned in the broad oldfashioned grate before the fire was a small tableit had formerly stood in the window for a reading or writing table now it served as a table set there for the old mans meals the cloth was in fact spread and the early dinner laid upon ita plain dinner of steak potatoes and a bottle of port which is a beverage proper to old age it warms and comforts it pleases and exhilarates it imparts a sense of strength and when the common forms of food can no longer be taken this generous drink supplies their place the walls were lined with shelves which were filled with books evidently some former member of the family had been a scholar and a bibliophile the books were all bound in leather the gilt of the titles had mostly disappeared if you took a volume from the shelf you found that it had parted from the binding if not it took advantage of the movement to remove itself from the binding if you examined the shelves long enough you would have found that there was not one book in the whole library of a date later than of all the thousands upon thousands of books published in the seventy years since that time not one was in this library for instance the quarterly and edinburgh reviewsthey stood here bound they stopped at the annual register was here also bound it stopped at and on this great library table there were lying as if for daily use scattered volumes and magazines which had been placed there for the reading of the house in no one had touched the table since some time in that year a long low leather chair stood beside the firethe leather was in rags and tatters worn to shreds at the table was placed a splendid great wooden chair which looked like the chair of a hallporter the carpet was in rags and tatters except the part along the front of the shelves there it was whole but its colour was faded in front of the fire was placed a common thick sheepskin the young man followed his ancestor into the library he took a chair placed it by the fire and sat down his long legs curled watching and waiting he had been in the same place before the silence of the old man the meaningless look in his eyes terrified him on the first occasion he was then unaccustomed to the manner of the man he had gradually grown accustomed to the sight it no longer terrified him and he now sat in his place on the other side of the fire resolved upon making sure that the old man was properly cared for properly fed properly clad properly looked after in all respects that his health was good and that there was no need of seeking advice he sat down therefore by the fire and looked on while the old man took his dinner the visitor i have said was the greatgrandson of the recluse he was also the heir of his house and the future owner of the place and its possessions as for what he was by calling you shall hear presently being the heirpresumptive he assumed the duty of making these occasional visits which were receivedas has been statedin silence and with not the slightest show of recognition without heeding his presence then the old man took his seat at the table lifted the cover and began his dinner it consisted every day of the same dish perhaps there are not many men at ninetyfour who can devour every day a fullsized steak with potatoes and bread and can drink with it a whole bottle of port yet this is what the recluse did the descendant for his part made it his business that the port should be of the best and that the steak should be treated scientifically in order to ensure its tenderness and juiciness the recluse took his food fast and eagerly one could perceive that in earlier days he must have enjoyed a great and noble power of putting away beef he took his steak with fierceness he devoured an immense quantity of bread he drank his wine off in goblets as in the old days he had tossed off the great glasses of beer he did not sip the generous wine nor did he roll it about in his glass and hold it up to the light he drank it as a child drinks water unconsciously and yet eagerly regardless of the taste and careless of its qualities when the bottle was empty and there was nothing more to eat he left the wooden chair and cast his great length into the long easychair where he stretched out his legs towards the fire and leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow on the arm of the chair he gazed into the fire but with eyes which had in them no kind of expression evidently thought the spectator the old man has two senses left he likes strong meat and drink he likes the physical comfort that they provide and he likes the warmth of a fire then he rose slowly and stood with his back to the fire looking down upon his ancestor and began a remonstrance which he repeated with variations on every visit sir he said i come to see you from time to time as you know i come to make sure that you are cared for and that you are well i come to see if anything can be done for you on these occasions you never fail to pretend that you do not see me you make believe that i am not present you do see me you know i am here you know who i am you know why i am here very well it is i suppose your humour to affect silence and solitude nothing that i can say will i fear induce you to break this silence there was no sign of recognition no reply nor any change of movement why you have imposed upon yourself this lifelong misery i do not know nor shall i inquire perhaps i shall never know it seems to me a great mistake whatever the causea sudden bereavement i have always understood if it was in consequence of another persons fault or another persons misfortune the waste and wreck of your own life would not remove the cause and if it was any fault of your own such a wreck and waste of life would only be an aggravation of the offence but if it was bereavement surely it would be the manlier part to bear it and to go on with the duties of life however as i do not know all the circumstances i have no right to speak on this point it is too late he went on to make up for all the years you have thrown away but is it too late for a change can you not even now at this late hour go back among your fellowcreatures and become human again if it is only for a year or two i should say it was harder to continue this life of loneliness and misery than to go back to the life for which you were born there was no answer i have been over the house this morning the young man went on pitilessly you have allowed it to fall into a shameful condition the damp has got into pictures and wallpaper it will need many thousands to restore the place to a condition proper to a gentlemans house dont you think you ought to spend that money and live in it as a gentleman of your position ought to do there was still no answer but then the heir expected none the old man lifted his head from his hand and dropped it back on the chair his eyes closed his hands dropped his breathing was soft and regular he was asleep his greatgrandson still stood over him this kind of scene affected him but little because it occurred on every visit he arrived at eleven or so he walked across the park he saw the old man doing his morning tramp as usual he spent an hour going over the empty desolate house he watched the old man taking his walk he followed him into the library he watched him taking his food he stood over him afterwards and addressed his remonstrances this was always received as george the third used to receive the remonstrances of the city of london in silence discouraging and always in the midst of the remonstrance the patriarch fell asleep the young man waited awhile watching his greatgrandfather of ninetyfour there is very little resemblance between a man of that age and himself at twentysix yet there may be some and no one could look upon that old man without becoming conscious that in early manhood he must have been of singular and wonderful comelinessfull of strength and vigour of fine proportions of noble stature and of remarkable face and head all these things the descendant possessed as well but in less marked degree with more refinement perhaps the refinement of scholarship and culture but with less strength he had done what he came to do he had delivered his message it was a failure he expected nothing less he might as well go there was nothing more to do or to be obtained by staying but then a very remarkable event happened he heard for the first time the voice of his greatgrandfather he was to hear it once more and only once more no one except himself on this occasion had heard it for nearly seventy years the patriarch moved in his sleep his fingers twitched his legs jerked he rolled his head then he sat up and clutched the arms of his chair his face became twisted and distorted as if under the possession of some evil spirit he half rose to his feet still holding to the arms of the chair and he spoke his voice was rough and harsh as if rusted with long disuse his eyes remained fixed yet his attitude was that of someone whom he sawwith whom he was conversing what he said was this that will end it then he sank back the distortion went out of him he laid his head upon the chair calm and peace as of a child returned to his face he was again asleepif he had been awake a dream said the looker on but he remembered the words which came back to him and remained with himwhy he could not tell he looked about the room he thought of the strange solitary meaningless life the monotonous life the useless life that this patriarch had lived for so many years seventy long years this recluse during the whole of that timefor seventy long yearshad never got outside the walls of his garden he had seen none of his old friends only his greatgrandson might from time to time visit the place to ascertain if he were still living he had done no kind of work during that long time he had not even put a spade into the ground he had never opened a book or seen a newspaper he knew nothing that had happened why for him the world was still the world before the reform act there were no railways there were no telegraphwires none of the inventions and improvements and new ideas and new customs were known to him or suspected by him he asked for nothing he cared for nothing he took interest in nothing he never spoke oh the wretchedness of it the folly of it what excuse could there bewhat reasonsufficient for this throwing away of a life in which so much might have been done what defence could a man have for thus deserting from the army of humanity as long as this young man remembered anything he had heard of this old man it was always the same story there was a kind of family bogie who wore always the same clothes and took the same walk every morning and slept every afternoon sometimes his mother would tell him when he was a boy scraps of history about the recluse long ago in the reign of george the fourth the gloomy solitary was a handsome spirited popular young man fond of hunting fond of shooting and fishing and all outdoor sports yet not a boor or a barbarian one who had passed through the university with credit and had learning and cultivation he had a fine library which he used he enjoyed conversations with scholars he had travelled on the continent a thing which then was rare he was thinking of entering the house he had a fine though not a large estate and a lovely house and stately gardens no one in the county had greater reason to be satisfied with his lot no one had a clearer right to look forward to the future with confidence than mr algernon campaigne the boy remembered all this talk he now contemplated the sleeping figure with a curious blend or mixture of emotions there was pity in the blend there was contempt in it there was something of the respect or reverence due to an ancestor one does not often get the chance of paying respect to so remote an ancestor as a greatgrandfather the ancestor lay back in his chair his head turned a little on one side his face perfectly calm had something of the transparent waxen look that belongs to the newly dead the young man went on thinking of what he had heard of this old man who was at once the pride and the shame of the family no one can help being proud of having a recluse an anchorite in the familyit is uncommon like an early shakespeare moreover the recluse was the head of the family and lived in the place where the family had always lived from time beyond the memory of man he remembered his mother a sadfaced widow and his grandmother another sadfaced widow a certain day came back to himit was a few weeks after his fathers early death when he was a child of sevenwhen the two women sat together in sorrow and wept together and conversed in his presencebut the child could not understandand said things which he recalled at this moment for the first time my dear said the elder lady we are a family of misfortune but whywhywhy asked the other what have we done the elder lady shook her head things are done she said that are never suspected nobody knows nobody finds out but the arm of the lord is stretched out and vengeance falls if not upon the guilty then upon his children and his grandchildren unto the third and fourth generation it has fallen heavily upon that old manfor the sins of his father perhapsand upon usand upon the children the helpless innocent children oh it is cruel we have scripture for it these wordsthis conversationcame back suddenly and unexpectedly to the young man he had never remembered them before who did what he asked the guilty person cannot be this venerable patriarch because this affliction has fallen upon him and still abides with him after seventy years but they spoke of something else why do these old words come back to me ancestor sleep on in the hall he saw the old housekeeper and stopped to ask her after the master he spoke just now he said spoke sir spoke the master spoke he sat up in his sleep and spoke what in the name o mercy did he say he said quite clearly that will end it say it again he said it again sir she said i dont know what he means its most time to end it master leonard something dreadful will happen it is the first time for seventy years that he have spoken one single word it was in his sleep the first time for seventy years something dreadful for sure is going to happen chapter ii what he wanted in the lightest and sunniest rooms of an unpretending flat forming part of the bendor mansions westminster sat a young man of sixandtwenty you have already seen him when he called upon his irresponsive ancestor at the family seat in the shire of buckingham he was now in his study and seated at what used to be called his desk this simple piece of the scholars furniture has long since given way to a table as big as the dimensions of the room permitin this case one of eight feet long and five broad it did not seem to be any too large for the object of its construction because it was completely covered with books papers bluebooks french and german journals as well as transactions of english learned and scientific societies there was no confusion the papers were lying in orderly arrangement the books stood upright along the back of the table facing the writer they were all books of political history political economy or of reference a revolving bookcase stood ready at hand filled with other books of reference these it might have been observed were principally concerned with statistics of tradehistories of trade books on subjects connected with trade free trade protection the expansion of trade and points connected with manufactures industries exports and imports mr leonard campaigne was already in the house it would be too much to say that he had already arrived at a position of authority but he was so far advanced that on certain subjects of the more abstruse kind which he endeavoured to make his own and to speak upon them with the manner of a specialist he was heard with some deference and reported at some length more than this is not permitted to sixandtwenty these subjects were such as demand a clear head untiring industry the grasp of figures and the power of making them attractive they also required a prodigious memory all these valuable qualities this young man possessed at cambridge where he went out in mathematics he tore himself reluctantly away from examiners who gave him all they could with tears that it could be no more than part ii division i class i and wept that they could not as all good examiners hope to do before long carry their examinations on to part iii divided into three parts and each part into three classes and then to part iv also divided into three divisions and each division into three classes and so to go on examining their candidates always decreasing in number once a year for the rest of their natural lives ending with a disgraceful pluck at eighty part ii division i class i no one can do better than that i believe that only one man in leonards year did as well therefore he went down having a very good record and a solid reputation for ability to begin with as to private fortune he was independent with an income derived from his mother of about a year and with those expectations which as you have seen were certainties he also had a fellowship worth at least five shillings a year it having gone up recently in consequence of an unexpected lookingup or recovery in the agricultural interest he came up to london therefore thus adequately equipped entered at the bar got called without any intention of practising looked out for a borough nursed it carefully for a twelvemonth and got in without a contest at a byelection on the liberal side so far he had followed the traditions of his family he was the third in sequence of father to son of university distinction his grandfather son of the dumb recluse whom you have already seen had also done well at cambridge and had also entered the house and had also made a highly successful beginning when he was cut off prematurely at the early age of thirtytwo his father who in his turn distinguished himself at the university also in his turn entered the house and was also in his turn considered a young man of promise when he too was carried off at about the same age there were moments when leonard asked himself whether this untoward fate was to be his as well there were indeed special reasons for asking this question of which he as yet knew nothing meantime he asked no questions of the future nor did he concern himself about the decrees of fate the study was pleasantly furnished with two or three easy chairs and the students wooden chair books lined the walls two or three cups stood on the mantelshelf showing that the tenant of the room was no pale student consumer of the midnight oil above it there was a drawing of a country house the same house which you have already seen one observed also with pleasure further proofs that the occupant had his hours of relaxation tobacco and that vulgar thing the briarroot were conspicuously present that a young man who hoped to rise by the most severe of all studies should habitually smoke a pipe should be to any wellregulated mind a most promising circumstance the study opened into the diningroom which was a diningroom only and a formal even a funereal place with a few books and a few picturesevidently not a room which was inhabited the tenant took his breakfast in it and sometimes his luncheon and that was all there were two bedrooms beyond them the kitchen and the room for the man and wife who did for mr campaigne the occupant of the flat presently laid down his pen and sat up turning his face to the light then he rose and paced the chamber he was a young man of somewhat remarkable appearance in stature as you have seen he was much above the average being at least six feet two and of strong build though not so massive a man as his greatgrandfather the hermit of campaigne park his features were good and strongly marked his forehead was broad rather than high his eyes small rather than large were keen and bright the eyebrows were nearly straight his appearance at this moment was meditative but then he was actually meditating in conversation and in debate his expression was alert and even eager he did not in fact belong to that school which admires nothing desires nothing and believes in nothing he believed strongly for instance that the general standard of happiness could be raised by wise lawsnot necessarily new lawsand by good educationnot necessarily that of the school boards and he ardently desired to play his part in the improvement of that standard that is a good solid lump of belief to begin with for a statesman such a solid lump of belief is invaluable presently he sat down again and renewed the thread of his investigations after an hour or so he threw aside his pen he had accomplished what he had proposed to do that morning if a man is going to succeed you will generally find that he knows what he means to do and the time that he will take over it and that he sets to work with directness as well as resolution the task was finished then and before twelve oclock leonard pushed back his chair and sprang to his feet with a sigh of relief much as men may love work it is always a satisfaction to get it done on the table beside his papers lay a little pile of letters not yet opened he took up one and opened it the letter was from the editor of a leading magazine accepting a proposal to contribute a paper on a certain economic theory leonard smiled with satisfaction the nineteenth century is the ladder of ambition it is by means of this magazine and of one or two like unto it that the ambitious young man is enabled to put himself forward as a student if not yet an authority on any subjecta more rapid way of advance than by means of the house leonard had already written on this subject and with success as a student he was now to write upon it with authority you will understand from all this that leonard was a young man whose mind was fully occupied even absorbed with work which was at once his greatest delight and the ladder for his ambitions that he occupied a good position in society and that his work his thoughts his relaxations were those of one who lived and moved habitually on a high level free from meanness or sordid cares or anxieties of any kind on the same staircase and the same floor was a flat exactly corresponding in every particular to his own except that the windows looked out towards the opposite pole this flat into which we will not penetrate was occupied by a young lady who lived in it just as leonard lived in his with a man and his wife to look after her people may be neighbours in a mansion and yet not know each other it is not likely that leonard would have made the acquaintance of miss constance ambry but for the fortunate circumstance that he belonged to the same club as well as the same collection of flats that he was introduced to her at the club that he met her at dinner day after day that he speedily discovered the fact that they were neighbours that they became friends that they often dined together at the club and that they frequently walked home together it will be understood therefore that miss constance ambry would have been called a few years ago an emancipated young woman the word has already become belated in a year or two it will be obsolete emancipation has ceased to carry any reproach or to excite any astonishment many girls and unmarried women live alone in flats and mansions and similar places they have their latchkey they marvel that there could have been formerly a time when the latchkey was withheld from girls they go where they like they see what they wish to see they meet people they wish to meet the emancipated woman twenty years ago thought it necessary in order to prove her superiority of intellect to become at least an atheist that was part of the situation other prancings and curvettings there were now she has settled down the question of comparative intellect being no longer discussed and goes on in many respects almost as if she were still in the ancient house of bondage in this case there were strong reasons comfortably running into a good many hundreds a year why constance ambry should dare to go her own way and live at her own will she began her independent career by three years at girton during her studentship she distinguished herself especially by writing critical essays in which it was remarked that the passion of love as depicted and dwelt upon by poets was entirely ignored by the critic not so much her friends explained from maidenly reserve as from a complete inability to sympathize even with the womans point of viewwhich indeed women who write poetry and lovesongs have always done their utmost to conceal or mendaciously to represent in the same terms and under the same form as the masculine passion on leaving girton she accepted a post as lecturer on english literature in a womens college it was a poorlypaid office and hitherto it had been difficult to find a good lecturer to keep it constance could afford not only to take it but also to make it the sole object of her work and thoughts one is pleased to add that her ideas of the liberty of women included their liberty to dress as well as they can afford she presented to her admiring and envious class the constant spectacle of a woman dressed as she should benot splendidly but beautifully the girls regarded their lecturer clad like a summer garden in varied beauty with far greater awe than they had entertained for her predecessor who was dumpy wore her hair short and appeared habitually in a mans jacket the two were friends close and fast leonard was not afraid of compromising her by taking tea in her drawingroom nor was constance afraid of compromising herself by venturing alone into the opposite flat if she wanted to talk about anything it is a dangerous position even for a young man whose ambitions absorb his thoughts who has put the question of marriage into the backgroundto be taken up at some convenient moment not yet arrived it is dangerous also for a girl even when she is emancipated as regards the young man the usual consequences happened first he perceived that it gave him a peculiar pleasure to sit beside her at dinner and to walk home with her then he became disappointed if he did not meet her presently he found himself thinking a great deal about her he also detected himself in the act of confiding his ambitions to her sympathetic earthis is one of the worst symptoms possible he had now arrived at that stage when the image of the girl is always present in a young mans mind when it sometimes interferes with work when an explanation becomes absolutely necessary if there is to be any peace or quiet work the victorian lover no longer speaks or writes about flames and darts but he is still possessed and held by the dominant presence in his mind night and day of his mistress in these matters there comes a time the one moment when words have to be spoken as with a pear which has half an hour of perfect ripeness so in love there is a dayan houra momentwhen the words that mean so much must be spoken it is a most unfortunate thing if the lover chooses the wrong moment it is also very unfortunate if the ripeness is on one side only leonard campaigne made this mistake being a selfcontained young man he thought about himself a great deal more than he thought of other people it is not necessarily a sign of selfishness or of obtusenessnot at all it is a defect with men of strong natures and ambitious aims to think habitually about themselves and their aims therefore while he himself was quite ripe for a declaration he did not ask himself whether the ripeness was also arrived at by the other person concerned unfortunately it was not the other person concerned was still in the critical stage she could consider her friend from the outside she felt as yet no attraction towards the uncritical condition the absorption of love leonard did not suspect this arrest so to speak of development he assumed that the maidens heart had advanced pari passu with his he wrote a letter therefore a method of wooing which is less embarrassing than that of speechi believe that girls prefer the latter certainly it is difficult to be glowing in a letter nor if there should be any doubt is a letter so persuasive as the voice aided by the pressure of the hand and the ardour of the eye my dear friend i am about to imperil a situation the preservation of which is my greatest happiness you have allowed me to talk to you freely about my cherished ambitions you have even done me the honour of consulting me about your own i would not throw away this position of confidence for any consideration whatever let me however venture to put before you a simple question i ask you to consider the possibility of a change in this situation this changethere is only one which we can considerwould not in any way affect this confidence but should draw it more closely how it would affect me i will tell you if you allow me your friend l c not a loverlike letter at all is it yet there were possibilities about it you see he held out the hope that more would be told the young lady answered by asking a few days for consideration she was to send or bring her reply that morning constance knocked at the door she came in from her rooms without a hat she took a chairleonards own wooden chairand sat down beginning to talk about other things as if such a matter as a proposal of marriage was of no importance but that was only her way which was always feminine i was told last night she said at the clubfancy at the clubthat i have been compromising myself by dining night after night with you and letting you walk home with me that is their idea of womans liberty she is not to form friendships dont abuse our members pray remember leonard that i do not in the least mind what they say at the first glance at her face one could understand that this girl was not in the least alarmed as to what women might say of her it was a proud face there are many kinds of prideshe might have been proud of her family had she chosen that form or of her intellect and attainments or of her beautywhich was remarkable she was not proud in any such way she had that intense selfrespect which is pride of the highest kind she was a woman therefore to be wooed but the wooer must meet and equal that intense selfrespect this pride made her seem cold everybody thought her intensely cold leonard was perhaps the only man who knew by a thousand little indications that she was very far from cold the pose of her head the lines of the mouth the intellectual look in her eyes the clearcut regularity of her features proclaimed her pride and seemed to proclaim her coldness i always remember what you say constance and now tell me what you came to say she rose from the chair and remained standing she began by looking at the things over the mantel as if she was greatly interested in tobacco and cigarettes then she turned upon him abruptly joining her hands what i came to say was this he read the answer in her face which was frank hard and without the least sign of embarrassment confusion or weakening it is not with such a look that a girl gives herself to her lover however he pretended not to understand what is it well it is just this i have thought about it for a whole week and it wont do that is my answer it wont do for either of us i like you very much i like our present relations we dine together at the club i come in here without fuss you come to my place without fuss we talk and walk and go about together i do not suppose that i shall ever receive this kind of invitation from any man whom i regard so much and yet yet why this obstructive participle i bring youbut he spoke with coldness due to the discouragement in the maidens facethe fullest worship of yourself she shook her head and put up her hand oh nono she said worship i want no worship what do you mean by worship i mean the greatest respectthe greatest reverencethe greatest admiration for what for constance ambry thank you my friend some of the respect i accept with gratitude not all of it still i dare say at this moment you mean it all but consider a little do you worship my intellect confess now you know that it is distinctly inferior to your own i know it i say if you came to me pretending to worship an intellect inferior to your own i should lose my respect for you or i should lose my faith in your truthfulness it cannot be my intellect is it then worship of my genius but i have no genius and that you know very well is it worship of my attainments they are far below most of the scholars of your university and the fellows of your college you cannot possibly pretend to worship my attainments let me worship constance ambry herself she laughed lightly it would be very foolish of you to do so for you could not do so without lowering your standards and your character by pretending what is not the case for i am no higher than yourself in any of the virtues possible to us both not a bit higher i believe that my standards of everythingtruth honour couragepatienceallalleverything are like my intellect distinctly lower than your own such is the respect which i entertain for you therefore my friend do not pray think of offering me worship you wrong yourself constance your nature is far higher than mine she laughed again if i were to marry you in a week you would find out your mistakeand then you might fall into the opposite mistake how am i to make you understand i do understand there is something that attracts you men are so i suppose it is face or voice or figure or manner no one can tell why a man is attracted constance is it possible that you are not conscious of your beauty she looked him full in the face and replied slowly i wish i understood things i see very well that men are more easily moved to love than women they make the most appalling mistakes i know of somemistakes not to be remedied do not let us two make a mistake it would be no mistake believe me i dont know there is the question of beauty women are not fascinated by the beauty of other women a man is attracted by a face and straightway attributes to the soul behind that face all the virtues possible women can behold a pretty face without believing that it is the stamp of purity and holiness besidesa face why in a dozen years what will it be like and in thirty years oh terrible to think of never constance you could never be otherwise than wholly beautiful she shook her head again unconvinced i do not wish to be worshipped she repeated other women may like it to me it would be a humiliation i dont want worship i want rivalry let me work among those who truly work and win my own place as for my own face and those socalled feminine attractions i confess that i am not interested in them not in the least if you will only let me go on admiring oh she shook that admirable head impatiently as much as you please leonard sighed persuasion he knew well was of no use with this young lady she knew her own mind i will ask no more he said your heart is capable of every emotionexcept one you are deficient in the one passion which if you had it would make you divine she laughed scornfully make me divine she repeated oh you talk like a mannot a scholar and a philosopher but a mere man she left the personal side of the question and began to treat it generally the whole of poetry is disfigured with the sham divinity the counterfeit divinity of the woman i do not want that kind of ascribed divinity therefore i do not regret the absence of this emotion which you so much desire i can very well do without it she spoke with conviction and she looked the part she playedcold loveless without a touch of venus i was lecturing my class the other day on this very subject i took herrick for my text but indeed there are plenty of poets who would do as well i spoke of this sham divinity i said that we wanted in poetry as in human life a certain sanity which can only exist in a condition of controlled emotion it was perhaps a proof that neither lover nor maiden really felt the power of the passion called love that they could thus at what to some persons would be a supreme moment drop into a cold philosophic treatment of the subject perhaps love does not recognise sanity then love had better be locked up i pointed out in my lecture that these conceits and extravagancies may be very pretty set to the music of rhythm and rhyme and phrase but that in the conduct of life they can have no place except in the brains of men who have now ceased to exist ceased to exist i mean that the ages of ungoverned passion have died out to dwell perpetually on a mere episode in life to magnify its importance to deify the poets mistressthat i told my class is to present a false view of life and to divert poetry from its proper function how did your class receive this view wellyou knowthe average girl i believe likes to be worshipped it is very bad for her because she knows she isnt worth it and that it cannot last but she seems to like it my class looked on the whole as if they could not agree with me you would have no love in poetry not extravagant love these extravagancies are not found in the nobler poets they are not in milton nor in pope nor in cowper nor in wordsworth nor in browning i have not as you say experienced the desire for love in any case it is only an episode poetry should be concerned with the whole life so should love leonard she said the doubt softening her face there may be something deficient in my nature i sincerely wish that i could understand what you mean by desiring any change no she understood nothing of the sacred passion but there must be no difference in consequence i could not bear to think that my answer even to such a trifle should make any difference between us such a trifle constance you are wonderful but it seems to me if the poets are right that men are always ready to make love if one woman fails there are plenty of others would not that make a difference between us you mean that i should be jealous i could not possibly use the word jealous in connection with you constance she considered the point from an outside position i should not be jealous because you were making love to some unseen person but i should not like another woman standing here between us i dont think i could stay here you give me hope constance no it is only friendship because you see the whole pleasure of having a friend like yourselfa man friendis unrestrained and open conversation i like to feel free with you and i confess that i could not do this if another woman were with us she was silent awhile she became a little embarrassed leonard she said i have been thinking about you as well as myself if i thought that this thing was necessary for youor best for youi might perhapsthough i could not give you what you expecti meanresponsive worship and the rest of it necessary he repeated there was no sign of loves weakness in her face which had now assumed the professional manner that is historical philosophical and analytical let us sit down and talk about yourself quite dispassionately as if you were somebody else she resumed the chairleonards own chairbeside the table it was a revolving chair and she turned it half round so that her elbow rested on the blottingpad while she faced her suitor leonard for his part experienced the old feeling of standing up before the head for a little wholesome criticism he laughed however and obeyed taking the easychair at his side of the fireplace this gave constance the slight superiority of talking down to instead of up to him a tall man very often forgets the advantage of his stature i mean if companionship were necessary for you it is i believe to weaker and to less fortunate mento poets i suppose love means i am sure a craving for support and sympathy some menweaker men than yourequire sympathy as much as women you do not feel that desireor need a terrible charge but how do you know i know because i have thought a great deal about you and because i have conceived so deep a regard for you that at first when i received your letter i almostalmostmade a great mistake wellbut tell me something more to learn how one is estimated may be very good for one selfconceit is an everpresent danger i think to begin with that of all young men that i know you are the most selfreliant and the most confident well these are virtues are they not of course you have every right to be selfreliant you are a good scholar and you have been regarded at the university as one of the coming men you are actually already one of the men who are looked upon as arrived so far you have justified your selfconfidence so far my vanity is not wounded but there is more yes you are also the most fortunate of young men you are miles ahead of your contemporaries because where they all lack something you lack nothing one man wants birthit takes a very strong man to get over a humble origin another man wants manner another has an unfortunate facea harsh voicea nervous jerkiness another is deficient in style another is ground down by poverty you alone have not one single defect to stand in your way let me be grateful then you have that very very rare combination of qualities which make the successful statesman you are goodlooking you are even handsome you look important you have a good voice and a good manner as well as a good presence you are a gentleman by birth and training you have enough to live upon now and you are the heir to a good estate really leonard i do not know what else you could ask of fortune i have never asked anything of fortune and you get everything you are too fortunate leonard there must be something behindsomething to come nature makes no man perfectly happy indeed he smiled gravely i want nothing of that kind in addition to everything else you are completely healthy and i believe you are a stranger to the dentist your hair is not getting prematurely thin really leonard i do not think that there can be in the whole country any other young man so fortunate yet you refuse to join your future with mine perhaps if there were any misfortunes or drawbacks one might not refuse family scandals now many noble houses have whole cupboards filled with skeletons your cupboards are only filled with blue china one or two scandals might make you more human unfortunately from your point of view my people have no scandals poor relations again many people are much pestered with poor relations they get into scrapes and they have to be pulled out at great cost i have a cousin for instance who turns up occasionally he is very expensive and most disreputable but you oh fortunate young man we have had early deaths but there are no disreputable cousins that is what i complain of you are too fortunate you should throw a ring into the sealike the too fortunate king the only person who could be compared with you i dare say gout or something will come along in time it isnt good for you she went on half in earnest it makes life too pleasant for you leonard you expect the whole of life to be one long triumphal march why you are so fortunate that you are altogether outside humanity you are out of sympathy with men and women they have to fight for everything you have everything tossed into your lap you have nothing in common with the working worldno humiliationsno disgracesno shames and no defeats i hardly understand he began disconcerted at this unexpected array of charges and crimes i mean that you are placed above the actual world in which men tumble about and are knocked down and are picked upmostly by the women you have never been knocked down you say that i do not understand love perhaps not certainly you do not love means support on both sides you and i do not want any kind of support you are clad in mail armour you do notyou cannoteven wish to know what love means he made no reply this turning of the table was unexpected she had been confessing that she felt no need of love and now she accused himthe wooerof a like defect leonard if fortune would only provide you with family scandals some poor relations who would make you feel ashamed something to make you like other people vulnerable you would learn that love might meanand then in that impossible casei dont knowperhaps she left the sentence unfinished and ran out of the room leonard looked after her his face expressing some pain what does she mean humiliation degraded relations ridiculous then for the second time after many years he heard the voices of his mother and his grandmother they spoke of misfortunes falling upon one and another of their family beginning with the old man of the country house and the terrace oh oh it was absurd he sprang to his feet it was absurd humiliations disgrace family misfortunes absurd well constance had refused him perhaps she would come round meanwhile his eyes fell upon the table and his papers he sat down he took up the pen love who had been looking on sorrowfully from a lofty perch on a bookshelf vanished with a sigh of despair the lover heard neither the sigh nor the fluttering of loves wings he bent over his papers a moment and he was again absorbedentirely absorbed in the work before him in her own room the girl sat before her table and took up her pen but she threw it down again no she said i could not he is altogether absorbed in himself he knows nothing and understands nothingand the world is so full of miseries and he is all happiness and men and women sufferhow they sufferfor their sins and for other peoples sins and he knows nothing he understands nothing oh if he could be made human by somethingby humiliation by defeat if he could be made human like the rest why thenthen she threw away her pen pushed back the chair put on her hat and jacket and went out into the streets among the men and women chapter iii something to come if you have the rare power of being able to work at any time and after any event to concentrate your thoughts on work this is certainly a good way of receiving disappointments and averting chagrin two hours passed leonard continued at his table absorbed in his train of argument and for the moment wholly forgetful of what had passed presently his pen began to move more slowly he threw it down he had advanced his position by another earthwork he sat up he numbered his pages he put them together and he found himself after the change of mind necessary for his work able to consider the late conversation without passion though with a certain surprise some menthe weaker brethrenare indignant humiliated by such a rejection that is because their vanity is built upon the sands leonard was not the kind of man to be humiliated by any answer to any proposal even that which concerns the weddingring he had too many excellent and solid foundations for the good opinion which he entertained of himself it was impossible for any woman to refuse him considering the standards by which women consider and estimate men constance had indeed acknowledged that in all things fortune had favoured him yet owing to some feminine caprice or unexpected perversity he had not been able to touch her heart such a man as leonard cannot be humiliated by anything that may be said or done to him he is humiliated by his own acts perhaps and his own blunders and mistakes of which most mens lives are so full he was able to put aside as an incident which would perhaps be disavowed in the immediate future the refusal of that thrice fortunate hand of his besides the refusal was conveyed in words so gracious and so kindly but there was this strange attack upon him he found himself repeating in his own mind her words nature constance said makes no man perfectly happy he himself she went on presented the appearance of the one exception to the rule he was well born wealthy enough strong and tall sound of wind and limb sufficiently well favoured with proved abilities already successful and without any discoverable drawback was there any other man in the whole world like unto him it would be better for him this disturbing girlthis oraclehad gone on to prophesy if something of the common lotthe dash of bitternesshad been thrown in with all these great and glorious gifts of fortune something would certainly happen something was coming there would be disaster then he would be more human he would understand the world as soon as he had shared the sorrows and sufferings the shames and the humiliations of the world he would become more in harmony with men and women for the note of the common life is suffering at this point there came back to him again out of the misty glades of childhood the memory of those two women who sat together widows both in the garb of mourning and wept together my dear said the elder ladythe words came back to him and the scene as plainly as on that day when he watched the old man sleeping in his chairmy dear we are a family of misfortune but whywhywhy asked the other what have we done things said the elder lady are done which are never suspected nobody knows nobody finds out the arm of the lord is stretched out and vengeance falls if not upon the guilty then upon his children and leonard drove the memory backthe lawn and the garden the two women sitting in the veranda the child playing on the grass the wordsall vanished leonard returned to the present ghosts he said ghosts were these superstitious fears ever anything but ghosts he refused to think of these things he put aside the oracle of the wise woman the admonition that he was too fortunate a youth you have seen how he opened the first of a small heap of letters his eye fell upon the others he took up the first and opened it the address was that of a fashionable westend hotel the writing was not familiar yet it began my dear nephew my dear nephew he asked who calls me his dear nephew he turned over the letter and read the name at the end your affectionate uncle fred campaigne fred campaigne then his memory flew back to another day of childhood and he saw his motherthat gentle creatureflushing with anger as she repeated that name there were tears in her eyesnot tears of sorrow but of wrathand her cheek was aflame and that was all he remembered the name of frederick campaigne was never more mentioned i wonder said leonard then he went on reading the letter my dear nephew i arrived here a day or two ago after many years wandering i lose no time after the transaction of certain necessary business in communicating with you at this point pray turn to my signature i have done so already said leonard he put the letter down and tried to remember more he could not there arose before his memory once more the figure of his mother angry for the first and only time that he could remember why was she angry he asked himself then he remembered that his uncle christopher the distinguished lawyer had never mentioned fredericks name seems as if there was a family scandal after all he thought he turned to the letter again i am the longlost wanderer i do not suppose that you can possibly remember me seeing that when i went away you were no more than four or five years of age one does not confide family matters to a child of those tender years when i left my country i was under a clouda light cloud it is truea sort of nebulous haze mysteriously glowing in the sunshine it was no more than the not uncommon mystery of debt my nephew i went off i was shoved off in fact by the united cold shoulders of all the relations not only were there money debts but even my modest patrimony was gone thus does fond youth foolishly throw good money after bad i should have kept my patrimony to go abroad with and spent nothing but my debts i am now however home again i should have called but i have important appointments in the city where you may be pleased to learn my name and my voice carry weight meantime i hear that you will be asked to meet me at my brother christophers on wednesday i shall therefore hope to see you then my city friends claim all my time between this and wednesday the magnitude of certain operations renders it necessary to devote myself for a day or two entirely to matters of haute finance it was i believe customary in former times for the prodigal son to return in rags we have changed all that nowadays the prodigal son returns in broadcloth with a chequebook in his pocket and credit at his bank the family will be glad i am sure to hear that i am prosperous exceedingly leonard read this letter with a little uneasiness he remembered those tears to begin with and then there was a certain false ring in the words an affectation of lightheartedness which did not sound true there was an ostentation of success which seemed designed to cover the past i had forgotten he said that we had a prodigal son in the family indeed i never knew the fact prosperous exceedingly is he important appointments in the city well we shall see i can wait very well until wednesday he read the letter once more something jarred in it the image of the gentle woman for once in her life in wrath real and undisguised did not agree with the nebulous haze spoken of by the writer besides the touch of romance the nabob who returns with a pocket full of money having prospered exceedingly does not begin by making excuses for the manner of leaving home not at all he comes home exultant certain to be well received on account of his moneybags after all said leonard putting down the letter it is an old affair and my poor mother will shed no more tears over that or anything else and it may be forgotten he put down the letter and took up the next humph he growled algernon again i suppose he wants to borrow again and constance said that i wanted poor relations it is true that his cousin algernon did occasionally borrow money of him but he was hardly a poor relation being the only son of mr christopher campaigne of lincolns inn barristeratlaw and in the enjoyment of a large and lucrative practice it is the blessed privilege of the bar that every large practice is lucrative now in the lower branch of the legal profession there are large practices which are not lucrative just as in the lower branches of the medical profession there are sixpenny practitioners with a very large connection and in the church there are vicars with very large parishes algernon for his part was studying with a great and ambitious object he proposed to become the dramatist of the future he had not yet written any dramas he haunted the theatres attended all the first nights knew a good many actors and a few actresses belonged to the playgoers club spoke and posed as one who is on the stage or at least as one to whom the theatre is his chosen home algernon was frequently stonebroke was generally unable to obtain more than a certain allowance from his father and was accustomed to make appeals to his cousin the head of the family the letter was as leonard expected an invitation to lend him money dear leonard i am sorry to worry you but things have become tight and the pater refuses any advances why with his fine practice he should grudge my small expenses i cannot understand he complains that i am doing no work this is most unreasonable as there is no man who works harder at his art than i myself i go to a theatre nearly every evening is it my fault that the stalls cost half a guinea all this means that i want you to lend me a tenner until the paternal pride breaks or bends yours algernon leonard read and snorted the fellow will never do anything he said nevertheless he sat down opened his chequebook and drew the cheque take it confound you he said and yet constance had told him that for want of poor relations he was out of harmony with the rest of the world there was a third letterfrom his aunt dear leonard will you look in if you possibly can on wednesday to meet your uncle fred he has come home again of course you cannot remember him he was wild i believe in the old days but he says that is over now indeed it is high time he seems to be doing well and is most cheerful as the acting head of the family you will i am sure give him a welcome and forget and forgive if there is anything to forgive algernon is i fear working too hard i could not have believed that the art of playwriting required such close attention to the theatres he is making many acquaintances among actors and actresses who will be able he says to help him tremendously i tell his father who sometimes grumbles that when the boy makes up his mind to begin there will be no living dramatist who has more conscientiously studied his art affectionately yours dorothy campaigne leonard wrote a note accepting this invitation and then endeavoured but without success to dismiss the subject of the returned prodigal from his mind it was a relief to feel that he was at least prosperous and cheerful now had leonard been a person of wider experience he would have remembered that cheerfulness in a prodigal is a most suspicious attribute because cheerfulness is the dominant note of the prodigal under all circumstances even the most unpromising his cheerfulness is his principal sometimes his only virtue he is cheerful because it is always more pleasant to be cheerful than to be miserable it is more comfortable to laugh than to cry only when the prodigal becomes successfulwhich is very very seldomdoes he lose his cheerfulness and assume a responsible and anxious countenance like the steady and plodding elder brother chapter iv the complete supply it was eleven oclock that same evening leonard sat before his fire thinking over the days work it was not a day on which he could congratulate himself he had been refused he had been told plain truths he had been called too fortunate he had been warned that the gods never make any man completely happy he had been reminded that his life was not likely to be one long triumphal march nor was he going to be exempt from the anxieties and the cares which beset other people nobody likes to be told that he is too fortunate and that he wants defeated ambition poor relations and family scandals to make him level with the rest of mankind moreover he had received as if in confirmation of the oracle the addition to his family of a doubtful uncle the mansion was quiet no pianos were at work those of the people who were not out were thinking of bed leonard sat over the fire feeling strangely nervous he had thought of doing a little work no time like the quiet night for good work yet somehow he could not command his brain it was a rebellious brain instead of tackling the social question before him it went off wandering in the direction of constance and of her refusal and of her wordsher uncomfortable illboding words unexpectedly and without any premonitory sound of steps on the stair there came a ring at his bell now leonard was not a nervous man or a superstitious man or one who looked at the present or the future with apprehension but this evening he felt a chill shudder he knew that something disagreeable was going to happen he looked at the clock his man must have gone to bed he got up and went out to open the door himself there stood before him a stranger a man of tall stature wrapped in a kind of inverness cape with a round felt hat mr leonard campaigne he asked certainly he replied snappishly who are you what do you want here at this time of night i am sorry to be so late i lost my way may i have half an hours talk with you i am a cousin of yours though you do not know me a cousin of mine what cousin what is your name here is my card if you will let me come in i will tell you all about the relationship a cousin i am most certainly leonard looked at the card mr samuel galleycampaigne in the corner were the words solicitor commercial road i know nothing about you said leonard perhaps howeverwill you come in he led the way into the study and turned on one or two more lights then he looked at his visitor the man followed him into the study threw off his cape and hat and stood before hima tall thin figure with a face which instantly reminded the spectator of a vulture the nose was long thin and curved his eyes were bright set too close together he was dressed in a frockcoat which had known better days and wore a black tie he looked hungry but not with physical pangs mr samuel galleycampaigne he repeated my fathers name was galley my grandmothers maiden name was campaigne oh your grandmothers name was campaigne your own name then is galley i added the old womans name to my own it looks better for business purposes also i took her family crestshes got a coat of armsit looks well for business purposes you cant take your grandmothers family shield cant i whos to prevent me its unusual down our way and its good for business well as you pleasename and coat of arms and everything will you explain the cousinship in two words that old man over therehe indicated something in the direction of the norththe old man who lives by himself is my grandmothers father hes ninety something and shes seventy something oh she is my greataunt then strange that i never heard of her not at all strange only what one would expect she went down in the world you went upor stayed upof course they didnt tell you about her welldo you tell me about her will you sit down may i offer you anythinga cigarette the visitor looked about the room there was no indication of whisky he sighed and declined the cigarette but he accepted the chair thank you he said it is more friendly sitting down youve got comfortable quarters no mrs c as yet is there the old woman said that you were a bachelor now then its this way she married my grandfather isaac galley that was fifty years agoin no isaac galley failed his failure was remarked upon in the papers on account of the sumthe amountof his liabilities the times wanted to know how he managed to owe so much pray go on i am interested this part of our family history is new to me leonard continued standing looking down upon his visitor he became aware presently of a ridiculous likeness to himself and he found himself hoping that the vulture played a less prominent part in his own expression all the campaigne people were tallermuch tallerthan the average their features were strongly marked they were as a rule a handsome family they carried themselves with a certain dignity this man was tall his features were strongly marked but he was not handsome and he did not carry himself with dignity his shoulders were bent and he stooped he was one of the race apparently but gone to seed looking common no one could possibly mistake him for a gentleman by birth or by breeding common was the word to apply to mr galleycampaigne common is a word much used by certain ladies belonging to a certain stage of society about their neighbours children it will do to express the appearance of this visitor pray go on leonard repeated mechanically while making his observations you are my cousin clearly i must apologise for not knowing of your existence we live at the other end of town im a gentleman of course being in the lawlower branch quite so said leonard but the old womani mean my grandmothertakes jolly good care that i shall know the difference between you and me youve had eton and college to back you up youve got the house of commons and a swagger club thats your world mine is different weve no swells where i live down the commercial road im a solicitor in what you would call a small way there are no big men our way it is a learned profession yes i am not a city clerk like my father tell me more about yourself your grandfather you say was bankrupt is he living no he went off about ten years ago boastful to the end of his great smash his sonthats my fatherwas in the city he was a clerk all his life to a winemerchant he died four or five years ago he was just able to pay for my articlesa hundred poundsand the stampanother eightyand that pretty well cleared him out except for a little insurance of a hundred when he died i was just beginning to get along and ive been able to live and to keep my mother and my grandmotherits a tight fit thoughwith what i can screw out of mary anne who is mary anne my sister mary anne shes a board school teacher but she shoves all the expenses on to me oh i have a whole family of cousins then previously unknown that is interesting are there more he remembered certain words spoken only that morning and he winced here were poor relations after all constance would be pleased no moreonly me and mary anne that is to say no more that you would acknowledge as such theres all fathers cousins and their children and all mothers cousins and brothers and nephews and nieces but you cant rightly call them your cousins hardly perhaps much as one would like now mr campaigne the old woman has been at me a long time to call upon you i didnt want to call i dont want to know you and you dont want to know me but i came to please her and to let you know that shes alive and that she would like above all things to see you and to talk to you indeed if that is all i shall be very pleased to call you see shes always been unluckyborn unlucky so to speak but shes proud of her own family theyve never done anything for her whatever they may have to dohave to do i say he became threatening have to do repeated leonard softly in the future it may be necessary to prove who we are and that before many yearsor monthsor even daysand it might save trouble if you were to understand who she is and who i am you wish me to call upon my greataunt i will certainly do so thats what she wants thats why i came here tonight look here sir for my own part i would not intrude upon you ive not come to beg or to borrow but for the old womans sake ive ventured to call and ask you to remember that she is your greataunt shes seventytwo years of age and now and then she frets a bit after a sight of her own people she hasnt seen any of them since your grandfather committed suicide and that must have been about the year before you and i were born leonard started my grandfather committed suicide what do you mean my grandfather died somewhere about what do you mean by saying that he killed himself what dont you know your grandfather sir said the other firmly died of cutthroat fever oh yes whatever they called it he died of cutthroat fever very sudden it was of that i am quite certain because my grandmother remembers the business perfectly well is it possible killed himself then why did i never learn such a thing i suppose they didnt wish to worry you your father was but a child i suppose at the time perhaps they never told him all the same its perfectly true committed suicide he remembered the widow who never smiledthe palefaced heavyeyed widow he now understood why she went in mourning all the days of her life he now learned in this unexpected manner why she had retired to the quiet little cornish village committed suicide why it seemed a kind of sacrilege to ask this person he hesitated he took up a trifling ornament from the mantelshelf and played with it it dropped out of his fingers into the fender and was broken pray he asked leaving the other question for the moment how came your grandmother to be separated from her own people they went away into the country and her father went silly she never knew him when he wasnt silly he went silly when his brotherinlaw was murdered brotherinlaw murdered murdered what is this good lord man what do you mean with your murder and your suicide why dont you know his brotherinlaw was murdered on his grounds and his wife died of the shock the same day what else was it that drove him off his old chump iiiknow nothingthe vulgarity of the man passed unnoticed in the face of these revelationsi assure you nothing of these tragedies they are all new to me i have been told nothing never told you well of all the why the old woman over there is never tired of talking about these things proud of them she is and you never to know anything nothing is there more and why do you call my greatgrandfather mad hes as much my greatgrandfather as yours mad well ive seen him over the garden wall half a dozen times walking up and down his terrace like a polar bear i dont know what you call mad as for me im a man of business and if i had a client who never opened or answered a letter never spoke a word to anybody neglected his children let his house go to ruin never went to church would have no servants about the placewhy i should have that misrable creature locked up thats all leonard put this point aside but you have not told me about his wifes death it is strange that i should be asking you these particulars of my own family mine as well if you please the east end solicitor objected with some dignity well sir my grandmother is seventytwo years of age therefore it is just seventytwo years since her mother died for her mother died in childbirth and she died of the shock produced by the news of her own brothers murder her brothers name was langley holme langley my grandfathers name yes langley holme i think he was found lying dead on a hillside so our greatgrandfather i say lost in one day his wife and his brotherinlaw who was the best friend he had in the world why sir if you ever go down to see him and find him in that state does it not occur to you to ask how it came about i confesshe is so old i thought it eccentricity of age no his cousin shook his head age alone would not make a man go on like that i take it sir that extreme age makes a man care nothing about other people not even his own children but it does not cut him off from money matters you are perhaps right yetwell i know nothing so the old mans mind was overthrown by the great shock of a double loss strange that they never told me and his son my grandfather committed suicide and his sisters husband became a bankrupt yes there are misfortunes enough the old woman is never tired of harping on the family misfortunes the second son was drowned he was a sailor and was drowned my father was never anything better than a small clerk ive known myself what it is to want the price of a dinner if you want to know what misfortune is like wait till youre hungry indeed leonard replied thoughtfully and all these troubles are new to me strange that they should be told me on this very day then theres your own father he died young too and the last case that the old woman talks about is your fathers brother i forget his name they packed him off to australia after he had forged your fathers name what forged thats a pretty word to use isnt it yes sir there are misfortunes enough he got up well the point is will you come and see the old woman yes i will call upon her when shall i find her at home she lies down on the sofa beside the fire every afternoon from two to four or halfpast four then wakes up refreshed and able to talk come about halfpast four its the backparlour the front is my office and my clerki have only one as yetworks in the room over the kitchenthe gals bedroom it is as a rule it is a most respectable house with my name on a doorplate so you cant miss it i will call then there is one thing more mr campaigne we have not thrust ourselves forward or tried to force ourselves on the family and we shall not sir we shall not we live six miles apart and we have our own friends and my friends are not yours still in a business way there is a question which i should like to ask it is a business question the mans face became suddenly foxy he leaned forward and dropped his voice to a whisper leonard was on his guard instinctively if it has to do with the campaigne estates i have nothing whatever to say would it not be well to go to the lawyers who manage the estate no they would not tell me anything what i want to know is this he has i believe a large estate he has i believe but he has no power to part with any portion of it the estate produces rents i suppose that is no doubt the case well for seventy years the old man has spent nothing there must be accumulations in case of no will these accumulations would be divided equally between your grandfathers heirs and my grandmother do you know of any will if i may be so bold as to ask i know nothing of any will it is most unlikely that there should be any will a man who has been off his head for nearly seventy years can hardly leave a will if he did one could easily set it aside mr campaigne it is on the cards that there may be enormous accumulations there may be as you say accumulations in that case it is possiblei say possiblethat my sister and i may become rich very richi hardly dare to put the possibility upon myselfbut there must bethere must beaccumulations and the question which i would put to you sir is this where are those accumulations invested and can a man find out what they amount towhat they are worthwho draws the dividendshow are they appliedand is there a will was it made before or after the old man went off his chump and if the money is left out of the family would you sir as the head of the family be ready to take steps to set aside that will those are my questions mr campaigne he threw himself back again in the chair and stuck his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes these are very important questions said leonard as a lawyer you must be aware that i cannot give you any answer as to the administration of the property i believe i have no right to ask the lawyers and agents any questions we must assume that the owner of the estate is in his right mind as for disputing a will we must wait till a will is produced sirthe cousin leaned over his knees and whispered hoarselysir the accumulations must be a million and a half i worked it all out myself with an arithmetic book i learned the rule on purpose for i never got so far in the book as compound interest it meant hundreds of sums i did em all one after the other i thought i should never get to the end mary anne helped hundreds of sums at compound interest and it tots up to a million and a halfa million and a half think of that a million and a half he got up and put on his overcoat slowly sir he added with deep emotion and a trembling voice this money must not be suffered to go out of the family it must not it would be sinfulsinful we look to you to protect the rights of the family leonard laughed i fear i have no power to help you in this respect goodnight i hope to call upon my greataunt as she wishes he shut the door upon his visitor he heard his feet going down the stairs he returned to his empty room it was no longer empty the man had peopled it with ghosts all of whom he had brought with him there was the old manyoung againstaggering under the weight of a double bereavementwife and best friend in the same day there was his own grandfather killing himself why the young sailor going out to be drowned his own father dying young the returned colonialthe prosperous gentleman who before going out had forged his brothers name forged forged the word rang in his brain there was the daughter of the housedeserted by the house married into such a family as mr galley represented were not these ghosts enough to bring into a quiet gentlemans flat yes he had been brought up in ignorance of these things he knew nothing of the cause of the old mans seclusion not the reason of his grandfathers early death not any of those other misfortunes he had been kept in ignorance of all and now these things were roughly exploded upon his unsuspecting head he sat down before the fire he worked at the subject no more that night and in his brain there rang still the strange warnings of constancethat he wanted something of misfortune such as harassed the rest of the world in order to bring him down to a level with the men and women around him i have got that something he said poor relations family scandals and humiliations and all but so far i feel no better chapter v a learned profession in one of the streets lying east of chancery lane is a block of buildings comparatively new let out as offices they generally consist of three rooms but sometimes there are four five or even six the geographical position of the block indicates the character of the occupants does not every stone in chancery lane and her daughters belong to the law sometimes however there are exceptions a few trading companies are established here for instance and occasionally one finds written across the door such an announcement as mr george crediton agent the clerks and people who passed up and down the stairs every day sometimes asked each other what kind of agency was undertaken in this office but the clerks had their own affairs to think about such a mystery as a business conducted in a quiet office to which no clients ever come is a matter of speculation for a while but soon ceases to excite any attention some twenty years and more had passed since that name had first appeared on the door and since the clerks began to wonder mr george crediton agent there are many kinds of agents land houses property of all kinds may be managed by an agent there are agents for taking out patentsseveral of these run offices near the patent office there are literary agentsbut chancery lane is not parnassus there are agents for the creation and the dissolution of partnership there are theatrical agentsbut what has law land to do with sock and buskin and what kind of agent was mr george crediton mr george crediton agent sat in his inner office the room was furnished solidly with a view to work the large and ponderous table covered with papers so dear to the solicitor was not to be seen here in its place was an ordinary study table this was turned at an angle to the wall and window there was a warm and handsome carpet a sheepskin under the table a wooden chair for the agent and two others for his visitors a typewriter stood on the table the walls were covered with booksnot law books but a miscellaneous collection the agent was apparently a man who revelled in light reading for in fact all the modern humorists were therethose from america as well as those of our own production there was also a collection of the english poets and some but not many of france and germany on a table before him stood half a dozen bound folios with the titles on the backreference ae and so on in one corner stood an open safe to which apparently belonged another folio entitled ledger the agent engaged upon his work evidently endeavoured to present an appearance of the gravest responsibility his face was decorated by a pair of small whiskers cut straight over and set back the chin and lips were smoothshaven the model set before himself was the conventional face of the barrister unfortunately the attempt was not successful for the face was not in the least like that conventional type it had no severity it had no keenness it was not set or grave or dignified it might have been the face of a light comedian in figure the man was over six feet high and curiously thin with a slightly aquiline nose and mobile sensitive lips he began his mornings work by opening his letters there were only two or three he referred to his ledger and consulted certain entries he made a few pencil notes then he took down from one shelf sam slick artemus ward and mark twain and from another a collection of burnands works and one or two of frederick ansteys he turned over the pages and began to make brief extracts and more notes perhaps then a bystander might have thought he was about to write a paper on the comparative characteristics of english and american humour outside his boyhe had a clerk of fourteen at five shillings a weeksat before the fire reading the heroic jests and achievements of the illustrious jack harkaway he was a nice boy full of imagination resolved on becoming another jack harkaway when the time should arrive and for the moment truly grateful to fortune for providing him with a situation which demanded no work except to post letters and to sit before the fire reading in a warm and comfortable outer room to which no callers or visitors ever came except his employer and the postman and if you asked that boy what was the character of the agency he would not be able to tell you when mr george crediton had finished making his extracts he pinned the papers together methodically and laid them on one side then he opened the last letter hes answered it he chuckled freds handwriting i knew iti knew it called himself barlow but i knew it directly oh hell comehell come he sat down and laughed silently shaking the room with his chuckling hell come wont he be astonished presently he heard a step and a voice i want to see mr george crediton thats fred said the agent chuckling again now for it theres nobody with him the boy replied not venturing to commit himself and unaccustomed to the arrival of strangers the caller was a tall man of about fortyfive well set up and strongly built he was dressed with the appearance of prosperity therefore he carried a large gold chain his face bore the marks which we are accustomed to associate with certain indulgences especially in strong drink it is needless to dwell upon these evidences of frailty besides one may easily be mistaken it was a kind of face which might be met with in a snug barparlour with a pipe and a glass of something hota handsome face but not intellectual or refined yet it ought to have been both in spite of broadcloth and white linen the appearance of this gentleman hardly extorted the immediate respect of the beholder tell mr crediton that mr joseph barlow is outside barlow said the boy why dont you go in then and turned over now to his book of adventures mr barlow obeyed and passed into the inner office there he stopped short and cried christopher by all thats holy the agent looked up sprang to his feet and held out his hand fred back again and become a barlow fred took the outstretched hand but doubtfully come to that chris youre a crediton in the way of business crediton quite so in the way of business barlow then they looked at each other and burst into laughter i knew your handwriting fred when i got your letter i knew it was yours so i sent you a typewritten reply typewriting never betrays and cant be found out if you want to be secret oh its mighty funny chris but i dont understand it what the devil does it all mean the very question in my mind fred what does it mean new rigout gold chain ringwhat does it mean why have you never written the circumstances of my departureyou remember perhaps the agents face darkened yes yes he replied hastily i remember the situation was awkwardvery you were much worse than i was but i got all the blame perhapsperhaps but it was a long time ago andandwell we have both got on you are now barlowjoseph barlow and you are now creditongeorge crediton sit down fred let us have a good talk and how long have you been back fred took a chair and sat down on the opposite side of the table only a fortnight or so and why didnt you look me up before as i told you there was some doubt however here i am barlow is the name of my firm a large and influential firm in sydney or melbourne no upcountryover there he pointed over his left shoulder thats why i use the name of barlow i am here on the business of the firmit brought me to london it takes me every day into the citymost important transactions owing to the magnitude of the operation my tongue is sealed oh there was a little doubt implied by the interjection you a business man you why you never understood the simplest sum in addition as regards debts probably not as regards assets and property but in those days i had none prosperity chrisprosperity brings out all a mans better qualities you yourself look respectable ive been respectable for exactly fourandtwenty years i am married i have a son of threeandtwenty and a daughter of oneandtwenty i live in pembridge crescent bayswater and you were by way of being a barrister i was but fred to be honest did you ever catch me reading a law book i never did and now youre an agent say rather that i practice in the higher walks of literature what can be higher than oratory quite so you supply the worldwhich certainly makes a terrible mess of its speecheswith discourses and afterdinner oratory oratory of all kinds from the pulpit to the inverted tub from the mansion house to the bar parlour from the house of commons to the political gathering what does your wife say my wife bless you my dear boy she doesnt know anything she doesnt suspect at home im the prosperous and successful lawyer they wonder why i dont take silk what dont they know nobody knows not the landlord of these rooms not the boy outside not any of my clients not my wife nor my son nor my daughter oh and you are making a good thing out of it so good that i would not exchange it for a county court judgeship its wonderful said fred and i always thought you rather a halfbaked lump of dough not more wonderful than your own success what a blessing it is fred that you have come home without wanting to borrow any moneyhe watched his brothers face he saw a cloud as of doubt or anxiety pass over it and he smiled not that i could lend you any if you did want itwith my expensive establishment still it is a blessing and a happiness fred to be able to think of you as the headi believe you said the headof the great and prosperous firm of barlow co freds face distinctly lengthened i suppose i must not ask a business man about his income hardlyhardly though if any man buti have a partner who would not like these private affairs divulged well fred im glad to see you back againi am indeed they shook hands once more and then for some unknown reason they were seized with laughter long and not to be controlled distinguished lawyer murmured fred when the laugh had subsided with an intermittent gurgle influential man of business said christopher oh ho lord cried he wiping his eyes it brings back the old times when we used to laugh what a lot we had to laugh at the creditors and the dunsyou remember i do and the girlsand the suppers they were good old times chris you carried on shameful we didwe did its pleasant to remember though chris im thirsty you always are his brother remembered this agreeable trait after fiveandtwenty years he got up opened a cupboard and took out a bottle and glasses and some sodawater then they sat opposite each other with the early tumbler and the morning cigar beaming with fraternal affection like old times old man said the barrister it is well have many more old times said fred now that im home again in the words of the poet alas they had been friends in youth as well as brothers and it might have been better had they not been friends in youth and they had heard the midnight chimes together and they had together wasted each his slender patrimony but now they talked friendly over the sympathetic drink that survives the possibility of port and champagne and even claret dont they really suspectany of them asked brother fred none of them they call me a distinguished lawyer and the pride of the familynext to leonard whos in the house isnt there a danger of being found out not a bit the business is conducted by letter i might as well have no office at all except for the look of it no theres no fear nobody ever comes here how did you find me out hotel clerk he saw my name as a speaker at the dinner tomorrow and suggested that i should write to you good he gets a commission i say you must come and see us you know remember no allusions to the complete speechmakereh not a word though i say it beats me how you came to think of it genius my boypure genius when you get your speech you will be proud of me whats a practice at the bar compared with a practice at the afterdinner table and now fred why barlow well you remember what happened his brother nodded and dropped his eyes absurd fuss they made nobody has heard anything about you for fiveandtwenty years i took another namea fighting name barlow i called myselfjoseph barlow joetheres fight in the very name no sympathy no weakening about joe yes for my own part i took the name of crediton respectability rather than aggressiveness in that name confidence was what i wanted tell me about the family remember that it was in that i went awaytwentyfive years ago his brother gave him briefly an account of the births and deaths his mother was dead his elder brother was dead leaving an only son as for algernons death said the speechmerchant it was a great blow he was really going to distinguish himself and he dieddied at thirtytwo his son is in the house they say he promises well hes a scholar i believe they say he can speak and hes more than a bit of a prig and about the old manthe ancient oneis he living yes he is nearly ninetyfive ninetyfive he cant last much longer i came home partly to look after things because although the estate goes to algernons sondeuced bad luck for me that algernon did have a sontheres the accumulations i remembered them one evening out there and the thought went through me like a knife that he was probably dead and the accumulations divided and my share gone so i bundled home as fast as i could noso far you are all right for hes hearty and strong and the accumulations are still rolling up i suppose what will become of them no one knows i see well i must make the acquaintance of algernons son and about this great firm of yours well its aas i saida great firm quite so it must be with fred campaigne at the head of it never mind the firm but tell me about this astonishing profession of yours the professor smiled fortunately he said i am alone were there any competition i might be ruined but i dont know my reputation by this time stands on too firm a basis to be shaken your reputation but people cannot talk about you they cannot but they may whisperwhisper to each other why just consider the convenience instead of having to rack their brains for compliments and pretty things and not to find them instead of hunting for anecdotes and quotations they just send to me they get in return a speech just as long as they wantfrom five minutes to an hourfull of good things in this way they are able to acquire it at a cheap that is a reasonable rate for next to nothing considering the reputation of wit and epigram and sparkles then think of the company at the dinner instead of having to listen to a fumbler and a stammerer and a clumsy boggler they have before them a speaker easy in his mind because he has learned it all by heart bright and epigrammatic he keeps them all alive and when he sits down there is a sigh to think that his speech was so short you must give me just such a speech i willi will fred you shall start with a name that will make you welcome at every city companys dinner it will help you hugely over your enormous transactions for the firm rely on me because you see when a man has once delivered himself of a good speech he is asked to speak again he must keep it up so he sends to me again look herehe laid his hands upon a little pile of lettershere are yesterdays and todays letters he took them up and played with them as with a pack of cards this man wants a reply for the army this is a return for literature this is a reply for the house of commons the ladies the american republic science the coloniessee and the pay the pay fred corresponds to the privilege conferred i make orators they are grateful as for yourself now mine is a reply for australia the dinner is on friday at the hotel cecildinner of colonial enterprise really the agent smiled and rubbed his hands this is indeed gratifying because fredof course you are as secret as deathi may tell you that this request of yours completes the toastlist for the evening the speeches will be allall my ownall provided by the agent but the plums my brother the real plums shall be stuffed in yours i will make it the speech of the evening mr barlowbarlowbarlow of new south wales fred rose well he said i leave you to my speech come and dine with me tonight at the htel mtropolehalfpast seven we might have a look round afterwards they had that dinner together it was quite the dinner of a rich man it was also the dinner of one who loved to look upon the winecup after dinner fred looked at his watch halfpast nine i say chris about this time we used to sally forth you remember i believe i do remember i am now so respectable that i cannot allow myself to remember there was the holborn casino and the argyll for a little dance the judge and jury evanss and the coalhole for supper and a singsong caldwells to take a shopgirl for a quiet dance cremorne my dear fred these are old stories all these things have gone the holborn and the argyll are restaurants cremorne is built over evanss is dead and gone the judge and jury business wouldnt be tolerated now what do the boys do now how should i know they amuse themselves somehow but its no concern of mine or of yours you are no longer a boy fred hang it what am i to do with myself in the evenings i suppose i can go and look on if i cant cut in any more no you mustnt even look on leave the boys to themselves join a club and sit by yourself in the smokingroom all the evening thats the amusement for you i suppose i can go to the theatreif thats all oh yes you must put on your evening clothes and go to the stalls we used to go to the pit you know there are musichalls and variety shows of sortsyou might go there if you like but you know youve got a character to maintain think of your position hang my position man get up and take me somewhere let us laugh and look on at something my dear fred consider i am a respectable barrister with a grownup son could i be seen in such a place the head of the firm of barlow and co allow me to point out would not improve his chances in the city if he were seen in certain places nobody knows me remember my dear brother that if you mean to get money out of the city you must be the serious and responsible capitalist in the evening as well as in the morning then well go and have tobacco in the smokingroom one is apt to forget chris the responsibilities of success quite so christopher smiled quite so well put the responsibilities of success i will introduce the phrase in your speech the responsibilities of success chapter vi the return of the prodigal mrs christopher campaigne was at home the rooms were filled with peoplechiefly young people friends of her son and daughter most of them were endowed with those literary and artistic leanings which made them severe critics even if they had not yet produced immortal works of their own the chief attraction of the evening however was the newlyreturned australian said to be a millionaire who took up a large space in the room being tall and broad he also took up a large space in the conversation he talked loud and laughed loud he presented successfully the appearance he desired namely that of a highly prosperous gentleman accustomed to the deference due to millions leonard came late i am glad to see you here said his hostess frederick you can hardly remember your other nephew son of algernon frederick held out a manly grasp when i left england he said you were a child of four or five i cannot pretend to remember you leonard nor can i remember you he tried to dismiss from his mind a certain ugly word but you are welcome home once more this time i hope to stay i think not affairsaffairs are sometimes peremptory particularly large affairs the city may insist upon my staying a few weeks or the city may allow me to go back i am wholly in the hands of the city if you come to think of it a man must be rich indeed to be in the hands of the city the people gazed upon the speaker with increased interest and even awe they were not in the hands of the city i confess he went on that i should like to remain society when one returns to it after many years is pleasing some people say that it is hollow perhaps the frocks varyhe looked round criticallythey are not the same as they were fiveandtwenty years ago but the effect remains the same and the effect is everything we must not look behind the scenes the rough old colonistyet no one in the room was better groomedlooks on from the outside and finds it all delightful can things unreal ever be delightful murmured a lady in the circle with a sigh at all events leonard continued you will not leave us for a time there again i am uncertain i have a partner in australia i have connections to look up in the city but for a few weeks i believe i may reckon on a holiday and a look round for colonials have to show the city that all the enterprise is not theirs nor all the wealthnor all the wealth and what he asked with condescension what are you doing leonard i am in the house as your father wasand your grandfather it is a great career it may be a great career truetrue there must be many failuresmany failures where and when are you most likely to be found leonard told him give me a note of it before we go tonight i dare say i can get round some time the ugly word once more unpleasantly returned to leonards mind mr frederick campaigne proceeded with his interrupted discourse which proved the necessity of the existence of the poor in order to make the condition of the rich possible and enviable he took the millionaires point of view and dwelt not only on the holiness of wealth but also on the duties of the poor towards their superiors leonard slipped away he felt uncomfortable he could not forget what had been told him about this loud and prosperous and selfsatisfied person besides he seemed to be overdoing itacting a part why in the inner drawingroom he found his two cousins algernon and philippa the former a young man of threeor fourandtwenty was possessed of a tall figure but rather too small a head he smiled a good deal and talked with an easy confidence common to his circle of friends it was a handsome face but it did not suggest possibilities of work leonard asked him how he was getting on always the same he replied with a laugh the study of the dramatic art presents endless difficulties that is why we are loaded up with plays then it remains for you to show the world what a play should be that is my mission i shall continue my studies for a year or so more and thenyou shall see my method is to study the art on the stage itself not in books i go to men and women on the stage i sit in various parts of the stalls and watch and learn presently i shall sit down to write well i look forward to the result look here leonardhe dropped his voice i hear that you go to see the old man sometimes he is nearly ninetyfive he cant last much longer of course the estate is yours but how about the accumulations i know nothing about the accumulations with the paters large practice and our share of the accumulations dont you think it is too bad of him to keep up this fuss about my work why should i trouble my head about money there will bethere must beplenty of money my work he said proudly shall be at least the work of one who is not driven by the ignoble stimulus of necessity it will be entirely free from the ignoble stimulus of necessity it will be free from the commercial taintthe curse of artthe blighting incubus of artthe degrading thought of money leonard left him in the doorway stood his cousin philippa you have just been talking to algernon she said you see he is always stretching out his hands in the direction of dramatic art so i observe he replied dryly some day perhaps he will grasp it at present as you say he is only stretching out arms in that direction and you i have but one dreamalways one dream she replied oppressed with endeavour i hope it will come true then by the way philippa i have just found a whole family of new cousins new cousins who are they and a great aunt i have seen one of the cousins and i am going tomorrow to see the greataunt and perhaps the other cousin who are they if they are your cousins they must be cousins on papas side i thought that we three were the only cousins on his side your uncle fred may have children have you asked him if he is married no he has promised to tell all his adventures he is a bachelor is it not interesting to get another uncle and a bachelor and rolling in money algernon has already she stopped remembering a warning but who are these cousins prepare for a shock to the family pride why we have no poor relations have we i thought listen my cousin your grandfathers sister lucy married one isaac galley about the year it was not a good marriage for her the husband became a bankrupt and as by this time her father had fallen into his present condition or profession of a silent hermit there was no help from him then they fell into poverty her son became a small clerk in the city her grandson is a solicitor in the commercial roadnot i imagine in the nobler or higher walks of that professionand her granddaughter is a teacher in a board school indeed the girl listened coldly her eyes wandered round the room filled with welldressed people a teacher in a board school and our cousin a board school teacher how interesting shall we tell all these people about our new cousins no doubt they have all got their own second cousins it is i believe the duty of the second cousin to occupy a lower rank i dare say at the same time we have always thought our family a good deal above the general run and its rather a blow leonard dont you think it is philippa but after all it remains a good old family one second cousin cannot destroy our record you may still be proud of it he left the girl and went in search of his uncle whom he found as he expected in his study apart from the throng always over your papers he said may i interrupt for a moment the barrister shuffled his papers hurriedly into a drawer always busy he said we lawyers work harder than any other folk i believe especially those with a confidential practice like my own which makes no noise and is never heard of but not the less valuable eh the barrister smiled we make both ends meet he said meeklyboth ends meet yes yes both ends meet i went to see the old man the other day leonard went on taking a chair i thought you would like to know he remains perfectly well and there is no change in any respect what i want to ask you is this it may be necessary before long to get the question decided is he in a condition to make a will the lawyer took time to give an opinion backed by his long legal experience and extensive practice it was an opinion carrying weight my opinion he said gravely and as one weighing the case judiciallyin imagination he had assumed the wig and gownmy opinion he repeated would be at first and on the statement of the case that he is unfit and has been unfit for the last seventy years to make a will he is undoubtedly on some points so eccentric as to appear of unsound mind he does nothing he allows house and gardens and furniture and pictures to fall into decay he never speaks he has no occupation this points i say to a mind unhinged by the shock of seventy years ago a shock of which i only heard the other day yesi know my sisterinlawyour mother and your grandfatherthought to screen you from what they thought family misfortune by never telling you the truththat is to say the whole truth i have followed the same rule with my children family misfortune i hardly know even now what to understand by it well they are superstitious your father died young your grandfather died young like you they were young men of promise your greatgrandfather at the age of sixandtwenty or thereabouts was afflicted as you know and they think they think that it is the visiting of the unknown sins of the fathers upon the children they think that the old mans father must have done something terrible oh but this is absurd very likelyvery likely meantime as to the power of making a will we must remember that during all these years the old man has never done anything foolish i have seen the solicitors they tell me that from father to son having acted for him all these years they have found him perfectly clearheaded about money matters i could not ask them what he has done with all his money nor what he intends to do with it but there is the factthe evidence of the solicitors as to the clearness of his intellect my opinion therefore is that he will do something astonishing unexpected and disgusting with his money and that it will be very difficult if not impossible to set aside his will oh that is your opinion is it the reason why i ask is that i have just discovered a family of hitherto unknown cousins do you know the name of galley no it is not a name i should say of the highest nobility possibly not it is the name of our cousins however one of them is a solicitor of a somewhat low class i should say the man has no pretensions whatever to be called a gentleman he practises and lives in the commercial road which is i suppose quite out of the ordinary quarter where you would find a solicitor of standing quite quite as a place of residencedeplorable from that point of view he has a sister it appears who is a board school teacher a board school teacher it is at least respectable but who are these precious cousins of ours they are the grandchildren of an aunt of yourslucy by name lucy yes i have heard of her i thought she was dead long ago she married a man named galley they seem to have gone down in the world more family misfortune the lawyer shuddered i am not superstitious he said but reallymore misfortunes oh misfortunes nonsense there are always in every family some who go downsome who go upsome who stay there you yourself have been borne steadily upwards to name and fortune i have said the lawyer with half a groan oh yesyesi have and my uncle fred you see comes homeall his wild oats sowedwith a great fortune truly the lawyers face lengthened a great fortune he told you so didnt he yes we have both been most fortunate and happy both fred and i go on leonard about these cousins these are the grandchildren of lucy campaigne i am to see the old lady in a day or two do they want anything help recognition nothing so far as i know not even recognition that is well i dont mind how many poor relations weve got provided they dont ask for money or for recognition if you give them money they will infallibly decline to work and live upon you if you call upon them and give them recognition they will infallibly disgrace you the solicitor asked for nothing this cousin of ours has been building hopes upon what he calls accumulations he evidently thinks that the old man is not in a condition to make a will and that all that is left of personal property will be divided in two equal shares one moiety among your fathers heirs on our side while the other will go to the old lady his grandmother on the other side that is i am afraid quite true but there may have been a will before he fell intoeccentricity it is a great pity leonard that these people have turned upa great misfortunebecause we may have to share with them still there must be enormous accumulations my mother did not tell us anything about possible cousins yet they do exist and they are very serious and important possibilities these people will probably interfere with us to a very serious extent and now fred has turned up and he will want his share too another misfortune how came my grandfather to die so young leonard passed on to another point he fell into a fever i was only two years old at the time leonard said nothing about the suicide clearly not himself only but his uncles also had been kept in the dark about the true cause of that unexpected demise he departed closing the door softly so as not to shake up and confuse the delicate tissues of a brain always occupied in arriving at an opinion as soon as he was gone the barrister drew out his papers once more and resumed the speech for which he had prepared half a dozen most excellent stories in such a case the british public does not ask for all the stories to be new leonard rejoined the company upstairs his uncle fred walked part of the way home with him i hadnt expected he said to find the old man still living of course it cannot go on much longer have you thought about what may happenwhen the end comes not much i confess one must i take it that he does not spend the fiftieth part of his income i have heard as a boy that the estate was worth a year very likely unless there has been depression say he spends a year that leaves a year take for expenses and repairsthat leaves a year he has been going on like this for seventy years total accumulations at compound interest for all these years it must reach two millions or so who is to have it his descendants i suppose you my brother christopher and myself two millions to divide between us a very pretty fortunevery pretty indeed goodnight my boygoodnight he walked away cheerfully and with elastic step accumulationsaccumulations said leonard looking after him they are all for accumulations shall i too begin to calculate how much has been accumulated and how if the accumulations turn out to be lostwastedgoneto somebody else chapter vii the child of sorrows on a cold day with a grey sky and an east wind leonard for the first time walked down the commercial road to call upon the newlyfound cousins it is a broad thoroughfare but breadth does not always bring cheerfulness with it even under a warm summer sun some thoroughfares cannot be cheerful nothing can relieve the unvarying depression of the commercial road it is felt even by the children who refuse to play in it preferring the narrow streets running out of it the depression is felt even by the drivers and the conductors of the tramcars persons who are generally superior to these influences here and there is a chapel here and there is a model lodginghouse or a factory or a square or a great shop one square was formerly picturesque when the fair of the goats was held upon it now it has become respectable the goats are gone and the sight provokes melancholy north and south of the road branch off endless rows of streets crossed by streets laid out in a uniform check pattern all these streets are similar and similarly situated like euclids triangles one wonders how a resident finds his own house nevertheless the houses though they are all turned out according to the same pattern are neat and clean and well kept the people in them are prosperous according to their views on prosperity the streets are cheerful though the road to which they belong is melancholy alas it says how can such a road as myself be cheerful i lead to the docks and limehouse and poplar and canning town and the isle of dogs mr galleys house was on the north side conveniently near to a certain policecourt in which he practised daily sometimes coming home with as much as three or four halfcrowns in his pocket sometimes with lessfor competition among the professional solicitors in the policecourts is keen and even fierce five shillings is a common fee for the defence of a prisoner and rumour whispers that even this humble sum has to be shared secretly with a certain functionary who must be nameless a brass plate was on the door mr samuel galleycampaigne solicitor it was a narrow threestoried house quite respectable and as depressing as the road in which it stood leonard knocked doubtfully after a few moments delay the door was opened by a boy who had a pen stuck behind his ear oh you want mrs galley he said there you arebackparlour and ran up the stairs again leaving the visitor on the doormat he obeyed instructions however and opened the door indicated he found himself in a small back roompity that the good old word parlour has gone outwhere there were sitting three ladies representing three stages of human lifenamely twenty fifty and seventy the table was laid for tea the kettle was on the oldfashioned hobpity that the hospitable hob has goneand the kettle was singing the buttered toast and the muffins were before the fire within the high oldfashioned fender the teathings and the cake and the breadandbutter were on the table and the ladies were in their sunday things waiting for him it was with some relief that leonard observed the absence of mr samuel the eldest of the three ladies welcomed him my grandnephew leonard she said giving him her hand i am very gladvery glad indeed to make your acquaintance thisshe introduced the lady of middle lifeis my daughterinlaw the widowalasof my only son and thisindicating the girlis my granddaughter the speaker was a gentlewoman the fact was proclaimed in her speech in her voice in her bearing in her fine features she was tall like the rest of her family her abundant white hair was confined by a black lace cap the last of the family possessions her cheek was still soft touched with a gentle colour and a tender bloom her eyes were still full of light and warmth her hands were delicate her figure was still shapely there were no bending of the shoulders no dropping of the head she reminded leonard of the recluse but her expression was different his was hard and defiant hers was gentle and sad the second lady who wore a widows cap and a great quantity of black crape evidently belonged to another class some people talk of a lower middle class the distinction i know is invidious why do we say the lower middle class we do not say the lower upper class however this lady belonged to the great and numerous class which has to get through life on slender means and has to consider before all things the purchasing power of sixpence this terrible necessity in its worst form takes all the joy and happiness out of life when every day brings its own anxieties about this sixpence there is left no room for the graces for culture for art for poetry for anything that is lovely and delightful it makes life the continual endurance of fear as dreadful as continued pain of body even when the terror of the morrow has vanished or is partly removed by an increase of prosperity the scars and the memory remain and the habits of mind and of body mrs galley the younger belonged to that class in which the terror of the morrow has been partly removed but she remembered in what followed she sat in silence but she occupied as of right the proud position of pouring out the tea she was short of stature and might have been at one time pretty the third the girl who was mary anne the board school teacher in some respects resembled her mother being short and somewhat insignificant of aspect but when she spoke she disclosed capacity it is not to girls without capacity and resolution that places in board schools are offered let me look at you leonard the old lady still held his hand ah what a joy it is to see once more one of my own people you are very tall leonard like the rest of us you have the campaigne face and you are proud oh yesyou are full of pridelike my father and my brothers it is fifty yearsfifty years and moresince i have seen any of my own people we have sufferedwe have suffered she sighed heavily she released his hand sit down my dear she said gently sit down and for once take a meal with us mary anne give your cousin some cakeit is my own makingunless he will begin with breadandbutter the tea was conducted with some ceremony indeed it was an occasion hospitalities were not often proffered in this establishment leonard was good enough to take some cake and two cups of tea the old lady talked while the other two ministered i know your name leonard she said i remember your birth sevenandtwentyyes it was in about the same time as samuel was born your mother and your grandmother lived together in cornwall i corresponded with my sisterinlaw until she died since then i have heard nothing about you my grandson tells me that you are in the house father to sonfather to son we have always sent members to the house our family belongs to the house there were campaignes in the long parliament so she went on while the cups went round the other ladies preserving silence at last the banquet was considered finished mary anne herself carried out the teathings mrs galley the younger followed and leonard was left alone with the old lady as had been arranged she wanted to talk with him about the family look she said pointing to a framed photograph on the wall that is the portrait of my husband at thirty not quite at his bestbutstill handsome dont you think as a young man he was considered very handsome indeed his good looks unfortunately like his good fortune and his good temperpoor manwent off early but he had heavy trials partly redeemed by the magnitude of his failure leonard reflected that comeliness may go with very different forms of expression in this case the expression was of a very inferior city kind there also appeared to be a stamp or brand upon it already at thirty as of strong drinks that is my son at the side he was half a campaigne to look at but not a regular campaigne no he had too much of the galley in him none of the real family pride poor boy the face of the young man apparently about twenty years of age was handsome but weak and irresolute and without character he had no pride in himself and no ambition my poor boy i could never understand why no push and no ambition that is why he remained only a clerk in the city all his life if he had had any pride he would have risen i must tell you said leonard that i have been kept no doubt wisely in ignorance of my own family history it was only yesterday that i heard from your son that there have been troubles and misfortunes in our records troubles and misfortunes and you have never heard of them why my children who havent nearly so much right as you to know have learned the history of my people better than that of their own mother or their grandfathers people to be sure with the small folk like those who live round here trouble is not the same thing as with us mostly they live up to the neck in troubles and they look for nothing but misfortune and they dont mind it very much so long as they get their dinners and you havent even heard of the family misfortunes i am astonished why there never has been any family like ours for trouble and you might have been cut off in your prime or struck off with a stroke or been run over with a waggon and never even known that you were specially born to misfortune as the sparks fly upwards am i born to misfortune more than other people it was in a kind of dream that leonard spoke his brain reeled the room went round and round he caught the arms of a chair and for a moment he heard nothing except the voice of constance who warned him that nature makes no one wholly happy that he had been too fortunate that something would fall upon him to redress the balance that family scandals poor relations disgraces and shames were the lot of all mankind and if he would be human if he would understand humanity he must learn like the rest of the world by experience and by suffering was she then a prophetess for behold a few days only had passed and these things had fallen upon him but as yet he did not know the full extent of what had happened and what was going to happen he recovered the fit had lasted but a moment but thought and memory are swifter than time the old lady was talking on to think that youve lived all these years and no one ever told you what did they mean by keeping you in the dark and ive always thought of you as sitting melancholy waiting for the stroke whenever it should fall i have been ignorant of any stroke possible or actual let me tell you that i have no fear of any stroke this is superstition nono the old lady shook her head and laid her hand on his dear boy you are still under the curse the stroke will fall perhaps it will be laid in mercy on me it fell with wrath that is our distinction thats what it is to be a campaigne the misfortunes however dont go on for ever they will leave off after your generation it will be when i am dead and gone but i should like i confess to see happiness coming back once more to the family your grandson spoke of a murder and of a suicide among other things other things indeed why there was my husbands bankruptcy there was your uncle fred my nephew and what he did and why he was bundled out of the country i thought your mother would have fallen ill with the shame of it and there was my poor father too and there was the trial did they not tell you about the trial what trial the great trial for the murder its a most curious case i believe the man who was tried really did it because no one else was seen about the place but he got off my father was very good about it he gave the man counsel who got him off ive got all the evidence in the casecut out of newspapers and pasted in a book i will lend it to you if you like thank you it might be interesting he said carelessly it is interesting but dont you call these things enough misfortunes for a single family quite enough but not enough to make us born to misfortune oh leonard if you had seen what i have seen and suffered what i have suffered ive been the most unfortunate of all my brothers gone poor dear langley by his own hand christopher dear lad drowned my father a wreck like him i live on i live on and wait for more trouble she shook her head and the tears came into her eyes i was a poor neglected thing with no mother and as good as no father to look after me galley came along he was handsome and i thought being a silly girl that he was a gentleman so i married him i ran away with him and married him then i found out he thought i had a large fortune and i had nothing and father would not answer my letters well he failed and he used me cruellymost cruelly he did and poverty came ongrinding horrible poverty you dont know my dear nephew what that means i pray that you never may there is no misfortune so bad as poverty except it is dishonour he died at lastthe widow heaved a sigh of relief which told a tale of woe in itselfand his son was a clerk and kept us all now hes dead and my grandson keeps me for fifty years i have been slave and housemaid and cook and drudge and nurse to my husband and my son and my grandson and oh i longed to speak once more with one of my own people leonard took her hand and pressed it there was nothing to be said tell me more she said about yourself he told her briefly his position and his ambitions you have done well she said so farbut take care there is the family luck it may pass you over but i dont know i doubt i fear there are so many kinds of misfortune i keep thinking of them all she folded her hands resigned let trouble come to me she said not to you or the younger ones to me that is what i pray daily i am too old to mind much trouble to me means pain and suffering rather that than more trouble to you young people leonard i remember now that your grandmother spoke in one of her letters of keeping the children from the knowledge of all this trouble yes i remember she went on talking she told the whole of the family history she narrated every misfortune at length to leonard listening in that little back room with the gathering twilight and the red fire to the soft sad voice of the mournful lady there came again the vision of two women both in widows weeds in the cottage among the flowerstree fuchsias climbing roses myrtles and passionflowers all through his childhood they sat together seldom speaking palefaced sorrowful he understood now it was not their husbands for whom they wept it was for the fate which they imagined to be hanging over the heads of the children once he heard his mother saynow the words came back to himthank god i have but one leonard the old woman was going on for fifty years i have been considering and thinking it means some great crime the misfortunes began with my father his life has been wrecked and ruined in punishment for someone elses crime his was the first generation mine was the second all our lives have been wrecked in punishment for that crime his was the first generation i sayshe repeated the words as if to drive them homemine was the second all our lives have been wrecked in punishment for that crime then came the thirdyour father died early and his brother ran away because he was a forger oh to think of a campaigne doing such a thing that was the third generation you are the fourthand the curse will be removed unto the third and fourthbut not the fifth yes said leonard i believei now rememberthey thoughtat homesomething of this kind but my dear lady consider if misfortune falls upon us in consequence of some great crime committed long ago and impossible to be repaired or undone what is there for us but to sit down quietly and to go on with our work she shook her head it is very well to talk wait till the blows begin if we could find out the crimebut we never can if we could atonebut we cannot we are so powerlessoh my god so powerless and yet so innocent she rose her face was buried in her handkerchief i think it consoled her to cry over the recollection of her sorrows almost as much as to tell them to her grandnephew i pray dailyday and nightthat the hand of wrath may be stayed sitting here i think all day long i have forgotten how to read i think leonard glanced at the walls there were a few books until mary anne began to study there were no books we were so poor that we had to sell everything books and all this room is the only one in the house that is furnished decently my granddaughter is my only comfort she is a good girl leonard she takes after the galleys to look at but shes a campaigne at heart and shes proud though you wouldnt think it because shes such a short bunch of a figure not like us shes my only comfort we talk sometimes of going away and living togethershe and iit would be happier for us my grandson is notis notaltogether what one would wish to be sure he has a dreadful struggle its poverty poverty poverty oh leonardshe caught his handpray against poverty it is poverty which brings out all the bad qualities leonard interrupted a monologue which seemed likely to go on without end besides he had now grasped the situation i will come again he said if i may oh if you may if you only knew what a joy what a happiness it is only to look into your face it is my brothers facemy fathers faceoh come againcome again i will come again then and soon meantime remember that i am your nephewor grandnephew which is the same thing if in any way i can bring some increase to your comforts no no my dear boy not that way she cried hastily i have been poor but neverin that way my father who ought to help me has done nothing and if he will not nobody shall i would if i could have my rights no woman of our family except me but was an heiress and besidesheshe pointed to the front of the house where was the office of her grandsonhe will take it all himself well then but if if i must i will dont give him money he is better without it he will speculate in houses and lose it all dont leonard i will notunless for your sake nononot for my sake but come again dear boy and we will talk over the family history i dare say there are quantities of misfortunes that i have left outoh what a happy day it has been to me he pressed her hand again have faith dear lady we cannot be crushed in revenge for any crime by any other person do not think of past sorrows do not tremble at imaginary dangers the future is in the hands of justice not of revenge they were brave words but in his heart there lurked say the possibilities of apprehension in the hall samuel himself intercepted him running out of his office i had my tea in here he said because i wanted her to have a talk with you alone and im sick of her family to tell the truth except for that chance of the accumulations did she mention them he whispered i thought she wouldnt i cant get her to feel properly about the matter women have got no imaginationnone well a man like that cant make a will he cant thats a comfort goodevening mr campaigne we rely entirely upon you to maintain the interests of the family if necessary against madmens wills those accumulationsah and hes ninetyfiveor is it ninetysix i call it selfish to live so long unless a mans a pauper he ought to be thinking of his greatgrandchildren chapter viii in the land of beeches leonard met constance a few days later at the club and they dined at the same table as for the decision and the rejection they were ignored by tacit consent the situation remained apparently unaltered in reality everything was changed you look thoughtful she said presently after twice making an observation which failed to catch his attention and you are absentminded i beg your pardon yes that is i do feel thoughtful you would perhaps if you found your family suddenly enlarged in all directions have you received unknown cousins from america i have received a greataunt a lesser aunt and two second cousins they are not from america they are on the contrary from the far east end of this towneven from ratcliffe or shadwell or perhaps stepney oh constance heard with astonishment and naturally waited for more if more was to follow perhaps however her friend might not wish to talk of connections with shadwell the great aunt is charming he continued the lesser aunt is not so charming the second cousins arearewell the man is a solicitor who seems to practice chiefly in a policecourt defending those who are drunk and disorderly with all who are pickpockets hooligans and common frauds a variegated life i should say and full of surprises and unexpectedness he is something like my familytall with sharp featuresmore perhaps of the vulture than the eagle in him but one may be mistaken his sister is like her mother short and round and plump andnot to disguise the truthcommonlooking but i should say that she was capable she is a board school teacher you were saying the other day constance that it was a pity that i had never been hampered by poor relations i consider that you are really a spoiled child of fortune i reminded you that you have your position already made you have your distinguished university career you are getting on in the house you have no family scandals or misfortunes or poor relations or anything well this loss is now supplied by the accession of poor relations andother things your mention of things omitted reminded fortune i suppose so she hastened to turn on a supply of everything i am now quite like the rest of the world do the poor relations want money yes but not from me the solicitor thinks that there must be great sums of money accumulated by the patriarch of whom i have spoken to you cupidity of a sort but not the desire to borrow sent him to me partly he wanted to put in his claim informally and partly he prepared the way to make me dispute any will that the old man may have made he is poor and therefore he is grasping i suppose i believe we all have poor relations said constance mine however do not trouble me much there has been a family enlargement in another direction a certain uncle of mine who formerly enacted with much credit the old tragedy of the prodigal son has come back from australia has he been living on the same diet as the prodigal shucks and beanpods he hardly looks as if that had been his diet he is well dressed big and important he repeats constantly and is most anxious for everybody to know that he is prosperous i doubt somehow leonard paused the expression of doubt is not always wise the return of a middleaged prodigal is interesting and unusual i fear i must not congratulate you altogether on this unexpected enlargement yet you said i ought to have poor relations however there is more behind what was it you said about disgraces well theyve come too oh constance changed colour disgraces but leonard i am very sorry and i really never supposed of course not it is the merest coincidence at the same time like all coincidences it is astonishing just after your remarks which did really make me very uncomfortable but ive stepped into quite a remarkable family history full of surprising events and all of them disasters but you had already a remarkable family history so i thoughta long history and a creditable history ending with the ancient recluse of whom i have told you we are rather proud of this old old manthis singular being who has been a recluse for seventy years i have always known about him one of the very earliest things i was told was the miraculous existence of this eccentric ancestor they told me so much i suppose because i am as a matter of fact heir to the estate whenever that happens to fall in but i was never toldi suppose because it is a horrible storywhy the old man became a recluse that i only learned yesterday from this ancient aunt who is the only daughter of the still more ancient recluse why was it that is dont let me ask about your private affairs not at all there is nothing that might not be proclaimed from the housetop there never is there are no private affairs if we would only think so well it seems that one day seventy years ago the brotherinlaw of this gentleman then a hearty young fellow of fiveor sixandtwenty was staying at the hall he went out after breakfast and was presently found murdered in a wood and in consequence of hearing this dreadful thing suddenly his sister my ancestors wife died on the same day the ancient aunt was born on the day that the mother died the blow which was certainly very terrible affected my ancestor with a grief so great that he became at once what he is now a melancholy recluse taking no longer the least interest in anything it is to me very strange that a young man strong physically and mentally should not have shaken off this obsession it does seem very strange i myself had an ancestor murdered somewherefather of one of my grandmothers but your case is different the aged aunt told me the story she had a theory about some great crime having been committed she suggests that the parent of the recluse must have been a great unknown unsuspected criminala kind of gilles de retz there have been misfortunes scattered aboutshe related a whole string of calamitiesall she thinks in consequence of some crime committed by this worthy as mild a christian i believe as ever followed the hounds or drank a bottle of port she is thinking of course of the visitation upon the third and fourth generation to which of them do you belong i am of the fourth according to that theory it is tempting it lends a new distinction to the family this lady is immensely proud of her family and finds consolation for her own misfortunes in the thought that they are in part atonement for some past wickedness strange is it not of course if there is no crime there can be no consequences have the misfortunes been very marked yes very marked and unmistakable misfortunes they cannot be got over or denied or explained away misfortunes doomswhat you please what does your recluse say about them he says nothing he never speaks constance will you ride over with me and see the man and the place it is only fiveandtwenty miles or so the roads are dry the spring is upon us come tomorrow there is a pretty village an old church an eighteenthcentury house falling into ruins great gardens all run to bramble and thistle and a park besides the recluse himself the recluse might not like my visit he will not notice it besides he sleeps all the afternoon and when he is awake he sees nobody his eyes go straight through one like a rntgen ray i believe he sees the bones and nothing else the least frequented of the great highroads running out of london is assuredly that which passes through uxbridge and so right into the heart of the shire of buckinghamthe home or clearing or settlement of the beeches few bicycles attempt this road the ordinary cyclist knows or cares nothing for the attractions yet there is much to see in one place you can visit the cottage where milton finished paradise lost it is still kept just as when the poet lived in it there are churches every two or three miles churches memorable and even historical for the most part and beautiful almost every church in this county has some famous man associated with it on the right is the burialplace of the russells with their ancient manorhouse a joy and solace for the eyes also on the right is another ancient manorhouse on the left is the quiet and peaceful burialplace of penn and elwood those two illustrious members of the society of friends or also on the left you may turn aside to see the church and the road and the house of englands patriot john hampden the road goes up and the road goes down over long low hills and through long low valleys on this side and on that are woods and coppices and parks with trees scattered about and country houses no shire in england is more studded with country houses than this of bucks at a distance of every six or eight miles there stands a town all the towns in bucks are small all are picturesque all have open marketplaces and townhalls and ancient inns and old houses i know of one where there is an inn of the fourteenth century i have had it sketched by a skilful limner and i call it the boars head eastcheap and i should like to see anybody question the authenticity of the name if any were so daring i would add the portrait of jack falstaff himself sitting in the great chair by the fire on a fine clear day in early spring two cyclists rode through this country they were leonard and his friend constance they went by train as far as uxbridge and then they took the road at first it was enough to breathe the pure air of the spring to fly along the quiet road while the rooks cawed in the trees and over the fields the larks sang then they drew nearer and began to talk is this what you brought me out to see asked constance i am well content if this is all what a lovely place it is and what a lovely air it is fragrant the sun brings out the fragrance from the very fields as well as the woods this is the quietest and the most beautiful of all the roads near london but i am going to show you more not all today we must come again i will show you miltons cottage and penns burialground john hampdens church and tomb and the old manorhouse of chenies and latimer today i am only going to show you our old family house we will come when the catkins have given place to the leaves and the hedgerose is in blossom and when the park is worth looking at everything however at our place is in a condition of decay you shall see the house and the church and the village then if you like we will go on to the nearest town and get some kind of dinner and go home by train that pleases me well they went on in silence for a while leonard took up the parable again about his family we have been in the same place he said for an immense time we have never produced a great man or a distinguished man if you consider it there are not really enough distinguished men to go round the families we have twice recently made a bid for a distinguished man my own father and my grandfather were both promising politicians but they were both cut off in early manhood both what a strange thing yes part of what the ancient aunt calls the family luck we have had in fact an amazing quantity of bad luck listen it is like the history of a house driven and scourged by the hand of fate she listened while he went through the terrible list why she said your list of disaster does really suggest the terrible words unto the third and fourth generation i dont wonder at your aunt looking about for a criminal what could your forefathers have done to bring about such a succession of misfortunes let us get down and rest a little they sat down on a stile and turned the talk into a more serious vein what have my forefathers done nothing of that i am quite certain they have always been most respectable squires good foxhunters with a touch of scholarship they have done nothing our misfortunes are all pure bad luck and nothing else those words however do force themselves on one i am not superstitious yet since that venerable dame however this morning i argued with myself i said it would be such a terrible injustice that innocent children should suffer from their fathers misdeeds that it cannot be so i dont know said constance i am not so sure you too among the superstitious i also however was brought up with that theory i suppose you went to church yes we went to church and now i remember that my mother for the reason which i have only just learned believed that we were ourselves expiating the sins of our forefathers it is very easy for me to go back to the language and ideas of my childhood so much so that this morning i made a little search after a certain passage which i had wellnigh forgotten what was that it is directed against that very theory it expresses exactly the opposite opinion the passage is in the prophet ezekiel do you remember it no i have never read that prophet and i have never considered the subject it is a very fine passage ezekiel is one of the finest writers possible he ought to be read more and studied more tell me the sense of the passage i can give you the very words listen he stood up and took off his hat and declaimed the words with much force what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge as i live saith the lord god ye shall not use this proverb any more behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die but if a man be just he shall surely live these are very noble words constance indeed leonard spoke them with much solemnity the verbal interpretation of the prophets no longer occupies our minds still they are very noble words i have never believed myself to be superstitious or to believe in heredity of misfortune still after learning for the first time the long string of disasters that have fallen upon my people i became possessed with a kind of terror as if the hand of fate was pressing upon us all they are very noble words constance repeated it seems as if the speaker was thinking of a distinction between consequencescertain consequencesof every mans life as regards his children and what consequencesfrom father to son why you have only to look around you we live in conditions made for us by our forefathers my people behaved well and prospered they saved money and bought lands they lived in the old phrase godfearing lives therefore i am sound in mind and body and i am tolerably wealthy oh that of course but i was not thinking of consequences like these you must think of them a man loses his fortune and position down go children and grandchildren the edifice of generations may have to be built up again from the very foundations is it nothing to inherit a name which has been smirched if a man commits a bad action are not his children disgraced with him of course but only by that act they are not persecuted by the hand of fate who can trace the consequences of a single act who can follow it up in all the lines of consequence yes but the third and fourth generation who can say when those consequences will cease as i live saith the lord it is a solemn assurancea form of words perhapsonly a form of wordsyet if so the audacity of it as i livethe lord himself takes the oathif a man be just he shall surely live a man may be kept down by poverty and shut out from the world by his fathers shame yet he may still be just it is the distinction that the prophet would draw what misfortune has fallen upon your house which affects the soul of a man death poverty the wrongdoing of certain members leonard shook his head yes i understand what you mean i confess that i had been shaken by the revelations of that old lady they seemed to explain so much perhaps they explained the wholeyet not as she meant them to explain now i understand so many things that were darkmy mothers sadness and the melancholy eyes which rested upon me from childhood she was looking for the hand of fate she expected disaster she kept me in ignorance yet she was haunted by the thought that for the third and fourth generation the sinsthe unknown sinsof the fathers would be visited upon the children when i learned these thingshe repeated himself because his mind was so full of the thoughti felt the same expectation the same terror the same sense of helplessness as if wherever i turned whatever i attempted the hand which struck down my father my grandfather and that old man would fall upon me it was natural so that these words came to me like a direct message from the old hebrew prophet our ancestors went for consolation and instruction to those pages they held that every doubt and every difficulty were met and solved by these writers perhaps we shall go back to the ancient faith and yet he looked round it was a new world that he saw with new ideas not in my time he said we are a scientific age when the reign of science is ended we may begin again the reign of faith he spoke as one in doubt and uncertainty receive the words leonard as a direct message at least i interpreted the words into an order to look at events from another point of view and i have taken all the misfortunes in turn they have nothing whatever to do with heredity your illustration about a man losing his money and so bringing poverty upon his children does not apply my greatgrandfather has his head turned by a great trouble his son commits suicide why nobody knows the young sailor is drowned why because he is a sailor the daughter marries beneath her station why because she was motherless and fatherless and neglected my own father died young why because fever carried him off leonardconstance laid her hand upon his armdo not argue the case any more leave it a thing like this may easily become morbid it may occupy your thoughts too much let me forget it by all means at present i confess the question is always with me it explains something in your manner yesterday and today you are always serious but now you are absentminded you have begun to think too much about these troubles he smiled i am serious i suppose from the way in which i was brought up we lived in cornwall right in the country close to the seashore with no houses near us until i went to school it was a very quiet household my grandmother and my mother were both in widows weeds there was very little talking and no laughing or mirth of any kind within the house and always as i now understand the memory of that misfortune and the dread of new misfortunes were upon these unhappy ladies they did not tell me anything but i felt the sadness of the house i suppose it made me a quiet boywithout much inclination to the light heart that possessed most of my fellows i am glad you have told me she replied these things explain a good deal in you for now i understand you better they mounted their cycles and resumed the journey in silence for some miles look he cried there is our old place he pointed across a park at the end of it stood a house of red brick with red tiles and stacks of red chimneysa house of two stories only in front was a carriagedrive but no garden or enclosure at all the house rose straight out of the park itself you see only the back of the house said leonard the gardens are all in the front but everything is grown over nothing has been done to the place for seventy years i wonder it has stood so long they turned off the road into the drive the old man when the double shock fell upon him dropped into a state of apathy from which he has never rallied we must go round by the servants entrance the front doors are never opened the great hall with the marble floor made echoes rolling and rumbling about the house above as they walked across it there were arms on the walls and armour but all rusted and decaying in the damp air there were two or three pictures on the walls but the colour had peeled off and the pictures had become ghosts and groups of ghosts in black frames the recluse lives in the library said leonard let us look first at the other rooms he opened a door this was the diningroom nothing had been touched there stood the great dininghall against the walls were arranged a row of leather chairs there was the sideboard the mahogany was not affected by the long waiting except that it had lost its lustre the leather on the chairs was decaying and falling off the carpet was motheaten and in threads the paper on the wall the oldfashioned red velvet paper was hanging down in folds the oldfashioned high brass fender was black with neglected age on the walls the pictures were in better preservation than those in the hall but they were hopelessly injured by the damp the curtains were falling away from the rings think of the festive dinners that have been given in this room said leonard think of the talk and the laughter and the happiness and suddenly unexpectedly the whole comes to an end and there has been silence and emptiness for seventy years he closed the door and opened another this was in times gone by the drawingroom it was a noble roomlong high well proportioned a harp stood in one corner its strings either broken or loose a piano with the music still upon it stood open it had been open for seventy years the keys were covered with dust and the wires with rust the music which had last been played was still in its place oldfashioned sofas and couches stood about the mantelshelf was ornamented with strange things in china there were occasional tables in the old fashion of yellow and white and gold the paper was peeling off like that of the diningroom the sunshine streamed into the room through windows which had not been cleaned for seventy years the moths were dancing merrily as if they rejoiced in solitude on one table beside the fireplace were lying as they had been left the workbasket with some fancy work in it the open lettercase a halffinished letter an inkstand with three or four quill pens on a chair beside the table lay an open volume it had been open for seventy years constance came in stepping noiselessly as in a place where silence was sacred she spoke in whispers the silence fell upon her soul it filled her with strange terrors and apprehensions she looked around her you come here often leonard no i have opened the door once and only once then i was seized with a strange sense ofi know not what it made me ashamed but it seemed as if the room was full of ghosts i think it is the whole house is full of ghosts i felt their breath upon my cheek as soon as we came into the place they will not mind us leonard nor would they hurt you if they could let us walk round the room she looked at the music it is glucks orpheo the song orpheo and euridice she must have been singing it the day beforethe day before her eyes turned to the worktable here she was sitting at work the day beforethe day before look at the dainty worka childs frock she took up the open book it was paschals penses she was reading this the day beforethe day before her eyes filled with tears the musicno common music the booka book only for a soul uplifted above the common level the dainty beautiful workleonard it seems to reveal the woman and the household nothing base or common was in that womans heartor in the management of her house they are slight indications but they are sure it seems as if i knew her already though i never heard of her until today oh what a loss for that manwhat a tragedy what a terrible tragedy it was her eyes fell upon the letter she took it up see she said the letter was begun but never finished is it not sacrilege to let it fall into other hands take it leonard we may read it after all these years leonard said shaking the dust of seventy years from it there can be nothing in it that she would wish not to be written there he read it slowly it was written in pointed and sloping italian handa pretty hand belonging to the time when women were more separated from men in all their ways now we all write alike my dearest i cannot make out the name the rest is easy algernon and langley have gone off to the study to talk business it is this affair of the mill which is still unsettled i am a little anxious about algernon he has been strangely distrait for this last two or three days perhaps he is anxious about me there need be no anxiety i am quite well and strong this morning he got up very early and i heard him walking about in his study below this is not his way at all however should a wife repine because her lord is anxious about her algernon is very determined about that mill but i fear that langley will not give way you know how firm he can be behind that pleasant smile of his that is all constance she wrote no more it was written then the day beforethe day before keep the letter leonard you have no other letter of hersperhaps nothing at all belonging to the poor lady i wonder who langley was i had a forefather too whose christian name was langley it is not a common name the christian name of my unfortunate grandfather who committed suicide was also langley it is a coincidence no doubt he was named after the person mentioned in this letter not by any means a common name as you say as for this letter i will keep it there is nothing in my possession that i can connect with this unfortunate ancestress where are her jewels and things perhaps where she left them perhaps sent to the bank i have never heard of anything belonging to her constance walked about the room looking at everything the dust lay thick but it was not the black dust of the towna light brown dust that could be blown away or swept away easily she swept the strings of the harp which responded with the discords of seventy years neglect she touched the keys of the piano and started at the harsh and grating response she looked at the chairs and the tables with their curly legs and the queer things in china that stood upon the mantel shelf why she said the place should be kept just as it is a museum of george the fourth fashion in furniture here is a guitar did that lady play the guitar as well as the harp and the piano the pictures are all watercolours the glass has partly preserved them but some damp has got in they are all injured i should like to get them all copied for studies of the time and its taste they are good pictures too this one looks like a watercolour copy of a constable was he living then and this is a portrait she started good heavens what is this this it is evidently a portrait said leonard why constance for she was looking into it with every sign of interest and curiosity how in the world did this picture come here leonard looked at it i cannot tell you he said it is only my second visit to this room it is a young man a pleasing and amiable face the short hair curled by the barbers art i suppose the face is familiar i dont know why leonard it is the face of my own greatgrandfather how did it come here i have a copy or the original in my own possession how did it come here was he a friend of your people i know nothing at all about it by the rolled collar and the curly hair and the little whiskers i should say that the original must have been a contemporary of my ancestor the recluse stop there is a name on the frame can you read it he brushed away the dust langley holme langley holme what is it constance oh leonard langley holmelangley holmehe was my greatgrandfather and he was murdered i remember to have heard of ithe was murdered then it was here and he was that old mans brotherinlaw andandyour tragedy is mine as well why constance are you not jumping to a conclusion how do you know that the murder in campaigne park was that of langley holme i dont know it i am only certain of it besides that letter algernon and langley were in the study the letter tells us oh i have no doubtno doubt at all this is his portrait he was here the day beforethe day before the terrible tragedy it must have been none otherit could have been none other leonard this is very strange you confide your story to me you bring me out to see the spot where it happened and the house of the recluse and i find that your story is mine oh to light upon it here and with you it is strange it is wonderful your story is mine as well she repeated looking into his face we have a common tragedy we are not certain yet there may be another explanation there can be no other we will hunt up the contemporary papers we shall find an account of the murder somewhere a gentleman is not murdered even so far back as without a report in the papers but i am quitequite certain this is my greatgrandfather langley holme and his death was the first of all your many troubles this was the first of the hereditary misfortunes the more important and the most farreaching perhaps we could trace them all to this one calamity leonard was looking into the portrait i said it was a familiar face constance it is your own the resemblance is startling you have his eyes the same shape of face the same mouth it is at least your ancestor and as for the rest since it is certain that he met with an early and a violent end i would rather believe that it was here and in this park because it makes my tragedy as you say your own we have a common history it needs no further proof there could not have been two murders of two gentlemen both friends of this house in the same year you are right this is the man whose death caused all the trouble they looked at the portrait in silence for awhile the thought of the sudden end of this gallant youth rejoicing in the strength and hope of early manhood awed them we may picture the scene said constancethe news brought suddenly by some country lad breathless and panting the old man then young with all his future before him a smiling future a happy life his wife hearing it the house made terrible by her shriek the sudden shock the heavy blow bereavement of all the man loved best the death of his wife for whom he was so anxious the awful death of the man he loved oh leonard can you bear to think of it yes but other young men have received blows as terrible and have yet survived and at least gone about their work as before is it in nature for a man to grieve for seventy years i do not think that it was grief or that it was ever grief that he felt or still feels his brain received a violent blow from which it has never recovered but he can transact business in his own wayby brief written instructions we are not physicians to explain the working of a disordered brain we can however understand that such a shock may have produced all the effect of a blow from a hammer or a club his brain is not destroyed but it is benumbed i believe that he felt no sorrow but only a dead weight of oppressionthe sense of suffering without painthe consciousness of gloom which never lifts is not the story capable of such effects perhaps there is however one thing which we have forgotten constance it is that we are cousins this discovery makes us cousins she took his proffered hand under the eyes of her ancestor who looked kindly upon them from his dusty and faded frame we are cousinsnot first or second cousinsbut stillcousinswhich is something you have found another relation i hope sir that you will not be ashamed of her or connect her with your family misfortunes this tragedy belongs to both of us come leonard let us leave this room it is haunted i hear again the shrieks of the woman and i see the white face of the manthe young man in his bereavement come she drew him from the room and closed the door softly leonard led the way up the broad oaken staircase which no neglect could injure and no flight of time on the first floor there were doors leading to various rooms they opened one it was a room filled with things belonging to children there were toys and dolls there were dresses and boots and hats there was a childrens carriage the predecessor of the perambulator and the cart there were nurserycots there were slates and pencils and colourboxes it looked like a place which had not been deserted children had lived in it and had grown out of it all the old playthings were left in when the children left it after the blow said leonard life went on somehow in the house the recluse lived by himself in his bedroom and the library the diningroom and the drawingroom were locked up his wifes roomthe room where she diedwas locked up the boys went away the girl ran away with her young man mr galley then the whole place was deserted he shut the door and unlocked another it was her room he whispered constance looked into the room it was occupied by a great fourposter bed with steps on either side in order that the occupant might ascend to the featherbed with the dignity due to her position one cannot imagine a gentlewoman of or thereabouts reduced to the indignity of climbing into a high bed therefore the steps were placed in position we have lost this point of difference which once distinguished the quality from the lower sort the former walked up these steps with dignity into bed the latter flopped or climbed everybody now seeks the nightly repose by the latter methods the room contained a great amount of mahogany the doors were open and showed dresses hanging up as they had waited for seventy years to be taken down and worn fashions had come and gone they remained waiting there was a chest of drawers with cunninglywrought boxes upon it silver patchboxes snuffboxes in silver and in silver gilt a small collection of oldworld curiosities which had belonged to the last occupants forefather there was a dressingtable where all the toilet tools and instruments were lying as they had been left constance went into the room on tiptoe glancing at the great bed which stood like a funeral hearse of the fourteenth century with its plumes and heavy carvings as if she half expected to find a tenant beside the lookingglass stood open just as it had been left the ladys jewelbox constance took out the contents and looked at them with admiring eyes there were rings and charms necklaces of pearl diamond brooches bracelets sprays watcheseverything that a rich gentlewoman would like to have she put them all back but she did not close the box she left everything as she found it and crept away these things belonged to langleys sister she whispered and she was one of my peoplemine they shut the door and descended the stairs again they stood together in the great empty hall where their footsteps echoed up the broad staircase and in the roof above and their words were repeated by mocking voices even when they whispered from wall to answering wall and from the ceilings of the upper place tell me all you know about your ancestor said leonard indeed it is very little he is my ancestor on my mothers side and again on her mothers side he left one child a daughter who was my grandmother and her daughter married my father there is but a legendi know no moreexcept that the young manthe lively young man whose portrait i havewhose portrait is in that roomwas found done to death in a wood that is all i have heard i do not know who the murderer was nor what happened nor anything it all seemed so long agoa thing that belonged to the past but then if we could understand the past belongs to us there was another woman who suffered as well as the poor lady of this house oh leonard what a tragedy and only the other day we were talking glibly about family scandals yes a good deal of the sunshine has disappeared my life you see was not as you thought to be one long succession of fortunes gifts it was seventy years ago however the thing must not make us unhappy we at least if not that old man can look upon an event of so long ago with equanimity yes yes but i must ferret out the whole story i feel as if i know so little i am most strangely interested and moved how was the man killed why who did it where can i look for the details when you have found what you want leonard you can tell me for my own part i may leave the investigation to you besides it was so long ago why should we revive the griefs of seventy years ago i really do not know except that i am as i said strangely attracted by this story come now i want you to see the man himself who married your ancestors sister her portrait is somewhere among those in the drawingroom but it is too far gone to be recognised pitypity we have lost all our family portraits come we will step lightly not to wake him he led her across the hall again and opened very softly the library door asleep in an armchair by the fire was the most splendid old man constance had ever seen he was of gigantic stature his long legs were outstretched his massive head lay back upon the chaira noble head with fine and abundant white hair and broad shoulders and deep chest he was sleeping like a child breathing as softly and as peacefully in that restful countenance there was no suggestion of madness or a disordered brain constance stepped lightly into the room and bent over him his lips parted he murmured something in his sleep he woke with a start he sat up and opened his eyes and gazed upon her face with a look of terror and amazement she stepped aside the old man closed his eyes again and his head fell back leonard touched her arm and they left the room at the door constance turned to look at him he was asleep again he murmured something in his sleep he was disturbed he looked terrified it was your presence constance that in some way suggested the memory of his dead friend perhaps your face reminded him of his dead friend think however what a shock it must have been to disturb the balance of such a strong man as that why he was in the full strength of his early manhood and he never recoveredall these seventy years he has never spoken all these years except once in my hearingit was in his sleep what did he say that will end it strange words the tears were standing in the girls eyes the pity of it leonardthe pity of it come into the gardens they were formerly in the last centurywhen a certain ancestor was a scientific gardenershow gardens they were now entirely ruined by seventy years of neglect the lawns were covered with coarse rank grass the walks were hidden brambles grew over the flowerbeds the neglect was simply mournful they passed through into the kitchengarden over the strawberrybeds and the asparagusbeds and everywhere spread the brambles with the thistle and the shepherdspurse and all the common weeds in the orchard most of the trees were dead and under the dead boughs there flourished a rank undergrowth i have never before said constance realized what would happen if we suffered a garden to go wild this would happenas you see i believe no one has so much as walked in the garden except ourselves for seventy years in the eyes of the village i know the whole place is supposed to be haunted day and night even the chance of apples would not tempt the village children into the garden come constance let us go into the village and see the church it was a pretty village consisting of one long street with an inn a small shop and postoffice a blacksmiths and one or two other trades in the middle of the street a narrow lane led to the churchyard and the church the latter much too big for the village was an early english cruciform structure with later additions and improvements the church was open for it was saturday afternoon the chancel was full of monuments of dead and gone campaignes among them was a tablet to the memory of langley holme born at great missenden june found murdered in a wood in this parish may married february to eleanor daughter of the late marmaduke flight of little beauchamp in this county left one child constance born january yes said constance one can realise it the death of wife and friend at once and in this dreadful manner in the churchyard an old man was occupied with some work among the graves he looked up and straightened himself slowly as one with stiffened joints mornin sir he said mornin miss i hope i see you well beg your pardon sir but you be a campaigne for sure all the campaignes are aliketall men they are and good to look upon but youre not so tall nor yet so strong built as the squire been to see the old gentleman sir ay he do last on he do its wonderful close on ninetyfive he is everybody in the village knows his birthday why hes a show on sundays in summer after church they go to the garden wall and look over it to see him marching up and down the terrace he never sees them nor wouldnt if they were to walk beside him you all know him then i mind him seventy years ago i was a little chap then you wouldnt think i was ever a little chap would you seventy years ago i was eightim seventyeight now you wouldnt think i was seventyeight would you a very garrulous old man this i gave evidence i did at the inquest after the murder they couldnt do nohow without me though i was but eight years old you why what had you to do with the murder i was scaring birds on the hillside above the wood i see the squirehe was a fine big figure of a manand the other gentleman crossing the road and coming over the stile into the field then they went as far as the wood together the squire he turned back but the other gentleman he went on they found him afterwards in the wood with his head smashed then i see john dunning go insame man as they charged with the murder and he came running outscaredlike with what hed seen oh i see it all and i told them so kissing the bible on it i have heard that a man was tried for the crime he was tried but he got off everybody knows he never done it but they never found out who done it that is all you know about it that is all sir many a hundred times ive told that story thank you sir mornin miss youll have a handsome partner miss and hell have a proper missus so said leonard as they walked away the murder is still remembered and will be i suppose so long as anyone lives who can talk about it it is strange is it not that all these discoveries should fall together that i should learn the truth about my own people and only a day or two afterwards that you should learn the truth about your own ancestors we are cousins constance and a common tragedy unites us they mounted their wheels and rode away in silence but the joy had gone out of the day the evening fell the wind in the trees became a dirge their hearts were full of violence and blood and death in their ears rang the cries of a bereaved woman and the groans of a man gone mad with trouble chapter ix mary anne it was the sunday afternoon after these visits to the ancestor and to the group in the commercial road leonard was slowly returning home after a solitary lunch he walked with drooping head touching the lampposts as he passed with his umbrella this as everybody knows is a certain sign of preoccupation and dejection he was becoming in fact conscious of a strange obsession of his soul the family history sat upon him like a nightmare it left him not either by day or by night he was beginning to realise that he could not shake it off and that it was come to stay when a man is born to a family history and has to grow up with it in full consciousness of it he generally gets the better of it and either disregards it or treats it with philosophy or laughs at it or even boasts of it the illustrious mr bounderby was one of the many who boast of it but then he had grown up with it and it had become part of him and he was able to present his own version of it very different is the case when a man has a family history suddenly and quite unexpectedly sprung upon him what could have been more desirable than the position of this young man for a whole quarter of a century sufficiently wealthy connected for generations with gentlefolk successful with nothing whatever to hamper him in his career with the certainty of succeeding to a large propertycould mortal man desire more and then suddenly a family history of the darkest and most gloomy kindmurder sudden death suicide early death the shattering of a strong mind bankruptcy poverty cousins whom no kindliness could call presentableall this fell upon him at one blow can one be surprised that he touched the lampposts as he went along is it wonderful that he could not get rid of the dreadful story it occupied his whole brain it turned everything else outthe great economical article for the nineteenth century all his books all his occupations if he read in the printed page his eyes ran across the lines and up and down the lines but nothing reached his brain the family history was a wall which excluded everything else or it was a jealous tenant who drove every intruder out as with a broom if he tried to write his pen presently dropped from his fingers for the things that lay on his brain were not allowed by that new tenant to escape and all night long and all day long pictures rose up and floated before his eyes terrible picturespictures of things that belonged to the history pictures that followed each other like animated photographs irrepressible not to be concealed or denied or refused admission this obsession was only just beginning it intended to become deeper and stronger it was going to hold him with grip and claw never to let him go by night or day until but the end he could not understand you know how at the first symptoms of a long illness there falls upon the soul a premonitory sadness the nurses and the doctors utter words of cheerfulness and hope there is a loophole there always is a loophole until the climax and the turningpoint the patient hears and tries to receive solace but he knows better he knows without being told that he stands on the threshold of the torture chamber the door opens he steps in because he must he will lie there and suffero lord how long with such boding and gloom of soulboding without words gloom inarticulateleonard walked slowly homewards it was about three in the afternoon that he mounted his stairs in his mood brooding over the newfound tragedies it seemed quite natural and a thing to be expected that his cousin mary anne should be sitting on the stairs opposite his closed door she rose timidly the man said he could not tell when you would come home so i waited she explained he ought to have asked you to wait inside did you tell him who you were no it doesnt matter im sorry to disturb your sabbath calm my oh yes pray come in she obeyed and sat down by the fire glancing round the room curiously in her lap lay a brownpaper parcel i thought you would come home to dinner after chapel she began so i got here about one she observed that his face showed some trouble and she hesitated to go on have you come to tell me of more family misfortunes he asked abruptly oh she said i wish i hadnt come i told her you didnt want it and you wouldnt like it besides whats the use it all happened so long ago but granny would have it ive brought you a book she says you must read it if youd rather not have it i will take it back again granny ought to know that you dont want to be worried about these old things he pulled himself together and assumed a mask of cheerfulness nonsense he said why should i not read about these old things which are to me so new they belong to me as much as to you he observed the girl more narrowly while he spoke her words and her hesitation showed perception and feeling at least as for her appearance she was short and sturdy her features were cast in one of the more common moulds she wore a black cloth jacket and a skirt of dark green serge a modest hat with black plumes nodding over her head in the hearselike fashion of the day before yesterday and her gloves were doubtful the first impression was of complete insignificance the second impression was of a girl who might interest one her eyes were goodthey were the eyes of her grandmother her hands were small and delicatethey were the hands of her grandmother her voice was clear and soft with a distinct utterance quite unlike the thick and husky people among whom she lived in all these points she resembled her grandmother leonard observed these thingsit was a distraction to think of the cousin apart from the family historyand became interested in the girl my cousin he said unexpectedly you are very much like your grandmother like granny she coloured with pleasure as she was not a girl who kept company with anyone she had never before received a compliment why she is beautiful still and i oh she laughed you have her voice and her eyes she seems to be a very sweet and gentle lady she is the sweetest old lady in the world and the gentlest and oh shes had an awful time i am sorry to think so she cried with pleasure and pride when you went away for fifty years not a single member of her family has been to see her i never saw her take on so and you so kind and friendly sam said you had as much pride as a duke your brother should not judge by first appearances and you were not proud a bit well granny said nobody ever told him of the family misfortunes and its shameful ive told him some but not all and now ill send him my scrapbook with the trial in itthe trial you know of john dunning for the wilful murder of langley holme and ive brought it here it is she handed him the parcel in her lap thats why i came thank you said leonard laying it carelessly on the table i will read it or look at it some time but i own i am not greatly interested in the trial it took place too long ago once she had another copy but she gave it to your grandfather a few days before he killed himself leonard remembered these words afterwards for the moment they had no meaning for him granny says weve got hereditary misfortunes so she told me hereditary why his brow contracted i dont know why hereditary misfortunes are supposed to imply ancestral crimes she puts it like this if it hadnt been hereditary misfortune she wouldnt have married grandfather he wouldnt have been bankrupt father wouldnt have been only a small clerk sam would have been something in a large way and i should be a lady instead of a board school teacher you can be both my cousin now look at the other side your grandfather was ruined i take it by his own incompetence his poverty was his own doing your father never rose in the world i suppose because he had no power of fight your brother has got into a respectable profession what right has he to complain thats what i say sometimes granny wont have it shes all for hereditary illluck as if we are to suffer for what was done a hundred years ago i dont believe it for my part do you he thought of his talk with constance in the country road it is a dreadful question do not let it trouble us let us go on with our work and not think about it its all very well to say dont think about it when she talks about nothing else especially when she looks at sam and thinks of you there was something else i wanted to say she dropped her head and began nervously to twitch with her fingertips im almost ashamed to say it sam would never forgive me but i think of granny first and of all she has endured and i must warn you she looked round there was nobody else present its about sam my brother i must warn youi must because he may make mischief between you and granny he will find that difficult well go on he goes to your village in the country he sits and talks with the people he pretends that he goes to see how the old man is getting on but it is really to find out all he can about the property what has he to do with the property he wants to find out what is to become of all the money does he think that the rustics can tell him i dont know you see his head is filled with the hope of getting some of the money he wants to get it divided among the heirs its what he calls the accumulations accumulations leonard repeated impatiently they are all in a tale i know nothing about these accumulations or what will be done with them sam is full of suspicions he thinks there is a conspiracy to keep him out oh does he well tell him that my greatgrandfathers solicitor receives the rents and deals with them as he is instructed i for one am not consulted i said you knew nothing about it granny was so angry you see sam can think of nothing else hes been unlucky lately and he comforts himself with calculating what the money comes to hes made me do sumsoh scores of sumsin compound interest for him sam never got so far himself if youve never worked it out i never have like sam i have not got so far well it really comes to a most wonderful sum sometimes i think that the rule must be wrong it mounts up to about a million and a half does it leonard replied carelessly let your brother understand if you can that he builds his hopes on a very doubtful succession half of it he expects to get granny and you he says are the only heirs what is hers he says is his so he has made her sign a paper giving him all her share oh and where do you come in there will be nothing for me because it will all be grannys and she has signed that paper so that it is to be all his i am sorry that she has signed anything though i do not suppose such a document would stand sam says she owes the family for fifty years maintenance that is without counting outofpocket expenses incidentals and rent how he makes it out i dont know because poor old granny doesnt cost more than a year and i find that cant he claim that money of course not she owes him nothing your brother is not i fear quite aa straightwalking christian is he she sighed hes a church member but then he says its good for business mother sides with sam they are both at her every day oh mr campaigne is it all sams fancy will there be no money at all when he finds it out hell go off his head for sure i dont know dont listen to him dont think about the money i must sometimes its lovely to think about being rich after youve been so poor why sometimes weve had to go for dayswe womenwith a kippered herring or a bloater and a piece of bread for dinner and as for clothes and gloves and nice things but now you have an income and you have your work those days are gone dont dream of sudden wealth she got up i wont think about it its wicked to dream about being rich what would you do with money if you had it first of all it would be so nice not to think about the rent and not to worry when illness came into the house how the doctor was to be paid and next sam would be always in a good temper no said leonard decidedly sam would not always be in a good temper then i should take granny away and leave mother and sam you would have to give up your work you knowthe school and the children and everything couldnt i go on with the school certainly not i shouldnt like that oh i couldnt give up the school and the children wellbut what would you buy booksi should buy books you can get them at the free library for nothing do you want fine clothes every woman likes to look nice she said but not fine clothesi couldnt wear fine clothes then youd be no better off than you are now do you want a carriage no ive got my bike do you want money to give away no it only makes poor people worse to give them money very well now my cousin you have given yourself a lesson you have work that you like you have a reasonably good salary you have access to booksas many as you want you can dress yourself as you please and as you wish would you improve your food oh the foods good enough we women dont care much what we eat as for sam hes always wanting more buttered toast with his tea rapacious creature now mary anne please to reflect on these things and dont talk about family misfortunes so long as you yourself are concerned and just think what a miserable girl you would be if you were to become suddenly rich she laughed merrily miserable she said i never thought of that you mean that i shouldnt know what to do with the money no not that you wouldnt know what to do with yourself you have been brought up to certain standards if you were rich you would have to change them the only way to be rich said this philosopher who was going to inherit a goodly estate is to be born rich and so not to feel the burden of wealth i suppose so i wish you would say it all over again for sam to hear not that he would listen and how would you like just to have everything you want by merely calling for it there is no desire for anything with a rich girl no trying to get it no waiting for it no getting it at last and enjoying it all the more wont you think of this i will yes i will put the horrid thought of the money out of your head altogether and go on with your work and be happy in it she nodded gravely i am happy in it only sometimes and remember please if there is anythinganything at all that it would please your grandmother to have let me know will you let me know and will you have the pleasure of giving it to her yes i willi will and will you come again soon i will call again very soon i will tell granny it will please heroh more than i can say and youll read the book wont you just to please her i will read the book to please her she longs to see you again and so do i oh mr campaignecousin thenits just lovely to hear you talk chapter x a dinner at the club leonard stood looking straight before him when the girl had gone well the omissions so much regretted by constance seemed to be fully supplied he was now exactly like other people with poor relations and plenty of scandals and people to be ashamed of only a week ago he had none of these things now he was supplied with all nothing was wanting he was richly if unexpectedly endowed with these gifts which had been at first withheld as yet he hardly rose to the situation he felt no gratitude he would have resigned these new possessions willingly the tragedies the new cousins the ennobling theory of hereditary sorrow he remembered the brownpaper parcel which he had promised to read he tore off the covering within there was a foolscap volume of the kind called scrapbook he opened it and turned over the pages it was more than half filled with newspaper cuttings and writing between and before and after the cuttings as he turned the pages there fell upon him a sense of loathing unutterable he threw the book from him and fell back upon an easychair half unconscious when he recovered he picked up the book the same feeling but not so strong fell upon him again he laid it down gently as a thing which might do him harm he felt cold he shivered for the first time in his life he was afraid of something he felt that deadly terror which superstitious men experience in empty houses and lonely places in the darka terror inexplicable that comes unasked and without cause this young man was not in the least degree superstitious he had no terror at all concerning things supernatural he would have spent a night alone in a church vault among coffins and bones and grinning skulls without a tremor therefore this strange dread as of coming evil astonished him it seemed to him connected with the book he took it up and laid it down over and over again always that shiver of dread that sinking of the heart returned he thought that he would leave the book and go out he would overcome this weakness on his return and he remembered that the returned australianthe man of wealth the successful man of the familywas to dine with him at the club he left the book on the table he took his hat and he sallied forth to get through the hours before dinner away from the sight of this enchanted volume charged with spells of fear and trembling uncle fred arrived in great spirits a fine figure of colonial prosperity talking louder than was considered in that club to be good form he called for a brandy and bitters and then for another which astonished the occupants of the morningroom then he declared himself ready for dinner he was he displayed not only an uncommon power of putting away food but also an enviable power of taking his wine as a running stream never stopping he swallowed the champagne served after the modern fashion with no other wine as if it was a brook falling continuously into a cave without pause or limit when the dinner was over a small forest of bottles had been successively opened and depleted never had the clubwaiters gazed upon a performance so brilliant in a house where most men considered a mere little pint of claret to be a fair whack a proper allowance after dinner this admirable guest absorbed a bottle of claret then on adjourning to the smokingroom he took coffee and three glasses of curaoa in rapid succession then he lit a cigar and called for a soda and whisky at regular intervals of a quarter of an hour he called for another soda and whisky let us not count them they were like the kisses of lovers never to be counted or reckoned either for praise or blame it was halfpast nine when this phenomenal consumption of wine and whisky began and it lasted until halfpast eleven leonard was conscious that the other men in the room were fain to look on in speechless wonder the increased seriousness in the waiters faces showed their appreciation and envy the clubwaiter loveth most the happy few who drink with freedom his most serious admiration and respect go forth to one who becomes a mere cask of wine and yet shows no signs of consequences now this performer from start to finish turned not a hair there was no thickness in his speech there was no sign of any effect of strong drink upon this big man that he talked more loudly than was at this club generally liked is true but then he always talked loud enough to be heard in every part of the largest room the things of which he spoke the stories he told the language in which he clothed these stories astonished the other members who were presentastonished and delighted them beyond measure because such a loud and confident guest had never before been known in the place and because it had been the fortune of campaigne leonard campaignethe blameless the austere the coldwho had brought this elderly bounder this empty hogshead or barrel to be filled with strong drink this trumpetvoiced utterer of discreditable stories next day there were anecdotes told in the club by those who had been present and scoffers laughed and those who had not been present envied those who had leonard said this delightful guest late in the evening and in a louder voice than ever i suppose someone has told you about the rowyou knowwhen i had to leave the country there had been plenty of rows before but i mean the big row you were only three or four years old at the time i suppose you cant remember the other men lifted their heads they were like mrs cluppins listening they scorned but the words were forced upon them no one told methat is to say i heard something the other day no detailssomething alleged as the cause would you like to know the real truth no good heavens no let bygone scandals rest he replied in a murmur as low as extreme indignation would allow let the thing diedie and be forgotten my dear nephewhe laid a great hand on leonards kneei dare say they told you the truth only you seehe said this horrid thing loud enough to gratify the curiosity of all presentthe real truth is that the fellow who put the name at the bottom of you know what and did the rest of it was not me but the other fellowchris thats all chris the respectable it wasnot me i tell you i want to know nothing about it i dont care you must after all these years do you think now that i am home again with my pile made that im going to labour under such an imputation any longer no sir ive come to hold up my head like you chris may hang his if he likes i wont boy another whisky and soda in those days chris and i hunted in couples very good sport we had too then we got through the money and there was tightness chris did it run him in if you like for you see enough saidenough said leonard looked round the room there were only three or four men present they sat singly each with a magazine in his hand they preserved the attitude of those who read critically but there was a jenesaisquoi about them which suggested that they had heard the words of this delightful guest indeed he spoke loud enough for all to hear it is not every day that one can hear in a respectable club revelations about putting somebodys name on the front and on the back of a document vaguely described as you know what enough said leonard repeated impatiently my dear fellow you interrupt i am going to set the whole thing right if youll let me i dont want to hear it it isnt what you want to hear its what youve got to hear said uncle fred impressively and earnestly he had taken even for him a little more than was good for him it made him obstinate it also made his speech uncertain as to loudness and control he carried off these defects with increased earnestness character leonard character is involved and selfrespect also forgiveness i am not come home to bear malice as will be shown by my testamentary dispositions when abraham calls me to his bosom oh but really reallyyou shall hear boy why the devil do you keep me waiting for another whisky and soda look here leonard there was a moneylender in it never mind the moneylender i must mind him man he was in it i quite forget at this moment where old cent per cent got in but he was thereoh yes he was there he always was there in those days either for chris or for me devil of a fellow chris now then the moneylending wormor crocodilewanted to be paid he was always wanting to be paid either it was chris or it was me let me think does it matter truth sir and character always matter what the moneylender said i forget at this moment i dare say chris knows it was more his affair than mine it amounted to this he drained his glass again and forgot what he had intended to say when the fellow was gone chris i said heres a pretty hole youre in i am certain that he was in the hole and not me because what was done you know was intended to pull him out of the hole so it must have been chris and not me it is necessary he added with dignity to make this revolutionrevelation it is due to selfrespect my brother chris then you understand was in the hole boy ill take another whisky and soda i want you to understand exactly what happened leonard groaned of course when it came to sticking a name on a paper and that paper a cheque for the lords sake man stop leonard whispered i knew and told him that the world which is a harsh world and never makes allowance would call the thing by a bad name which happened but who could foresee that they would tack that name on to me leonard sprang to his feet the thing was becoming serious it is eleven oclock he said i must go go why ive only just begun to settle down for a quiet talk i thought we should go on till two or three and ive nearly done ive only got to show that the cheque noi must go at once i have an appointment i have work to do i have letters to write uncle fred slowly rose its a degenerate world he said we never thought the day properly begun before midnight but if these are your habitswell leonard youve done me well the champagne was excellent boyno ill wait till i get back to the hotel then two or three glasses and so to bed moderationtemperanceearly hours these are now my motto and my rule this way down the stairs said leonard for his uncle was starting off in the opposite direction one warning dont talk to chris about that story for youll hear a garbled versiongarbled sirgarbled he lurched a little as he walked down the stairs but otherwise there were no indications of the profound and gargantuan thirst that he had been assuaging all the evening leonard went home in the deepest depression and shame why did he take such a man to such a club he should have given him dinner in the rowdiest tavern filled with the noisiest topers he cannot be really what he pretends leonard thought a man of wealth is a man of responsibility and position this man talks without any dignity or reticence whatever he seems to associate still with larrikins and cattledrovers he sits in bars and saloons he ought to keep better company if only on account of his prosperity the family history asserted itself again you have entertained it said another unfortunate here is a man nearly fifty years of age he has revealed himself and exposed himself he is by his own confession although he is rich and successful the companion and the friend of riffraff his sentiments are theirs he has no morals he drinks without stint or measure he has disgraced you in the club no doubt the committee will interfere it is the moralist declares an age of great laxity a man may make a living in more ways than were formerly thought creditable men are admitted to clubs who formerly would not have dared to put their names down in leonards mind there still remained strong and clear the opinion that there are some things which a gentleman should not do things which he must not do companions with whom he must not sit yet it appeared from the revelations of this man that whatever he had done he had habitually consorted with tramps hawkers peddlers and shepherds chapter xi the book of extracts leonard turned up his light in the study his eye fell upon the book of extracts he looked at his watch nearly twelve he took up the book resolutely another wave of loathing rolled over his mind he beat it back he forced himself to open the book and to begin from the beginning the contents consisted as he had already seen of cuttings from a newspaper with a connecting narrative in writing on the titlepage was written in a fine italian hand the following brief explanation this book was given to me by mrs nicols our housekeeper for thirty years she cut out from the newspapers all that was printed about the crime and what followed there are accounts of the murder the inquest and the trial she also added notes of her own on what she herself remembered and had seen she made two cuttings of each extract and two copies of her own notes these she pasted in two scrapbooks she gave me one the other i found in her room after her death i sent the latter copy to my brother three days before he committed suicide this statement was signed lucy galley ne campaigne the extracts and cuttings followed some of the less necessary details are here suppressed the first extract was from the weekly paper of the nearest county town we are grieved to report the occurrence of a crime which brings the deepest disgrace upon our neighbourhood hitherto remarkably free from acts of violence the victim is a young gentleman amiable and respected by everyonemr langley holme of westerdene house near the town of amersham the unfortunate gentleman had been staying for some days at the house of his brotherinlaw mr algernon campaigne jp of campaigne park on tuesday may as will be seen from our report of the inquest the two gentlemen started together for a walk after breakfast it was about ten oclock they walked across the park they crossed the highroad beyond they climbed over a stile into a large field and they walked together along the pathway through the field as far as a small wood which lies at the bottom of the field then mr campaigne remembered some forgotten business or appointment and left his friend returning by himself when mr holme was discoveredit is not yet quite certain how long after mr campaigne left him but it was certainly two hourshe was lying on the ground quite dead his head literally battered in by a thick clubthe branch of a tree either pulled off for the purpose or lying on the ground ready to the hand of the murderer they carried the body back to the house where he had been staying it is sad to relate that the unfortunate mans sister mr campaignes wife was so shocked by the news which seems to have been announced or shouted roughly and without any precaution about breaking it gently that she was seized with the pains of labour and in an hour was dead thus the unfortunate gentleman mr algernon campaigne himself quite young has been deprived in one moment so to speak of wife and brotherinlaw mr langley holme was also a married man and leaves one young child a daughter to weep with her mother over their irreparable loss the inquest was held on wednesday morning then followed a passage in writing i was in my own room the housekeepers room which is the last room of the south wing on the groundfloor overlooking the garden there is an entrance to the house at that end for servants and things brought to the house at ten oclock in the morning just after the clock in the stables struck i saw the master with mr langley holme walking across the terrace down the gardens and so to the right into the park they were talking together friendly and full of life being both of them young gentlemen of uncommon vivacity and spirit with a temper too both of them as becomes the master of such a place as his which cannot be ruled by a meek and lowly one but calls for a high spirit and a temper becoming and masterful threequarters of an hour afterwards i heard steps in the garden and looked up from my work it was the master coming home alone he was walking fast and he was swinging his arms as id often seen him do now i think of it his face was pale one would think that he had a presentiment he entered the house by the garden door and went into his study now this morning my lady when we called her was not at all well and the question was whether we should send for the doctor at once but she refused to consent saying that it would pass away and so she took breakfast in bed but i was far from easy about her i wish now with all my heart that i had sent a note to the doctor who lived three miles away if it was only for him to have driven over besides as things turned out he might have been with her when the news came however about twelve oclock or a little after i heard steps in the garden and i saw a sight which froze my very blood for four men were carrying a shutter walking slowly and on the shutter was a blanket and beneath the blanket was a form oh there is no mistaking such a form as thatit was a human form my heart fell i say like lead and i ran out crying oh in gods name what has happened said one of them john dunning by name its mr holme i found him dead someones murdered him i screeched i ran back to the house i ran into the kitchen i told them never thinking in the horror of it of my poor lady then all over the house suddenly the air was filled with the shrieks of women alas my lady had got up she was dressed she was on the landing she heard the cries what has happened she asked mr holme is murdered i do not know who told her none of the maids confessed the thing but when she heard the news she fell back all of a sudden like a woman knocked down we took her up and carried her to bed when the doctor came in an hour my lady was deadthe most beautiful the kindest the sweetest most generoushearted lady that ever lived she was dead and all we could do was to look after the newborn babe and as for her husband that poor gentleman sat in his study with haggard looks and face all drawn with his grief so that it was a pity and a terror to look upon him wife and brotherinlawwife and friendboth cut off in a single morning did one ever hear the like as for the unfortunate victim mr holme that had been they laid him in the diningroom to wait the inquest at this point leonard laid down the book and looked round the place was quite quiet even from the street there came no noise of footsteps or of wheels once more he was overpowered by this strange loathinga kind of sickness he closed his eyes and lay back before him as in a vivid dream he saw that procession with the body of the murdered man and he saw the murdered lady fall shrieking to the ground and he saw the old recluse of the park then young sitting alone with haggard face while one body lay in the diningroom and the other on the marriagebed the feeling of sickness passed away leonard opened his eyes and forced himself but with a beating heart and a dreadful feeling of apprehension to go on with the reading i remember that the house was very quiet so quiet that we could hear in my roomthe housekeepers roomthe cries and shouts of the two little boys in the nursery which was the room next to where the mother lay dead the boys were master langley the eldest who was three and master christopher then a year and a half little did those innocents understand of the trouble that was coming upon them from the terrible tragedy of that day they would grow up without a motherthe most terrible calamity that can befall a child and they were to grow up as well without a father for the master has never recovered the shock and now i fear never will on the wednesday morning the next day the coroner came with his jury and held the inquest they viewed the body in the diningroom i was present and heard it all the report of the paper is tolerably accurate so far as i remember the newspaper began again at this point on wednesday last the th inst an inquest was held at campaigne park on the body of langley holme esquire justice of the peace of westerdene house near amersham aged twentyeight years the unfortunate gentleman as narrated in our last number was found dead under circumstances that pointed directly to murder in a wood not far from campaigne park where he was staying as the guest of his friend and brotherinlaw mr algernon campaigne the cause of death was certified by dr alden he deposed that it was caused by a single blow from a heavy club or branch which had probably been picked up close by the club was lying on the tablea jagged branch thick at one end which was red with blood the nature of the wound showed that it was one blow only and that by a most determined and resolute hand which had caused death and that death must have been instantaneous mr algernon campaigne jp of campaigne park deposed that the deceased named langley holme his brotherinlawhis wifes brother and his most intimate friendwas staying with them and that on tuesday morning the two started together after breakfast for a walk they walked through the park crossed the road got over the stile on the other side and followed the pathway under the hill they were entering the wood in which the body was found when he himself recollected a letter which had to be written and posted that morning he therefore stopped and explained that he must return immediately unfortunately his brotherinlaw chose to continue his walk alone mr campaigne turned and walked home as quickly as he could he saw the deceased no more until he was brought back dead the coroner asked him if he had observed anyone in the wood he said he had not looked about him carefully but that he had seen nobody a little boy who gave the name of tommy dadd and said that he knew the meaning of an oath deposed that he was on the hillside scaring birds all day that he saw the two gentlemen get over the stile walk along the footpath together talking fast and loud that they came to the wood and that one of them mr campaigne turned back that he looked up and down the path as if he was expecting somebody and then walked away very fast stop said the coroner let us understand these facts quite plainly you saw mr campaigne and the deceased get over the stile and walk as far as the wood yes and you saw mr campaigne turn back and walk away yes go on then a long time after that i see john dunning walking from the farm across the field to the pathway he was carrying a basket of something over his shoulder he wore his smockfrock he went into the wood too presently he came out and ran back to the farmyard and three other men came and carried something away did nobody else go into the wood no nobody john dunning said that he was a labourer that on the day in question he was on his way to some work and had to pass through the wood that halfway through he came upon what he thought was a man asleep when he looked closer he found that it was a gentleman and he was dead and he lay in a pool of blood there was no scuffle of feet or sign of a struggle that he tried to lift him getting his hands and frock covered with bloodstains that he found a bit of rough and jagged wood lying beside the body which was covered with blood at one end that on making this discovery he ran out of the wood and made his way as fast as he could to the nearest farm where he gave the alarm and got four men to come with him carrying a shutter and a blanket the coroner crossexamined this witness severely where did he work was he a native of the village had he ever been in trouble what was it he was carrying on his shoulder would he swear it was not the club that had been found near the body to all these questions the man gave a straightforward answer the coroner then asked him if he had searched the pockets of the deceased at this point the deceaseds valet stood up and said that his master had not been robbed that his watch and rings and purse were all found upon him in his pockets i presume that the murderer had no time said the coroner he must have been disturbed i never yet heard of a murder that was not a robbery unless indeed there was revenge in it mr campaigne interposed i would suggest mr coroner he said with submission sir said the coroner your suggestions are instructions i venture then to suggest that perhaps there may have been some person or persons unknown in the wood the boys evidence was straightforward but he could not see through the wood that is true call up the parish constable this officer stood up to give evidence he was asked if there were any dangerous or suspicious persons in or near the village if he had seen any tramps sturdy vagabonds gipsies or in fact any persons who might reasonably be suspected of this outrage there was no one the village he said was quite quiet and well behaved he was asked if there were poachers about he said there were poachers whom he knew very well and so did his honours gamekeeper but in the month of may there was little or nothing to poach and no excuse for going into the wood besides why should they go into the wood at ten in the morning he was quite confident that the village poachers had nothing to do with the business my suggestion sir said mr campaigne seems unproductive nevertheless there was the chance that the mystery might be explained if we could in this way light upon a clue there is another way of explanation said the coroner grimly he put other questions to the constable had he seen any gipsies or tramps about the village or on the road the constable declared that he had seen none that the village lying as it did off the main road from which it was not even visible did not attract gipsies or tramps or vagabonds of any description had the constable observed any case of drunkenness he had not there were men who sometimes took more beer than was good for them but they carried their liquor peaceably and did not become quarrelsome in their cups we come next said the coroner to the question whether the deceased gentleman had any private enmities to fear to this mr campaigne made reply my brotherinlaw sir was a man who may have made enemies as a magistrate especially among poachers but if so these enemies would be all in his own part of the county fifteen miles away in this place he could have had neither friends nor enemies then gentlemen of the jury said the coroner we can find no motive for the crime i said just now that there was another explanation possible we can put aside the theory of poachers being disturbed at their work and the theory of private enmity and the theory of tramp or gipsy attacking him for the sake of robbery we come back therefore to the broad facts at ten in the morning the deceased entered the woodalone at twelve the man dunning ran out his smockfrock covered with blood he said that he had found the dead body of this gentleman lying on the grass and he had tried to lift it getting his smockfrock stained with blood in doing so now gentlemen what was the good of trying to lift a dead body on the other hand suppose that a man finding this gentleman unarmed perhaps asleep conceived the sudden thought of killing him for the sake of taking his money suppose him to have been disturbed or to have thought himself disturbedit might be by the birdscaring boywhat would he do naturally he would give the alarm and pretend that the crime was committed by another man you gentlemen of the jury will form your own conclusion you will return such a verdict as seems to you reasonable leaving further investigation to the law far be it from me to suggest your verdict or to influence your judgment you have now to consider how and by whom this murderas clear a case of murder as has ever been knownwas committed the jury considered their verdict for half an hour they then returned a verdict of wilful murder against john dunning the man was standing alone by this time everybody shunned him when the verdict was given he cried out no no i never done it i never done it passionately or with some show of passion the constable arrested him on the spot after the first ejaculation the man became quite passive and made no kind of resistance the coroner turned to mr campaigne you are a magistrate sir you can formally commit the man for trial i commit this man the bereaved gentleman seemed to have difficulty in understanding the matter however he came to himself and performed his duties mechanically the man john dunning now lies in gaol awaiting his trial we would not say anything to forejudge the case but it certainly looks black so far against the accused to this the housekeeper added the coroners court was full and a sorrowful sight it was to see the master tall and handsome and upright but ashy pale on the same day in the afternoon they buried both the brother and the sister in the parish church they lie side by side in the chancel then followed the report of the trial of john dunning part of it is a repetition of the evidence heard at the inquest he was defended by counsel and a very able counsel tooa young man who had taken the greatest pains to get up the case leonard knew the name later on he had become a judge the crossexamination was keen and searching every little point was made the most of the report gave at full length all the evidence and the speeches in this place it is sufficient to give the most important questions and answers the counsel had a map of the wood he made a great deal out of this map he called attention to distances for instance it would take five minutes only to get from the wood to the farm on these points he crossexamined mr campaigne closely i believe it is a small woodlittle more than a coppice it is very little more than a coppice how long now would it take you to walk through the wood from end to end not five minutes are there any seats in the woodany places where a man might sit down none did your friend express any intention of lingering in the wood or was there any reason why he should linger in the wood no certainly not he entered the wood at a quick pace and so far as i know he intended to keep it up he was walking partly for exercise and partly to look at the condition of the fields there were no seats in the wood the counsel returned to the point were there any fallen trees to sit down upon not to my knowledge was it a morning for lying down on the grass no there had been rain the path was muddy and the grass was wet did you suppose that the deceased would loiter about in the wet wood in the mud and in the long grass in the wood for two long hours i do not i think it most improbableeven impossible your suggestion is that there was someone lurking in the wood everything points to that in my opinion otherwise on the theory of the prosecution your brotherinlaw must have stood in the wood doing nothing for nearly two hours because nobody disputes the fact that the prisoner entered the wood a little before twelve that is so i think i am sorry to press you mr campaigne on a subject so painful but i have a life to save do you suppose that your friend was one who would be likely to yield up his life without a struggle certainly not he was a strong and resolute man again look at the prisoner who was not more than five feet five do you suppose that your friend would stand still to be killed by a little man like that it is absurd to suppose anything of the kind he might have been taken unawares but then the blow would have been at the back of the head now it was in the front do you suppose it possible that this labouring man should on entering the wood suddenly resolve upon taking a strange gentlemans life without a motive not even with the hope of plundershould rush upon him find him off his guard and succeed in taking his life without receiving a blow or a scratch i certainly do not i consider the thing absolutely impossible do you suppose that if all these improbabilities or impossibilities had taken place the man would have run back covered with blood to tell what he had found and to pretend that some other man had done it i certainly do not the boy who had already given his evidence was recalled how long was it after mr holme went into the wood before john dunning went in it was a long time we know the facts already said the judge the two gentlemen went out at ten they would reach the wood according to this map about fifteen minutes past ten the dead body was brought home a little after noon therefore as the prisoner was only a few minutes in the wood it must have been about twenty minutes to twelve that he went in and remained my lord no more than a few minutes so it would seem from the evidence much mischief however may be done in a few minutes the counsel recalled the doctor when you saw the body it was i think you said a little before one oclock that is so the body was then quite stiff and dead you say quite it had been dead some timeperhaps two hours it had been dead two hours you are quite sure i will not swear to the exact time i will say a long while if the boys evidence as to the time occupied by the prisoner in the wood is correct death would have been caused a few minutes before the men brought the shutter the body would have been quite warm it would nowyou saw the wound indicate for the jury exactly where it was the doctor laid his hand on the top of his head not the front but the top very good mr holme was six feet high look at the prisoner is it possible that so short a man could have inflicted such a blow on the top of the head not unless he found his victim seated quite so and we have heard from mr campaigne that it was impossible to sit down in the wet wood thank you one need not go on this was the most important part of the evidence at first it looked very bad against the prisoner no one else in the wood the blood on the smock the weapon with which the deed was accomplished the apparent impossibility of anyone else being the criminal then came this clever lawyer upon the scene and in a little while the whole of the case fell to pieces first the doctors evidence that death had been caused two hours before the prisoner entered the wood the evidence of the boy that the prisoner had gone in only a few minutes before he came out running that was positive evidence in his favour there was next the evidence of mr campaigne his brotherinlaw was the last man in the world who would be murdered without making a fight he was a powerful man much stronger than the fellow charged with murdering him he was not taken unawares but received the fatal blow in full front again there was no robbery if a poor man commits the crime of murder he does it either for revenge or for jealousy or for robbery there could be none of those motives at work in the murder of this unfortunate gentleman lastly there was the best possible testimony in favour of the prisoners personal character this is not of much use where the evidence is strong but when it is weak it may be of the greatest possible help his employer stated that the prisoner was a good workman who knew his business that he was sober and industrious and honest the least likely man on his farm to commit this atrocious act the judge summed up favourably the jury retired to consider their verdict they came back after an hour verdict not guilty quite right said leonard laying down the book the man john dunning certainly was innocent of this charge then followed more writing by the housekeeper when the verdict was declared the prisoner stepped down and was greeted with friendly congratulations by his master the farmer and others the judge before leaving the court sent for mr campaigne sir he said shaking hands with him we have to deplore our own loss as well as yours in the melancholy events of that day for my own part although i consider the verdict of the jury amply justified by the evidence i should like your opinion on the matter if it is worth your attention you shall hear it i had already made up my mind on the point the evidence at the inquest was quite incomplete after talking the matter over with the doctor i was convinced that the murder was most certainly committed long before the man dunning went into the wood at all the state of the body showed if medical evidence is worth anything that death had taken place two hours before that is before elevenin fact shortly after i left him he must have been walking straight to his death when i left him and saw him striding along through the wood and have you been able to form any theory at all none had there been robbery i should have suspected gipsies our own people about here are quiet and harmless such a thing as wilful and deliberate murder would be impossible for them so the case only becomes the more mysterious i felt so strongly as to the mans innocence that i not only provided him with counsel but i also provided counsel with my own full statement of the case the murderer of my brotherinlaw the slayer of my wifehere mr campaigne turned very palewill be discovered some time or other he must be discovered i have understood that murder lies on the conscience until life becomes intolerable then the man confesses and welcomes the shameful death to end it let us wait till the murderer finds his burden too heavy to be borne yet said the judge one would like to find him out by means of the law well said mr campaigne for my own part i resolved that i would do all in my power so that an innocent man should not suffer for the guilty if i could prevent it sir said the judge your conduct is what the world expects of a noble gentleman there remains one conclusion it is that there was someone concealed in the wood the boy said that no one went out he was thinking of the two ends but he could not perhaps see through the wood or beyond the wood it is not yet perhaps too late to search for footsteps however no doubt all that can be done will be done so the trial was finished i have not heard that any further examination of the spot was made as all the village and people from neighbouring villages and the nearest markettowns crowded over every sunday for weeks after gazing at the spot where the body was found it was of very little use to look for footsteps the man john dunning went back to work but the village folkhis old friendsturned against him they would no longer associate with him the taint of murder was upon him though he was as innocent a man as ever stepped the vicar spoke to the people but it was in vain anyone who had been tried for murder must be a murderer and he was shunned like a leper or a madman then the vicar spoke about it to the squire who gave john money so that he might emigrate and with all his family he went to botany bay where the people are not all convicts i am told there at least it ought not to be thrown in a mans teeth that he had been tried and acquitted for murder i have never heard what became of john dunning and his family afterwards the squire offered a reward of for the apprehension and conviction of some person unknown who had murdered mr langley holme the printed bill remained on the church door for yearslong after the rain had washed out the letters until the whole bill was finally washed out and destroyed but the reward was never claimed nor was there any attempt to fix the guilt upon another and as time went on a belief grew up in the minds of the world that notwithstanding the acquittal no other was possible as the criminal than john dunning himself so that it was a fortunate thing for him that he went away when he did before the popular belief was turned quite so dead against him the wood became haunted no one dared pass through it alone even by day because the murdered man walked by day as well as by night i cannot say for myself that i ever actually saw the ghostnot that is to say to recognise the poor gentleman though there are plenty of credible witnesses who swear to having seen itin the twilight in the moonlight and in the sunshine but one day when i was walking home from the villageit was in the morning about eleven oclocki saw a strange thing which made my heart stand still it was a spring day with a fresh breeze and sunshine but with flying clouds they made light and shadow over the fields in the wood which as was stated at the trial was more of a coppice than a wood composed of slender trees such as birches which were on one side and firs and larches on the other with a good deal of undergrowth among the birches i saw as clear as ever i saw anything in my life a figureoh quite plaina figure under the birches and among the bushes and undergrowth i knew there could be no one there but i saw a figure plain as the figure of man or woman it had its back to me and i made out head and shoulders and arms the rest of the body was hidden while i looked the shadow passed away and the sun came out then the figure disappeared i waited for it to return it did not i crept slowly through the wood looking about fearfully to right and left there was nothing the birds were singing and calling to each other but there was no ghost yet i had seen it when i asked myself how it was dressed i could not remember nay i had not observed then there were some to whom the ghost had appeared clad as when he met the murderer nay some to whom it has spoken so that my own evidence is not of so much importance as that of some others after the funeral we could not fail to observe a great change in the habits of my master before the trouble mr campaigne was a man fond of society he would invite friends to dinner two or three times a week he was fond of the bottle but no drunkard once a week he went to the market town and there dined at the gentlemens ordinary he was a justice of the peace and active he farmed himself some of his own land and took an interest in the stock and in the crops he went to church every sunday morning and had prayers every morning for the household he was fond of playing with his children he talked politics and read the paper every week he went hunting once or twice a week in the season he went shooting nearly every day in the autumn he attended the races he was a gardener and looked after his hothouses and conservatories in a word he was a country gentleman who pleased himself with the pursuits of the country he was a good farmer a good landlord a good magistrate a good father and a good christian yet mark what followed when the murder happened the body was placed in the diningroom the master went into the library there he had his meals served he never entered the diningroom afterwards he sat in the library when he was not walking on the terrace alone suddenly not little by little he abandoned everything he left off going to church he left off going to market he left off shooting hunting gardening farming reading he gave up company he refused to see anyone he opened no letters he held no family prayers he paid no attention to his children if he found them playing he passed by the innocents as if they had been strangers as for the youngest she who cost her mother her life i doubt if he ever saw her or knew who she was if he did see her and so it has continued all these years sometimes the lawyer comes over when money is wanted then the money is obtained but he never speaks he listens and signs a cheque as his housekeeper i used to present an open bill from time to time the money was put upon the bill with no question the grooms have been long dismissed the horses turned out to grass are long dead the dogs are dead the garden has run to seed and weed the rooms in which there has been no fire or light or air or anything are mouldering in decay as for the poor unfortunate children they grew up somehow the master would allow no interference on the part of his own family the lawyer mr ducie was the only person who could persuade him to anything the boys were sent to a preparatory school and then to a public school the second went into the navynever was there a more gallant or handsome boybut he was drowned the elder went to oxford and into parliament but he killed himself the girl married a merchant who turned out bad everything turned out bad it was a most unfortunate family father and children alikeall were unfortunate here ended the housekeepers book of extracts and comments there was appended a letter it was headed marys letter september d dear lucy i have not been able to answer your letter beforebelieve me there are times when the heart must be alone with the heart i have been alone with my sorrowful heartoh my sorrowful heartfor a month since it happened i can now tell you somethingnot allthat has fallen upon us upon my innocent babes and myself you heard that langley took his own life with his own hand four weeks ago you ask now why he did it he was doing wellno one was more promising no one had brighter prospects friends assured me that in proper time i might confidently expect to see him in the cabinet his powers and his influence and his name were improving daily he was acquiring daily greater knowledge of affairs at home i may say truthfully that he was happy with his wife who would have laid down her life cheerfully to make him happy and with his tender children as for anything outside his home such as some young men permit themselves he would have no such thought and could not have as a man who considered his duty to wife and family or as a christian yet he killed himselfoh my dear he killed himselfand i am left why did he do it there was one thing which always weighed heavily upon his mindthe condition of his father he frequently talked of it why he asked should a misfortune such as that which had befallen himthe tragic death of a friend and the sudden death of his wifeso completely destroy a strong man young healthy capable of rising above the greatest possible disasters why should this misfortune change him permanently so that he should neglect everything that he had formerly loved and should become a miserable silent solitary brooding over the past living the useless life of a hermit of course he felt also the neglect in which he and his brother and sister had been left and the lack of sympathy with which his father had always regarded them for remember his father is not insane he is able to transact business perfectly it is only that he refuses to speak or to converse and lives alone now dear lucy i am not going to make any suggestion i want only to tell you exactly what happened you sent him a book of extracts and cuttings with supplementary notes these cuttings were the contemporary account of the murder of mr langley holme the inquest the trial of a man who was acquitted and the strange effect which the whole produced upon mr campaigne then quite a young man he received the book and took it into his study this was in the morning at midnight i looked in he turned his face my dear it was haggard i asked him what was the matter that he looked so ill he replied rambling that the fathers had eaten sour grapes i begged him to leave off and to come upstairs he said something in reply but i did not catch it and so i left him he never came upstairs at five in the morning i woke up and finding that he was not in bed i hurried down the stairs full of sad presentiments alas he was dead do not ask me howhe was dead dear lucy you are now the only one left of the three children i have burnt the book at all events my children shall not see it or hear of this terrible story i implore you to burn your copy mrs galley wrote after this i have read the book again quite through i cannot understand at all why my brother killed himself as for the murderer of course it was the man named john dunning who else could it have been leonard looked up it was three oclock in the morning his face was troubled with doubts and misgiving why did they burn the book he said as for the murder there must have been someone hidden in the wood that is clear no other explanation is possible but why did my grandfather cut his throat there is nothing in the book that could lead him to such an act chapter xii on the site leonard shut the book and threw it aside he sat thinking over it for a little then he thought it was time to go to bed there was not much of the night left in fact it was already broad daylight but if it had been a night of midwinter for darkness he could not have been visited by a more terrifying nightmare in his sleep the family history continued it now took the form of a mysterya mystery in a shape it sat upon his afflicted chest and groaned he was unable to guess or understand what kind of mystery it was or in his sleep to connect it with anything on the earth or in the world outside this earth he woke up and shook it off he went to sleep again and it returned unrelenting it was vague and vast and terrible a thing with which the sufferer wrestled in vain which he could not shake off and could not comprehend there are many kinds of nightmares that of the unintelligible mystery which will not go away and cannot be driven away is one of the worst when he rose late in the morning unrefreshed and tired he did connect the nightmare with something intelligible it arose from the book and its story which like chaucers was left half told that in itself would have mattered little a strange thing happened it began with this morning there fell upon him quite suddenly an irresistible sense that here was a duty laid upon him a duty not to be neglected a thing that had to be done to the exclusion of everything else he had to follow up this story and to recover after seventy years and more the true history of the crime which cast a shadow so long and so terrible upon all those years and the children of those years he looked at the papers on his table they were the halffinished article he had undertaken his mind bidden to think upon the subject rebelled it refused to work it would not be turned in that direction it went off to campaigne park and to seventy years before without words leonard was mysteriously commanded to follow up the story to its proper conclusion without any words he was plainly and unmistakably commanded to follow it up by whom he did not ask he obeyed after seventy years the discovery of the guilty man would seem difficult we find historians grappling with the cases of accused persons and forming conclusions absolutely opposite even when the evidence seems quite full and circumstantial in every point take the case of anne boleyn for instance or that of mary queen of scots two of the most illustrious and most unfortunate princesses what agreement is there among historians concerning these ladies yet there are monumental masses of documentscontemporary voluminous official private epistolary confidential partisanthat exist to help them in this case there were no other documents except those in the book of cuttings all that a private investigation could do was to read the evidence that had already been submitted to two courts and to arrive if possible at some conclusion this leonard proceeded to do he laid aside altogether the work on which he had been engaged he placed the book before him and he read the whole contents again word for word albeit with the same strange shrinking then he made notes the first referred to the man dunning i john dunningthe prisoner was rightly acquitted he was most certainly innocent the boy showed that he had not been in the wood more than two or three minutes the deceased was a man six inches taller than dunning and strong in proportion the latter could only have delivered the fatal blow if he had come upon his victim from behind and while he was sitting but the medical evidence proves that the blow must have been delivered from the front and it was also proved that the grass was too wet from recent showers for the deceased to have been sitting down on it ii the time of deathif the medical evidence is worth anything the man when found had been lying dead for about two hours as was proved by the rigor mortis this absolutely convinces one of dunnings innocence and it introduces the certainty of another hand whose there he paused and began to consider there must have been another person in the wood this person must have rushed upon his victim suddenly and unexpectedly to rush out of the wood armed with a heavy club torn from a tree was the act of a gorilla if there had been an escaped gorilla anywhere about the crime could have been fixed upon him but gorillas in the year were not yet discovered perhaps the assailant ran upon him from behind noiselessly perhaps langley holme heard him at the last moment and turned so that the blow intended for the back of the head fell upon the fore part this was all very well in theory but why who wanted to kill this young gentleman and why there was no robbery the body lay for two hours and more in this unfrequented place there was plenty of time for the murderer to take everything the murderer had taken nothing then why how to explain it here was a young country gentleman highly popular if he had enemies they would not be outside his own part of the country most country gentlemen in those days had many enemies these enemies who were rustics for the most part satisfied their revenge and their hatred by poaching on the preserves they also set fire to the hayricks langley holme was staying a welcome guest with his friend and brotherinlaw he was walking along on a summer morning in a wood not a mile away from the house and park and there he was discovered lying deadmurdered it may be objected that this attempt to solve the insoluble after seventy years was a waste of time that dead and gone crimes may as well be left alone other peoples crimes may no doubt be left alone but this was his own crime so to speaka crime inflicted in and upon his own family besides he was dragged by ropes to the consideration of the thing his mind was wholly charged with it he could think of nothing else presently he shaped a theory which at first seemed to fit in with everything it was really a very good theory which promised when he framed it to account for all the facts brought out in the inquest and at the trial the theory supposed an escaped lunatica homicidal maniac of course that would account for everything a maniaca murderous maniac he must have been lying concealed in the wood he must have rushed out armed with his club like that gorilla this theory seemed to meet every point in the case he shut up the book he had found out the truth he could now go about his own work again forgetting the mysterious murder which drove his greatgrandfather off his balance he sighed with satisfaction he placed the book in a drawer out of the way he need not worry any more about the thing so with another sigh of relief he reached out for his books and returned once more to the study of his subject presently he became aware that his eyes were resting on the page without reading it that his mind was back again to the book of extracts and that in his brain there was forming without any volition of his own one or two difficult questions about that maniac as for instance if there had been such a creature wandering in the fields someone would have seen him he would probably have murdered more than one person while he was in the mood for murder there was a little boy for instance scaring birds he would have killed that little boy then the fact of a roving maniac would have been known he must have escaped from somewhere his madness must have been known there would have been some sort of hue and cry after him either at the inquest or at the trial there would have been some mention of this dangerous person going about at large some suggestion that he might have been the guilty person dangerous maniacs do not escape without any notice taken or any warning that they are loose no it would not do another and a more workable theory must be invented he got another poachers everybody knows the deadly hostility far worse seventy years ago than at present that existed between a country gentleman and a poacher the latter was accustomed in those days to get caught in a mantrap to put his foot into a gin to be fired upon by gamekeepers to be treated like a weasel or a stoat in return the poacher manifested a lamentably revengeful spirit which sometimes went as far as murder in this case no doubt the crime was committed by a poacher the theory satisfied him at first just as much as its predecessor presently however he reflected that there is not much for a poacher to do in early june and that poachers do not prowl about the woods and coverts in broad daylight and at noon and that poachers do not as a rule murder gentlemen belonging to other parts of the country besides poachers on one estate would not bear malice against the squire of another estate fifteen miles distant leonard pushed his papers away in despair any other kind of work was impossible he could think of nothing else at this point however some kind of relief came to him for he felt that he must make himself personally acquainted with the place itself he wanted to see the wood of which so much mention was madethe place where the blow was struck the place where the murderer lay hidden he wanted the evidence of the wood itself which was probably the same now as it had been seventy years before unless it had been felled or built over in that part of the country they do not destroy woods and they do not build upon their site it is a conservative country as the fields were a hundred years ago so they are now visitors to the house most conveniently approach it from the metropolitan extension line which goes to rickmansworth amersham and verney leonard resolved upon going there that very morning he took a notebook and started setting down the points on which he wished to inquire he arrived at the station a little before noon a walk of ten minutes brought him to the house on the terrace at the back the old man tall broadshouldered erect walked as usual up and down with his hard resolute air leonard did not speak to him he passed into the garden and looking at his watch walked along the grassgrown walks and at the end turning to the right entered the park it was but a small park there was only one walk in the direction which the two would have followed this was now like the garden walks overgrown with grass at the end there was a lodge but it had stood empty for nearly seventy years the gates were rusting on their hinges the windows were broken and the tiles had fallen off the roof beyond the park was an open roadthe highroad beyond the road a narrow path led across a broad field into a small wood on the right hand was a low rising ground this then was the wood where the thing was done this was the hillside on which the boy was scaring the birds when he saw the two go in and the one come out leonard crossed the field and entered the wood he looked at his watch again it had taken him twenty minutes to walk from the house to the road he made a note of that fact he walked through the wood it was a pretty wood more like a plantation than a wooda wood with a few large trees many saplings two or three trees lying on the ground and waiting to be cut up the spring foliage was out dancing in the sunlight the varying light and shade were pleasing and restful the air was soft the birds were singing a peaceful lovely place this then was the spot where langley holme was suddenly done to death by whom now as leonard stood looking into the tangled mass of undergrowth a curious thing happened it was the same thing which had happened to the housekeeper and was mentioned in her notes by some freak of light and shade there was fashioned in a part of the wood where the shade was darkest the simulacrum or spectre of a manonly the shoulders and upper part of a man but still a man leonard was no more superstitious than his neighbours but at this ghostly presentment he was startled and for a moment his heart beat quickly with that strange kind of terror unlike any other which is called supernatural there are men who boast that they know it not and have never felt it these are men who would take their work into a deserted house and would carry it on serenely alone through the watches of the livelong night for my own part i envy them not give me the indications of the unseen world the whisper of the unseen spirit the cold breath of the unseen guest even though they are received with terror and superstitious shrinkings it was with such terror that leonard saw this apparition a moment after and it was gone then he perceived that it was nothing but the shadows lying among the undergrowth so that they assumed a solid form yet as to the housekeeper to whom that same apparition had appeared it seemed to him the actual phantom of the murdered man he retraced his steps it took no more than five minutes he found to walk through the wood from one end to the other it was so small and the undergrowth of so light a character with no heavy foliage that any person standing in any part of it would be easily visible it would be impossible for any man to conceal himself he made a note also of these facts he then remembered the boy on the hillside scaring the birds there was no boy at the moment but leonard walked up the low hill in order to learn what the boy had been able to see the hill although low was a good deal higher than the trees in the wood it commanded a view of the land beyond the woodanother field with young corn upon it leonard observed that one could not see through the wood but that he could see over it and beyond it and on either side of it if for instance anyone approached the wood from any direction or ran away from it it would be quite possible for a boy standing on the hillside to see that person then in his imagination he heard the boys evidence i see the squire and a gentleman with him they came as far as the wood together presently the squire went away by himself then john dunning came along and presently he came out running over to the farm then they brought a shutter and carried out something on it covered up thats all i see the words were so clear and plain that when they ceased he looked round and was astonished to find there was no boy he sat down on a gate and looked at his notes the walk from the house to the wood took twenty minutes the time taken in walking through the wood was five minutes the wood was nowhere thick enough to conceal a man the wood could not be seen through from the hillside but it was overlooked on all sides from the hill he considered these things being now more than ever seized and possessed with the weight and burden of the mystery consider it was no ordinary crime such as one might read about when in the annals of a family one member of a long time ago was brutally and wickedly cut off it was a crime whose effects were felt by every member of his family in the strange seclusion of the head whatever advantages might be possessed by any member of this ancient and honourable house were lost for the head of it and the owner of all the property took no notice of anyone knew nothing of his existence even and lived entirely to himself and by himself it was again the first of all the numerous misfortunes which had fallen upon the family lastly it was a mystery which seemed continually on the point of being cleared up by some theory which would explain and account for everything he looked round the place seemed too peaceful for any deed of violence the sunshine was warm the singing of birds filled his ear the contrast with his own thoughts bewitched him he would have preferred a thunderous atmosphere charged with electricity he argued with himself that the thing took place seventy years ago that it might be very well left to be cleared up when the secrets of all hearts will be known that after all these years he could not hope to clear it up that he was only wasting his time and so forth he charged the mystery so to speak to leave him no demon of possession no incubus ever refused more resolutely to be driven out it remained with him more burdensome more intolerable than ever he left the hillside and walked back to the road there instead of walking through the park again he turned to the left and entered the village one must eat he ordered a chop at the village inn and while it was getting ready he went to the church the monuments of his own family were scattered about the church and on the wall he read again the tablet to the memory of the unfortunate man outside in the churchyard was the same old man who had accosted him when he brought constance here he was sitting on a tombstone basking and blinking in the sun he stood up slowly and pulled off his hat hope youre well sir he said oh leonard remembered you were the boy who was scaring birds on the dayseventy years agowhen mr holme was murdered surely sirsurely i havent forgotten i remember it alljust as yesterday better than yesterday im old master and i remember what happened when i was a boy better than what happened yesterday to many old people the same hath happened very likely i have heard so now sit down and tell me all about it ive just come down from london to look at the place and i remembered your evidence i will tell you everything sir will you ask me or shall i tell my own story you may tell your own story first and i will ask you questions afterwards so the old man repeated in a parrotlike way it was on a fine morning in june getting on to dinnertime id been scaring since five and i was hungry i was all alone on the hill in the field where theres a little wood and the path runs through the wood then i saw two gentlemenone was the squire the other id seen at church with the squire sunday before but i didnt know his name he was tall but nothing like so tall as the squire they were talking high and loud and fast i remember hearing them but i couldnt hear the words they went as far as the wood together directly after the squire turned back he looked up and down as if he was expecting somebody then he turned and walked home fast the other gentleman didnt go out with the squire nor yet at the other end of the wood a long time after john dunning came along he had on his smockfrock he hadnt been in the wood two minutes before he came running out of it and he made for the farm i saw that his smockfrock was red and the farmin men brought a shutter and carried out of the wood something covered up that is all i remember yes that is all that is what you said at the inquest and the trial is it not that was it sir yes was the wood then such as it is now just the same not a close dark wood but light and openjust as at present a light and open coppice with plenty of bushes could you then see through the wood no i could see over it and beyond it but not through the road where i was standing on that day what time was it when you arrived my time was halfpast five mother gave me my breakfast and sent me out i suppose it must ha been about that time very well you went straight to the hillside and began your work i suppose no i went through the wood first what for to see the birds nests there oh you were in the wood did you find anybody there or any signs of anybody being concealed there lord love you how could a body hide in that little place there might have been poachers for instance not in june if there was anyone at all i should have seen him well then you went up the hill and began your scaring did you see anyone pass into the wood before the squire and mr holme arrived no if there had been anyone i must have seen himfor certain sure i must there was no one all the morningno one that way at all there very seldom was anyone where does the path lead it leads across the fields to the village of highbeech and the church it is not a frequented way then no most days there will be only a single person on that way humph leonard was disconcerted with the old mans positiveness nobody in the wood on his arrival no one passed into it all the morning where was the poacher where was the murderous maniac you were only a little boy at the time he said dont you think your memory may be at fault it was seventy years ago you know the old man shook his head why for months and months and for years and years i was asked over and over again what happened and what i saw sometimes it was the vicar and his friends who talked about the matter and sent for me sometimes it was the men at the crown and jug who talked about the murder and sent for me sometimes it was the gossips dont you think my memory fails master because it cant fail why he chuckled the very last thing i shall see before i go up to the throne will be the sight of them two gentlemen going along to the wood very well come back to that point when they arrived at the wood the squire turned back yes first went in with the other gentleman oh it doesnt matter but he went a little way into the wood did he i dont know if it was a little way it was a bit of a timei dont know how long five minutes perhapstwo minutes perhapsi dont knowbefore he came out oh was this in your evidence i answered what i was asked nobody ever asked me how long the squire was in the wood well they entered the wood and they were talking in an animated manner that is not in your evidence either because i wasnt asked as for animated they were talking high and loud as if they were quarrelling they could not be quarrelling i didnt hear what they said well it doesnt matter the squire turned back just at the entrance again the sexton shook his head i know what i said he replied and i know what i saw is there anybody in the village leonard asked besides yourself who remembers thethe event it was seventy years ago he said im the oldest man in the village except the squire he remembers it very well for all his mad ways hes bound to remember it theres nobody else then they suspected one man john dunning it was why i was only seven years of age but i knew well enough that it couldnt be john first he wasnt big enoughand then he wasnt man enoughand then he wasnt devil enough but they tried him and he got off and came back to the village however he had to go because you see the people dont like the company of a man whos been tried for murder even though hes been let off and they wouldnt work with john so the squire gave him money and he went away out to australiahim and all his familyand never been heard of since was no one else ever suspected there might be some who had suspicions but they kept their suspicions to themselves did you yourself have suspicions its a long time ago sir the squire and me are the only two people that remember the thing whats the use after all these years of having suspicions i dont say i have and i dont say i havent if i have they will be buried with me in my grave leonard returned to london he now understood exactly the condition of the ground and he had examined the old man whose evidence was so important nothing additional was to be got out of him but the verbal statement of a contemporary after seventy years concerning the event in which leonard was so much interested was remarkable he returned to his own rooms hither presently came constance my friend and cousin she said in her frank manner as if there had never been any disturbing question between them you are looking worried what is the matter am i looking worried the more important point isare you feeling worried leonard it has nothing to do with that little conversation we had the other day no he replied nothing it was not a complimentary reply but then constance was not a girl to expect or to care for compliments wellis it the discovery of the poor relations you will think me a very ridiculous person i dont worry in the least about the poor relations but i am worried about that crimethat murder of seventy years ago oh but why it concerns you as well as me do you mean that i ought to worry about it i cannot really it is too long ago i feel really no interest in it at allexcept for a little pity about my grandmother whose childhood was saddened by the dreadful thing and that too was such a long time ago but why should it worry you i can hardly tell you why but it does constance it is the most wonderful thing you do not suspect me of nerves or idle fancies not at all you are quite a strong person as regards nerves then you will perhaps explain what has happened last night i came home about eleven i remembered that my newly discovered greataunt had sent me as a presenta cheerful presenta book containing a full account with cuttings from the papers of the time and notes by a woman who was housekeeper at campaigne park of the crime well i took it out of its brownpaper covering again constance am i a man of superstitions certainly not well he considered the point for a few moments as one perhaps better concealed then he resolved upon communicating it when i opened it i was seized with a most curious repulsiona kind of loathingwhich it was difficult to shake off this morning on looking at the book again i had the same feeling yes it is strange but you got over it in spite of it i persisted and resolutely went through the whole book i am repelled and i am attracted by the subject i sat up half the night reading iti have never been so held by any book before strange constance repeated and for a thing so long ago i threw it aside at last and went to bedand to dream and the endor the beginningof it is that i am compelledi use the word advisedlycompelled constance to investigate the whole affair oh but you are not in earnest investigate but it happened seventy years ago what can be learned after seventy years i dont know i must investigate and find out what i can constance looked at him with astonishment he sat at his deskbut with his chair turned towards her his face was lined and somewhat haggard he looked like one who is driven but he looked resolved leonard this is idle fancy i cannot help it i must investigate the case there is no help for me constancei must this was the first of the family misfortunes they have been so heavy and so many thatwell it is weakness to connect them with something unknown i am sorryi am very sorrythat you have learned the trutheven though it makes me your cousin i am very sorry too but fate has found meas it found my grandfather and my father and that old old man perhaps my own career is also to be cut short nonsense leonard you will investigate the case you will find out nothing you will throw it aside you will forget it no it is not to be forgotten or thrown aside well make your inquiry as soon as you can and get it over oh i should have thought you the last person in the world to be moved by fancies of compulsion or any other fancies i should have thought so too except for this experience when i got up constance i resolutely shut the book and i made up my mind to forget the whole business and you could not i suppose i could not i found it impossible to fix my attention so i pulled out the book again and went all over it from the beginning once more constance it is the most remarkable story i ever read you shall read it yourself if i do not even my duty to our ancestor will make me take it so seriously as you are doing today i have been down to the place i have visited the wood where the thing happened i found again that old man of the churchyard who paid you an undeserved compliment constance blushed but not much i made him tell me all he remembered it was not much but it sounded like the unexpected confirmation of some old document and have you come to any conclusion yet have you formed any theory none that will hold water i dont know what is going to happen over that business but i must go oni must go on she laid a hand upon his arm if you must go on let me go with you it is my murder as well as yours lend me the book she carried it off to her own rooms and that night another incubus sat upon another sleeping person and murdered rest chapter xiii a compromise come to get another speech fred christopher looked up cheerily from the work before him the sweet spring season when the big dinners are going on is his time of harvest and after june he can send his sheaves of golden grain to the bank it promised to be a busy and a prosperous season come for another speech old man he repeated im doing a humorous one on literature but i can make room for you hang your speeches fred sat down on the table you might offer a man a drink he spoke as one oppressed with a sense of injustice seem out of sorts fred whats gone wrong colonial enterprise the great concern which interests all lombard street hitched up somehow he asked with the exasperating grin of the doubter but he opened a cupboard and produced a bottle a glass and two or three sodas well old man theres your drink fred grunted helped himself liberally though it was as yet only eleven in the forenoon the great colonial concern is where it was he explained vaguely so i supposed and about lombard street well i thought better of the city i thought there was still some enterprise left in this rotten stagnant decaying and declining old country christopher laughed they wont look at it eh on the contrary they wont do anything till they have looked at it humph awkward isnt it i say fred what did you come back for at all why not stay in australia i came back for many reasons partly to look after you brother chris oh after me why after me well you see you are the only one left who knew of my existence leonard remembered nothing about me my grandfathers lawyers had never heard of me and one day there came into my headit was like a voice speaking to meit said fred you are a fool youve been twenty years in this country youve got an old lunatic of a grandfather who must have piles and piles of money perhaps hes dead and no one but christopher left to remember you get off home as quick as you can christopher said this remarkable voice is quite capable of putting his hands on the lot and forgetting you that is what the voice said my brother sometimes its rats sometimes its cats sometimes its circles sometimes its a voice fred you must have been pretty far gone perhaps but i listened to that voice and what is more i obeyed it and came home the old man isnt gone yet so far thats safe and the lawyers know of my existence so thats all right you wont get the chance of forgetting me after all very good very good there will be very soon i should say the division of a most almighty pile fred you are quite welcome to your share much obliged im sure do you know how much it is i am afraid to calculate besides what will has he made will my boy hes got a year and he spends nothing and he gives nothing all that money with something he had from his mother has been rolling up and rolling up how much is it a million two millions and here am i hard up for want of a few pounds and you a fraud and an impostor working like a nigger and all that money waiting to be spent as it should be spent its maddening chrisits maddening so it is so it is but nothing can be done well you were on the highroad to dt and instead of seeing rats you heard a voice calumniating your brother and you came home and you put your vast concern in your pocketthe waistcoat pocket held it all no doubt what the devil does it matter which pocket held it christopher leaned back and joined the tips of his fingers i wasnt going to spoil your game fred though that devil of a voice did speak such utterances but i knew all along i smelt a fake so to speak you a man of business you the head of a great colonial enterprise no no it was too thin my brothertoo thin not but what you looked the parti will say that upon my word i thought it was going to come off i got hold of a company promoter he said hes steered craft more crazy than mine into port talked of a valuation talked of assigning shares to me as owner of the colonial business well but fred come to the facts sooner or later the facts would have to be faced you know what was the colonial business it was a going concern fast enough when i left it whether its going now i dont know a lovely shanty by the roadside stocked with a large assortment of sardines day and martin tea flour and sugar what more do you want the thing i traded on was not the shanty but the possible development the development of the shanty excellent the development i say out of this humble roadside beginning i made great use of the humble beginning i thought they would accept the first steps of the development i proposed a vast company with stores all over australia for the sale of everything barlow brothers were to serve the australian continent we were to have our sugar estates in the mauritius our coffee estates in ceylon our tea estates in assam our flourmills everywhere our vineyards in france and germany i seei see quite enough fred the scheme does you great honour so you went into the city with it i did ive wasted buckets full of champagne over it and whisky enough to float a firstclass yacht and whats the result i see and youve come to an end that is so the very end look he pulled out his watchchain there was no watch at the end of it the watch has gone in he said the chain will go next and theres the hotel bill rather a heavy bill i should imagine ive done myself well christopher and how are you going to pay that bill and what are you going to do afterwards i thought of those accumulations i went down to see the old man hes quite well and heartywouldnt speak to me pretends to be deaf and dumb but the housekeeper says he understands everything so he knows of my existence the woman gave me the address of his solicitors and ive been to see them i wanted an advance you know just a little advance on the accumulations ah but they wont acknowledge that they have any power my dear sir i said i dont ask whether you have any power or noti dont care whether you advance me a thousand on my reversionary interest or whether you lend it yourself no sir the fellow wouldnt budge said i must prove the possession of reversionary interest said he wasnt a moneylender said i had better go to a bank and show security here i am one of the heirs to a noble fortune i dont know how much but it must be something enormous why his estate is worth a year and i know that there was money besides which he had from his mother enormous enormous and here i am wanting a poor thousand it seems hard doesnt it but then are you sure that you are one of the heirs the old man is off his head everything will be divided he cant live long no but he may live five or six years more well christopher the long and the short of it is that you will have to find that money you may charge interest you may take my bond you will do what you like but i must have that money the long and the short of it fred is this i am not going to give or to lend or to advance any money to you at all put that in your pipe oh fred helped himself to another whiskyandwater you wont eh then what do you think of my blowing this flourishing concern of yours eh christopher changed colour what do you think christopher of my going to call on pembridge crescent and letting out in the most natural and casual way in the world that ive just come from the rooms in chancery lane where you carry on your business fred youyouyou are a most infernal scoundrel what business asks my sisterinlaw what business asks my niece what business asks my nephew why says i dont you know hasnt he told you quite a flourishing incomealmost as flourishing as barlow brothers its in the fraudulent speech supply line thats a pretty sort of shell to drop in the middle of your family circle isnt it fred you were always the most coldblooded villain that ever walked thats what i shall do my dear brother more than that i shall go and see leonard that aristocratic young gentleman who thinks so much about his family will be greatly pleased will he not we need not follow the conversation which became at this point extremely animated memories long since supposed to be forgotten and buried and put away were revived with comments satirical indignant or contemptuous language of the strongest was employed the office boy put down his novelette and wondered what jack harkaway would do under such circumstances indeed the past lives of the two brothers lent themselves singularly to the recollection of romantic adventures and episodes of a startling character presentlywe are not cain and abelthe conversation became milder some kind of compromise began to be considered well i dont mind said fred at length i dont care so long as i can get the money but i must have the moneyor some moneyand that before long you can put your case before leonard if you like he wont give you much because he hasnt got much to give i think he has a few hundreds a year from his mother he might advance on his reversions but he isnt that sort of man at all ill try but look you christopher if he refuses ill take it out of you how would you like all the world to know how you live and by the lord sir if i have to tell all the world i will i was a great fool fred to let you into the secret i might have known from old experience what you would do with it to suit your own purpose always the dear old uncalculating unselfish truthful brotheralways fred took another drink and another cigar then he invoked a blessing upon his brother with all the cordiality proper for such a blessing and retired chapter xiv consultation the rle of coincidence in the history of the individual is much more important than any writer of fiction has ever dared to represent not the coincidence which is dear to the oldfashioned dramatist when at the very nick and opposite point of time the longlost earl returns the coincidence of real life does not occur in this way a mans mind is much occupied and even absorbed by one subject he goes about thinking upon that subject and upon little else then all kinds of things happen to him which illustrate this subject that is what coincidence means for instance i was once endeavouring to reconstruct for a novel a certain scene among the overgrown byways and the secluded and forgotten lanes of history i had nothing at first to help me worse still i could find nothing not even in the british museum the most profound knowledge of the books and pamphlets in that collection in the person of the greatest scholar could not help me i was reluctantly making up my mind to abandon the project which would have inflicted irreparable damage on my novel when a sheaf of secondhand catalogues came to me it was by the last evening post i turned over two or three without much curiosity until among the items i lit upon one which caught my eye it was only the title of a pamphlet but it promised to contain the exact information which i wanted the promise was kept i was too late to buy the pamphlet but i had the title and it was found for me in the british museum and it became my crib now that if you please was a coincidence and this kind of coincidence happens continually to every man who thinks about anything it is said of a most distinguished numismatist that he cannot cross a ploughed field without picking up a rose noble that is because his thoughts are always turned to rose nobles and other delightful coins if one is studying the eighteenth century there is not a museum a picturegallery a secondhand catalogue which does not provide the student with new information every man absorbed in a subject becomes like a magnet which attracts to itself all kinds of proofs illustrations and light these things are mentioned only to show that the apparently miraculous manner in which external events conspired together to keep up the interest in this case was really neither remarkable nor exceptional for the interest itself the grip with which the story of the newspaper cuttings caught and held both these readers was a true miracle in every group of situations there is the central event in this case the mystery of the wood was the central event it is my murder leonard constance repeated as much as yours it was my greatgrandfather who was murdered if it was your greatgrandmother who was also killed by that crime let me sit with you while you work it out you too constance leonard saw in her eyes something that reminded him of his own overpowering interest in the thing you too take back the book leonard you have read it i read it over and over againi have been reading it all the livelong night and youyou alsofeelwith methe same he did not finish the sentence i feellike youconstrained to go onwhyi cannot tell you it is not pity for one cannot feel pity for a man of whom one knows nothing except that he was young and handsome and unfortunate and that he was an ancestor it is not desire for revengehow can one take revenge for a crime when everybody concerned is dead and gone except the man who suffered most except that old old man well i cannot understand it but the fact is so like you i am drawn by ropes to the subject as for me i can think of nothing else i am wholly possessed by the story and by the mystery we will work at it togetherif any work is possible they sat down together and they read the book aloud both making notes they read parts of it over again they compared notes they went to the club together and dined together they went home and they spent the evening together they separated with the assurance that everything had been done which could be done and that they must reluctantly abandon any further investigation in the morning they met again i was thinking last night said constance about the inquest there are two or three points i was thinking about the trial said leonard there are a few doubts in my mind let us have out the book again once more it was produced once more it lay on the table once more they sat on opposite sides and read and considered and took counsel togetherwith no result once more they locked up the book and agreed that further investigation was impossible tomorrow said leonard i shall go on with my work again this is like the following of jackalantern tomorrow said constance with a sigh strange that we should have been led to consider the subject at all let the dead bury their dead it is an old story and nothing more remains to be found out why have we been so foolish despite this agreement they continued at their hopeless task they sat together day after day during this time they talked and thought of nothing else again and again they agreed there was nothing more to be found again and again they made a show of putting the book away and locking it up again and again they took it out again and read it till they knew it all by heart together they went once more to campaigne park they visited the fatal wood they wandered about the deserted rooms of the house haunted by the dreadful memory how could they expect to find anything now after all these years we have said leonard repeating the words a hundred times all the evidence that can now be discoveredthe evidence of the wood and the place the evidence of one survivor the evidence of the trial if the truth cannot be discovered why should we go on moreover after all these years nothing more can be discovered nothing more except the hand that did it why should they go on because they could not choose but go on they were compelled to go on if they spoke of other things their thoughts and their talk wandered back to this same subject as may always happen when two persons are engaged on the subject and absorbed in it their faces assumed the same expressionthat of one who searches and finds not with such a face the alchemist was accustomed every day to enter his laboratory hoping against hope beaten back every evening returning in the morning but with a differencefor the alchemist knew what he wanted to find out and these two were in search of they knew not what they went together in the vain hope of finding or hearing something more to call upon the lady of the commercial road she was most gratified to be recognised as a cousin of this young lady she desired nothing better than to talk of the family and its misfortunes but she threw no more light upon the story knowing in fact less than they themselves knew they left her they agreed once more that it was absurd to continue a quest so hopeless they agreed once more to lock up the book next day they took it out and laid their heads together again how long is this going to last constance asked i dont know leonard replied wearily are we possessed are we bewitched are we two persons who do not believe in possession or in witchcraft yet are really possessedi dont know by whom or why or anything at all about itbut if there is not possession then the old stories mean nothing we might make a wax image and call it by the name of the witch and stick pins in it if we knew the name of the witch why it seems as if we could speak and think of nothing else if one were superstitious if echoed the other doubtfully one were superstitious it might seem like part of the hereditary misfortunes yet why should i share in your sorrows here she blushed because she remembered how before the misfortunes were even heard of she had been invited to share in the good fortune but leonard observed nothing the quest left no room for any thoughts of love no he replied gravely you must not share in our troubles constance i too ask myself every day how long this will last why cannot i throw off the sense of being driven on against my own will in a search which must be hopeless yes i too am driven but it is to follow you what does it mean is it imagination of a morbid kind she paused leonard made no reply after all she continued there is nothing to do but to accept the situation and to go on and see what happens leonard groaned suppose he said with a wintry smile that we are doomed to go on day after day till the end of things just as that old man has walked up and down his terrace day after day for seventy years what a fearful tramp what a monotony what a life a dreary prospect yet to go over the same story day after day every day seems little better than that walk up and down the terrace does it leave it constance give it up and go back to your own work he took up the fatal book and threw it to the other end of the room frankly i would leave it if i could the thing weighs upon me i understand what possession means i am possessed i must follow you constance we are growing ridiculous we are two persons of culture and we talk of possession and of an unseen force that drags us but since we are dragged yes since we are draggedhe crossed over the room picked up the book and brought it backand we are draggedlet us obey it was then three weeks since this inquiry had begun it was now the sole object of their lives they hunted in the british museum among old papers they went to the hall and turned out desks and drawers and cupboards of letters documents papers and accounts they found enough to reconstruct the daily life of the old man before the tragedy and the history of his predecessors they were the simple annals of peaceful country life with no events but those that one expectsbirths of children buying of lands festivities you know that when sisyphus had rolled his ballor was it a wheelto the top of the hill the thing incontinently rolled all the way down again then with a sigh the prisoner walked after it as slowly as was consistent with a show of obedience and began again so leonard with a sigh began again when one theory after the other broke down at this point the coincidences commenced they were talking together one morning if said leonard we could only hear the man dunning on the subject he would be more interesting even than the ancient boy who scared the birds he must be dead long ago yet if he could be found at this momentno coincidence i have explained can be considered remarkableleonards servant opened the door and brought him a bulky letter it had an australian postage stamp upon it he looked carelessly at the address and tossed it on the table to wait his convenience as it lay on its back constance read printed across the securing fold the words john dunnings sons john dunnings sons she said this is strange she took up the letter and pointed out the name just as we were talking of john dunning open the letter leonard and read it oh this is wonderful open it at once leonard tore open the envelope within there was a letter and an enclosure he read both rapidly good heaven he cried it is actually the voice of the man himself constance it is the voice we were asking for it is his voice speaking from the grave he read aloud both the letter and the enclosure the following was the letter dear sir i found the enclosed paper only yesterday though it was written ten years ago and my grandfather by whom it was written died very shortly after it was written i will not trouble you with the causes which led to our overlooking it for so many years but hasten to send it on to you in accordance with the writers wishes the circumstances to which he refers happened seventy years ago no doubt everyone who can remember the events has long since departed i do not suppose that you even know the factto my grandfather of vital importancethat his acquittal was secured by the kind offices of your ancestor who was then the owner of campaigne park and i do not suppose that you have ever heard of the great kindness the sympathy the desire for justice which prompted those good offices nor of the further generosity which sent my grandfather out to australia he began life as an agricultural labourer in england he would have remained in that humble position all his days but for the calamity which turned out so great a blessinghis trial for murder he came out here he died one of the richest men in the colony for everything that he touched turned to gold the paper which i enclose is a proof that gratitude is not wholly dead in the world i gather from the published notes on the members of parliament and their origin that you are now the head of the house seeing that you were distinguished in the university of oxford and are a member of several clubs as well as in the house i do not suppose that there is anything we can do to carry out the wishes of my grandfather as regards yourself personally it may happen however that members of your family might come out to this country and might not be so fortunate as yourself in that case will you please to inform those members that our worldly wealth is great that the origin of all our property was the generosity of your ancestor that my grandfathers wishes are commands and that there is nothing which we can do for any member of your family if the opportunity should occur which we will not do cheerfully and readily i remain dear sir very faithfully yours charles dunning i should very much like to make the acquaintance of mr charles dunning said constance now for what the grandfather says leonard opened the other paper and read being now in my eightysixth year and therefore soon to be called away i desire to place in writing in order that it may be sent after my death to the present head of the campaigne family first my thanks and heartfelt gratitude for what was done for me by the late squire in and after my trial for murder i have enjoined upon my children and my grandchildren that they are to part with their last farthing if the occasion arises for the benefit of any descendants of that good man i suppose that he is dead and beyond the reach of my prayers i can only hope that he speedily recovered from the loss of his dear lady and that he enjoyed a long and happy life it is a dreadful thing to be accused of murder all my life i have remembered the charge and the trial after the case was over the people of the village were cruel hard the charge was thrown in my teeth every day no one would work with me and no one would sit with me so i had to come away if there is anyone living who remembers the case and me i would ask him to read and to consider two points that i found out after the trial this is indeed the voice of the dead said constance speaking low the first point is that i had witnesses but i was too much stunned to think of them who could prove that i was at work all the morning until just before noon in another place the second point may be more important the path through the wood leads to a stile opening on the lane to the village of highbeech there is a cottage in the lane opposite the stile on the morning of the murder the woman of the cottage was washing outside the door she told me after the trial that not a soul had gone into the wood from her end of it all the morning she could not see the other end but she saw me coming down the hill on my way to the wood and i had not been in the wood half a minute before she saw me running back again and up the hill to the farmyard on the top i hope that if there is any doubt left in the mind of anyone as to my innocence this new evidence will make it clear the paper was signed john dunning there is no doubt left said constance still what bearing has the evidence of the cottage woman on the case what do you think has the voice contributed anything we will consider presently meantime all he wanted was to clear himself i think that was effectually done at the trial still he would naturally catch at anything like corroboration it proves that no one went into the wood from the other end as for anything else why it would seem with the boys evidence to mean that nobody went into the wood at all that morning except those two gentlemen then we come back to the old theory the lurking in the wood of poacher madman or private enemy we asked for a voice from the grave and it came said leonard and now it seems to have told us nothing he placed the paper in the book leaving the letter on the table they looked at each other blankly then leonard rose and walked about the room finally he took up a position before the fireplace and began to speak slowly as if feeling his way i suppose that it is natural that i should connect this crime with that great question about the inheritance of punishment or consequences it is quite natural said constance and yet my mother and my grandmother as i now understand believed that the misfortunes which they so carefully concealed from me were the inheritance of the forefathers sins and since these misfortunes began with this crime it was natural that they should attribute the cause to the ancestor who died before the crime now all i can learn about that ancestor is that he was a country gentleman and justice of the peace a member of parliament and that he left behind him no record or memory of anything uncommon now to produce this enormous list of misfortunes one must be a gilles de retz at least i am not acquainted with that example he was a great master in every kind of villainy about these misfortunes however my greatgrandfather as you know my grandfather died by his own hand his brother was drowned at sea his sister has been unfortunate throughout her life his son my father died young my uncle frederick went abroad under a dread of disgrace which we may forget now he has come home again the list of misfortunes is long enough but we cannot learn any causewhich may even to the superstitious account for itunder anything of inheritance why should we try to account for the misfortunes they are not caused by you i try because they are part of the whole business i cannot escape or forget the chain of misfortune if you only could leonard and it is so long ago and no misfortune has fallen upon you oh what did i say oncein this very room the misfortune that has fallen upon me is the knowledge of all these misfortunesthese ruined lives the old selfish contentment is gone i lived for myself that is henceforth impossible wellhe shook himself as a dog after a swimi am now what you wanted me to belike other people he relapsed into silence i cannot choose he said presently but connect these misfortunes with that first and greatest the point of doubt is whether to speak of consequence or punishment must it be one or the other the child must suffer for the fathers sin that is most certain if the father throws away his property the son becomes a pauper if the father loses his social position the children sink down with him if the father contracts disease the children may inherit all this is obvious and cannot be disputed but that is not punishment for generations of innocent children it is consequence not punishment we must not confuse the two take the case of crime body and mind and soul are all connected together so that the face proclaims the mind and the mind presents the soul the criminal is a diseased man body and mind and soul are all connected together he lives in an evil atmosphere thought action impulse are all evil he is wrapped in a miasma like a lowlying meadow on an autumn morning the children may inherit the disease of crime just as they may inherit consumption or gout that is to say they are born with a tendency to crime as they may be born with a tendency to consumption or gout it is not punishment i repeat it is consequence in such children there is an open door to evil of some kind or other since all men have weaknesses or faults there must be always such an open door to all children i suppose so but the son of a man reputed blameless whose weaknesses or faults are presumably light or venial is less drawn towards the open door than the son of the habitual criminal the son of the criminal naturally makes for the open door which is the easy way it is the consequence as for our own troubles perhaps if we knew they too may be the consequencenot the punishment but we do not knowwe cannot find the crime or the criminal chapter xv barlow brothers the theory of consequenceleonard was arranging his thoughts on paper for better clearnesswhile it answers most of the difficulties connected with hereditary trouble breaks down it must be confessed in some cases given for instance a case in which a boy is carefully educated has no bad examples before him shows no signs of vice and is ignorant of the family misfortunes if that boy becomes a spendthrift and a prodigal or worse when there has never before been such a thing in the family how can we connect the case with the faults or vices of a grandfather altogether unlike his own and unknown to him i should be inclined rather to ascribe the case to some influences of the past not to be discovered due to some maternal ancestry a man for instance may be so completely unlike any other member of the family that we must search for the cause of his early life in the line of his mother or his grandmother he was just then thinking of his unclethe returned colonial in whom except for his commanding stature and his still handsome face there was nothing to remind the world of the paternal side whenever he thought of this cheerful person with whom life seemed a pleasant play certain doubts crossed his mind and ran like cold water down his back he had come home richthat was something he might have come home as poor as when he started rich or poor he would have been the sameas buoyant as loud as unpresentable in fact at this very moment when these reflections were forming a part of leonards great essay on the aftereffects of evilan essay which created only last month so great a stir that people talked of little else for a whole eveningthe rich australian was on his way to confess the fact that things were not exactly as he had chosen to present them he did confess the truth or as much of the truth as he could afford to express but in an easy and irresponsible manner as if nothing mattered much he was a philosopher to whom nothing did matter he came in he shook hands and laughed buoyantly he chose a cigar from leonards box he rang the bell for whisky and a few bottles of soda when the whisky and the soda had arrived and were within reach he took a chair and laughed again my boy he said im in a tight place again in what way why for want of money thats the only possible tight place at my age at yours there are many it is only a temporary tightness of course he opened the sodawater and drank off the full tumbler at a gulp temporary till the supplies arrive the supplies leonard put the question in a nasty cold suspicious manner which would have changed smiles into blankness in a more sensitive person but uncle fred was by no means sensitive or thinskinned he was also so much accustomed to temporary tightness that the incongruity of tightness with his pretensions of prosperity had not occurred to him supplies he replied supplies from australia of course i thought that you were a partner in a large and prosperous concern quite truequite true barlow brothers is both large and prosperous in that case it is easy for you to draw upon your bankers or the agents for your bank or some friends in the city you go into the city every day i believe your position must be well known in other words i mistrust this temporary tightness mistrust and from you really leonard i put things together i find in you none of the habits of a responsible merchant i know that everywhere character is essential for commercial success character what should i be without character you come home as the successful merchant you drink you talk as if you were a debauched youngster about town your anecdotes are scandalous your tastes are low those are the outward signs i am on a holiday out thereits very different as for drink of course in a thirsty climate like that of new south walesand this placeone must drink a little for my own part i am surprised at my own moderation very well i will not go on with the subject onlyto repeatif you are in a tight place those who know your solvency will be very willing to relieve you i hope you are not here to borrow of me because the man laughed again not i nobody is likely to borrow of you leonard that is quite certainnot even the stoniest broke make your mind quite easy as for my friends in the city i know very well what to do about them no i am here because i want to throw myself upon the family the family consists of your brother who may be able to help you ive asked him he wontchristopher was always a selfish beast good fellow to knock about with and all thatready for anythingbut selfishdamned selfish and your aunt lucy i dont know her who is she she is not able to assist you and of myself you forget the head of the familymy old grandfather i am going to him you will get nothing out of himnot even a word of recognition i know i have been down there to look at him i have been to see his solicitors you will get nothing from them without their clients authority well you know the family affairs of course i suppose that a word from you authorising or advising the transfer of a few thousandsor hundredsout of that enormous pile i have no right to authorise or advise i know nothing about my greatgrandfathers affairs tell me dear boy what about those accumulations we mentioned them the other day i know nothing about them of course of course im not going to put questions the bulk of everything will be yours naturally i have no objection i am not going to interfere with you only dont you think you could go to the people the agents or solicitors and put it to them that as a son of the house i should like an advance ofsay a thousand pounds i am quite certain beforehand they will do nothing for you youre a better man of the world than i thought my boy i respect you for it nobody is to have a finger in the pie but yourself and you look so damned solemn over it too i tell you that i know nothing just sojust so well you know nothing ive made a rough calculationbut never mind let the accumulations be very good then i shall not interfere meantime i want some money get me from those lawyers a thousand i cannot get you anything as for myself i have not got a thousand pounds in the world you forget that all i have is my mothers small fortune of a few hundreds a year it is not in my power to lend you anything he laughed again in his enjoyment of the situation delicious he said and i said that i wasnt going to borrow anything this it is to be a british swell well i dont mind i will draw upon you at six months come long before that time i shall be in funds again no you shall not even draw upon me at six months leonard replied with some vague knowledge of what was implied you told me you were rich every man is rich who is a partner in a going concern then again why are you in this tight place my partner you see has been playing the fool barlow brothers general stores colonial produce will be smashed if i cant raise a few hundreds your going concern as you call it is going to grief and what will you do you shall just see what i wanted barlows is a general store in a rising town there are great capabilities in barlow brothers i came over here to convert barlow brothers into a limited liability company capital branches everywhere our own sugar estates our own tea and coffee plantations that was my idea it was a bold idea at any rate it was as for barlows general store i confess between ourselves and considering that you dont belong to the city i dont mind owning up to you that it is little better than a shanty where i sold sardines and tealeaves and bacon but the capabilities my dear boythe capabilities and you brought this project to london well there have been greater robberies uncle fred took another glass of whiskyandsoda he laughed no more he even sighed i thought london was an enterprising city it appears not no promoter will so much as look at the company i was willing to let my interest in it go for if youll believe me leonard they wont even look at it a few hundreds would save it a few thousands would make it a colossal success for want of it we must go to the wall you were hoping to sell a bankrupt business as a flourishing business that is so but it hasnt come off well what shall you do i shall have to begin again at the bottom thats all oh leonard looked at him doubtfully for he seemed in no way cast down you will go back to australia then there was some consolation in the thought i shall go back i dont know my way about in london i will go back and begin again just as before at the bottom rung i shall have to do odd jobs i dare say i may possibly have to become a shepherd or a nightwatchman or a sandwichman what does it matter i shall only be down among the boys who cant get any lower theres a fine feeling of brotherhood down there which you swells would never understand have you no money left at all none not more than i carry about with me a few pounds then the fine show of prosperity was all a sham all a sham and it wouldnt work nobody in the city will look at my company would it not be better to try for some definite kind of work you can surely do something you might write for the papers with all your experience write for the papers i would rather go on tramp which is much more amusing do something what am i to do man there isnt on the face of the earth a more helpless person than a bankrupt trader at fortyfive he knows too much to be employed in his own trade hes got to go down below and to stay there never mind i can turn my hand to anything if i stayed at home i should have to be a sandwichman how would you like that even my old grandfather would come back to the present life if it were only to burst with rage if he met his grandson walking down regent street between a pair of boards you wouldnt like it yourself would you come out to sydney next year and very likely youll see that or something like it then you go out to certain misery misery certain misery the colonist laughed cheerfully my nephew you are a very narrowminded person though you are a scholar and a member of parliament you think that it is misery to take off a frockcoat and a tall hat and to put on a workingmans jacket and bowler bless you my boy thats not misery the real misery is being hungry and cold in australia no one is ever cold and very few are ever hungry in my worst times ive always had plenty to eat and though ive been many times without a shilling ive never in all my life been miserable or ashamed but there is the companionship the companions they are the best fellows in the world misery there isnt any with the fellows down below especially the young fellows and mind you it is exciting work the handtomouth life now by the time i get out the business will be sold up and my partner who is a young man will be off on another lay they always put out the old man as soon as they can what shall i do i shall go hawking and peddling i shall become autolycus and afterwards there is no afterwards till you come to the hospital which is a really pleasant place and the black box ive done it before and ill do it again he mixed another sodaandwhisky and drank it off its thirsty work along the roads under the suna redhot burning sun not like your red fryingpan skulking behind a cloud wherever you stop you get a drink then you bring out your wares ive got a tongue that runs like an engine newly oiled and where you put up for the night there are the boys on the road and there are songs and stories respectability go hang he laughed again he put on his hat and swung out of the room laughing as at the very finest joke in the worldto come home as a gentleman and to go back as a tramp chapter xvi and another came almost immediately after the colonial merchantthe wholesale trader in sardines and tealeaves from a shantyhad departed there came another they might almost have passed each other on the stairs it was none other than the counsel learned in the law the pride and prop of his family the successful barrister mr christopher campaigne good heavens cried leonard what is the matter with this man for his uncle dropped speechless limp broken up into a chair and there lay his hands dangling his face filled with terror and care my dear uncle christopher he said what has happened the worst groaned the lawyerthe very worst the impossible has happened the one thing that i guarded against the thing which i feared oh leonard how shall i tell you come with me to the chambers where the professor of oratory was preparing as in a laboratory his great effects of laughter and of tears it was morninghigh noon he was engaged upon what is perhaps the most fascinating branch of a most delightful professiona speech of presentation before him in imagination stood the mug beside him the recipient and in front of him a vast hall filled with sympathetic donors such a speech is the enunciation and the magnifying of achievements it must be illustrated by poetical quotations the better known and the more familiar they are the more effective they will prove the speaker should tell one funny story at least he must also contrive but not obtrusivelywith modestyto suggest his own personal importance as if anything superior to that of the recipient he must not grovel before greatness all these points the professional manufacturer of oratory understood and had at his fingers ends he was quite absorbed in his work insomuch that he paid no kind of attention to footsteps outside nor even at first to an angry voice in the outer office which as we have seen was only protected by the boy who had nothing else to do unless the reading of jack harkaways adventures be considered a duty stand out of my way cried the voice apparently infuriated let me get at him the professional man looked up wonderingly apparently a row on the stairs but his own door burst open and a young man quite a little man with hot cheeks and eyes aflame rushed in brandishing a stick the orator sprang to his feet seizing the office ruler he leaned over his table six feet three in height with this formidable weapon in his hand and he faced the intruder with calm cold face we must not blame the assailant doubtless he was of tried and proved courage but he was only five feet five before that calm face of inquiry on which there was no line of terror or of repentance his eyes fell the fire and fury went out of him quite suddenly perhaps he had not developed his sthetic frame by rude exercise he dropped his stick and stood irresolute oh said his enemy quietly you think better about the stick do you the horsewhipping is to stand over is it now sirhe rapped the table horribly with the ruler so that the little man trembled all over the adventure unexpectedly promised pain as well as humiliationwhat do you mean what do you come here for making this infernal racket what here he stopped short because to his unspeakable dismay he saw standing in the doorway none other than his own son algernon and algernons face was not good to look at being filled with shame amazement and bewildermentwith shame because he understood all in a moment that his fathers life had been one long lie and that by this way and none other the family income had been earned had not his friend on the way told him that the man crediton was known in certain circles as the provider of good afterdinner speeches for those who could afford to pay for themhow it was whispered that the rare and occasional evenings on which the speeches were crisp and fiery and witty and moving all through were those for which crediton had supplied the wholeand how for his own speech about which he had been most shamefully treated he had paid twenty guineas so that he understood without more words and looked on openmouthed having for the moment no power of speech or utterance the father first recovered he went on as if his son was not present who are you sir i say who come to my quiet office with this blackguard noise if you dont tell me on the spot i will take you by the scruff of your miserable little neck and drop you over the banisters iii wrote to you for a speech what speech what name what for his client whose eyes at first were blinded by excess of wrath now perceived to his amazement that mr crediton was none other than his friends father whom indeed he had met at the family mansion in pembridge crescent good lord he cried itsits mr campaignehe glanced from father to son and back againmr campaigne and why not sirwhy not answer me that again the ruler descended with a sickening resonance oh i dont know why not how should i know the intruder stammered its no concern of mine im sure then come to the point what speech what name what for the company of cartmakers the speech that you sent meit arrived by post a very good speech too i did send it much too good for you or for the fee you paid i remember it what is the matter with it how dare you complain of it the matter sirthe matter he stammered feeling much inclined to sit down and cry is that you sent the same speech to the proposer mine was the reply the same speechdo you hearthe same speech to the proposer as to me who had to reply now sir do you realise oh i am not afraid of your ruler i say but his looks belied his words do you understand the enormity of your conduct impossible how could i do such a thingi who have never made a mistake before in all my professional career he looked hard at his son and repeated the words professional career are you sure of what you say he laid down his ruler with a very serious air are you quite sure certain the same speech word for word everythingevery single thingwas taken out of my mouth i hadnt a word to say how did that happen i wonder stay i have typewritten copies of both speechesthe toast and the reply yes yes i always keep one copy i am afraid i do understand how i may have blundered he opened a drawer and turned over some papers ah yes yes dear me i sent out the second copy of your speech to the other man instead of his own here is his own duplicatethe two copieswhich fully explains it dear dear tut tut tut i fear you were unable to rise to the occasion and make up a little speech for yourself i could not i was too much astonished and i may add disgusted to doerjustice to myself no doubtno doubt my clients never can do justice to their own genius without my help now sit down sir and let us talk this over for a moment he himself sat down his son meanwhile stood at the open door still as one petrified now sir i confess that you have reason to complain it was a most unfortunate accident the other man must have observed something wrong about the opening words however most unfortunate he opened a safe standing beside him and took out a small bundle of cheques your cheque arrived yesterday morning fortunately it is not yet paid in i return it sirtwenty guineas that is all i can do for you except to express my regret that this accident should have occurred i feel for you young gentleman i forgive your murderous intentions and i assure you if you will come to me again i will make you the finest afterdinner orator in the town and now sir i have other clients he rose the young man put the cheque in his pocket it will be he said grandly my duty to expose youeverywhere he turned to his companion to expose you both and yourself dear sirand yourself at the same time the agent rattled the keys in his pocket and repeated the words yourself at the same time i dont careso long as i expose you you will care when you come to think about it you will have to tell everybody that you came to me to buy a speech which you were about to palm off as your own there are one or two transactions of the same nature standing over so to speak remember young gentleman there are two persons to be exposed myself whom the exposure will only advertise and you yourself who will be ruined as an oratoror anything else but the young man was implacable he had his cheque back this made him stiffer and sterner i care nothing i could never pretend again to be an orator after last nights breakdown i was dumfoundered i could say nothing they laughed at me the whole hall full of peoplethree hundred of themlaughed at meand all through youthrough you ill be revengedill make you sorry for last nights businesssick and sorry you shall be as for you he turned upon algernon shut up and get out said his friend get out i say or algernon made room for him and the aggrieved client marched out with as much dignity as he could command left together father and son glared at each other icily they were both of the same height tall and thin and closely resembling each other with the strong type of the campaigne face and both wore pincenez the only difference was that the elder of the two was a little thin about the temples the consciousness of being in the wrong destroyed the natural superiority of the father he replied with a weak simulacrum of a laugh surely the situation explains itself he said feebly opening the door for explanation am i to understand that for money you writewritewrite speeches for people who pretendactually pretendthat they are their own undoubtedly did not your friend confess to you why he was coming here wellof course he did and did you remonstrate with him on account of his dishonesty mr algernon campaigne shirked the question and replied by another and do you regard this mode of moneymakingi cannot call it a professionthis modehonourablea thing to be proud of why not certain persons with no oratorical gifts are called upon to speak after dinner or on other occasions they write to me for assistance i send them speeches i coach them in fact i am an oratorical coach they learn what they have to say and they say it it is a perfectly honourable laudable and estimable way of making money moreover my son it makes money then why not conduct thisthis tradeopenly under your own name because in the nature of things it is a secret business my clients names are secret so also is the nature of our transactions but this place is not lincolns inn how do you spare the time from your law work my dear boy there has been a little deception pardonable under the circumstances in point of fact i never go to lincolns inn there is no practice ive got a garret which i never go near there never has been any practice no practice the young man sank helplessly into a chair no practice but we have been so proud all along of your distinguished career there has never been any legal practice at all i adopted this line in the hope of making a little money at a time when the family was pretty hard up and it succeeded beyond my expectations algernon sat down and groaned aloud we are done for thatthat little beast is the most spiteful creature in the world and the most envious he is mad to be thought clever he has published some thingsi believe he bought them he goes about he poses there isnt a man in london more dangerous he will tell everybody how shall we face the storm people my son will still continue to want their afterdinner speeches i am thinking of my sister myself and our position what will my mother say what will our friends say good lord we are all ruined and shamed we can never hold up our heads again what on earth can we say how can we get out of it who will call upon us the parent was touched my dear boy he said humbly i must think the matter over there will be trouble perhaps leave me for the present andstill for the presenthold your tongue his son obeyed then mr crediton resumed his work but the interruption was fatal he was fain to abandon the speech of presentation and to consider the prospect of exposure not that any kind of exposure would destroy his profession for that had now become a necessity for the convenience of the social lifethink what we should suffer if all the speeches were homemadebut there was the position of his wife and family the reproaches of his wife and family the lowering of his wife and family in the social world it would be fatal for them if he were known as a secret purveyor of eloquence secrecy can never be considered honourable or ennobling dress it up as you will the cloven foot of fraud cannot be disguised he went out because he was too much agitated to keep still or to do any work and he wandered through the streets feeling pretty small how would the exposure come this young fellow had been brought to the house he called at the house he came to their evenings and posed as poet storyteller orator epigrammatist he knew a whole lot of people in their set he could certainly make things very disagreeable and he was in such a rage of disappointment and humiliationfor he had broken down utterly and shamefullythat he certainly intended to be nasty after a tempestuous youth in company with his brother this man had settled down into the most domestic creature in the world twentyfive years of domestic joys had been his portion they were made possible by his secret profession his wife adored and believed in him his children while they despised his sthetics respected his law in a word he occupied the enviable position of a successful barrister a gentleman of good family and the owner of a good income this position was naturally more than precious it was his very life at home he was in his own belief a great lawyer in his office he was mr crediton the universal orator they were separate beings and now they were to be brought together crediton would be known to the world as campaigne campaigne as crediton he was a forlorn and miserable object indeed as he passed along the street he discovered suddenly that he was passing one of the entrances to bendor mansions a thought struck him i must ask someones advice he murmured i cannot bear the trouble all alone and unsupported i will tell leonard everything leonard sprang to his feet astonished at this extraordinary exhibition of despair my dear uncle christopher he exclaimed what does this mean what has happened the unhappy man anxious to take counsel yet shrinking from confession groaned in reply has anything happened at home my aunt my cousins worseworse it has happened to me well but what has happened man dont sit groaning there lift up your head and tell me what has happened ruin he repliedsocial ruin and disgrace that is all that is all then you are the second member of our truly fortunate family who has been ruined this very day perhaps leonard added coldly it might be as well if you could let me know what form your ruin has taken social ruin and disgrace that is all i shall never be able to look anyone in the face any more what have you done then i have done only what i have been doing blamelessly because no one ever suspected it for fiveandtwenty years now it has been found out you have been doing something disgraceful for fiveandtwenty years and now you have been found out well why have you come to me is it to get my sympathy for disgracing your name you dont understand leonard he lost his temper how the devil am i to understand if you wont explain you say that you are disgraced let me tell you alleverythingfrom the beginning it came from knocking about london with my brother fred he was a devil he didnt care what he did so we ran through our moneyit wasnt muchand fred went away i have heard why a most shameful business truly yes i always told him so since he came home however we have agreed not to mention it go on you were left with no money i had just been called i was engaged i wanted to get married you rapidly acquired an extensive practice nono that is where the deception stepped in my dear nephew i never had any practice at all if any cases had been sent to me i could not have taken them because you see i never opened a lawbook in my whole life youneveropeneda lawbook thenhow i loathed the sight of a lawbook but i was engagedi wanted to be marriedi wanted to live too without falling back on your mother pray go on i knew a man who wanted to get a reputation for an afterdinner speaker he heard me make one or two burlesque speeches and he came to me after a little conversation we talked business i wrote him a speech it succeeded i wrote him another that succeeded he leaped into fameleaped so to speak over my backoratorical leapfrogby those two speeches then my price ran up and then i conceived the idea of opening out a new profession for fiveandtwenty years i have pretended to go to chambers in lincolns inn and i have gone to an office in chancery lane where under another name i have carried on the business of providing speeches for all occasions good heavens cried leonard and this is the man of whom we were proud his face had been darkening from the beginning and it was now very hard and dark i understand i suppose the beginning of the story i had heard already you got through your fortune in company with your brotherin riotous living quite soquite so was there not something about a cheque freds affairnot mine your brother says it was your affair dont think i want to inquire into the horrid story i have found quite enough shame and degradation among my family without wanting to know more if fred says that it is simply disgraceful why everybody knewbut as you say why rake up old scandalsat the time when it happened but why as you say why indeed except to make quite sure that there is no longer a shred of family pride possible for us i now learn on your own confession that you entered upon a general course of imposition and deception by which you have managed to live ever since and to maintain your family with credit because you have escaped detection excuse me i dont call it deception nobody is deceived except pleasantly is it wrong to present a fellowcreature in an agreeable and quite unexpected character before the world can you blame me for raising the standard of afterdinner oratory can you blame me for creating reputations by the dozen i make no doubt that you persuaded yourself that it was laudable and honourable nevertheless you must consider how it grew i told you i was myself a good afterdinner speaker i was hard up then this manold friend now a colonial judgecame to me for help i wrote him a speech and he bought itthat is to say he lent me ten pounds for itreally he bought my secrecy thats how it began money was necessary there was an unexpected way of making money so it spread i have no doubt that the practice of imposition was duly paid for you must considerreally there is nothing envied so much as the reputation of good afterdinner speaking i supply that reputation people go where they are likely to hear good speeches i supply those speeches i do not deny the position but you are nevertheless helping a man for money to deceive the world to deceive the world not at all to delight the world why i am a public benefactor i open the purses at charity dinners i send the people home in good temper do you think the people care two pins who is speaking if they can be amused then why this secrecy why not he walked about the room swinging his arms and turning from time to time on leonard as he made his points and pronounced his apology why not i ask you talk as if some fraud was carried on nobody is defrauded i earn my fees as much as any barrister look you leonard my position is unique andandyes honourable if you look at it rightly honourable oh yes i am the universal afterdinner speaker i supply the speeches for every occasion i keep up the reputation of the city for eloquence why we were rapidly sinking we were already acknowledged to be far below the american level then i came i raised the standard our afterdinner speechesmineare becoming part of our national greatness why because i siri christopher campaignetook them in hand yet in secrecy i carry on this business alonei myselfhitherto without recognition the time may come when the national distinctions will be offered to thein fact the afterdinner demosthenes you look so far forward i confess that the work is light easyto me at leastand pleasant it is also well paid people are willing to give a great deal for such a reputation as i can make for them nobody ever wants to see me nobody knows who i am nobody wants to know that is natural come to think of it the whole business is done by correspondence i work for none but persons of wealth and position confidence is respected on both sides sometimes the whole of a dinner so to speak passes through my hands i have even known occasions on which i have sat unrecognised at a dinnertable and listened to my speeches being delivered well or ill through the whole evening imagine if you can the glow and glory of such an evening i can imagine a ruddy hueof shame after fiveandtwenty years of deception however there is not much shame left what has happened now you have been found out i suppose yes i have been found out there was a little mistake i sent a man the wrong speechthe response instead of the proposers speech to the proposer i sent the same speech in duplicate i cannot imagine how the mistake was possible but it happened and you may imagine the feelings of the poor young man who heard his own brilliant speech which was in his pocket actually delivered a few words only changed by the man whom he was about to answer when his turn came he rose he was overcome he blurted out three or four words and sat down oh and then in the morning he came to beard me in my own den he had never seen me before but he knew my address he came with a big stick being a little man ho ho and he marched in flourishing his stick you should have seen him when i stood over him with the office ruler he laughed again but at the sight of leonards dark face he checked his sense of humour well the misfortune was that i know the fellow at home and he comes to our place and knows me and worse than that my own son algernon was with him to see fair oh algernon was with him then algernon knows yes he knows i packed off the fellow and had it out with algernon it was a tough business im sorry for algernon perhaps he wont put on quite so much side though yes he repeated thoughtfully i had it out with that young man he knows now what the real profession is well what next i dont know what next shall you continue your trade of deception and falsehood shall i go into the workhouse upon my word it would be better his uncle rose and took up his hat well leonard if you have nothing but reproaches i may as well go i did think that you would consider my positionmy very difficult position i have at least supported my family and i have confided the whole to you if you have nothing to say except to harp upon deceptionas if that matteredi may as well go stop lets consider the thing is there no other way of livelihood none the only question is whether i am to conduct the business henceforth under my own name or not i dont know that i can advise or help in any way why did you come to me i came for adviceif you have any to give i came because this misfortune has fallen upon me and you are reputed to be wise beyond your years the fact of your occupation is misfortune enough well you have nothing more to say then i must go he looked so miserable that leonard forgot his indignation and inclined his heart to pity you are afraid of exposure he said on account of your wife and children on their account alone for my own part i have done no wrong and i fear no exposure they were brave words but he was as the donkey in the lions skin he spoke valiantly but his knees trembled i should think leonard replied that this young man for his own sake would be careful not to spread abroad his experience because he would expose himself as well as you he proposed deliberately to impose upon the audience as his own an oration prepared by another man and bought by himself that is a position if it were known and published even less dignified than your own i think that algernon should put this side of the case to him strongly and plainly he may leave himself out and whisper rumours abroad algernon should warn him against such things if however the man persists in his unholy ambition to obtain a false reputation he will probably have to come to you again since there is no other practitioner mr crediton jumped in his chair thats the point youve hit it thats the real point im glad i came here hes not only got his ambition still but hes got his failure to get over he must come to me there is no other practitioner he must come i never thought of that he rubbed his hands joyously he may not be clever enough to see this point therefore algernon had better put it to him if algernon fails you must make a clean breast to your wife and daughter and send it round openly among your personal friends that you are willing to supply speeches confidentially that seems the only way out of it the only waythe only way leonard there will be no clean breast at all and that venomous beast will have to come to me again i am so glad that i came here you have got more sense than all the rest of us put together chapter xvii yet another when he was gone leonard threw himself into the nearest chair and looked around him he gazed with bewildered face not upon the study full of books the papers which showed the man of learning the reports which spoke of the man of affairs the engravings on the wall which spoke of the man of culture these are accidental anyone may show them the artist sprung from the gutter the selfmade scholar the mere mushroom might possess and exhibit all these things he saw strewn around him the wreck and ruin of all that he had hitherto considered the essential namely the family honour there are none so full of family pride as those who show it least to leonard it had always been the greatest happiness merely to feel that the records of his family went back to times beyond the memory of man it was not a thing to be talked about but a prop a stay a shield anything that helps to make a man at peace with himself no one knew when the campaignes first obtained their estate in every century he found his ancestorsnot distinguishedindeed they had never produced a man of the first rankbut playing a part and that not an unworthy one it was the record of an honourable line there were no traitors or turncoats in it the men were without reproach the women without a spot or stain among them all i suppose that nobody either at school or college ever knew or suspected the profound pride which lay at the heart of this quiet and selfpossessed scholar it was the kind of pride which is free from arrogance he was a gentleman all his people had been gentlemen by gentlemen he meant people of good birth and breeding and of blameless life the word we well know is now used so as to include the greater part of male man to most people it means nothing and matters nothing even with people who use limitations the door is always open to those who choose to lead the gentle life and are privileged to follow the work which belongs to the gentle life he was a gentlemanhe and all his people he had no feeling of superiority not the leastno more than a man may entertain a feeling of superiority on account of his stature nor had he the least feeling of contempt for those who have no such advantages a man who has a grandfather may affect to despise one who has no grandfather but not a man who has a long line terminating like the ancestry of a saxon king in dim shapes which are probably woden thor and freyya the grand essentials of family pride are ancestry and honour the former cannot very well be taken away but without the latter it is not worth much one might as well take pride in belonging to a long line in which gallant highwaymen footpads costers hooligans and marylebone boys have succeeded each other for generations with the accompaniments and distinctions of tyburn tree and the carttail therefore i say leonard sat among the ruins of the essentials regardless of the accidentals the man who had just left him had stripped off all that was left of his former pride he could feel no further support or solace in the contemplation of his forefathers think what he had learned and endured in less than a month it was line upon line precept upon precept it was like unto the patriarch to whom while one messenger of evil was speaking there came also another saying thus and thus has it been done where is now thy pride first he learned that he had cousins living in one of the least desirable quarters of london the mancousin could not by any possible stretch be considered as possessing any of the attributes of a gentleman the girl occupied a station and followed a calling which was respectable but belonging to those generally adopted by the poor relation he was thus provided with poor relations constance had said that he wanted poor relations in order to be like other people and then they came as if in answer to her words he had learned also that his grandfather almost at the outset of a promising career had committed suicide for no reason that could be discovered that his father had died young also at the outset of a promising career was a misfortune but not a blot two persons were left of his fathers generation he had welcomed one as the prodigal who had gone forth to the husks and returned bearing sheaves of golden grain at least there was the pretence of the golden grain the other he had regarded all his life with respect as one in successful practice in a most honourable profession where were they now one was a bankrupt grocer or general storekeeper the owner of a shanty in an australian township a miserable little general shop selling sardines and tea and oil and blacking which he wanted to turn into a company as a great business one who made no pretence at truth or honesty the companion of tramps devoid of honour or even the respect or care for honour he had been driven out by his family as a spendthrift a profligate and a forger he had come home unchanged and unrepentant and ready to swindle and to cheat if he could do so without the customary penalties as for the other man the pretended barrister he stood revealed as one who was living under false pretences he had an equal right to stand in pillory beside his brother once a prodigal and a spendthrift like him now living a daily lie which he had carried on for fiveandtwenty years good heavens christopher campaigne barristeratlaw of lincolns inn the successful lawyer on whom his family reposed a confidence so profound and a pride so unboundedwho does not take pride in a successful lawyerwas nothing more than a common pretender and an impostor he wrote speeches and sold them to humbugs who wished to be thought clever speakers honourable occupation delightful work a proud and distinguished career so there was nobody left except himself to maintain the family honour certain words which you have already heard came back again it seemed to him as if constance was saying them all over again you are independent as to fortune you are of a good house you have no scandals in your family records you have got no poor or degraded relations you are outside humanity if you had some family scandals some poor relations who would make you feel ashamed something that made you like other people vulnerable now he had them all the door was opened his servant brought him a card mr samuel galleycampaigne another leonard groaned and sprang to his feet another the sight or the thought of this man the caricature of his own family tall and thin like himself but with every feature vulgarized and the meanness of petty gains petty cares petty scheming and selfseeking stamped upon his face irritated leonard unspeakably and he was a cousin he stiffened involuntarily his attitude his expression became that of the supercilious beast formed by mr galley on his previous business the cousin came in and bowed slightly not holding out his hand there was a look in his face which meant resolution held back by fear the desire to try on something and the doubt as to whether it would be successful it is an expression which may be remarked on change and in every markettown on marketday it has been wisely perhaps frequently remarked that trouble brings out a mans true character far more certainly than prosperity which may encourage him to assume virtues not really his own the lines about the uses of adversity must be referred to the bystander rather than the patient because the former is then enabled to contemplate and observe the true man for the first time mr galley for instance who was smug in prosperity was openly and undisguisedly vulgar in adversity at this moment for instance he was struggling with adversity it made him red in the face it made him speak thick it made him perspire inconveniently and it made his attitude ungraceful he came up the stairs he knocked at the door with an expression of fixed resolution one might have expected him to bang his fist on the table and to cry out there thats what i want and thats what i mean to have he did not quite do that but he intended to do it when he called and he would have done i have no doubt but for the cold quiet air with which his cousin received him mr campaigne he began or cousin if you like mr campaigne perhaps said leonard the supercilious well mr campaigne then ive come to have a few words of explanationexplanation sir he repeated with some fierceness by all means pray take a chair he took a chair and was then seized by the doubt of which we have spoken perhaps the cause was the commanding position of his cousin standing over him six foot three in height and with a face like that of a judge not personally interested in the case before him the point is this ive got a bill against your family and i want to know whether i am to present it to you or to my greatgrandfather a bill of what nature a bill for maintenance we have maintained my grandmother for fifty years she has been kept partly by my grandfather partly by my family and partly by myself and its time that your family should do their duty that is a very remarkable claim putting it at a year which is cheap for the lavish way shes been kept that makes at compound interest it mounts up to and odd i shall be contented to square the claim for you propose to send in a billa bill for keeping your own grandmother that is just what i am going to do you must surely be aware that such a claim would not be entertained for a moment no court of law would so much as look at it i am aware of the fact but this is not a claim of an ordinary kind it is a claim that rests on equityon equity not on law what is the equitable side of the claim well its this way my grandfather who failed for an enormous amountwhich showed the position he occupied in the citymarried my grandmother in the reasonable expectation that she would bring him a fortune it is true that the old man was then not more than fifty or so but he did not count so much on a will as on a settlement i understand that the marriage was undertaken without consultation with my greatgrandfather or under the circumstances with his solicitors that was no doubt the case but when one marries into so wealthy a family and when the head of it is not in a position to be consulted the least that can be expected is a settlementa settlement of some kind my grandfather said that he expected nothing less than twenty thousandtwenty thousand he dated his subsequent misfortunes to the failure of this expectation because he got nothing perhaps mr campaigne as you were not born then you can hardly believe that he got nothing i am in ignorance of the whole business quite soquite so i think therefore that i am quite justified in asking your people to pay me just the bare sumoutofpocket expenseswhich we have expended upon my grandmother oh the tone was not encouraging but the other man was not versed in these external signs and went on unabashed you saw yourself the other day the style in which we live i believe mr campaigne you will acknowledge that it was a noble tea leonard bowed solemnly an account rendered under any circumstances for the maintenance of a grandmother a mother and a wife i should myself tear up and throw into the fire but it is no concern of mine you can send your claim to my greatgrandfather my greatgrandfather as much as yours to his solicitors whose name and address you probably know if not i will furnish you with them if that is all you have to say he moved towards the door no no i mean this we had a right to expect a fortune and there has been none you said that before again mr galley i cannot discuss this matter with you take your claim to the right quarter im not obliged to keep the old woman he replied sulkily i decline to discuss your views of duty i want to wake up the old man to a sense of justice i will too if hes mad we will find out if he isnt i will make him payeven if i have to expose him leonard stepped to the door and threw it open mr galley rose his face betrayed many emotions in fact the conversation had not proceeded quite on the lines he hoped dont be in a hurry he said give me a little time leonard closed the door and returned to the hearthrug take time mr galley i dont want he said to behave ungentlemanly but im in desperate trouble if you think its no good sending in a claim i withdraw it the fact is mr campaigne i want money i want money desperately leonard made no reply this was discouraging ive been speculatingin house propertybacking a builder and the man is going that is what has happened to me if i cant raise a thousand pounds in the course of a day or two i must go too you will not raise anything by sending in a bill for the maintenance of your grandmother put that out of your head mr galley he groaned then will you lend me a thousand pounds mr campaigne you were very friendly when you came to see us the other day the security is firstclassthe shells of three unfinished housesand i will give you eight per cent for the accommodation good security and good interest there you are come mr campaigne you are not a business man and i dont think you can make as a rule more than three per cent at the outside i have no money either to lend or to advance i have been to the bank but they wont look at the business its a mean creeping miserable bank i shall change it well mr galley i am sorry to hear that you are in trouble but i cannot help you if i do go bankrupt he said savagely the old woman will go into the workhouse thats one consolation and shes your greataunt you forget your sister mr galley from what i know of board schools i should say that she is quite able to maintain her grandmother if not there may be other assistance theres another thing then he persisted when i spoke to you first i mentioned the word accumulations no one mentions any other word just now i think leonard replied with a touch of temper they must be enormous ive been working it out enormous and that old man cant live much longer he cant hes ninetyfive mr galley i put it to you as a lawyer or at least as a solicitor do you think that your greatgrandfather has lived all these years without making a will he cant make a will he is a madman ask his solicitors for an opinion on that subject the old man will not speak but he receives communications and gives instructions i shall dispute the will if im not named in it i shall expect a full share i shall show that hes a madman as you please meanwhile it is doubtful whether the testator ever heard your name he knows his daughters name and whats hers is mine i must open the door again mr galley if you talk nonsense i hear by the way that you have made that lady sign certain papers as a solicitor you must know that such documents would be regarded by the court with extreme suspicion if i have to go bankrupt i shall let the whole world know that you wouldnt lift a finger to save your own cousin as you please and if theres a will that turns out me ill drag the whole thing into court and expose you i will expose you by leonard opened the door again this time mr galley you will go he obeyed he dropped his hat on his head he marched out and he bawled on the stairs as he went down ill expose youill expose youill expose you these terrifying and minatory words rang up and down the stairs of that respectable mansion like the voice of an accusing angel so that everybody who heard them jumped and turned pale and murmured oh good lord whats come out now chapter xviii the light that broke it was sunday morning leonard sat before the fire doing nothing he had done nothing for three weeks he had no desire to do anything his work lay neglected on the table books and papers piled together he was brooding over the general wreck of all he had held precious over the family history the family disgraces and disasters and the mystery which it was hopeless to look into but impossible to forget the bells were ringing all around the air was full of the melody or the jingle of the bells of many churches then constance knocked at his door may i come in she asked and came in without waiting for an answer i was proposing to go to the abbey she said but things have got on my nerves i felt that i could not sit still for the service i must come and talk to you i suppose that we know the very worst now said leonard why do you worry yourself about my troubles constance because we are cousinsbecause we are friends isnt that enough she might have added as another reason that the events of the last three weeks had drawn them more closely togetherso closely that it wanted but a wordif once their minds were free from the obsession of the mysteryto bind them so that they should never again drift asunder leonard replied with a wintry smile without you to talk things over constance i believe i should go mad and i feel so guiltyso guiltywhen i think of what i said so lightly about scandals and poor relations with all this hanging over your head nothing more i should thinkhe looked about the room as if to make sure that no telegrams or letters were floating in the aircan happen nowexcept to me everybody else is laid low one cousin has brought me a bill for the maintenance of his grandmother for fifty yearssays he will take eighteen thousand pounds down one ought really to be proud of such a cousin the solicitor of the commercial road i suppose but really what does it matter nothing only at the moment there is a piling up and every straw helps to break the camels back the man says he is going to be a bankrupt my uncle frederickthat largesouled genial thirsty wealthy prosperous representative of colonial enterprisenow turns out to be an impostor and a fraud oh leonard an impostor and a fraud he repeated he has a small general store in an australian township and he has come over to represent this as a big business and to make a company out of it the other unclethe learned and successful lawyer dont tell me leonard another time then we ought certainly to have heard the worst let us go to the village and bury the family honour before the altar in the church and put up a brass in memory of what our ancestors created no you will guard it still leonard it could not be in better hands you must notyou cannot bury your own soul leonard relapsed into silence constance stood over him sad and disheartened presently she spoke how long she asked how long he replied who can say it came of its own accordit was uninvited perhaps it will go as it came you would rather be left alone she asked let me stay and talk a little my friend we must have done with it after all what does it matter to us how a crime was committed seventy years ago it concerns your own ancestor constance yes he poor man was killed leonard when i say poor man the words exactly measure the amount of sorrow that i feel for him an ancestor of four generations past is no more than a shadow his fate awakens a little interest but no sadness i should say the same thing i suppose but my ancestor was not killed he was condemned to a living death constance it is no use whether i will or no the case haunts me day and night he sprang to his feet and threw up his arms as one who would throw off chains how long since i first heard of it through that unfortunate old lady of the commercial road three weeks it seems like fifty years as for any purpose that i had before or any ambitionit is gonequite gone and vanished as for me i am haunted in the same manner i am like a man who is hypnotisedi am no longer a free agent i am ordered to do this and i do it as for this accursed book of extractshe laid his hand upon the abominationi am forced to go through it over and over again every time i sit down i am prompted by a kind of assurance that something will be discovered every time i rise up it is with disgust that nothing has occurred to me are we to go on all our lives looking for what we can never find we know the whole contents by heart yet every day there is the feeling that something will start into light it is madness constance i am going madlike my grandfather who killed himself that will end the family tale of woes so far as i am concerned send the book back to its owner he shook his head i know it all that will be no use burn the dreadful thing no use i should be made to write it all out again i dropped an envelope in your letterbox last night have you opened it i dont think i have read a single letter for the last three weeks then it must be among the pile what a heap of letters oh leonard you are indeed occupied with this business i found last night three letters from langley holme to his wife they were written from campaigne park but on what occasion i do not know i thought at first that i might have found something that would throw a little light upon the business but of course when one considers how could he throw light upon his own tragic end he took the packet carelessly do the letters tell us anything nothing important i believe they show that he was staying at the park we know that already it is strange how we are continually mocked by the things we learn it was the same with the letter from australia that was an interesting letterso are theseeven if they tell us nothing that we do not know already he opened the envelope and took out the packet of letters there were three they were written on square letter paper the folds had been worn away and the letters were now dropping to pieces the ink was faded as becomes ink of the nineteenth century leonard laid them on the table to read because they were in so ragged a condition the date he said is difficult to make out but the last letter looks like that would make it you say that there is nothing important in them nothing so far as i could make out but read them you may find something the first letter was quite unimportant containing only a few instructions and words of affection the next two letters however spoke of the writers brotherinlaw my little dispute with algernon is still unsettled he makes a personal matter of it which is disagreeable he really is the most obstinate and tenacious of mortals i dont like to seem to be thinking or saying anything unkind about him indeed he is a splendid fellow all round only the most obstinate but i shall not budge one inch last night in the library he entirely lost command of himself and became like a madman for a few minutes i had heard from others about the ungovernable side of his temper but had never seen it before he really becomes dangerous at such times he raged and glared like a bull before a red rag since philippa is happy she has certainly never seen it in the third letter he spoke of the same dispute we had another row last night row or no row i am not going to budge one inch we are going to discuss the matter againquietly he promises i will write to you again and tell you what is settled my dear child i am ashamed to see this giant of a man so completely lose control of himself however i suppose he will give way when he sees that he must there seems to have been a slight dispute said leonard his brotherinlaw lost his temper and stormed a bit but they made it up again well constance that is alla little quarrel made up again undoubtedly he replaced the letters in the envelope and returned them to constance keep them he said they are valuable to you as letters from your ancestor like the letter from mr john dunning which we received with amazement as a voice from the grave they help us to realise the businessif one wanted any help but we realised it beforequite vividly enoughand that he sighed is all we are no whit advanced there were no more papers i searched the desk over and over again but i could find nothing more now leonard she took a chair and placed it beside his own at the table leave the fire and take your chair and we will begin and finish this time must be the very last it is high time that we should make an end of this as for me i came here this morning just to say that whatever happens i am determined that we must make an end the thing is becoming dangerous to your peace of mind we cannot make an end yesyeswe are now persons bewitched let us swear that after this morning we will put away the book and the papers and cease from any further trouble about it if we can he replied gloomily leonard for the first time in your life you are superstitious we may swear what we like we shall come back to the case again tomorrow we will not let us resolve nay leonard you must not continue to you it is becoming dangerous leonard sighed it is weary work well then for the last time he laid the packet of papers upon the table he opened the dreadful bookthe book of fate it is always the same thing whenever i open the book there is the same sense of sickness and loathing are the pages poisoned they are my friend he began the old round that is to say he read the case as they had drawn it up while constance compared it with the evidence these are the facts of the inquest of the trial of the effects of the crime the evidence of place and the evidence of time the two leave the house they walk together through the park they cross the road they get over the stile they enter the wood then the squire turns back after some short time constance corrected according to the recollection of the ancient man who was the birdscarer he went into the wood then the squire walked homewards rapidly if the housekeeper gave the time correctly and it took him the same time to get home as to reach the woodi have timed the distancehe may have been ten minutesa quarter of an hour in the wood two hours or so later the boy saw a working man whom he knew well by sight and name enter the wood he was dressed in a smockfrock and carried certain tools or instruments over his shoulder he remained in the wood a few minutes only and then came running out his white smock spotted with red as the boy could see plainly from the hillside he ran to the farmyard beyond the field and returned with other men and a shutter they entered the wood and presently came out carrying something covered up the boy was asked both at the inquest and the trial whether anyone else had entered the wood or had come out of it he was certain that no one had done so or could have done so without his knowledge the men carried the body to the house they were met on the terrace by the housekeeper who seemed to have shrieked and run into the house where she told the womenservants who all together set up a shrieking through the house someone after the mistress was thus terrified blurted out the dreadful truth in an hour the squire had lost his wife as well as his brotherinlaw at the inquest the squire gave the principal evidence he said that he walked with his brotherinlaw as far as the wood when he turned back not as far as the wood he said that on entering the wood he remembered an appointment and turned back remembering the evidence of the boy and your timing of the distance we must give him some little time in the wood very wellthe longer the better because it would show that there was nobody lurking there then john dunning deposed to finding the body it lay on its back the forepart of the head was shattered in a terrible manner the unfortunate gentleman was quite dead beside the body lay a heavy branch broken off it would seem to have been caught up and used as a cudgel blood was on the thicker end a medical man gave evidence as to the fact of death he reached the house at about one and after attending the unfortunate lady who was dying or dead he turned his attention to the body of the victim who had then been dead sometime probably two hours or thereabouts the valet deposed further that the pockets were searched and that nothing had been taken from them the coroner summed up the only person who had gone into the wood after the deceased gentleman was the man john dunning who but john dunning could have committed this foul murder the verdict of the jury was delivered at oncewilful murder against john dunning we have next the trial of john dunning mr campaigne was so fully persuaded in his own mind of the mans innocence that he provided him at his own expense with counsel the counsel employed was clever he heard the evidence the same as that given at the inquest but instead of letting it pass he pulled it to pieces in crossexamination thus on examining mr campaigne he elicited the very important fact that mr holme was six feet high and strong in proportion while the prisoner was no more than five feet six and not remarkably strong that it was impossible to suppose that the murdered man would stand still to receive a blow delivered in full face by so little a man that was a very strong point to make then he examined the doctor as to the place in which the blow was received it appeared that it was on the top of the head behind the forehead yet delivered face to face he made the doctor acknowledge that in order to receive such a blow from a short man like the prisoner the murdered man must have been sitting or kneeling now the wood was wet with recent rain and there was nothing to sit upon therefore it required said the doctor a man taller than mr holme himself to deliver such a blow leonard stopped for a brief comment it shows how one may pass over things i passed over this point altogether at first and indeed until the other day perhaps because the newspaper cutting is turned over at this place the murderer therefore was taller than langley holme who was himself six feet high the point should have afforded a clue at all events it effectively cleared the prisoner it appears that the crime created the greatest interest in the neighbourhood there were kept up for a long time after the acquittal of john dunning discussions and arguments for and against as to his guilt or innocence no one else was arrested and no one tried and the police left off looking after the case indeed there was nothing more than what i have set down in these notes the friends of mr campaigne however speedily discovered that he was entirely changed in consequence of the double shock of the deaths of brother and sister brotherinlaw and wife in one day he ceased to take interest in anything he refused to see his friends he would not even notice his children he gradually retreated entirely into himself he left his business affairs to an agent he dismissed his servants he sent his children to the care of a distant cousin to get them out of the way he never left the house at all except to walk on the terrace he kept neither horses nor dogs he never spoke to anyone he had never been known to speak for all these years except once and then two or three words to me the following he went on is also a part of the case we have been a very unfortunate family of mr campaignes three children the eldest committed suicide for no reason discoverable the next was drowned at sea the third married a bankrupt tradesman and dropped very low down in the world of the next generation the eldest my father died at an early age and at a time when his prospects were as bright as those of any young member of the house his second brother has just confessed that he has led a life of pretence and deception and his younger brother who was sent abroad for his profligacy told me yesterday that he is about to become bankrupt while another member of the family is threatened with ruin and to judge from his terror with worse than ruin there are still two or three facts that you have omitted said constance we had better have them all what are they you have not mentioned that the boy went into the wood early in the morning and found no one that the woman in the cottagethis was the voice of the grave that we asked for and obtainedsaid that nobody at all had been through the wood that day until the gentlemen appeared we will consider everything but remember constance we are sworn not to go through this ceremony again whatever the force that draws us we have forgotten there is the halffinished letter that we found upon the table read that again leonard it was in one envelope among the papers leonard took it out there is nothing in it that we do not know langley was staying in the house never mind read it he read it algernon and langley have gone into the study to talk business it is this affair of the mill that is still unsettled i am a little anxious about algernon he has been strangely distrait for the last two or three days perhaps he is anxious about me there need be no anxiety i am quite well and strong this morning he got up very early and i heard him walking about in the study below this is not his way at all however should a wife repine because her lord is anxious about her algernon is very determined about that mill but i fear that langley will not give way you know how firm he can be behind that pleasant smile of his nothing much in that letter constance is there i dont know it is the voice of the dead so are these letters of langleys to his wife they speak of a subject of disagreement neither would give way mr campaigne was at times overcome with anger uncontrolled leonard it is wonderful how much we have learned since we first began this inquiryi mean this new evidence of the quarrel and mr campaignes ungovernable temper and his strange outburst in the evening oh it is new evidenceher face changed she looked like one who sees a light suddenly shine in the darknessa bright and unexpected light it is new evidence she repeated with wondering dazzled eyes it explains everythingshe stopped and turned white oh she shrank back as if she felt a sudden pain at her heart she put up her hands as if to push back some terrible creature she sprang to her feet she trembled and shook she clasped her foreheadthe gesture was natural to the face of terror and amazement and sudden understanding leonard caught her in his arms but she did not fall she laid her hand upon his shoulder and she bowed her head oh god help us she murmured what is it constance what is it leonard no oneno oneno one was in the wood but only those twoand they quarrelled and the squire was taller than his brotherand we have found the truth leonard my poor friendmy cousinwe have found the truth she drew herself away from him and sank back into her chair hiding her face in her hands leonard dropped the papers constance he cried for in a moment the truth flashed across his brainthe truth that explained everythingthe despair of the wretched man the resolve to save an innocent man a remorse that left him not by day or night so that he could do nothing think of nothing for all the long long years that followed a remorse which forbade him to hold converse with his fellowman which robbed him of every pleasure and every solace even the solace of his little children constance he cried again holding out his hands as if for help she lifted her head but not her eyes she took both his hands in hers my friend she whispered have courage so for a brief space they remained he standing before her she sitting but holding both his hands with weeping eyes i said he murmured that nothing more would happen there wanted only the lastthe fatal blow we were constrained to go on until the truth came to us it has come to us after all these yearsfrom the memory of the old man who scared the birds from the innocent man who was triedhe spoke from the grave from the murdered man himself leonard this thing should be marvellous in our eyes for this is not mans handiwork he drew away his hands no it is vengeance for the spilling of blood she made no reply but she rose dashed the tears from her eyes placed the papers in the book closed it tied it up again neatly with tape and laid the parcel in the lowest drawer of the table let it lie there she said tomorrow if this possession is past as i think it will be we will burn it papers and all he looked on saying nothing what could he say what are we to do with our knowledge he asked after a few minutes nothing it is between you and me nothing let us nevermore speak of the thing it is between you and me the unaccustomed tears blinded her eyes her eyes were filled with a real womanly pity the student of books was gone the woman of nature stood in her place and womanlike she wept over the shame and horror of the man leave me constance he said there is blood between us my hands and those of all my house are red with bloodthe blood of your own people she obeyed she turned away she came back again leonard she said the past is past courage we have learned the truth before that unhappy man dies it is a sign the day of forgiveness draws nigh then she left him softly chapter xix the signs of change leonard was left alone he threw himself into a chair and tried to think he could not the power of concentration had left him the tension of the last three weeks followed by the wholly unexpected nature of the discovery was too much for a brain even so young and strong as his the horror of the discovery was not even felt he tried to realise it he knew that it ought to be there but it was not all he felt was an overwhelming sense of relief he fell asleep in the chair before the fire it was then about noon on sunday from time to time his man looked in made up the fire for the spring day was still chilly but would not awaken his master it was past seven in the evening when he woke up twilight was lying about the room he remembered that constance had laid the papers in a drawer he opened the drawer he took out the papers and the book he held them in his hand for the first time since his possession of those documents he felt no loathing of the book and its accursed pages nor did he feel the least desire to open it or to read any more about the abominable case he returned the packet to the drawer then he perceived that he was again downladen with the oppression of sleep he went into his bedroom and threw himself dressed as he was upon the bed when he instantly fell sound asleep he was neither hungry nor thirsty he wanted no food he wanted nothing but sleep he slept the clock round and more it was ten on monday morning when he woke up refreshed by his long and dreamless sleep and in a normal condition of hunger more than this although the discoverythe tragic discoverywas fresh in his mind he found himself once more free to think of anything he pleased he dressed expecting the customary summons to the book and the case none came he took breakfast and opened the paper for three weeks he had been unable to read the paper at all now to his surprise he approached it with all his customary interest nothing was suggested to his mind as to the book he went into the study he again opened the drawer he was not afraid though no compulsion obliged him to take out the book since he was not constrained as before to open it he put it back again he remarked that the loathing with which he had regarded it only the day before was gone in fact he heeded the book no longer it was like the dead body of a demon which could do no more harm he turned to the papers on his writingtable there were the unfinished sheets of his article lying piled up with notes and papers in neglect he took them up with a newborn delight and the anticipation of the pleasure of finishing the thing he wondered how he had been able to suspend his work for so long there was a pile letters the unopened unanswered letters of the last three weeks he hurriedly tore them open some of them at least must be answered without delay all this time he was not forgetful of the discovery that was now made it was complete strange it did not look so horrible after fourandtwenty hours it seemed as if the discovery was the longlooked for answer to the mystery which explained everything he sat down his mind clear once more and tried to make out the steps by which the truth had been recovered to give his thoughts words we started with two assumptions both of which were false and both made it impossible to find the truth the first of these was the assumption that the two were fast and firm friends whereas they were for the moment at variance on some serious affairso much at variance that on one occasion at least before the last one of them had become like a madman in his rage the second was the assumption that the squire had turned and gone home at the entrance of the wood both at the inquest and the trial that had been taken for granted now the boy had simply said that they went into the wood together and that one had come out alone in consequence of these two assumptions we were bound to find some one in the wood who must have done the deed the boy declared that no one was in the wood at halfpast five in the morning and that he saw no one but these two go in till john dunning went in at noon the cottage woman said that no one at all had used that path that day the coppice was so light that the two who went in must have seen anybody who was lurking there if we remove the two assumptionsif we suppose that they entered the wood quarrellingif we remember that the evening before one of them had become like a madman for rageif we give them ten minutes or a quarter of an hour togetherif we remember the superior height of one which alone enabled the blow to fall on the top of the others headif we add to all this the subsequent behavior of the survivor there can no longer be the least room for doubt the murderer was algernon campaigne justice of the peace master of campaigne park all this he reasoned out coldly and clearly that he could once more reason on any subject at all gave him so much relief that the blow and shame of the discovery were greatly lessened he remembered besides that the event happened seventy years before that there could be no further inquiry that the secret belonged to himself and to constance and that there was no need to speak of it to any other members of his family by this time what was left of the family honour he laughed bitterly as he reflected on the blots upon that once fair white scutcheon suicidebankruptcythe mud and mire of dire povertyforgeryshame and pretence and at last the culminating crime beyond which one can hardly gothe last crime which was also the firstthe slaying of a man by his brothermurder a knock at the door roused him was it more trouble he sat up instinctively to meet it but he was quite calm he did not expect trouble when it comes one generally feels it beforehand now he felt no kind of anticipation it was in fact only a note from constance i write to tell you that the misfortunes of your house are over there will be no more i am certain of what i say do not ask me how i learned this because you would not believe we have been ledand this you will not believeby the hand of the man who was killed and none otherto the discovery which ends it all constance the discovery he thought which is worse than all the rest put together no more misfortunes no more consequences then what does she mean consequences must go on you remember how one day there came to a certain patriarch one who told of trouble and almost before he had finished speaking there came also another with more trouble and yet a third with more you remember also how to this man there came one after the other messengers who brought confession of fraud and disgrace this afternoon the opposite happened there came three but there were not messengers of trouble but of peace and even joy the first was his cousin mary anne ive come she said with a message from my brother sam is very sorry that he carried on here as he says he did i dont know how he carried on but sam is very nasty sometimes when his temper and his troubles get the better of him pray do not let him be troubled i have quite forgotten what he said it seems that he brought his precious bill against granny and showed it to you he says that hes put it in the fire and that he didnt mean it except in the hope that youd lend him a little money i see well my cousin is that all oh he begs your pardon humbly and he says that the builder has got the bank to back him after all and hell be contented to wait now for his share of the accumulations i am sorry that he still entertains hopes in that direction oh he thinks about nothing else he has got the whole amount worked out he knows how much there will be if it is left to you or to anybody else he will dispute the will hell carry it up to the lords he says very good we may wait until the will is produced meantime mary anne there is a little point which he seems to forget it his grandmother and not himself who could have a right to dispute the will can he be so poor in law as not to know that he makes granny sign papers i dont know how many she has signed he is always thinking about some other danger to be met and then he draws up a paper and makes her sign it with me as witness granny never asks what the paper means signing documents is dangerous you must not allow it my cousin if there is anything coming to your branch of the family from campaigne park you are as much concerned as sam she laughed you dont know sam he means to have it all he says that hes arranged to have it all let us talk about something else is your grandmother content to go on living as she does now no but she has always been so unhappy that a few years more of sams bad temper and selfishness dont seem to matter i came here this morning partly to tell you that ive arranged it at last i had it out with sam yesterday i told him that he could go on living with mother and i would take grannyshes so vexed you cant thinkthat sam should have gone and made out a bill for her keep and presented to youthat i was able to persuade her granny will live with mei can afford itand mother will go on with sam and i do hope mr campaigne that you will come and see her sometimes she says have you read the book yes i will go to see her sometimes tell her so and as for the book i have read it all through and did it do you good to read the book to me it always makes that old gentleman so grand and goodfinding lawyers for the poor innocent man and all tell her the book has produced all the effect she desired and more while she was still speaking uncle fred burst in mary anne retired making way for the visitor who she perceived from the family likeness was a large and very magnificent specimen of the campaigne family he burst in he came in like an earthquake making the furniture crack and the glasses rattle and the pictureframes shake he showed the most jovial happy benevolent air possible no one could look happier more benevolent and more contented with himself congratulate me my dear boy he cried offering the most friendly hand in the world there was a fine and large forgiveness in that extended hand the last conversation was forgotten and dismissed from memory barlow brothers is saved oh how have you saved it i will tell you how it has been a most wonderful stroke of luck for australian enterprise nothing short of a national disaster has been averted indeed i gathered from your last communication that the business waswell not worth saving not worth saving my dear leonard it is colossalcolossal leonard is still mystified whenever he thinks of it by this abrupt change of front what did he mean i am immediately going back to australia to put things on a right footing oh you have made a company in the city after all no he replied with decision the city has had its chance and has refused its opportunity i leave the city to lament its own shortsighted refusal i am sorry for the city i now return to australia the firm of barlow brothers may rise conspicuous and colossal or it may continue to be a purveyor of sardines and blacking or it may go smash at this point his eye fell upon a letter it was one of the documents in the case in fact it was the letter from australia which came with john dunnings memorandum by accident it had not been put away with the rest he read the superscription on the seal john dunnings sons john dunnings sons he asked john dunnings sons its an old story your grandfather helped john dunning in early life leonard took out the letter his family write to express the gratitudea postmortem gratitudeof the late john dunning to the family generally would you like to read it uncle fred read it his jovial face became graveeven austere in thoughtfulness he folded the letter and put it in his pocket by your leave he said my dear boy the dunnings are the richest people in the colony i am a made man their gratitude simply warms my heart it inspires once more the old youthful belief in human nature with this letterwith this introductionbarlow brothers vanish damn the sardine boxes fred campaigne returns to australia and fortune smiles my boy farewell with this letter in my pocket i start tomorrow stop stop cried leonard how about the colossal business how about the saving of that important shanty where you dispensed sardines uncle fred looked at his watch but you say that you have saved ithow i have just timeagain he looked at his watchto keepah a most important appointment i shall go out to australia next week on the way out i will amuse myself by writing you an account of the barlow brothersin several chaptersthe conception the first box of sardines the shanty the realisation the millionaire novels would not be more thrilling but you abandon this colossal undertaking i give it up why because an easier way lies open i should be more than human if i did not take the easier way you are going out to mr dunning with that letter in your pocket i am going sir to throw myself into the arms of gratitude human nature human nature how lovely a thing is human nature when it is grateful leonard grunted i am not sure he said that i did right in giving you that letter you can have it back again i know the contents and now my dear nephew there is but one small duty to performi allude to the hotel bill my brother has found the passagemoneychristopher was always a selfish beast but his language at parting with that money was inexcusable he refuses the hotel bill and so you come to me why should i pay your hotel bill there is no reason that i know of except the fact that i have referred the hotel clerk to you as a member of parliament and a gentleman you come home boasting of your wealth being next door to penniless you forgetthe accumulations and you end with the confession that you were lying you mean putting the best foot forwardpresenting myself in the enviable light of the successful unclethe modern nabob and you levy money on your people i borrow on my reversionary interestsin the accumulations i will pay your bill on the understanding that you take yourself off how much is it uncle fred named the amount it was a staggerer good heavens man you must have bathed in champagne there has been champagne fred replied with dignity i had to support my position city men lunched with me and dined with me we discussed the fourth act in the comedy of barlow brothersthe realisation as for the bill i borrow the amount leonard sat down and wrote a cheque uncle fred took it read it folded it and sighed with a tear of regret that he had not named double the amount thanks he said the act was ungraciously performed but the main thing is to get the cheque that i have always felt even when i got it out of old sixty per cent well i go back to a land which has been hitherto inhospitable farewell my nephew i shall bask i shall batten whatever that means i shall fatten i shall swell out with fatness in the sunshinethe sydney sunshine is very fatteningof gratitude and the generosity of a sydney millionaire he buttoned his coat and went away with loud and resounding footsteps as he had come the furniture cracking the pictureframes rattling so far leonard has not received the promised explanation of the mystery of barlow brothers nor has that check been returned there remained one more credit to the family it was christopher the eminent and learned counsel he too called half an hour after the departure of his brother i came he said first of all to warn you against giving or lending any more money to that fraudmy brother fred you are too late then i have paid his hotel bill you have paid his passage out no i paid his hotel bill you paid his passage out oh well so long as he goes i paid his hotel bill because he threatened to go into the city and expose my real name go into the city what could he do in the city whom does he know in the city your brother is just a mass of lies and impostures what does it matter if he is really going he must go nobody except you and me will lend or give him any money he goes as he camethe wealthy australian he has promised my people to make them rich by his will he hinted at an incurable disorder and he bade farewell for everwith my cheque in his pocket let him go you had something else to say yes it was about my own affairs they know all leonard they know all who told them ive had a terrible time with the wife and daughter but they know all that vindictive little beast called at the house went upstairs and told them everything then he went away grinning there was a terrible scene so i should suppose yes its all right though at last i persuaded them with a good deal of trouble that the profession was rather more holy than the church i set forth the factsthe honour and glorythe secret diffusion and cultivation of a better tastehigher standardsa missionnobler stheticsand the incomeespecially the income that would be a serious factor in the case yes and i pointed out the educational sidethe advance of oratory so they came round little by little and i clinched the thing by offering to go back to the bar in which case i told them we should have to live at shepherds bush in a a year semidetached while algernon went into the city as a clerk at fifteen shillings a week which is more than his true value well since it did well i congratulate you the profession will be continued of course of course but i confess i was surprised at the commonsense of algernon he will immediately enter at the bar he will join me there will henceforth be two successful lawyers in the family instead of one and what about the threatened exposure algernon has gone to see the beast he is to promise him that if a word or a hint is dropped everybody shall know where hethe beastbuys his stories and his poems and his epigrams as well as his afterdinner speeches algernon has fished it all out why sir the man is a frauda common fraud he buys everything so with this tribute to truth and honesty the weaver of speeches for other people went away only the day before leonard would have received this communication with disgust as another humiliation the way of deceptionthe life of pretencewas kept open it would have been a tearing down of more family pride now it was nothing the pretence of it the ready way in which his cousin algernon had dropped into it belonged to someone elsenot to himself the family honoursuch as he had always regarded it and believed in itwas gonesmashed and broken up into fragments the house of the campaignes like every other family had its decaying branches its dead branches its offshoots and humble branches its branches of dishonour there is no such thing existing as a family where men have been always bayards and its women always beyond reproach upon him had fallen the blow of finding out the things concealed the blot on the scutcheon the ugly stories of the past the poor relations and the unworthy relations the discovery humiliated him at the outset it became rapidly a thing apart from himself and outside himself uncle fred might be an impostor and fraud very good it mattered nothing to him uncle christopher was a pretender and a humbugwhat did it matter the eastend solicitor was a person with no pretence at honour and honestywhat did it matter they belonged to him by blood relationship yet he was stillhimself only one thing remained and now even the horror of that was more tolerable than the humiliation of the first revelations it was the terrible story of the crime and the seventy years of expiation in which there had been no expiation because nothing can ever atone for a crime or make it as if it had not been men pray for forgivenessneither reward us after our iniquities there should be another and a less selfish prayer that all shall be in the world as if the iniquity had never been committed that the consequences of the iniquity shall be stayed miraculously stayedbecause but for a miracle they must take their course according to the great law of nature that nothing can happen save under conditions imposed by the record of the past the dream of the sinner is that he shall be forgiven and shall go straight to the land of white clothing and hearts at peace for ever while down below the children and the grandchildren are in the misery of the consequencesthe inevitable consequences of his follies and his crimes so every soul stands or falls by itself yet in its standing or in its falling it supports or it drags down the children and the grandchildren these thoughts and other thoughts like unto these crowded into the brain of the young man when he sat alonethe dossier of the crime locked up in the drawerthe disgraces of his cousins pushed asideand the crime which caused so much little more than a memory and an abiding pity everything had come to leonard which constance not knowing what the words might mean desired for him how great the change it made in him as yet he hardly suspected chapter xx he speaks at last was it really the last day of visitation punishment or consequence would there be no more punishment or consequence it matters little which one thing more happened on this eventful day it came in a telegram from the ancestral housekeeper please come down as soon as you can there is a change a change when a man is ninetyfive what change do his friends expect leonard carried the telegram to constance i think he said it must be the end it is assuredly the end you will go at oncetoday let me go with you leonard you but it would only distress you it will not distress me if i can take him before he dies a simple message you sent me a message how did you know that it was a message i knew it was a message because i saw it with my minds eye written clear and bright and because i heard it plain and unmistakable it came to me in the night i thought it was a dream now i think it was a message you said that all the misfortunes were over like your message it was a dream yet now we get this telegram whydo you call this a misfortune what better can we desire for that poor old man but the end they started at once they caught a train which landed them at the nearest station a little before seven it was an evening in early spring the sun was sinking the cloudless sky was full of peace and light the air was as soft as it was fragrant there was no rustle of branches even the birds were hushed it is the end said constance softly and it is peace they had not spoken since they started together for the station when one knows the mind of his companion what need for words presently they turned from the road into the park it was opposite the stile over which seventy years ago one man had passed on his way to death and another less fortunate on his way to destruction let us sit down in this place said leonard before we go on i have something to sayi should like to say it before we are face to face with that most unhappy of men constance obeyed and sat down upon the stile when we came here before he began with a serious voice and grave eyes i was fresh from the shame and the discovery of the family misfortunes and we talked of the sins of the fathers and the eating of sour grapes and the consolation of the prophet i remember every word very well i think you will understand me constance when i say that i am rejoiced that i made the discovery of this fatal family history with all that it entailedthe train of evils and shamesyes even though it has led to these weeks of a kind of obsession or possession during which i have been unable to think of anything else what do you think now are the sins of the fathers visited upon the children or was the prophet right i see with you that it is impossible to avoid the consequences of the fathers life and actions the words third or fourth generation must not be taken literally they mean that from father to son there is a continual chain of events linked together and inseparable and always moulding and causing the events which follow and this though we know not the past and cannot see the connecting links that form the chain in a higher stage humanity will refrain from some things and will be attracted by other things entirely through the consideration of their effect upon those who follow after it will be a punishment selfimposed by those who fall that they must in pity and in mercy have no children to inherit their shame you put my own thoughts into words but about the children i am not so sure their very shames may be made a ladder such as augustine made his sins there is nothing so true as the inheritance of consequences except that one does not inherit the guilt even with the guilt there is sometimes the tendency to certain lines of action nothing so hereditary as the drink craving says the physician so i suppose there may be a hereditary tendency in other directions some meni have known somecannot sit down to steady work they must lie about in the sun they must loaf they have a vitium an incurable disease as incurable as a humpback of indolence mind and body some seem unable to remain honestwe all know examples of such men some cannot possibly tell the truth what i meanleonard went on clearing his own mind by putting his wandering thoughts into argumentative arrayis that the liability to temptationthe tendencyis inherited but the necessity which forces a man to act is not inherited that is due to himself what says the prophet again as i live saith the lord godsaith the lord god it is magnificent it is terrible in its depth of earnestness he declares an inspiration through him the lord strengthens his own wordveritably strengthens his own wordby an oath as i live saith the lord god can you imagine anything stronger more audacious but for the eternal verity that follows the speakers voice trembled his cheek touched by the setting sun glowed the light of the western sky filled his eyes constance womanlike trembled at the sight of the man who stood revealed to herthe new mantransformed by the experience of shames and sorrows as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine but if a man doeth that which is lawful and right he shall surely live saith the lord god saith the lord god leonard repeated what must have been the faith of a man who could so attribute his words how to sound the depths of his faith and his insight he verily believed that he heard the voice of the lord we live for and by each other leonard returned we think that we stand by ourselves and we are lifted up by the work of our forefathers we talk as if we lived alone and we are but links in the chain we are formed and we form we are forged and we forge i have been like unto one who stands in a crowd and is moved here and there but believes all the time that he is alone on a hilltop he was silent for awhile presently he went on all that has followed the crime he said has been in the nature of consequence the man who committed the act retired from the world he deserted the world he gave up his duties he resigned his children to others one of them went to sea he was drowned others were drowned with himthat was but a consequence his daughter neglected and ill educated ran away with a vulgar adventurer whom she took for a gallant gentlemanthat was a consequence his son found out the dreadful truth and committed suicide his boys had no father two of them fell into evil waysthat was a consequence my own father died young but not so young as to leave me a mere infantthat was a misfortune but not a consequence in other words constance the sins of that old man have been visited upon the children but the soul of the son has been as the soul of the father that is the sum and substance of the whole the consequences are still with us that poor lady in the commercial road is still in the purgatory of poverty which she brought upon herself her son is and will continue what he is her daughter rises above her surroundings she shall surely live saith the lord god my two uncles will go on to the end in their own way and so i suppose shall i myself he stopped the light went out of his eyes he was once more outwardly his former self that is all leonard that is all i want you to understand that at the endif this is the endi desire to feel towards that old man no thought or feeling of reproach only of pity for the fatal act of a moment and the long punishment of seventy yearsand you whose ancestor he smote only with forgiveness in the name of that ancestor and of pity akin to yours and equal to yours come leonard perhaps the end has come already they entered the park by the broken gate and the ruined lodge i have been looking for some such call said constance this morning i sent you that message i knew it was a true message because there fell upon me quite suddenly a deep calm all my anxieties vanished we have been so tornshe spoke as if the house was hers as wellby troubles and forebodings with such woes and rumours of woes that when they vanished suddenly and unexpectedly i knew that the time was over you are a witch constance many women are when they are interested oh leonard what a happiness that there is always an end of everythingof sorrow nay of joy there must comeat lastthe end even of punishment or of consequence she looked up and round the evening is so peacefullook at the glories of the westit is so peaceful that one cannot believe in storm and hail and frost it seems to mean for us reliefand for himforgiveness everything was indeed stillthere was no sound even of their own footsteps as they walked across the springy turf of the park and the house when they came within view of it was bathed in the colours of the west every window flaming with the joy of life instead of the despair of death yet within was a dying man death is coming said constance with pardon upon his wings the news that there was a changeword meaning muchat the hall had reached the village the pride of the people because no other village in england entertained a recluse who lived by himself in a great house and allowed everything to fall into decay was to be taken from them no more would strangers flock over on sunday mornings from the nearest town and the villages round to look over the wall at the tall stalwart figure pacing his terrace in all weathers with the regularity of a pendulum in the village house of call the men assembled early to hear and tell and whisper what they had heard then the old story was revivedthe story which had almost gone out of mens memorieshow the poor gentleman then young still under thirty with a fine high temper of his ownit was odd how the fine high temper had got itself rememberedlost in a single day his wife and his brotherinlaw and never held up his head again nor went out of the house nor took notice of man woman or child nor took a gun in his hand nor called his dogs nor rode to hounds nor went to church these reminiscences had been told a thousand times in the dingy little room of the village publichouse they reeked like the room of beer and tobacco and wet garments for seventy years they had been told in the same words they had been so far that most interesting form of imaginative workthe story without an end now the end had arrived and there would be no more to tell the story was finished then the door opened and the cidevant scarer of birds appeared he limped inside he closed the door carefully he looked around the room he supported himself bravely with his two sticks and he began to speak were all friends here all friends theres nobody here as will carry things to that young man no take half a pint thomas by your leave presently i shall lend a hand tomorrow or next day to digging a grave we must all come to it why not therefore he looked important and evidently had something more to say if he could find a way to say it were all thinking of the same thing he began its the old squire who will soon be lyin dead how he never went out of the place for seventy long yearsas long as i can remember why because there was a man murdered and a woman died who was the man murdered the squires brotherinlaw who murdered him john dunning they said john dunning he was tried and he got off and he went away who murdered that man john dunning didnt why because john dunning didnt go to the wood for two hours afterwards who murdered that man i say at this point he accepted the hospitality of the proffered glass of beer i know who done it i always have known nobody knows but me ive known for all these years and ive never told for why he would ha killed me too for certain sure he would ha killed me who was it then ill tell you it was the man that lies adyin over there it was the squire himselfthats who it was no one else was in the wood all the morning but the squire and the other gentleman i say the squire done it the squire and nobody else the squire done it the squire done it the men looked at each other in amazement then the blacksmith rose and he said solemnly thomas youre close on eighty years of age youve gone silly in your old age you and your squire i remember what my father said the squire he left mr holme at the wood and turned back that was the evidence at the inquest and the trial you and your squire go home thomas and go to bed and get your memory back again thomas looked round the room again the faces of all were hard and unsympathetic he turned and hobbled out the days that followed were few and evil for he could speak about nothing else and no one heeded his garrulous utterances assuredly if there had been a lunatic asylum in the village he would have been enclosed there a fatal example of the mischief of withholding evidence now had this boy made it clear at the inquest that the two gentlemen were together in the wood for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour one knows not what might have followed thomas did not go home he turned his steps in the direction of the hall and he hobbled along with a purpose in his face his revelation had been received with scorn and derision perhaps in another place it would be received with more respect the housekeeper met leonard and constance at the open door it had stood open all day as if for the admission of the guest whose wings were hovering very near hes in the library said the woman with the corner of her apron brushing away the tears with which womenservants always meet the approach of azrael i wanted him to go upstairs and to bed but he takes no notice hes been in the library nearly all day did he go out this morning after breakfast he took his breakfast as usual and he went out afterwards as usual walking as upright as a post and looking as strong and as hard as ever after a bit he stopped and shook all over then he turned round and went indoors he went into the library and he sat down before the fire did he speak never a word i offered him a glass of wine but he only shook his head at one oclock i took him his dinner but he could eat nothing presently he drank a glass of wine at four oclock i took him his tea but he wouldnt touch it only he drank another glass of wine thats all hes had since the morning and now he is sitting doubled up with his face working terrible they opened the door of the library softly and went in he was not sitting doubled up he was lying back in his ragged old leather chair extendedhis long legs stretched out his hands on the arms of the chair his broad shoulders and his great head lying backsplendid even in decay like autumn opulent his eyes were open staring straight upwards to the ceiling his face was as the housekeeper put it working it spoke of some internal struggle what was it that he was fighting in his weary brain leonard the girl whispered it is not despair in his face it is not defiance look it is doubt there is something he cannot understand he hears whispers oh i think i hear them too i know what they are and whose they are she drew down her veil to hide her tears the sun had now gone down the shadows of the twilight lay about the corners of the big room the rows of books looked ghostly the western light began to fall and the colours began to fade a fire burned in the grate as it always burned all the year round the flames began to throw flickering lights and shadows about the room they lit up the face of the old man and his figure seemed to stand out clear and apart as if there were nothing in the room but himself nay as if there were no room no furniture no house nothing but that one sole figure in the presencethe unspeakable presenceof the judge his face was changing the housekeeper spoke the truth the defiance and the stubbornness were going out of it what was come to take their place as yet nothing but doubt and pain and trouble as for the whispers there was no proof that there were any whispers save from the assurance of the girl who heard them with the ear of faith leonard stepped forward and bent over him sir he said solemnly you know me i am your greatgrandsonthe grandson of your eldest son who killed himself because he discovered a secretyour secret and he could no longer endure it and live i am his grandson the words were plain even brutal leonard intended that there should be no mistake about them but plain as they were they produced no effect there was not even a gleam in the old mans eye to show that he heard you are ninetyfive leonard went on it is time to speak i have brought with me one who will recall a dayif you have ever forgotten itof tragic memories the day when you lost at once your wife and your brotherinlaw you have never forgotten that day have you the old man made no reply but he closed his eyes perhaps as a sign that he refused to listen sir i have a message for you it is from the man whom you saved from the gallowsthe innocent man whom you saved at a trial for murder he sent a message from his deathbedwords of gratitude and of prayer the good deed that you did has grown and borne fruit a hundredfoldyour good deed let the grateful words of that man be some comfort to you again the old man made no sign at this point an unexpected interruption took place for the door was opened and a man a villager came clumping in noisily seventy years agone he was the boy who had done the birdscaring they told mehe addressed leonard but he looked at the figure in the chairthat you were here and they said that he was going at last so i came i minded what you said did never a one suspect thats what you said i dont care for him now he nodded valiantly at the figure of his old master he wont hurt no oneno more he clumped across the room being rheumatic and planted himself before the chair bringing his stick down with a bump on the floor did never a man suspect he looked round and held up his finger he suspected and he knew old manhe addressed himself directly to the silent figurewho done that job you done it nobody else done it nobody else couldnt ha done it who done it you done it there was nobody else in the wood but you before john dunning came along leonard took him by the arm and led him unresisting out of the library but he went on repeating his story as if he could not say it often enough to satisfy his conscience i always meant to tell him some day before i died now i have told him ive told all the people tooall of them why should i go on putting of it away and hiding of it he ought to ha swung long ago he ought and he shall too he shall yet though he be ninety years and more who done it who done it who done it he done it he done it he done it i say they heard his voice as leonard led him to the door they heard his voice when leonard shut the door upon him repeating his refrain in a senile singsong what matter said leonard let him sing his burden all over the village the time has gone by when such as he can hurt but the old man still made as if he had heard nothing he remained perfectly impassible not even the sphinx could be more obstinately fixed on betraying no emotion presently he stirredperhaps because he was moved he pulled himself up with difficulty he sat supported by the arms of the chair his body bending under the weight of the massive head and broad shoulders too heavy at last even for that gigantic frame his head was bent slightly forward his eyes deep set were now fixed upon the red coals of the fire which burned all the year round to warm him his face was drawn by hard lines which stood out like ropes in the firelight his abundant white hair lay upon his shoulders and his long white beard fell round him to the waist and thus he had been for seventy years while his early manhood passed slowly into the prime of life while the first decay touched his locks with tiny streaks of grey while early age fell upon him while his face grew furrowed while his eyes sank and his cheekbones stood out while his teeth fell out and his long face was shortened and his ancient comeliness vanished so he had remained while his neglected children grew up while consequences fell unheeded and unknown upon his house ignorant of what went on in the outer world though a new world grew up around him with new thoughts new ideals new standards and a new civilisation the great revolution which we call the nineteenth century went on around him and he knew nothing he lived as he was born in the eighteenth century which was prolonged to the days of king george the fourth if he thought at all in his long life his thoughts were as the thoughts of the time in which he was born did he think at all of what could he think when day followed day and one was like another and there was no change when spring succeeded winter unheeded and cold and heat were alike to one who felt neither and there was no book or newspaper or voice of friend to bring food for the mind or to break the monotony of the days the anchorite of the church could pray his only occupations were prayer and his mighty wrestling with the devil since this anchorite of the country house could not pray there was left with him day and night the latter resource surely after seventy long years this occupation must have proved wearisome leonard went on speak the old man made no sign speak then speak and tell us what we already know there was still no reply you have suffered so long you have made atonement so terrible it is time to speakto speak and end it his face visibly hardened oh it is no use leonard cried in despair it is like walking into a brick wall sir you hear meyou understand what is said you cannot tell us one single thing that we do not know already he made a gesture of despair and stepped back then constance herself stepped forward she threw herself at his feet like a greek suppliant she clasped his knees and she spoke slowly and softly you must hear me i have a right to be heard look at me i am the greatgranddaughter of langley holme she raised her veil the old man screamed aloud he caught the arms of the chair and sat upright he stared at her face he trembled and shook all over insomuch that at the shaking of his large frame the floor also trembled and shook and the plates on the table and the fender rattled langley he cried seeing nothing but her facelangley you have come back at lastat last he could not understand that this was a living woman not a dead man he saw only her face and it was the face of langley himself yes she said boldly langley come back he says that you have suffered long enough he says that he has forgiven you long ago his sister has forgiven you all is forgiven langley says speakspeakin the very presence of god who knows it was your hand that murdered langley speak you struck him with the club in the forehead so that he fell dead when he was brought home dead your punishment began with the death of your wife and has gone on ever since speak the old man shook his head mechanically he tried to speak it was as if his lips refused to utter the words he sank back in the chair still gazing upon the face and trembling at last he spoke langley knowslangley knows he said speak constance commanded langley knows speak i did it said the old man constance knelt down before him and prayed aloud i did it he repeated constance took his hand and kissed it i am langleys child she said in his name you are forgiven oh the long punishment is over oh we have all forgiven you oh you have suffered so longso long at lastat lastforgive yourself then a strange thing happened it happens often with the very old that in the hour of death there falls upon the face a return of youth the old mans face became young the years fell from him but for his white hair you would have thought him young again the hard lines vanished with the crowsfeet and the creases and the furrows the soft colour of youth reappeared upon his cheek oh the goodly manthe splendid face and figure of a man he stood up without apparent difficulty he held constance by the hand but he stood up without support towering in his six feet six erect and strong forgiven he asked what is there to be forgiven forgive myself why what have i done that needs forgiveness let us walk into the wood langleylet us walk into the wood my dear i do not understand langleys child is but a baby in arms his hand dropped he would have fallen to the ground but that leonard caught him and laid him gently on the chair it is the end said constance he has confessed it was the end the recluse was dead chapter xxi the will one of the london morning papers devoted a leading article to the subject of the modern recluse the following is a passage from that excellent leader the hermit or the recluse has long disappeared from the roadside from the bridgeend from the river bank his hermitage sometimes remains as at warkworth but the ancient occupant is gone he was succeeded by the eccentric who flourished mightily in the last century and took many strange forms some lived alone each in a single room some became misers and crept out at night to pick up offal for food some lived in hollow trees some never washed and allowed nothing in the house to be washed there were no absurdities too ridiculous to be practised by the eccentric of the last century for reasons which the writer of social manners may discover the eccentric has mostly followed the recluse there are none left therefore the life of the late algernon campaigne of campaigne park bucks an eccentric of the eighteenthcentury type will afford a pleasing exception to the dull and monotonous chronicles of modern private life this worthy a country gentleman of good family and large estate was married in quite early manhood having succeeded to the property at twentyone or so his health was excellent he was a model of humanity to look at being much over six feet high and large of frame in proportion he had gone through the usual course of public school and the university not without distinction he had been called to the bar he was a magistrate and he was understood to have ambitions of a parliamentary career in a word no young man ever started with fairer prospects or with a better chance of success in whatever line he proposed to take up unfortunately a single tragic event blasted these prospects and ruined his life his brotherinlaw a gentleman of his own rank and station and his most intimate friend while on a visit at campaigne park was brutally murderedby whom it was never discovered the shock of this event brought the young wife of mr campaigne to premature labour and killed her as well on the same day this misfortune so weighed upon the unhappy man that he fell into a despondent condition from which he never rallied he entered into a voluntary retirement from the world he lived alone in his great house with no one but an old woman for a housekeeper for the whole remainder of his lifeseventy years during the whole of that time he has preserved absolute silence he has not uttered a word he has neglected his affairs when his signature was absolutely necessary his agent left the document on his table and next day found it signed he would have nothing done to the house the fine furniture and the noble paintings are reported to be ruined with damp and cold his garden and glasshouses are overgrown and destroyed he spent his mornings in all weathers walking up and down the brick terrace overlooking his ruined lawns he dined at one oclock on a beefsteak and a bottle of port he slept before the fire all the afternoon he went to bed at nine he never opened a book or a newspaper or a letter he was careless what became of his children and he refused to see his friends a more melancholy useless existence can hardly be imagined and this life he followed without the least change for seventy years when he died the day before yesterday it was on his ninetyfifth birthday more followed but these were the facts as presented to the readers with a moral to follow they buried the old man with his forefathers in sure and certain hope the words may pass perhaps for he had been punished if punishment can atone for crime constance brought him a message of forgiveness but could he forgive himself all manner of sins can be forgiven the murdered man the dishonoured woman the wronged orphan the sweated workwoman the ruined shareholder the innocent man done to death or prison by perjuryall may lift up their hands in pity and cry aloud with tears their forgiveness but will the guilty man forgive himself until he can the glorious streets of the new jerusalem will be dark the sound of the harp and the voices of praise will be but a confused noise and the new life itself will be nothing better than an intolerable prolonging of the old burden dust to dust ashes to ashes then they went away and when they were all gone the old birdscarer came hobbling to the grave and looked into it and murmured but not aloud for fear the man in the grave might arise and kill him too you done it you done it you done it the funeral party walked back to the house where for the first time for seventy years there was a table spread all were therethe ancient lady daughter of the dead man stately with her black silk and laces with the bearing of a duchess leaning on the arm of her grandnephew the two grandsons fred and christopher the wife and children of the latter mr samuel galley and mary anne his sister and constance greatgrandniece of the deceased with them came the agent a solicitor from the neighbouring town after luncheon the agent produced the will this will he said was drawn up by my greatgrandfather in the year exactly one month after the tragic event which so weighed upon his clients mind was he in his right mind asked sam turning very red i ask the question without prejudice sir he was always in his right mind he would not speak but on occasion he would write he was never down to the very end in any sense out of his mind i have letters and instructions from him year after year for seventy yearsmy firm has acted for this family for a hundred yearswhich will establish his complete sanity should that be questioned well the will said sam lets get to the will i will read the will for the will of a rich man it was comparatively short there was in it however a clause which caused leonard to glance curiously and inquiringly at constance i dont understand said sam theres something left to me no sirto your grandmother to you nothing its the same thing what is hers is mine no said the lady concerned stiffly you will find my grandson that you are mistaken well said sam disconcerted anyhow youve got a share what i want to know is the meaning of that clause about somebodys heirs what have they got to do with it perhaps said leonard you might kindly explain the will certainly the testator had at the time of making his will a certain amount of personal property to bequeath the property consisted partly of invested moneys chiefly his mothers fortune as he was an only child the whole of this personal property came to him partly it consisted of a townhouse in berkeley square also part of his mothers property not entailed and his pictures his library and his furniture carriages horses etc the latter part he has bequeathed to the heir of the campaigne estateto you mr leonard the former part consisting of the invested moneys he bequeathes to his three children in equal portions as the second child was drowned and left no heirs this money will be divided equally between the elder son and the daughteryou mrs galley and as the elder son is dead his heirs will receive the money shared between them with all the accumulations cried sam ah with a long long breath of relief no not the accumulations they are especially provided for the testator expressly states that only the amount actually standing in his name at that date shall be divided as i have set forth and he continues seeing that i may live some years yet very much against my wish and that i shall not spend on myself or on my house or in any way being now and henceforth dead to the world and waiting in silence for my removal whenever it may come there will be interest on this money which i desire shall be invested year after year by my solicitors and on my death i desire that the difference between the money then and the money now whatever it may be shall be given in equal shares to the heirs of langley holme my late brotherinlaw who was foully murdered near my house for a reason which he alone knows this is very wonderful said frederick all the accumulationsseventy years of compound interest an immense fortuneto be given to strangers or very distant cousins are we going to allow this will to stand without a protest you are the chief leonard what do you say the question is whether the testator was sane at the time of making his will said leonard he was sane then i believe said the solicitor and he was certainly sane at the end i have here a note written by him three years ago all our communication was by writing i ventured to ask him whether he desired to make any change in his testamentary disposition here is his reply he took a note out of his pocketbook it was quite short nothing has happened to cause any alteration in my will the reasons which made me set apart all moneys saved and accumulated for the heirs of langley holme still exist i do not know who the heirs area c is that the letter of a person of unsound mind i for one shall dispute the will said sam standing up and thrusting his hands in his pockets pardon me sir you have no locus standi i dont care it is an iniquitous will as you please siras you please will you tell us the amount of the money which will come to us said fred there was a sum of invested in the three per cents the half of that sum or will be divided among you three gentlemen as the grandson and the sons of mr campaignes eldest son the other half will be given to you mrs galley humph said sam but when i get the will set aside as for the accumulations they amount at the present moment to a very large sum indeed an immense summore than a million of money the late langley holme left one daughter whose only descendant is the young lady here present miss constance ambry constance rose we will talk about this business at another time she said leonard followed her out of the damp and gravelike house into the ruined garden and they sat down together in silence fifteen thousand pounds said fred it is no more at present rates of interest than a year but its a pleasant little nestegg to take out to australiawith the dunnings to place if fifteen thousand pounds said christopher to his son its a nice little addition but my boy the bureau is worth ten times as much they walked away they rambled about the house of ruin and decay presently they walked to the station the dream of huge wealth was shattered but still there was a solatium mrs galley turned to the lawyer sir she said when will that money be my very own immediately it has only to be transferred if you wish for an advance i wish for protection against my grandson quite right it was mary anne who had not hitherto said a word he claims everything as his own madame said the lawyer we have acted father and son for four generations for your family let me assure you that if you allow us your confidence you shall be amply protected sam looked from one to the other then he put on his hat and walked away gloomily my dear said mrs galley laying her hand on her granddaughters shoulder i am again a gentlewoman we will live you and i in a country house with a garden and flowers and servants and a pony carriage no my dear i will never go back to the commercial road he is welcome to everything there let us stay here in the village and among the people where i was bornyou and i together oh my dearmy dear it is happiness too great the hand of the lord is lifted his wrath is stayed leonard and constance returned to town together in the carriage the girl sat beside leonard in silence her hands folded her eyes dropped you are a great heiress constance he said i learn that the accumulations now amount to an immense sum what will you do with all this money i do not know i shall pretend to myself that i havent got any perhaps in time someone may help me to use it i have enough already i do not want to buy anything that costs large sums i do not want to dress more expensively i have as good society as i can desire and i cannot i believe eat any more than i have always done yet how happy would some people be at such a windfall the difficulty of doing something with it will be very terrible let us never talk about it besides that cousin of yours is going to set the will aside if he can she relapsed into silence it was not of her newlyacquired fortune that she was thinking they drove from the station to the mansions they mounted the stairs to the firstfloor let me come in with you leonard she said i want to say something it had better be said today and at once else it will become impossible he observed that she was embarrassed in her manner that she spoke with some constraint and that she was blushing a presentiment seized him presentiment is as certain as coincidence he too changed colour but he waited they remained standing face to face tell me first she said is the possession of your mind wholly gone are you quite free from the dreadful thing happily yes i am quite free my mind is completely clear again there is plenty to think aboutone is not likely to forget the last few weeksbut i can think as i please my will is my own once more i also am quite free the first thing that i want to say is this what are we to do with our knowledge you are the person to decide if you wish it shall be proclaimed abroad i cannot possibly wish that or if you wish a history of the case shall be written out and shown to every member of the family and placed with the other documents of our people so that those who follow shall be able to read and understand the history no i want the story absolutely closed so that it can never again be reopened in a few years the memory of the event itself will have vanished from the village your cousins of the commercial road will certainly not keep the story alive besides they know nothing there remains only the book of extracts let us first burn the book of extracts leonard produced the volume constance tore out the leaves one by one rolled them up laid them neatly in the grate put the cover on the top and set light to the whole in one minute the dreadful story was destroyed there was no more any evidence except in the piles of old newspapers which are slowly mouldering in the vaults of the british museum never again she said never again will we speak of it nobody shall know what we discovered it is our secretyours and mine whose secret should it be but yours and mine if it were a burden to you i would it were all mine it is no burden henceforth why should that be a burden which has been forgiven it is our secret too that the suffering was laid upon us so that we might be led to the discovery of the truth were we led you would make me believe constanceeven mein supernatural guidance but it seems natural somehow that you should believe that we were as you say led you who believe nothing but what you see you will not understand oh it is so plain to meso very plain you have been forcedcompelled against your willto investigate the case who compelled you i know not but since the same force made me follow you i think it was that murdered man himself confess that you were forced you said so yourself it is true that i have been absorbed in the case who sent your cousin from the east end who fired your imagination with halftold tales of trouble who sent you the book how do you explain the absorbing interest of a case so old so long forgotten is it not natural no it is not natural that a man of your willpower should become the slave of a research so hopelessas it seemed who was it after we had mastered every detail and tried every theory and examined every scrap of evidence and after you had examined the ground and talked to the surviving witnessi say after the way had been preparedwho was it sent the two voices from the gravethe one which made it quite certain that those two were the only persons in the wood and the other which showed that they were quarrelling and that one was ungoverned in his wrath can you explain that leonard you believe that we were led by unseen hands step by step towards the discovery for the purpose of those who led there were two purposes one for the consolation of that old man and the other for yourself how for myself look back only a month are you the same or are you changed i told you then that you were outside all other men because you had everythingwealth sufficient pride of ancestry intellectual success and no contact with the lower world the vulgar and the common or the criminal or the disreputable world you remember yesare you changed if to possess all these undesirable things can change one i am changed if to lose the things which separate you from the world and to receive the things which bring you nearer to the world do change a man then you are changed you will change more and more because more and more you will feel that you belong to the world of men and womennot of caste and books when all is gone there still remains yourselfalone before the world he made no reply where is now your pride of birth it is gone where is your contempt for things common and unclean you have had the vision of st peter if there are things common and unclean they belong to you as well as to the meaner sortfor to that kind you also belong something of this i have understood and there was the other purpose while with blow after blow it is destroyed you were led on and on with this mystery voices from the dead were brought to you till at last the whole mystery was made plain and stood out confessedand with it i was moved and compelled to follow you till at the end i was taken to see the dying man and to deliver to him the forgiveness of the man he slew oh leonard believe me if it is true that the soul survives the death of the body if it is possible for the soul still to see what goes on among the living then have you and i been directed and led again he made no reply but he was moved beyond the power of speech forgiveness came long since oh i am sure of thatlong since that which followedwas it consequence or punishmentlasted for seventy years oh what a life oh what a long long agony always to dwell on one moment day after day night after night with never a change and no end to whirl the heavy branch upon the head of the brother to see him fall back dead to know that he was a murderer leonard leonard think of it i do think of it constance but you must not go on thinking of it no nothis is the last time forgiveness yeshe would forgive gods sweet souls cannot but forgive but justice must prevail with the condemnation of selfreproach till forgiveness overcomesuntil in some mysterious way the sinner can forgive himself she sat down and buried her face in her hands you say that we have been ledperhaps i neither deny nor accept but whatever has been done for that old man whom we buried this morning whatever has been done for the endowment of myself with cousins and peoplewell of the more common sortone thing more it has accomplished between you and me constance there flows a stream of blood she lifted her head she rose from the chair she stepped closer to him she stood before him face to face her hands clasped her face pale the tears yet lying on her cheek her eyes soft and full of a strange tender light you asked me three or four weeks ago she said to marry you i refused i told you that i did not know the meaning of love or the necessity for love i now understand that it means above all the perfect sympathy and the necessity for sympathy i now understand besides that you did not then know any more than i myself the necessity of sympathy you were a lonely man content to be lonely and sufficient for yourself you were a proud manproud through and through belonging to a caste separated from the people by a long line of ancestry and a record full of honour you had no occasion to earn your daily bread you were already distinguished there was no man of your age in the whole country more fortunate than you or more selfcentred i was able to esteem youbut you could not move my heart are you following me leonard i am trying to follow you many things have happened to you since then you have joined the vast company of those who suffer from the sins of their own people you have known shame and humiliation and between us flows that stream even for a strong and resolute woman who is not afraid of misunderstanding and does not obey conventions there are some things very hard to say there is one thing and only one thing leonard that can dry that stream his face changed he understood what she meant is there anything think constance langley holme was your ancestor he was done to death by mine yes there is one way oh leonard in this time of trouble and anxiety i have watched you day by day i have found the man beneath the scholar if i had accepted your offer three weeks ago it would have been out of respect for the scholar but a woman can only love a mannot a scholar believe me nor a student nor a poet nor an artist nor anything except a man constance it is impossible you are his daughter it is fortunate that i am as you say the daughter of the man who was killed he suffered less than the other the suffering was but a pang but the othersoh it was a lifelong agony if i marry the son of the man who did the wrong it is because the message i carried to the dying man was a sign that all was forgiven even to the third and fourth generation tell me constance is this pity or oh leonard i know not what flowers there are which grow out of pity and sympathy but she said no more because there was no need the end typographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber when
