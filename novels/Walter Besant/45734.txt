xxii how lord chudleigh received his freedom the chaplain of the fleet part i within the rules chapter i how kitty lost her father and her friends my life has been above any merits of my own so blessed by providence that methinks its history should be begun with the ringing of bells the singing of psalms the sound of cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of music for surely the contemplation of a happy course should even towards its close be accompanied by a heart full of cheerful piety and gratitude and though as often happens to us in the lord's wisdom ill fortune disappointment troubles of the flesh and pain of disease may perhaps afflict me in these latter years of fleeting life they ought not to lessen the glad song of praise for blessings formerly vouchsafed and still dwelling in my memory of love of joy and of happiness truly the earth is a delightful place a fair garden which yields pleasant fruit and if it may be so said with becoming reverence there are yet outside the gates of eden places here and there which for beauty and delight to those who thither win their way are comparable with paradise itself in such a place it has been my happy lot to dwell yet just as the newborn babe begins his earthly course with a wail ah joyful cry for ear of mother so must this book begin with tears and weeping the weeping is that of an orphan over her dead father the tears are those which fall upon a coffin beside an open grave they are the tears of men and women come to pay this reverence at the burial of a man who was their best friend and their most faithful servant all the morning the funeral knell has been tolling the people listen now to the solemn words of a service which seem spoken by the dead man himself to those who mourn they admonish and warn but they bid them be of good cheer lift up hearts and trust in the lord when we are in great grief and sorrow outward things seem to affect us more than in ordinary times when the heart is in repose and the mind perhaps slower of apprehension the day for instance was late in may the blackbird thrush and chaffinch were singing in the wood beside the church a lark was carolling in the sky a cuckoo was calling from the coppice the hedges were green and the trees were bright with their first fresh foliage the white may blossom the yellow laburnum and the laylock were at their best and the wild roses were just beginning to the country girl who had never yet left her native village this joy of the spring was so natural that it did not jar upon the grief of her soul when the funeral was over and the grave filled in and the people all dispersed she stood for a few moments alone and then walked away across the long grass of the churchyard stepping lightly over the graves of the villagers opened the little wicket gate which led to the vicarage garden passed in and sought a sheltered place where beneath the shade of bushes she sat upon a bench and folded her hands looked before her and fell a thinking she was between sixteen and seventeen but tall of her age and looked older she wore a new black frock she had thrown her straw hat with black ribbons upon the bench beside her as for her face i suppose it was pretty alas i am a hypocrite because i know that it was pretty as yet she did not know it and had never thought about her face her eyes were brown she has ever been thankful to have had brown eyes her features were regular and her face rather long her hair was abundant and soft it was like the hair of most english maidens of a dark brown or chestnut it is now white her arms were shapely and her fingers thin and delicate they were the fingers of a pleydell as for her complexion it was as good as can be expected in a girl whose blood is pure who has as yet known no late hours who has been taught to use plenty of cold water and no washes or messes who has run about without thinking of freckles and has lived in the open air on homely food in other words as fine a show of red and white was in the cheeks of that child as ever sir joshua reynolds tried to copy upon canvas she was thinking many things first of her father and his death of the funeral and the grief shown by people whom she had thought to be hard of heart insensible to his admonitions and untouched by his prayers yet they stood about the grave and wept rude women and rough men would they ever again find a minister so benevolent so pious and so active in all good work she thought of the house and how dark and lonely it was deserted by its former owner she thought of what she should do in the time before her and how she would be received in her new home one thing comforted her she looked older than she was and was tall and strong she could be helpful then she drew out of her pocket a letter written for her only three days before her father died she knew it quite by heart but yet she read it again slowly as if there might still be something in it which had escaped her my beloved daughter thus it ran knowing that i am about to die and to appear before my father and merciful judge it is right that i should bestir myself to make thee comprehend the situation in which thou wilt be placed of worldly wealth i have indeed but little to give thee face thy lot with hope resignation and a cheerful heart the righteous man said one who knew hath never been found to beg his bread indeed the whole course of this world is so ordered by divine wisdom that he who chooseth the narrow path chooseth also the safest therefore be of good cheer imprimis when i am buried search the bedstead and in the head thereof will be found a bag containing the sum of one hundred guineas in gold pieces i have saved this money during my twenty years of incumbency i trust that it will not be laid to my charge that i did not give this also to the poor but i thought of my daughter first secondly farmer goodpenny is indebted to me in the sum of twenty two pounds four shillings and eightpence for which i have his note i charge thee that he be not asked to pay interest and since it may be that he hath not the money let it wait his good time he is an honest man who fears god thirdly there is money some twelve pounds or more lying in my desk for present use fourthly there are several small sums due to me money put out and lent but not at usury such as five shillings from the widow coxon and other amounts the which i will have thee forgive and remit entirely for these my debtors are poor people the horse is old but he will fetch five pounds and the cow will sell for two as for the books they may be sent to maidstone where they may be sold but i doubt they will not bring more than ten guineas or thereabouts seeing that the call for works of divinity is small even among my brethren of the cloth and when you go to london forget not to ask of mr longman publisher of st paul's churchyard an account of my 'sermons' published by him last year my essay on 'philo judaeus' issued four years ago and my 'reflections on the christian state' which he hath by him in manuscript he will perhaps be able to return a larger sum of money than i was led by him at first to expect my will and plain injunctions are as follows when everything has been paid that is owing and there are none who can hereafter say that he had a claim upon me which was unsatisfied get together thy wearing apparel and effects and under some proper protection as soon as such can be found go to london and there seek out thy uncle and mother's brother the reverend gregory shovel doctor of divinity of whom i have spoken to thee of old i take shame to myself that i have not sent him for many years letters of brotherly friendship nor do i rightly remember where he is to be found but i know that he lives because once a year there comes to me a keg or anker of rum which i know must be from him and which i have drunk with my parishioners in a spirit of gratitude perhaps it would have been more consistent in a brother clergyman to have sent one of the latest books of our scholars but he means well and the rum is i confess of the best and a generous drink in moderation he was once curate and lecturer of st martin's in the fields but i would have thee go first to the coffee house in st paul's churchyard where they know all the london clergy and ask for his present lodging this found go to him tell him that i am dead give him thy money entrust thyself to him and be guided by him as thou hast been by me and now my daughter if a father's prayers avail thee be assured that i die like jacob the patriarch blessing thee and commanding thee for my blessing i pray that the lord may have thee in his keeping and give thee what is good for the eternal life for my commandment be good for herein is summed up the whole of the commandments and remember my child the christian who lives in fear of death is foolish even as he is foolish who will not lay hold of the promise and so lives in terror of the judgment for now i know yea i know that the lord loveth best that man who all the days of his life walks in faith and dies in hope your loving father lawrence pleydell had ever a girl so sweet a message from the dead to keep and ponder over to comfort and console her she knew every word of it already but the tears came afresh to her eyes in thinking of the dear hand which wrote those words quiet now its labours done in the cold grave her father's last will and testament gave her more than riches it gave her strength and consolation the example of his life which was so christian and so good might be forgotten because the girl was too young to understand it and too ignorant to compare but this letter of true faith and religion would never be forgotten the reverend lawrence pleydell master of arts and sometime fellow of the ancient and learned college or house of christ cambridge was which is a thing too rare in these days a country clergyman who was also a scholar a divine a man of pious thought and a gentleman by descent though only of a younger branch it is too often found that if a country clergyman be a gentleman he continues the habits of his class such as fox hunting card playing and wine drinking concerning which although the bishops seem not yet of one mind upon the matter i for my humble part remembering what kind of man was my good father venture to think are pursuits unworthy of one who holds a cure of souls and when a clergyman is a scholar he is too often devoted entirely to the consideration of his greek and latin authors whereby his power over the hearts of the people is in a measure lost or if he is a divine he is too often out of the fulness of his mind constrained to preach the subtleties and hidden things of theology which cannot be understood of the common people so that it is as if he were speaking in an unknown tongue and sometimes the parson of the parish is but a rude and coarse person of vulgar birth who will smoke tobacco with the farmers yea even with the labourers drink with them and not be ashamed to be seen in beer houses tap rooms or even at such unseemly diversions as bull baiting badger drawing and cock fighting it were to be wished that the church were purged of all such the parish contained besides farmers but one family of gentlefolk that of sir robert levett knight who with his wife and two children lived at the hall and had an estate worth two thousand a year at least when the vicar's wife died she was somewhat his inferior in point of family but had a brother in the church and his child was left without a mother nothing would do for lady levett than that the little maid should be taken into the hall and brought up having governesses and teaching with her own daughter nancy who was of about the same age but a little younger so the two girls were playfellows and scholars together being taught those things which it befits a lady to learn although one of them would be a poor lady indeed there was one son will who was at first at eton with his cousin and sir robert's ward harry temple the young squire of wootton hampstead it was a fearful joy when they came home for the holidays for although they kept the house in activity and bustle making disorder and noise where there was generally quiet and order yet after the manner of boys who rejoice to show and feel their strength they would play rough tricks upon the two girls upset and destroy their little sports and make them understand what feeble things are young maidens compared with boys now just as the two girls were different for one grew up tall and disposed to be serious which was kitty pleydell and the other was small and saucy always with a laugh and a kiss which was nancy levett so the boys became different for one which was will levett a rosy cheeked lad with a low forehead and a square chin grew to dislike learning of all kinds and was never happy except when he was in the stables with the horses or training the dogs or fox hunting or shooting or fishing or in some way compassing the death of wild creatures sports to which his father was only moderately addicted but the other harry temple was more studiously disposed always came home with some fresh mark of his master's approbation and read every book he could find there came a change in their behaviour to the girls as they grew older will ceased to set a dog to bark at them and to crack a whip to frighten them or ride unbroken colts in order to make them cry out for fear and harry ceased to tease and torment them with little tricks and devices of mischief at which they were half pleased and half humiliated when the boys left school they were sent to pembroke college cambridge a college in which many generations of levetts had been educated after two terms will came home looking cheerful though somewhat abashed he had been rusticated sine die as the phrase runs which means that he was not to go back again until he had made such ample submission and apology with promises of future amendment as would satisfy the authorities as to the safety of allowing him back it was not known rightly what he had done there was a story in which a retriever a horse a punch bowl a badger a bargee a pump and a water trough were curiously mixed up and his rustication had somehow to do with the introduction of a proctor whom one understands to be a learned and reverend magistrate and a bull dog into this inconsistent and discordant company sir robert looked grave when he received his son my lady wept and the girls were ashamed but all speedily recovered their good spirits and the whole stable rejoiced exceedingly to see will back among them even the foxes and their cubs sir robert said which had of late waxed fat and lazy manifested a lively pleasure and hastened to get thin so as to afford the greatest sport possible the trout practised all their tricks in readiness for one who respected a fish of subtlety the pheasants and young partridges made haste to grow strong on the wing the snipe and small birds remembered why nature had taught them to use a devious and uncertain flight the rabbits left off running straight the otters remembered the uncertainty of life and the glory of a gallant fight the ferrets laughed thinking of the merry days they were going to have the hares who never take any solid interest in being hunted ran away to the neighbouring estates and the badgers who were going to be drawn in their holes turned sulky this was what sir robert told the girls who laughed but believed that it was all true as for cambridge there was no more thought of that will had had enough of lectures chapels and dons henceforth he said he should please himself man said sir robert who is ever disappointed must continually be resigned what if will hath refused to get learning he will not therefore gamble away the estate nor disgrace the name of levett holdfast is a good dog it is the fortune of this house that if once in a while its head prove a fool as regards books he still sticks to his own will promised to stick fast to his own and though he gave himself up henceforth altogether to those pursuits which make a man coarse and deaden his sensibility whereby he loses the best part of his life he promised in his father's opinion to prove a capable manager and just landlord jealous of his own rights and careful of those of others will thus remaining at home the girls saw him every day and though they had little talk with him because it could not be expected that they should care to hear how the dogs behaved and how many rats had been killed that morning yet he was in his rough way thoughtful of them and would bring them such trifles as pretty eggs stuffed kingfishers dressed moleskins and so forth which he got in his walks abroad in the evening he would make his artificial flies twist his lines mend his landing nets polish his guns being always full of business and kindly taking no notice while nancy or kitty read aloud nor seeming to care what they read whether it was the poetry of pope or some dear delightful romance or the spectator or the plays of shakespeare all was one to him he seemed in those days a good natured young man who went his own way and troubled himself not one whit about other people women were inferior creatures of course they could not shoot hunt fish ride to hounds they had no strength they did not like to see things killed they did not love sport they did not drink wine they did not take beer for breakfast they did not smoke tobacco they loved tea chocolate coffee and such vanities they loved to dress fine and stand up making bows to men which they called dancing they loved to read a lot of nonsense in rhymes or to cry over the sorrows of people who never lived women however had their uses they kept things in order looked after the dinner and took care of the babies will did not say all these things at once but they were collected together and written down by the girls who kept a book between them where they entered all the things they heard which struck their fancy nancy even went so far as to try to make up a story about the proctor and the pump but never dared show it except to her father who pinched her ear and laughed they called the page about the ways of women will's wisdom and continually added to it without his knowledge because will like all men who love the sports of the field and not the wisdom of the printed page became quickly angry if he were laughed at the girls always pictured esau for instance as a grave man with a square chin who talked a good deal about his own hunting took no interest in the occupations of the women and could never see a joke two years or so after will's rustication harry came of age and left cambridge without taking a degree there were bonfires and oxen roasted whole and barrels of beer upon the green when he took possession of his own estate and went to live in his own house which was three miles and a half from the hall he came from cambridge having no small reputation for learning and wit being apt at the making of verses in english latin and italian he was moreover skilled in mathematical science and especially in astronomy he had read history and understood the course of politics i think that from the beginning he aspired to be considered one of those who by birth and attainments are looked upon as the leaders of the world he would be a scholar as well as a gentleman he would be a poet perhaps to be ranked with pope or dryden he would be a man of fashion and he would sit in ladies' salons while other men sat over bottles of port and talked gallantry as for his appearance he was tall and slight in figure his face was long and rather thin his eyes were grave his manner was reserved to the girls he was always courteous asking their opinion setting them right when they were wrong lending them books and directing them what to read to kitty he was a man to be respected but never she may truly say did she allow her thoughts to dwell on the possibility of love perhaps because love is between opposites so that the grave may love the gay perhaps because she knew very early that lady levett earnestly desired one thing that harry might fall in love with nancy and perhaps because to nancy herself little merry nancy whose heart was full of sunshine as her eyes were full of sunlight and her lips never moved but to say and sing something saucy or to laugh and smile to nancy i say this man was an apollo and she wondered that all women not to speak of men whose stupidity in the matter of reverence for each other is well known did not fall down before him and do him open worship a few months after harry temple came of age the vicar was taken ill with a putrid fever caught while administering the last rites of the church to a dying woman and was carried off in a fortnight this disaster not only robbed poor kitty of the best of fathers but also of the kindest patron and the most loving friend for it took her away from the hall and drove her out as will be presently seen to meet dangers as she had never imagined among a people whose wickedness after many years and even to this day makes her wonder at the longsuffering of the lord chapter ii how kitty made engagements the day after the funeral sir robert levett himself walked to the vicarage in the afternoon and found the girl still in the garden on her favourite seat as soon as she looked into his kind face she burst into fresh tears cry on pretty he said sitting beside her and with a tear in his own eye cry on to cry is natural thou hast lost the best and most christian father that ever girl had therefore cry on till thou art tired let the tears fall don't mind me out handkerchief so good a scholar shall we never see again cry on if thou hast only just begun should it bring thee comfort nor ever shall we hear so good a preacher when thou hast finished let me have my say but do not hurry even at the very saddest when tears flow as unceasingly as the fountains in the land of canaan the sight of an elderly gentleman sitting on a bench beneath a mulberry tree his hat beside him his wig in his hands for coolness his stick between his legs and his face composed to a decent position waiting till one had finished would be enough to make any girl stop crying kitty felt immediately inclined to laugh dried her eyes restrained her sobs and pulled out her father's will which she gave to sir robert to read he read it through twice slowly and then he hummed and coughed before he spoke a good man kitty child see that thou forget not his admonitions i would he were here still to admonish us all sinners that we were to heed his voice no better and now he is gone he is gone yet he was a younger man than i by ten years and more and i remain here he put on his wig and rose as for this money child let us lose no time in making that safe lest some thief should rob thee of it a hundred guineas and twenty more with farmer goodpenny and this money waiting at the publishersa verily thou art an heiress indeed in the bedroom at the head of the great bed they found beneath the mattress a long narrow box secretly let into the panel close to the great cross beam i say secretly but it was a secret known to all the world carpenters always made those secret hiding places in beds so that had there been a robber in the house he would have begun by searching in that place sir robert knew where to find the spring and quickly opened the box within it lay two canvas bags tied up could bags so little hold so great a sum sir robert tossed them into his pockets as carelessly as if they were bags of cherries now little maid said he sitting on the bed that money is safe and be sure that i shall call on farmer goodpenny to morrow let me know what is to be done about thy father's wish that thou shouldst go to london it is his injunction sir said kitty gravely i must obey his will yet thy father child did not know london and to send a young girl like thyself with a bag of guineas about thy neck to ask in a coffee house for the address of a clergyman is methinks a wild goose sort of business as for dr shovel i have heard the name to be sure it cannot be the same man he stopped as if he would not tell me what it was he had heard it is my father's command she repeated unless nothing better should be found now london is a dangerous place full of pitfalls and traps especially for the young and innocent we are loth to lose thee kitty we are afraid to let thee go nothing will do for lady levett but that thou remain with us and nancy this was a generous offer indeed kitty's eyes filled with tears again and while she stood trying to find words of gratitude and to decline the offer so as not to appear churlish madam herself came running up the stairs in her garden hat and plain pinner and fell to kissing and crying over the girl then she had to be told of the will and last commands to be sure she said thy father's commands must be respected and obeyed yet i know not whether it would not be well to disobey them kitty my dear stay with us and be my daughter all the same as nancy i do not ask thee to enter my service or to receive wages or to do work for me any other than a daughter may kitty shook her head again she was truly grateful there was no one so kind as her ladyship but she must go to london as her father bade her why cried sir robert the child is right let her go but if she is unhappy with her friends or if she is in any trouble let her know where to look for help there may be cousins said madam who will find thee too pretty for their own faces and would keep thee at home with the towels and dusters and napkins i would not have our kitty a cinderella though house service is no disgrace to a gentlewoman or there may be manners and customs of the house that a young girl should disapprove or there may be harsh looks instead of kind words if that is the case kitty come back to us who love thee well and will receive thee with kisses and joy then they left her in the empty house alone with deborah the house servant she was looking over her father's books and taking out one or two which she thought she might keep in memory of him as if anything were needed when she heard steps and deborah's voice inviting some one to enter it was harry temple he stood in the doorway his hat in his hand and under his arm a book i was meditating in the fields he said what i should say to kitty pleydell in consolation for her affliction the learned boethius o harry she cried do not talk to me of books what can they say to comfort any one he smiled harry's smile showed how much he pitied people not so learned as himself the greatest men he said have been comforted by books cicero for instance nay kitty i will not quote cicero i came to say that i am sorry indeed to learn that we shall lose thee for a time alas she said i must go it is my father's order i am sure he replied that you would not leave us for a lighter reason you know our hearts kitty and how we all love you i know kitty began to cry again everybody was so full of love and pity i know harry and perhaps i shall never n n never see you again and does that make this parting harder he turned very red and laid his precious book of consolation on the table why of course it does she replied wiping her eyes you shall see us again he went on earnestly you shall come back with me kitty i will give you one twelvemonth of absence you know i love you tenderly but your father's commands must be obeyed therefore for a whole year i shall not seek you out then when i come for you will you return with me never to go away again oh she cried clasping her hands how joyfully will i return the young man took her hand and raised it to his lips divine maid he cried fit to grace a coronet or to make the home of a simple gentleman an arcadia of pastoral pleasure do not mock me harry she said snatching away her hand with idle compliments but forget not to come and carry me away alas he said how shall i exist how bear this separation for twelve long months oh divine kitty thou will remain an ever present idea in my heart harry she burst out laughing in her tears think of the learned boethius so he left her in half an hour another visitor appeared this time it was will he was in his usual careless disorder his scarlet coat a good deal stained his waistcoat unbuttoned his wig awry his boots dusty his neckerchief torn his hands and cheeks browned by the sun he carried a horsewhip and was followed by half a dozen dogs who came crowding into the room after him so he said sitting down and leaning his chin upon his whipstock thou must go then what do you want with me will she asked angry that he should show so little sympathy why he replied rubbing his chin with the whipstock not much kitty nancy will come to cry then you can go away will i came to say kitty that though you do be going to go will easily dropped into country talk i shanna forget thee there thank you will as for the matter of that i love thee ah like i love old rover here thank you again will and so i've brought along a sixpence here it is and we'll break it together here he bent and broke the coin with his strong fingers my half goes into my pocket so and the other half is thine there he threw it on the table well that's done he stood up looked at me sorrowfully and heaved a great sigh i doubt i've a done wrong hadst been going to stay a' woulden a' spoke yet awhile liberty is sweet girls are skittish well we'll take a twelvemonth yet there's no hurry plenty time before us i shall have my liberty for that while mayhap i will fetch thee in the spring ay may's the best month to leave the dogs and the birds though the vermin will begin to swarm rot 'em come rover good bye wench he gave her a resounding kiss on the cheek and turned away the girl laughed she did not pick up the broken sixpence which indeed she hardly noticed her mind being full of many things presently nancy came and the two girls spent a miserable evening together in great love and friendship now how could an ignorant country girl who had never thought over these things at all guess that she had engaged herself to be married in one day in one hour even to two different men yet that was exactly what this foolish kitty had actually done footnotes a when some months later kitty went to the publisher that gentleman informed her that there was no money to receive because he had been a loser by the publication of the books chapter iii how we came to london on the coach with the purpose therefore of carrying out my father's injunctions i remained for a few days at the vicarage alone having one servant to take care of me but had it not been for an accident i might have remained at the village all my life for said lady levett it is but right child that the instructions of your father should be carried out i should like to know however who is to take charge of thee to london and how we are to get thee there a young maid cannot be sent to london on a pack horse like a bundle of goods as for sir robert he goes no more to town since he has ceased to be a member i care not for the court for my own part and am now too old for the gaieties of london nancy will enjoy them i doubt not quite soon enough and as for the boys i see not very well how they can undertake so great a charge i doubt kitty that thou must come to the hall after all you can be useful child and we will make you happy there is the still room where heaven knows what with the cowslip wine the strong waters the conserving pickling drying candying and the clove gilliflowers for palleting there is work enough for you and nancy as well as my still room maid and myself and just now sir robert calling every day for a summer sallet which wants a light hand to cool his blood i would very willingly have gone to the hall i asked nothing better and could think of nothing more happy for myself if it could so be ordered my father's wishes must certainly be obeyed but if no one at the hall could take charge of me it seemed at first as if there could be no going to london at all for our farmers and villagers were no great travellers none of them knew much of this vast round world beyond their own fields unless it were the nearest market town or perhaps maidstone or even canterbury now and again one of the rustics would go for a soldier being crossed in love but he never came home again to tell of his campaigns or one would go for a gentleman's servant being too lazy to work like his father then he would return filled with all the wickedness of london and stay corrupting the minds of the simple folk till sir robert bade him pack and be off for a pestilent fellow or one would go away to the nearest market town to be apprenticed to a handicraft being ambitious as will happen even to simple clods and aspiring to a shop but if he succeeded such an one would seldom come back to the place which gave him birth an accident happened which served my purpose there was a certain farmer on sir robert's estate whose sister had married a london tradesman of respectability and reputed honesty named samuel gambit he was a builder's foreman who afterwards became a master builder and made great sums of money by taking city contracts his son after him rose to be an alderman in the city of london whether the young woman was in ill health or whether she was prompted by affection i know not but she left her husband for a space and journeyed into the country to see her friends and people now when i heard by accident that she was about to return my heart fell because i saw that my time was come and that a proper person to take charge of me during the journey was found in mrs gambit madam sent for her she was a strong well built woman of about six or seven and twenty resolute in her bearing and sturdy of speech she was not afraid she said of any dangers of the road holding but that was through ignorance highwaymen in contempt but she could not be answerable she said and this seemed reasonable for the safety of the coach which might upset and break our necks as for the rest she would be proud to take the young lady with her to london and madam might if she wished consider the extra trouble worth something but that she left to her ladyship i know said lady levett that it is a great charge for you to conduct a young gentlewoman to town in these bad and dangerous times when not only the high roads are thronged with robbers and the streets with footpads but also the very inns swarm with villains and gentlemen are not ashamed to insult young persons of respectability in stage coaches and public places but kitty is a good girl not giddy and obedient i will admonish her that she obey you in everything upon the road and that she keep eyes ears and mouth closed all the way the good woman undertook to have her eye upon me the whole journey then lady levett made her promise that she would take me straight to st paul's coffee house st paul's churchyard there to inquire after my uncle's residence and never leave me until she had seen me deposited safely in dr shovel's hands now was i in a flutter and agitation of spirits indeed as was natural considering that i was going to leave my native place for the first time in my life and to seek out new relations nancy i cried what will be my lot what will become of me nancy said that she would tell my fortune if i would only leave off walking about and wringing my hands and be comfortable then she sat down beside me in her pretty affectionate way and threw her arms round my waist and laid her head upon my shoulder you are so tall and so pretty kitty that all the men will lose their hearts but you must listen to none of them until the right man comes oh i know what he is like he will be a great nobleman young and handsome and oh so rich he will kneel at your feet as humble as a lover ought to be and implore you to accept his title and his hand and when you are a great lady riding in your own coach as happy as the day is long you will forget oh no my dear sure i am you will never forget your loving nancy then we kissed and cried over each other in our foolish girls' way promising not only kind remembrance but even letters sometimes and we exchanged tokens of friendship i gave her a ring which had been my mother's made of solid silver with a turquoise and two pearls very rich and good and she gave me a silver gilt locket with chased back and within it a little curl of her hair brown and soft lady levett gave me nothing but her admonition i was going she said to a house where i should meet with strangers who would perhaps after the manner of strangers be quicker at seeing a fault than a grace and this particularly at the outset and very beginning when people are apt to be suspicious and to notice carefully therefore i was to be circumspect in my behaviour and above all be careful in my speech giving soft words in return for hard and answering railing if there was any railing with silence but perhaps she said there would be no railing but only kindness and love in the which case i was all the more to preserve sweet speech and sweet thoughts so as not to trouble love then she was good enough to say that i had ever been a good maid and dutiful and she doubted not that so i would continue in my new world wherefore she kissed me tenderly and prayed with tears in her eyes for my lady though quick and sharp was wondrous kind of heart that the lord would have me in his keeping i say nothing about sir robert because he was always fond of me and would almost as soon have parted from his nancy now it was a week and more since i had without knowing it received those overtures of love from harry temple and will which i took in my innocence for mere overtures of friendship and brotherly affection they thought being conceited like all young men that i had at once divined their meaning and accepted their proposals no doubt they gave themselves credit for condescension and me for gratitude therefore when the evening before i came away harry temple begged me with many protestations of regret not to inform sir robert or madam of his intentions i knew not what to say what intentions why should i not reigning star of beauty he cried laying his hand upon his heart i entreat thy patience for a twelvemonth alas such separation who can bear it 'fond thyrsis sighs through mead and vale his absent nymph lamenting ' o harry i cried what do i care about thyrsis and absent nymphs you have promised to bring me back in a year very well then i shall expect you of course you can tell sir robert whatever you please it is nothing to me what you tell sir robert or my lady she is cold as diana said harry with a prodigious sigh but i broke from him and would hear no more such nonsense sighing shepherds and cruel nymphs were for ever on harry temple's lips as for will of course he wanted to have an explanation too he followed harry and in his rustic way begged to say a word or two pray go on will i said i promised a twelvemonth he explained i'll not go back upon my word i did say a twelvemonth a twelvemonth oh yes you said the same as harry i remember i don't know what harry said but i'll swear whatever harry said i said just the clean contrary now then liberty's sweet my girl come let us say fifteen months lord when a man is twenty one he don't want to be tied by the heels all at once let's both have our run first you are but a filly yet ay a six months' puppy so to say you said a twelvemonth will i replied little thinking of what he meant how indeed could i know i shall expect you in a twelvemonth very good then a twelvemonth it must be i suppose shan't tell my father yet kitty don't you tell un neyther there's a good girl gad there will be a pretty storm with my lady when she hears it ho ho then he went off chuckling and shaking himself how could a courtly gentleman like sir robert and a gentlewoman like her ladyship have a son who was so great a clown in his manner and his talk but the sons do not always take after their parents a stable and a kennel when they take the place of a nursery and a school are apt to breed such bumpkins even out of gentle blood in the morning at five i was to start in the cart which would take us across the country to the stage coach nancy got up with me and we had a fine farewell kissing the boys were up too harry out of compliment to me dressed in a nightcap and a flowered morning gown and will out of compliment to his kennel for whose sake he always rose at daybreak he was dressed in his old scarlet coat he carried a whip in one hand and half a dozen dogs followed at his heels remember sweet kitty whispered harry with a ceremonious bow it is but for a twelvemonth only a year said will heart up my pretty they heard what each had said and they were looking at each other puzzled when i drove away what did you mean will asked harry when the cart was out of sight by saying only a year i meant what i meant he replied doggedly perhaps you know and perhaps you don't of course i know said harry the question is how do you know well replied will that is a pretty odd question to be sure how could i help knowing i think said harry red in the face that some one has been injudicious in telling any one will laughed she ought not to have told that's a fact but we will keep it secret harry don't tell her ladyship so that each thought that the other knew of his engagement with kitty little heed gave i to them and their promises it was pleasant perhaps though i soon forgot to think about it at all to remember that harry and will after a twelvemonth would come to carry me home again and that i should never leave the old place again but just then i was too sad to remember this i was going away heaven knew where amongst strangers to people who knew me not and i mounted the cart in which we were to begin our journey crying as sadly as if it had been the dreadful cart which goes to tyburn tree the best thing to cure a crying fit is a good jolting it is impossible to weep comfortably when you are shaken and rolled about in a country cart among the deep hard ruts of last winter so i presently put up my handkerchief dried my eyes and thought of nothing but of clinging to mrs gambit when the wheels sank deeper than usual the way lay along the lanes which i knew so well arched over with trees and lofty hedges then in their beautiful spring dressing it led past the churchyard where the sun was striking full upon my father's new made grave i tried to think of him but the cart jolted so terribly that i was fain to remember only how i carried his last admonitions in my bosom and the money in two bags sewn to my petticoats presently the lane led on to the high road which was not quite so rough and here we came to the roadside inn where the stage coach changed horses we waited an hour or so until at length we saw it coming slowly up the hill piled with packages and crowded with passengers but there was room for two more and we mounted to our places outside presently the machine moved slowly along again it was so heavily laden and the roads were so rough that we rolled as if every moment we were going to roll over into the ditch where we should all be killed mrs gambit loudly declared that nothing should ever again take her out of london where a body could ride in a coach without the fear of being upset and the breaking of necks on this journey however no necks were broken because the coach did not upset when the rolling was very bad mrs gambit clutched me with one hand and her right hand neighbour with the other i in my turn seized her with one hand and my right hand neighbour with the other then we both shrieked until presently finding that we did not actually go over i began to laugh my neighbour was a clergyman of grave and studious aspect he wore a full wig which had certainly been a second hand one when it was bought so shabby was it now his gown was also shabby and his stockings were of grey worsted clearly a country clergyman of humble means his face however looked young when i caught him by the arm he laid hold of my hand with both of his saying gravely now madam i hold you so tightly that you cannot fall this was very kind of him and presently he wanted to lay his arm round my waist for my better protection but this was taking more trouble than i would consent to there was however a worse danger than that of upsetting this year england suffered from a plague of highway robbers the like of which was never before known the roads were crowded with them they were mostly disbanded soldiers who being either disinclined to return to their old trades or being unable to find employment roamed about the country either singly or in pairs or in bands rogues and vagabonds ready to rob steal plunder or even murder as occasion offered they were sometimes so bold that they would attack a whole coachful of passengers and take from them whatever they carried unless as sometimes happened there were one or two valiant men on the coach ready to give them a warm reception with guns pistols swords or even stout cudgels they were said seldom to show much fight being conscious of the gallows awaiting them if they were wounded or captured and would generally make off but it was not always that passengers were found ready to risk the fight and in most cases they sat still and delivered with this danger before us it was not surprising that the conversation should turn upon highwaymen whenever the road became a little smooth and i listened with terror to the tales i heard most of them were related by a man who sat opposite to me he wore a scratch wig probably his second best and had his hat flapped and tied about his ears as if it were winter he was i suppose a merchant of some kind because he talked a great deal about prices and stocks and markets with other things greek and hebrew to me also he looked so uneasy and kept watching the road with so anxious an air that i felt sure he must be carrying a great parcel of money like me and i longed to advise him to imitate my prudence and at the next town we got down to sew it within his coat he continually lamented as we went along the desperate wickedness of the highway robbers he spoke of it as if he were entirely disinterested and regarded not at all the peril to his own fortune but only the danger of their own souls liable to be wretchedly lost and thrown away by their dreadful courses and he talked so feelingly on this subject that one began to feel as if good words were being spoken to the edification of the soul as for their suppression he said that in their own interests strong measures would be necessary trade would never flourish and therefore men would not be induced to follow a respectable trade until ships could sail the seas without fear of pirates and honest merchants carry their property up and down the king's highway without fear of highwaymen here we came in sight of a man on horseback and we all kept silence for an anxious space till we discovered by his great wig and black coat that it was nothing but a country surgeon riding out to see a patient then the merchant went on to say that since the gallows did not terrify these evil doers he for one was for trying how they would like the french wheel at this there was a terrible outcry the clergyman especially asking if he wished to introduce french barbarities such things he said solemnly are the natural accompaniment of popery pray sir remember smithfield sir said the merchant i hope i am as good a protestant as my neighbours i call that however not barbarity but justice and mercy which punishes the guilty and deters the weak as for barbarities are we protestants better than our neighbours is it not barbarous to flog our soldiers and sailors for insubordination to flog our rogues at the cart tail to lash the backs of women in bridewell to cut and scourge the pickpockets so long as the alderman chooses to hold up the hammer do we not hack the limbs of our traitors and stick them up on temple bar truly the world would come to a pretty pass if we were to ask our cut throats what punishment would hurt them least i like not the breaking of legs on wheels cried mrs gambit but to call the flogging of bridewell hussies barbarous fie sir you might as well call bull baiting barbarous no one wanted to encourage highway robbers yet none but this merchant from foreign parts would allow than an englishman however wicked should cruelly have his limbs broken and crushed by a rod of iron as for the gentlemen of the road said mrs gambit i for one fear them not they may take the butter and eggs in my basket but they won't find my money for that is in my shoe nor mine said i taking courage and thinking to show my cleverness for it is all sewn safe inside my petticoats hush silly women cried the merchant you know not but there is a highwayman sitting in disguise on the coach beside you i beg pardon sir he turned to the clergyman beside me no offence sir though i have heard of a thief who robbed a coach after travelling in it dressed as a gentleman of your cloth none sir none replied his reverence yet am i not a highwayman i do assure you for your comfort nor have i any money in my pocket or my shoe i am but a simple clergyman going to look at a benefice which hath been graciously bestowed upon me that sir said the merchant is satisfactory and i hope that no other ears have heard what these ladies have disclosed shoes petticoats oh the things that i have seen and heard the clergyman then told us that he had a wife and six daughters and that the preferment two hundred pounds a year would make a man of him who had as yet been little better than a slave with sixty pounds for all his income the christian year he told us was a long lent for him save that sometimes as at christmas and eastertide he was able to taste meat given to him yet he looked fat and hearty my drink he said is from the spring which costs nothing and my bread is but oatmeal porridge potatoes or barley meal then he pressed my hand in his said i resembled his wife in her younger days and declared that he already felt to me like a father there sat next to the merchant a young gentleman of about seventeen or eighteen brave in scarlet for he had just received a commission as ensign in a regiment of the line and was on his way to join his colours as he told us with pride directly highway robbers were mentioned he assumed being a young man with rosy and blushing cheek fitter for a game of cricket on the green than for war's alarms a fierce and warlike mien and assured us that we ladies should not want protection while he was on the coach and he made a great show of loosening his sword in the scabbard to ensure its quick and ready use should the occasion rise the merchant received these professions of courage with undisguised contempt the clergyman smiled mrs gambit nodded her head and laughed as if he was a boy whose talk meant nothing i neither laughed at him nor scowled at him in fact i was thinking girl like what a handsome boy he was and hoping that he would some day become a great general as the country seems at the present juncture sadly in want of great generals i fear he has been killed in action when we stopped for dinner at one o'clock i remember that i never before saw so prodigious a piece of roast beef upon the table our host must needs spoil all enjoyment of the meal by asking us just as we were sat down sharp set by the air if we had met or seen anything of a certain black will who seemed to be very well known by all the very name caused our poor merchant to push back his plate untasted and the young officer to rise from the table and hasten to assure himself that his sword was loose in the scabbard because said the landlord it is right for you to know that black will is reported in this neighbourhood with all his crew a bloody lot gentlemen i hope you have no valuables to speak of upon you however perhaps they will not meet you on the road they murdered a man last year a young gentleman like you sir nodding to the ensign because he offered resistance and drew his sword what is a little toothpick like that compared with a quarterstaff in the hands of a sturdy rogue so they beat his brains out for him then they gagged and used most unmercifully kicking him till he was senseless an honest gentleman like yourself sir he nodded to our merchant who gave them the trouble of taking off his boots where for greater safety as the poor wretch thought he had bestowed his money god bless my soul cried the merchant changing colour so that i for one felt quite certain that his was there too and that his courage was down in his boots as well to keep the money company bless my soul hanging mere hanging is too good for such villains it is indeed replied the landlord shaking his head there was a young lady too i started because he looked at me who had her money sewn in a bag inside her frock i blushed red knowing where mine was they made her take it off and dance a minuet with one of them in her petticoats but indeed there is no end to their wickedness come gentlemen let me carve faster spare not the beef don't let black will spoil your appetites cut and come again he may be twenty miles away a noble sirloin upon my word to be sure he may be waiting on the hill there in the wood a glass of brandy landlord cried the merchant who surely was a dreadful coward tell me would he be alone not likely the landlord i thought took a pleasure in making us uneasy he would have two or three with him perhaps six with pistols do take some more beef and blunderbusses ah a desperate wicked gang in such cheerful discourse we took our dinner and then with trepidation mounted to our places and drove away we got up the hill safely and met no black will during the next stage we all kept an anxious look up and down the road the coach seemed to crawl and the way was rough the sight of a man on horseback made our hearts beat if we saw two we gave ourselves up for lost but i was pleased all the time to mark the gallant and resolute behaviour of the boy who with his hand upon the hilt of his sword sat pale but determined and when he caught my eye smiled with the courage of one who would defend us to the death as i am sure he would like the gallant young knight he was towards the evening we caught sight of the tower of canterbury cathedral and soon afterwards we rolled through the streets of that ancient city and got down at the crown inn where we were to rest for the night i pass over as unworthy of record my own wonder at so great and beautiful a city this was the first town i had ever seen these the first shops and this the first and still the grandest to my mind of great cathedral churches we walked through the great church at sunset where there was something truly awful in the lofty arches mounting heavenwards and the gloom of the roof outside there were gothic ruins rooks were calling to each other in the trees and swifts were flying about the tower at supper we had more talk about highway robbers but we were assured that there was less danger now because between canterbury and london the road is more frequented and therefore robbers who are by nature a timorous folk hesitate to attack a coach moreover the landlord told us that we should have with us two or three honest citizens of canterbury substantial tradesmen who travelled to london together for mutual protection taking money with them and pistols with which to defend themselves one of them he added is a lieutenant in the train band and a draper in the city a more resolute fellow never handled a yard measure the gentlemen ordered a bowl of punch after supper and we retired as we left the room the clergyman followed us outside the door mrs gambit having already begun to go upstairs he said he would give me his benediction which he did kissing me on the cheeks and lips with much and undeserved affection he was good enough to say that i greatly resembled his youngest sister the beautiful one and he desired closer acquaintance nor could i understand why mrs gambit spoke scornfully of this act of kindness which was entirely unexpected by me kindness quotha she cried a pious man indeed to love to kiss a pretty maid i like not such piety in the morning the train band lieutenant with his two friends came swaggering to the inn he carried his pistols openly and made more display of them i thought than was necessary considering his character for resolution and desperate bravery then we started our little soldier still ready with his sword the road was smoother it ran for the most part along enclosures and gentlemen's parks it was broad and straight having been made we were told by the draper in the time of the romans and as we drew near to london the villages became more frequent and the road was covered with carts waggons and carriages of every kind all moving towards london was london bigger than canterbury i asked they laughed at my innocence and began to tell me that you might take the whole of canterbury out of london and not miss it much also that he or she who had not seen london had not seen the greatest marvel and wonder of the world there are fine buildings said the merchant in paris though the streets are foul but in london there are buildings as fine with streets that are broader and there is the trade aha he smacked his lips paris hath no trade one has to see the ships in the pool and the custom house and the wharves before one can understand how great and rich a city is london and one should also but that young lady you cannot ever do live as long as you will being only a woman feast at one of the great city companies to understand how nobly they can use their wealth we were still anxious about highwaymen but our fears were greatly lessened by the presence of the brave draper of canterbury the clergyman kept up a flow of anecdotes which showed strange acquaintance with the wickedness of the world on highwaymen footpads robbers of all kinds deceivers of strangers and practisers on innocence the merchant listened eagerly and together they bemoaned the credulity of the ignorant and the subtlety of the designing our spirits grew higher as we neared the end of our journey now indeed there was but little fear the coach travels from canterbury to london in a single day we should arrive before nightfall ha ha said the merchant rubbing his hands we who travel encounter many dangers in london one can go to bed without fearing to be murdered in one's sleep and walk abroad without looking to be brained and murderously treated for the sake of a purse and a watch there may be pickpockets shoplifters and such petty rogues there may be footpads about st pancras or lincoln's inn fields but small villains all compared with these desperate rogues of highwaymen desperate indeed said the clergyman dear sir we should be grateful for our preservation it was already past seven when we arrived at the talbot inn the merchant fetched a deep sigh and thanked providence aloud for keeping us safe from the danger of stand and deliver the clergyman said amen but gently reproved the merchant for not allowing him as an ordained minister to take the lead in every devotional exercise when they got down they entered the house together the young ensign pulled off his hat to me and said that no doubt the rogues had got wind of an officer's presence on the stage then he tapped his sword hilt significantly and got down and i saw him no more the gallant draper getting down slowly lamented that he must still be carrying loaded pistols with never an opportunity for using them upon the road and uncocked his weapons with as much ostentatious care as he had shown in loading them for my own part i had no taste for fighting or for seeing fights and was only too glad to escape the hands of men who if tales were true did not even respect a girl's frocks the clergyman bestowed a final benediction upon me saying that he craved my name with a view to a closer friendship and would have kissed me again had not mrs gambit pushed him away with great roughness the thing i am now about to relate will doubtless seem incredible yet it is true i learned it some time after when black will was hanged and his last dying speech and confession was cried in the streets the merchant and the clergyman entered the talbot inn to drink together a bowl of punch at the former's expense before separating the latter out of respect for his cloth called for a private room whither the punch was presently brought now when they had taken a glass or two each both being very merry they were disturbed by the entrance of two tall and ill favoured fellows who walked into the room and sat down one on each side of the merchant gentlemen he cried this is a private room ordered by his reverence here and myself for the peaceful drinking of a thanksgiving glass no replied the clergyman rising and locking the door i find dear sir that this room had been already bespoke by these gentlemen who are friends of mine own and that we have very urgent business which particularly concerns yourself at these words the merchant turned pale being as you may imagine horribly frightened and perceiving that he had fallen into a nest of hornets whereupon he sprang to his feet and would have rushed to the door but that two of the villains seized him and pushed him back into the chair while the third drew a knife and held it at his throat informing him that his weasand would most certainly be cut across did he but move a finger or utter a sigh at this dreadful threat the poor man gave himself up for lost and said no more only the tears of despair rolled down his face as he thought of what was going to happen to him the good clergyman then with smiles and a polite bow informed him that in this world things are not always what they seemed to be honest tradesmen he said often turn out to be common cheats and substantial citizens become bankrupts therefore it is not surprising if a reverend minister of the established church should occasionally bear a hand in a little scheme in which good acting and dexterity are essentials necessary for success in fact he went on drinking up all the punch meanwhile though to you and to many good friends i am a pious divine among my particular intimates and these gentlemen of the road here he pointed to the two villains i am no other than black will at your service nay do not faint dear sir although you would break me on the wheel had you the power i assure you i shall do you no harm in the world wherefore kick off your boots alas in his boots was the money which the poor man was bringing home from france they took it all they tied him to his chair and that to the table they gagged him they put his wig on the table tied a handkerchief over his head so that he should seem to be asleep and then they left him telling the waiter that the gentleman in the blue room was tired after his journey and would like to be undisturbed for an hour or two to think that this villain who was but twenty four when he was hanged a year or so later should dare to feel towards me like a father and to give me his blessing on the lips chapter iv how kitty first saw the doctor it was past seven in the evening when we arrived at the talbot inn of southwark and too late to begin our search after my uncle that evening mrs gambit therefore after conference with a young man of eight and twenty or so dressed in broadcloth very kindly offered me a bed at her own lodging for the night this she told me was in a quiet and most respectable neighbourhood viz fore street which she begged me not to confound with houndsditch i readily assured her that i would preserve separate the ideas of the two streets which was easy to one who knew neither she then informed me that the young man was no other than her husband foreman of works to a builder and that to save the expense of a porter he would himself carry my box mr gambit upon this touched his hat respectfully grinned shouldered the box and led the way pushing through the crowd around us and elbowing them to right and left without a word of excuse as if they were so many ninepins i learned afterwards that it is customary with the mechanical tradesmen of london thus to assert their right of passage and as it is not every one who gives way the porter's burden is not unfrequently lowered while he stops to fight one who disputes his path in evidence of these street fights most of the london carters coachmen chairmen porters and labourers bear continually upon their faces the scars recent or ancient of many such encounters as for the gentlemen it seems right that they should not disdain to strip and take a turn with their fists against some burly ruffian who would thrust his unmannerly body past his betters confident in his superior strength mr gambit looked round from time to time to see if we were following and it gave me pain to observe how my box which was long in shape became the constant cause of sad accidents for with it mr gambit either knocked off a hat or deranged a wig or struck violently some peaceful person on the back of his head or gave an inoffensive citizen a black eye or caused profane passengers to swear he was however so big strong and careless about these reproaches that no one cared to stop him or offered to fight him until he was well on ahead it's a royal supper he turned and nodded pleasantly shouting these words to his wife the box thus brought at right angles to the road barred the way while he spoke except to the very short tripe fried tripe with onions and carrots and potatoes will be done to a turn at eight make haste what crowds what rushing to and fro what jostling pushing and crowding what hurrying and what wicked language sure something dreadful must have happened nor could i believe mrs gambit when she assured me that this was the usual crowd of london then we came to london bridge and i saw the ships in the river and the tower of london oh the forests of masts and beyond the river the steeples of the great city shining bright in the evening sunshine which of them was my uncle's church we crossed the bridge we walked up gracechurch street to cornhill we passed through a labyrinth of narrow and winding lanes crowded like the wider streets mr gambit hurried along thinking i suppose of his supper and using my box as a kind of battering ram with which to force a way presently we came to a broad street which was in fact fore street where was mrs gambit's lodging eight o'clock said mr gambit as we reached the top of the stairs now for supper there was such a noise in the street below that we could hardly hear the church bells as they struck the hour yet there were churches all round us but their bells clanging together only added somewhat to the general tumult eight o'clock wife good time he dropped my box upon the floor and hastened down the stairs it was a comfortable lodging of two rooms in one of which a cloth was laid for supper which mr gambit speedily brought from a cookshop and we had a royal supper indeed with two quarts at least of the nauseous black beer of london to which such men are extravagantly addicted supper ended mr gambit lit a pipe of tobacco and began to smoke begging me not to mind him his wife told him of the farm and her brother and i tried to listen through the dreadful noise of the street below it was a warm evening and our window was thrown open people were passing up and down talking singing whistling shouting and swearing i could hear nothing else but the good man seemed as if he was deaf to the roar of the street and listened to his wife as quietly as if we were in the fields i asked him presently with a shout what was the cause of a dreadful riot and tumult he laughed and said that it was always the same it was a pity i said that london being so rich could not keep the streets quiet ay but said he there are plenty of poor people as well and you must first ask what they think about having their mouth shut the strangeness of the place and the noise in the streets kept me awake nearly all that night so that when mrs gambit called me in the morning i was still tired but it was time to be up and seeking for my uncle we got everything ready my father's last will and testament my bags of money which mrs gambit carried for me in her basket and tied the basket to her arm and my box of clothes then because mrs gambit said that a young lady should not walk with her box carried by a porter like a servant wench we hired a coach and told him to drive us to st paul's coffee house it is not far from fore street to st paul's churchyard but the crowd in the streets the waggons and carts and the dreadful practice of london drivers to quarrel and then to stop while they abuse each other delayed us a great deal so that it was already half past nine when we came to the coffee house we got down leaving the coach at the door it was a place the like of which i had never dreamed of to be sure everything was new to me just then and my poor rustic brain was turning with the novelty there was a long room which smelt of tobacco rum punch coffee chocolate and tea it was already filled with gentlemen sitting on the benches before small tables at which some were taking pipes of tobacco some were talking some were writing and some were reading the newspapers running along one side of the room was a counter covered with coffee pots bottles of nantz jamaica rum hollands and geneva there were also chocolate dishes sugar lemons spices and punch bowls behind the counter sat a young woman of grave aspect knitting but holding herself in readiness to serve the customers the gentlemen raised their heads and stared at me some of them whispered and laughed all gazed as if a woman had no more business there than in the inner precincts of the temple that was what occurred to me instantly because they were i observed all of them clergymen they were not certainly clergymen who appeared to have risen in the world nor did their appearance speak so much in their favour as their calling they were mostly in fact clad in tattered gowns with disordered or shabby wigs and bands whose whiteness might have been restored by the laundress but had changed long since into a crumpled yellow i heard afterwards that the house was the resort of those tattered crapes as they are irreverently called who come to be hired by the rectors vicars and beneficed clergy of london for an occasional sermon burial or christening and have no regular cure of souls on such chance employment and odd jobs these reverend ministers contrive to live they even vie with each other and underbid their neighbours for such work and some who have not the means to spend a sixpence at the coffee house will it is said walk up and down the street ready to catch a customer outside one fears that there must be other reasons besides lack of interest for the ill success of these men surely a godly life and zeal for religion should be even in this country of patronage better rewarded than by this old age of penury and dependence surely too those tattered gowns speak a tale of improvidence and those red noses tell of a mistaken calling this however i did not then know and i naturally thought there must be some great ecclesiastical function in preparation a confirming on a large scale about to be celebrated in the great cathedral close beside whose vastness was such as amazed and confounded me these clergymen whose poverty was no doubt dignified by their virtues were probably preparing for the sacred function after the manner practised by my father namely by an hour's meditation perhaps my uncle would be among them seeing me standing there helpless and i daresay showing by my face what i immediately manifested in speech my rusticity the young woman behind the counter came to my assistance and asked me very civilly what i lacked i was told i stammered to inquire at the st paul's coffee house for the present lodging of my uncle as if there was but one uncle in all london certainly madam said the woman if you will tell me your uncle's name i was told that you knew at this house the residence of every london clergyman yes madam that is true and of a good many country clergymen if you will let me know his name we will do what we can to assist you he is named i said this with a little pride because i thought that perhaps from my own rusticity and the homeliness of my companion she might not have thought me so highly connected he is the reverend gregory shovel doctor of divinity lord save us she cried starting back and holding up her hands while she dropped her knitting needle why did she stare smile and then look upon me with a sort of pity and wonder dr shovel is your uncle madam yes i said my father who was also a clergyman and is but lately dead bade me come to london and seek him out she shook her head at this news and called for one william there came from the other end of the room a short legged man with the palest cheeks and the reddest nose i had ever seen they spoke together for a few minutes william grinned as she spoke and scratched his head under the scantiest wig i had ever seen can you tell me i began when she returned i observed that william when he left her ran quickly up the room whispering to the gentlemen who had ceased to stare at me and that as soon as he had whispered they all with one consent put down their pipes or their papers or their coffee stayed their conversation and turned their clerical faces to gaze upon me with a universal grin which seemed ill bred if one might so speak of the clergy can you tell me i can madam and will she replied what did your father not know the present residence of dr shovel i fear it will not be quite such as a young lady of your breeding madam had a right to expect but doubtless you have other and better friends she has indeed said miss gambit if his honour sir robert levett justice of the peace is to be called a good friend but if you please tell us quickly madam because our coach waits at the door and waiting is money in london the country for me where a man will sit on a stile the whole day long and do nothing content with his daily wage and the sooner we get away from these reverend gentlemen who stare as if they had never seen a young lady from the country before the better then the young woman went on tell your man to drive you down ludgate hill and up the fleet market on the prison side he may stop at the next house to the third pen and hand you will find the doctor's name written on a card in the window we thanked her and got into the coach when we told the coachman where to go he smacked his leg with his hand and burst out laughing i thought as much cried the impudent rascal ah mother slylips wouldn't the doctor serve your turn but you must needs look out for one in the coffee house i warrant the doctor is good enough for the likes of you he cracked his whip and we drove off slowly now which was really extraordinary all the reverend gentlemen of the coffee room had left their places and were crowded round the door some of them almost pushing their wigs into the coach windows in their eagerness to look at us this seemed most unseemly conduct on the part of a collection of divines nor did i imagine that curiosity so undignified and so unworthy a sacred profession could be called forth by the simple appearance of a young girl in the coffee room the faces formed a curious picture some of the clergymen were stooping some standing some mounting on chairs the better to see so that the doorway of the coffee house seemed a pyramid of faces they were old young fat thin red pale of every appearance and every age they were mostly disagreeable to look at because their possessors were men who had been unsuccessful either through misfortune or through fault and they all wore as they stared a look of delighted curiosity as if here was something indeed to make londoners talk nothing less if you please than a girl of seventeen just come up from the country bless us cried mrs gambit are the men gone mad london is a wicked place indeed when even clergymen come trooping out merely to see a pretty girl fie for shame sir and be off with you these last words were addressed to one old clergyman with an immense wig who was actually thrusting his face through the coach window he drew it back on this reprimand and we went on our way i looked round once more the young woman of the counter was still in the doorway and with her william with the scrubby wig and the red nose round them were the clergymen and they were all talking about me and looking after me some of them wagged their heads some shook theirs some nodded some were holding their heads on one side and some were hanging theirs some were laughing some smiling some were grave what did it mean if said mrs gambit they were not clergymen i should say they were all tomfools and this for a pretty girl for you are pretty miss kitty with your rosy cheeks and the bright eyes which were never yet spoiled by the london smoke but there must be plenty other pretty girls in london and them to call themselves clergymen perhaps they were looking at you mrs gambit the idea did not seem to displease her she smiled smoothed the folds of her gown and pulled down the ends of her neckerchief five years ago child they might but i doubt it is too late set them up indeed as if nothing would suit them to look at but the wife of a respectable builder's foreman they must go into the country must they after the pretty faces but oh the noise and tumult of the streets for as we came to the west front of st paul's we found ludgate hill crowded with such a throng as i had never before believed possible the chairmen jostled each other up and down the way the carts coaches drays barrows waggons trucks going up the hill met those going down and there was such a crush of carriages as it seemed would never be cleared all the drivers were swearing at each other at the top of their voices shut your ears child cried mrs gambit but immediately afterwards there it's no use they could be heard through my grandfather's nightcap oh this london wickedness there are many kinds of wickedness in london but the worst as i have always thought because i have seen and heard so much of it is the great and terrible vice of blasphemy and profane swearing so that if you listen to the ragamuffin boys or to the porters or to the chair and coach men it would seem as if it were impossible for them to utter three words without two at least being part of an oath then some of the drivers fought with each other the people in the coaches looked out of the windows swore if they were men if they were ladies they shrieked most of those who were walking up and down the hill took no manner of notice of the confusion they pushed on their way bearing parcels and bundles looking neither to the right nor to the left but straight in front as if they had not a moment to spare and must push on or lose their chance of fortune some there were it is true who lingered looking at the crush in the road and the men fighting or if they were women stopping before the shops in the windows of which were hoods cardinals sashes pinners and shawls would make the mouth of any girl to water only to look at them at the doors stood shopmen bravely habited in full dressed wigs with broad ribbon ties behind who bowed and invited the gazers to enter and there were a few who loitered as they went these carried their hats beneath their arms and dangled canes in their right hands there was plenty of time for us to notice all that passed because the block in the way took fully half an hour to clear away we were delayed ten minutes of this time through the obstinacy of a drayman who after exchanging with a carter oaths which clashed and clanged and echoed in the air like the bombshells at the siege of mans declared that he could not possibly go away satisfied until he had fought his man the mob willingly met his views applauding so delicate a sense of honour they made a ring and we presently heard the shouts of those who encouraged the combatants but happily could not see them by reason of the press mrs gambit would fain have witnessed the fight and indeed few country people there are who do not love to see two sturdy fellows thwack and belabour each other with quarterstaff singlestick or fists but i was glad that we could not see the battle being i hope better taught my father indeed and lady levett were agreed that in these things we english were little better than the poor pagan romans who crowded to see gladiators do battle to the death or prisoners fight till they fell cruelly torn and mangled by the lions and no better at all than the poor spanish papists who flock to a circus where men fight with bulls it is hard to think that roman gentlewomen and spanish ladies would go to see such sights whatever men may do yet in this eighteenth century when we have left behind us as we flatter ourselves the gothic barbarisms of our ancestors we still run after such cruelties and cruel sports as fights with fists sticks or swords baitings of bull bear and badger throwing stones at cocks killing of rats by dogs and ferrets fights of cocks dogs cats and whatever other animals can be persuaded to fight and kill each other when the fight was over and one man defeated i know not which but both were horribly bruised and stained with blood the carts cleared away rapidly and we were able to go on is it not strange to think that the honour of such a common fellow should be satisfied when he hath gotten black eyes bloody nose and teeth knocked down his throat we got to the bottom of the hill and passed without further adventure through the old gate of lud with its narrow arch and the stately effigy of queen elizabeth looking across the fleet bridge pity it is that the old gate has since been removed for my own part i think the monuments of old times should be carefully guarded and kept not taken away to suit the convenience of draymen and coaches what would fleet street be without its bar or the thames without its river gates outside there was a broad space before us the fleet river ran filthy and muddy to the left the road crossing it by a broad and handsome stone bridge where the way was impeded by the stalls of those who sold hot furmety and medicines warranted to cure every disease on the right the fleet had been recently covered in and was now built over with a long row of booths and stalls on either side the market were rows of houses fleet market said the driver looking round patience young lady five minutes and we are there there was another delay here of two or three minutes the crowd was denser and i saw among them two or three men with eager faces who wore white aprons and ran about whispering in the ears of the people especially of young people i saw one couple a young man and a girl whom they all one after the other addressed whispering pointing and inviting the girl blushed and turned away her head and the young man though he marched on stoutly seemed not ill pleased with their proposals presently one of them came to our coach and put his head in at the window it was as impudent and ugly a head as ever i saw he squinted one eye rolling about by itself as if having quarrelled with the other he had had the bridge of his nose crushed in some fight some of his teeth stuck out like fangs but most were broken his chin was bristly with a three days' beard his voice was thick and hoarse and when he began to speak his hearers began to think of rum pity it is he said that so pretty a pair cannot find gallant husbands now ladies if you will come with me i warrant that in half an hour the doctor will bestow you upon a couple of the young noblemen whom he most always keeps in readiness here the driver roughly bade him begone about his business for an ass for the young lady was on her way to the doctor's at this the fellow laughed and nodded his head aha he said no doubt we shall find the gentleman waiting your ladyship will remember that i spoke to you first the fees of us messengers are but half a crown even at the doctor's where alone the work is secure what means the fellow cried mrs gambit what have we to do with gentlemen all right mother he replied with another laugh then he mounted the door step and continued to talk while the coach slowly made its way we were now driving along the city side of the fleet market that side on which stands the prison the market was crowded with buyers and sellers the smell of the meat the poultry and the fruit all together being strong rather than delicate this said mrs gambit is not quite like the smell of the honeysuckle in the kentish hedges the houses on our right seemed to consist of nothing but taverns where signs where hoisted up before the doors at the corner close to the ditch was the rainbow and four doors higher up was the hand and pen next to that the bull and garter then another hand and pen then the bishop blaize a third hand and pen the fighting cocks and the naked boy one called the white horse had a verse written up under the sign my white horse shall beat the bear and make the angel fly turn the ship with its bottom up and drink the three cups dry but what was more remarkable was that of the repetition in every window of a singular announcement two hands were painted or drawn rudely clasping each other and below them was written printed or scrawled some such remarkable legend as the following weddings performed here a church of england clergyman always on the premises weddings performed cheap the only safe house the old and true register marriage by church service and ordained clergymen safety and cheapness the licensed clergyman of the fleet weddings by a late chaplain to a nobleman one familiar with the quality no imposition not a common fleet parson with other statements which puzzled me exceedingly you do well ladies the man with us went on talking with his head thrust into the coach you do well to come to doctor shovel whose humble servant or clerk i am the doctor is no ordinary fleet parson he does not belong to the beggarly gentry not regular clergymen at all who live in a tavern and do odd jobs as they come for a guinea a week and the run of the landlord's rum not he madam the doctor is a gentleman and a scholar master of arts of the university of cambridge he was where by reason of their great respect for his learning and piety they have made him doctor of divinity there is the rev mr arkwell who will read the service for you for half a crown he was fined five shillings last week for drunkenness and profane swearing would it be agreeable to your ladyship to be turned off by such an impious rogue there is the rev mr wigmore will do it for less if you promise to lay out your wedding money afterwards on what he calls his nantz he hath twice been fined for selling spirituous drinks without a license who would trust herself to a man so regardless of his profession or the rev john mottram but there your ladyship would not like to have it read in a prison now at the doctor's is a snug room with hassocks there is forsooth the rev walter wyatt brother of him who keeps the first pen and hand after you turn the corner but sure such a sweet young lady would scorn to look for drink after the service or the rev john grierson or mr walker or mr alexander keith will do it for what they can get ay even it is reported down to eighteenpence or a shilling with a sixpennyworth of geneva but your ladyship must think of your lines and where is your security against treachery no ladies the doctor is the only man a gentleman enjoying the liberties of the fleet for which he hath given security a cambridge scholar who receives at his lodging none but the quality no less a fee than a guinea with half a crown for the clerk ever enters his house the guinea ladies includes the five shilling stamp with the blessing of the archbishop of canterbury which binds the happy pair like an act of parliament or a piece of cobbler's wax this cheapness is certainly due to the benevolence and piety of the doctor who would be loth indeed to place obstacles in the way of so christian and religious a ceremony we have certainly cried mrs gambit in dismay at such a flow of words got into tom fool's land this man is worse than the parsons at the coffee house now ladies the fellow went on throwing the door wide open with a fling and letting down the steps this is the house look at it ladies we got down and stood looking at it it was a low house of mean appearance built in two stories of brick and timber the first floor overhanging the lower as was the fashion until the present comfortable and handsome mode of using stucco and flat front was adopted the brick had been once covered with a coat of yellow wash which had crumbled away over most of the front the timber had once been painted but the paint had fallen off the roof was gabled like the rest of the house it looked decaying and neglected the window of the room which looked out upon the street was broad but it was set with leaden frames of the kind called diamond provided with the common greenish glass every other pane being those thick bull's eye panes which would stand a blow with a club without being broken little light would enter at that window but for the bright sun which shone full upon it the casement however was set open to catch the air as for the air that was hardly worth catching so foul was it with the fumes of the market right in front of the door stood a great heap of cabbage leaves stalks and vegetable refuse which sometimes was collected put in barrows and carted into the fleet ditch but sometimes remained for months mrs gambit sniffed disdainfully give me fore street she said there's noise if you like but no cabbage stalks this ladies said the man after a pause so that we might be overpowered with the grandeur of the house this is no other than the great dr shovel's house here shall you find a service as regular and as truly read as if you were in the cathedral itself not so much as an amen dropped they do say that the doctor is a private friend of the dean and hand in glove with the bishop this way your ladyship's box i will carry it this is the good doctor's door the clerk's fee half a crown your ladyship will not forget unless the young gentleman which is most likely should like to make it half a guinea i follow your ladyships doubt not that early as it is his reverence will be found up and ready for good works i believe said mrs gambit that this man would talk the hind legs off a donkey keep close to me miss kitty here may be villainy and if there is there's one at least that shall feel the weight of my ten nails young man she addressed the fellow with sharpness you let that box alone or if you carry it go before i trust londoners as far as i can see them and no farther pray ladies cried the man have no suspicion it's all right said the coachman grinning lord i've brought them here by dozens go in madam go in young lady this way ladies cried the man the doctor will see you within a clergyman continued mrs gambit taking no manner of notice of these interruptions may not always no more than a builder's foreman choose where he would live and if his parish is the fleet market among the cabbages as i suppose the doctor's is or about the fleet prison among the miserable debtors as i suppose it may be why he must fain live here with the cabbage stalks beneath his nose and make the best of it your ladyship the messenger went on addressing himself to me will shortly no doubt be made happy the gentleman however hath not yet come pray step within ladies you see miss kitty said mrs gambit pointing to the window with a disdainful look at this impertinent fellow this is certainly the house so far therefore we are safe in the window there hung a card on which was written in large characters so that all might read reverend gregory shovel doctor of divinity formerly of cambridge university now without any reason i immediately connected this announcement with those curious advertisements i had seen in the tavern windows and yet what could my uncle have to do with marrying and what did the man mean by his long rigmarole and nonsense about the reverend this and the reverend that however mrs gambit led the way and i followed the messenger pushed a door open and we found ourselves in a low room lit by the broad window with the diamond panes of which i have spoken the air in the room was close and smelt of tobacco and rum the floor was sanded the wainscoting of the walls was broken in places walls floors and ceiling were all alike unwashed and dirty the only furniture was a table half a dozen cushions or hassocks and one great chair with arms and back of carved wood on the table was a large volume it was the prayer book of the established church of england and ireland and it was lying open i could plainly see at the marriage service at the head of the table a reflection of the sunlight from the window falling full upon his face sat a man of middle age about fifty five years or so who rose when we came in and bowed with great gravity could this be my uncle he was a very big and stout man one of the biggest men i have ever seen he was clad in a rich silk gown flowing loosely and freely about him white bands clean and freshly starched and a very full wig he had the reddest face possible it was of a deep crimson colour tinged with purple and the colour extended even to the ears and the neck so much of it as could be seen was as crimson as the cheeks he had a full nose long and broad a nose of great strength and very deep in colour but his eyes which were large reminded me of that verse in the psalms wherein the divine poet speaks of those whose eyes swell out with fatness his lips were gross and protruded he had a large square forehead and a great amplitude of cheek he was broad in the shoulders deep chested and portly a man of great presence when he stood upright he not only seemed almost to touch the ceiling but also to fill up the breadth of the room my heart sank as i looked at him for he was not the manner of man i expected and i was afraid where were the outward signs and tokens of that piety which my father had led me to expect in my uncle i had looked for a gentle scholar a grave and thoughtful bearing but even to my inexperienced eyes the confident carriage of the doctor appeared braggart the roll of his eyes when we entered the room could not be taken even by a simple country girl for the grave contemplation of a humble and fervent christian the smell of the room was inconsistent with the thought of religious meditation there were no books or papers or any other outward signs of scholarship and even the presence of the prayer book on the table with the hassocks seemed a mockery of sacred things so good roger he said in a voice loud and sonorous yet musical as the great bell of st paul's so deep was it and full so good roger whom have we here a young lady sir whom i had the good fortune to meet on ludgate hill she was on her way to your reverence's to ask your good offices she is ahem fully acquainted with the customary fees of the establishment that is well he replied my dear young lady i am fortunate in being the humble instrument of making so sweet a creature happy but i do not see in fact the other party the young lady expects the gentleman every minute said the excellent roger oh cried mrs gambit the man is stark mad staring mad sir i faltered there is i fear some mistake he waved both of his hands with a gesture reassuring and grand no mistake madam at all i am that dr shovel before whom the smaller pretenders in these liberties give place and hide diminished heads if by any unlucky accident your lover has fallen a prey to some of those self styled clerical gentry who are in fact impostors and sharpers we will speedily rescue him from their talons describe the gentleman madam and my messenger shall go and seek him at the pen and hand or at some other notorious place the clerk meanwhile had placed himself beside his master and now produced a greasy prayer book with the aid of which i suppose he meant to give the responses of the church at the mention of the word mistake a look of doubt and anxiety crossed his face there is indeed some mistake sir i repeated my errand here is not of the kind you think then madam your business with me must be strange indeed sirrah he addressed his clerk in a voice of thunder hast thou been playing the fool what was it this young lady sought of you oh sir this good person is not to blame perhaps are you indeed the rev gregory shovel doctor of divinity no other madam he spread out both his arms proudly lifting his gown so that he really seemed to cover the whole of the end of the room no other i assure you i am dr gregory shovel known and beloved by many a happy pair and the brother in law of the late reverend lawrence pleydell late vicar of he interrupted me late vicar is then my brother in law dead or have they which is a thing incredible conferred preferment upon sheer piety alas sir i cried with tears my father is dead thy father child yes sir i am kitty pleydell at your service kitty pleydell he bent over me across the table and looked into my face not unkindly my sister's child then how he turned upon his clerk who now stood with staring eyes and open mouth chapfallen and terrified fool he thundered get thee packing lest i do thee a mischief chapter v how kitty witnessed a fleet wedding then i pulled out my father's letter and gave it to him to read he took it read it carefully nodding gravely over each sentence and then returned it to me lawrence then he said softly lawrence is dead lawrence pleydell is dead and i am living lawrence he hath without reasonable doubt passed away in full assurance he hath exchanged this world for a better he hath gone to happiness nay if such as he die not in faith what hope remains for such sinners as ourselves then would it be better for those who dwell in the liberties of the fleet if they had never been born so my sister's child hold up thy face my dear he kissed me as he spoke and held his hand under my chin so that he could look at me well there is more pleydell than shovel here that is well because the pleydells are of gentle blood and the daughter doth ever favour the father more than the mother favour him in thy life child as well as in thy features lawrence is dead he went on the gentlest soul the most pious and religious creature that the world has ever seen he for one could think upon his maker without the terror of a rebellious and prodigal son the world and the flesh had no temptations for him a good man indeed it is long since i saw him and he knew not where i live nor how yet he who knew me when i was young trusted still in me whom no one else will trust this it is to start in life with goodly promise of virtue scholarship and religion he cleared his throat and was silent awhile thy father did well child i will treat thee as my own daughter yet i know not indeed where to bestow thee for this house is not fit for girls and i have none other still i would fain take thy father's place so far as in me lies he good man lived in the country where virtue like fresh butter and new laid eggs flourishes easily and at the cost of a little husbandry in the way of prayer and meditation as for us who live in great cities and especially in the rules or liberties of the fleet we may say with the psalmist having examples to the contrary continually before us with temptations such as dwellers in the fields wot not of 'he that keepeth the law happy is he' i have neither wife nor child to greet thee kitty i must bestow thee somewhere what shall we do he paused to think i might find a lodging but no that would not do or in but the house is full of men there is the clerk of st sepulchre's whose wife would take thee but the rector bears me a heavy grudge ho ho he laughed low down in his chest there is not a parish round london from limehouse to westminster and from southwark to highgate where the niece of dr shovel would not find herself flouted out of the singular hatred which the clergy bear to me for i undersell them all and if they pass an act to prevent my marrying then will i bury for nothing and undersell them still well i must take order in this matter and who are you my good woman he asked this of mrs gambit jane gambit sir she replied at your service and the wife of samuel gambit foreman of works and my charge is not to leave miss kitty until she is safe in your reverence's hands there are the hands to be sure but as for safety she paused and sniffed violently looking round the room with a meaning air why woman you would not think the child in danger with me i know not sir but miss kitty has been brought up among gentlefolk and the room is not one to which she has been accustomed to live in or to eat in or to sleep in either at the vicarage or the hall tobacco and the smell of rum may be very well in their place which i humbly submit is in a tavern not a gentlewoman's parlour the woman speaks reason he growled laying his great hand upon the table see my dear my brother in law thought me holding a rich benefice in the church those get rich benefices who have rich friends and patrons i had none therefore i hold no benefice and as for my residence why truly i have little choice except between this place and the fleet prison or perhaps the king's bench else might i welcome thee in a better and more convenient lodging know therefore kitty without any concealment that i live here secluded in the liberties of the fleet in order that my creditors of whom i have as many as most men and more importunate may no longer molest me when i take my walks abroad that i am in this place outside the authority of the bishop and that my occupation is to marry with all safety and despatch without license or asking of banns or any of the usual delays those good people who wish to be married secretly and quickly and can afford at least one guinea fee for the ceremony i stared in amazement to be sure every clergyman can marry but for a clergyman to do naught else seemed strange indeed he saw my amazement and drawing his tall and burly figure upright he began to deliver an oration i call it an oration because he so puffed his cheeks rolled his sentences and swelled himself out while he spoke that it was more like a sermon or oration than a mere speech in it he seemed to be trying at once to justify himself in my eyes to assert his own self respect and to magnify his office it is not likely child he said that thou hast been told of these marriages in the fleet know therefore that in this asylum called the rules of the fleet where debtors find some semblance of freedom and creditors cease to dun there has grown up a custom of late years by which marriages are here rapidly performed for the good of the country which the beneficed clergy would not undertake without great expense trouble delay and the vexation of getting parents' and guardians' consent to say nothing of the prodigality and wasteful expense of feasting which follows what is called a regular marriage therefore finding myself some years ago comfortably settled in the place after contracting a greater debt than is usually possible for an unbeneficed clergyman i undertook this trade which is lucrative honourable and easy there are indeed he added both in the prison and the rules but more especially the latter many fleet parsons here he rolled his great head with complacency but none my child so great and celebrated as myself some indeed are mere common cheats whose marriages call them rather sacrilegious impostures are not worth the paper of their pretended certificates some are perhaps what they profess to be regularly ordained clergymen of the church of england and ireland as by law established the supreme head of which is his gracious majesty but even these are tipplers and beggars and paupers men who drink gin of an evening and small beer in the morning whose gowns are as ragged as their reputations and who take their fees in shillings with a dram thrown in and herd with the common offscourings of the town whom they marry illiterate too not a greek verse or a latin hexameter among them all go not into the company of such lest thou be corrupted by their talk in the words of king lemuel 'let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more' here he paused and adjusted his gown as if he were in a pulpit indeed for the moment he imagined perhaps that he was preaching as for me gregory shovel my marriages are what they pretend to be as tight as any of the archbishop's own tying conducted with due decorum by a member of the university of cambridge a man whose orders are beyond dispute whose history is known to all an approved and honoured scholar yes my niece behold in me one who has borne off university and college medals for latin verse my latin verses wherein i have been said to touch horace and even to excel ovid whether in the tender elegiac the stately alcaic the melting sapphic or the easy flowing hendecasyllabic loved of martial have conferred upon my head the bays of fame other fleet parsons let them hide their ignorant heads in their second hand peruques by the thunders of jupiter his powerful voice rose and rolled about the room like the thunder by which he swore by the thunders of jupiter i am their bishop let them acknowledge that i and i alone am the chaplain of the fleet during this speech he swelled himself out so enormously and so flourished his long gown that he seemed to fill the whole room i shrank into a corner and clasped mrs gambit's hand this kind of terror i have always felt since whenever which is rare i have heard a man speak in such a full rich manliness of voice it was a voice with which he might have led thousands to follow him and do his bidding when i read of any great orator at whose speeches the people went mad so that they did what he told them were it but to rush along the road to certain death i think of the reverend dr shovel i am sure that peter the hermit or st bernard must have had such a voice while he spoke though the words were not noble the air was such the voice was such the eloquence was such that my senses were carried away and i felt that in the hands of such a man no one was master of himself his demeanour was so majestic that even the shabby dirty room in which he spoke became for the time a temple fit for the sacred rites conducted by so great and good a man the noise of carts the voices of men and women were drowned and stilled beneath the rolling music of his voice i was rapt and astonished and terrified mrs gambit was so far impressed when the doctor began this oration that she instantly assumed that attitude of mind and body in which country people always listen to a sermon that is to say she stood with her chin up her eyes fixed on the ceiling fie how black it was her hands crossed and her thoughts wandering freely whithersoever they listed it is a practice which sometimes produces good effects save when the preacher which is seldom hath in his own mind a clear message to deliver from the revealed word for it prevents a congregation from discerning the poverty of the discourse and in these latter days of whitfield wesley and the sad schisms which daily we witness it checks the progress of dissent the doctor after a short pause swept back his flowing gown with a significant gesture of his left hand and resumed the defence or apology for his profession it was remarkable that he spoke as earnestly and with as much force eloquence and justness in this address to two women or to one and a half because mrs gambit thinking herself in church was only half a listener as if he had been addressing a great congregation beneath the vast dome of st paul's the doctor i afterwards found was always great no mean or little ways were his he lived he spoke he moved he thought like a bishop had he been actually a bishop i am sure that his stateliness dignity and pomp would have been worthy of that exalted position and that he would have graced the bench by the exhibition of every christian virtue except perhaps that of meekness for the doctor was never meek let us said the doctor argue the question what is there contrary to the rubric in my calling the church hath wisely ordered that marriage is a state to be entered upon only after sanctification by her ministers or priests i am one of those ministers she hath provided and strictly enjoined a rule of service i read that service she hath recommended the faithful to marry as if to enter a holy and blessed condition of life i encourage and exhort the people to come to me with the design of obeying the church and entering upon that condition she hath in deference to the laws of the land required a stamped certificate at five shillings i find that certificate in obedience to the law further for the credit of the cloth and because people must not think the ministers of the church to be like common hackney coachmen messengers running lackeys and such varlets at the beck and call of every prentice boy and ragamuffin wench with a yard measure and a dishclout for all their fortune and because further it is well to remind people of thrift especially this common people of london who are grievously given to waste prodigality gluttony fine clothes drinking and all such extravagances nay how except by thrift will they find money to pay their lawful tithes to mother church wherefore it is my custom nay my undeviating rule to charge a fee of one guinea at least for every pair with half a crown for the services of the clerk more may be given more i say is generally given by those who have money in pocket and generous grateful hearts what indeed is a present of ten guineas in return for such services as mine child know that i am a public benefactor behold in me one who promotes the happiness of his species but for me maids would languish lovers groan and cruel guardians triumph i ask not if there be any impediment i inquire not if there be some to forbid the banns i do not concern myself with the lover's rent roll i care not what his profession i have even married a lady to her footman since she desired it and a nobleman to his cook since that was his lordship's will i ask not for consent of parents the maiden leaves my doors a wife when she goes home no parents or guardians can undo the knot that i have tied doctors learned in theology casuistry science and philosophy have been called by divers names there have been the subtle doctor the golden doctor the eloquent doctor for me there has been reserved the title of the benevolent doctor of me let it be said that he loved even beyond his respect towards his diocesan even beyond obedience to his ecclesiastical superiors even beyond consideration to the parish clergy who by his means were deprived of their fees the happiness of his fellow men and women his voice had dropped to the lower notes and his last words were spoken in deep but gentle thunder when he had finished mrs gambit dropped her chin and returned to practical business and pray sir what will miss kitty do recalled to the facts of the case the doctor paused his cheeks retracted his breadth and height became perceptibly smaller what will she do that is indeed a difficulty if said mrs gambit your honour is a prisoner woman he roared i enjoy the liberties of the fleet the liberties do you hear prate not to me of prisoners is dr shovel a man think ye to clap in a prison well then is miss kitty to live here she looked round in disgust why what a place is this for a young lady virtuously and godlily reared your ceiling is black with smoke the windows are black with dirt the walls are streaked with dirt the floor is as thick with mud as the road faugh if your honour is a bishop as you say you are you can doubtless put the poor young lady who is used to sweet air and clean floors where she will get such and that without profane swearing the last remark was caused by language used at that moment outside the window by a man wheeling a barrow full of cabbages which upset while picking up the vegetables he swore loudly administering rebuke in a couple of oaths at least and in some cases more to every head of cabbage in turn an unreflecting wretch indeed to break a commandment upon a senseless vegetable nay i said my uncle will do what is best for me i will do for thee he said what i can this place is not fit for a young girl all the morning it is wanted for my occupation in the evening i am visited by gentlemen who seek me for certain merits graces or beauties of conversation in which i am said although i boast not to be endowed with gifts beyond those allotted to most men no child thou must not stay here while we stood waiting for his decision we became aware of a most dreadful noise outside men were shouting women were screaming of course bad language and cursing formed a large part of what was said the air about the fleet was always heavy with oaths so that at last the ear grew accustomed to them and we noticed them no more than in the quiet fields one notices the buzzing of the insects but these people whoever they were congregated outside the door of the house and after more oaths and loud talk the door was opened and they all tramped noisily into the room a party of men and women twelve in all and drew up in some sort of order every man leading a woman by the hand as for the men though i had never seen the sea i knew at once that monsters so uncouth and rough could be none other than sailors they were all dressed alike and wore blue jackets with flannel shirts and coloured silk neckties every man carried round his waist a rope at the end of which was a knife they wore three cornered hats without lace or any kind of trimming they had no wigs but wore their own hair plastered with tallow rolled up tightly and tied behind and one bore a great and grisly beard most terrible to behold great boots covered their feet their hands were smeared with tar their faces were weather beaten being burnt by the sun and blown by the breeze their eyes were clear and bright but their cheeks were bruised as if they had been fighting they were all laughing and their countenances betokened the greatest satisfaction with everything as for the women they were young and some of them i suppose were handsome but they looked bold and rough they were very finely dressed their frocks being of silk and satin with flowered shawls and hats of a grandeur i had never before seen immense hoops and great patches but the fight outside had torn their finery and more than one nymph had a black eye however these accidents had not diminished the general joy and they were laughing with the men why why roared the doctor as he called them to attention by banging the table with his fist so that the windows rattled the women shrieked and the plaster fell from the wall what is this who are ye the impudent fellow with the white apron who had brought us to the place here stepped in bringing with him another couple he too had been fighting for his face was bleeding and bruised fighting i presently found was too common in fleet market to call for any notice what is this roger repeated the doctor these tarpaulins are no cattle for my handling let them go to the pen and hand or some other pigsty where they can be irregularly and illegally married for eighteenpence and a glass of rum please your reverence said roger handling his nose which was swollen tenderly they are honest gentlemen of the sea paid off at wapping but yesternight still in their sea going clothes by reason of their having as yet no time to buy long shore rigging not common sailors but mates by rating in the ship's books and anxious to be married by none other than your reverence ay ay honest roger the doctor's voice dropped and became soft and encouraging ay ay this is as it should be know they of the fee they wish me to offer your reverence said the clerk a guinea apiece and five guineas extra for your honour's trouble if so be so small a gift is worth your acceptance with half a crown apiece for the clerk and a guinea for his nose which i verily believe is broken in the bridge i have had great trouble your reverence in conveying so large a party safe and indeed i thought at one time the rev mr arkwell would have had them all but the gallant gentlemen knew what was best for them and so your honour with a nose the doctor shook his head and interrupted any further explanation that would indeed have been a misfortune for these brave fellows come roger collect the fees and to business with what speed we may now then said roger roughly money first business afterwards no fee no marriage pay up my lads the men lugged out handfuls of gold from their pockets and paid without hesitation what they were told but the women grumbled saying that for half a crown and a dram they would have been married quite as well and so much more to spend when the doctor had put the fees in his pocket he advanced to the table and took up the prayer book what would my father have said had he witnessed this sight then roger pulled out his greasy book and put himself in place ready to say the responses all being ready the doctor again banged the table with his fist so that they all jumped and the women screamed again and more plaster fell off the wall now all of you he roared listen to me the first man who interrupts the first woman who laughs the first who giggles the first who dares to misbehave or to bring contempt on this religious ceremony i will with my own clerical hands pitch headforemost into the street and he shall remain unmarried whether they were awed by his great voice and terrible aspect the men being short of stature as all sailors seem to be or whether they feared to be pitched through the window or whether they trembled at the prospect of remaining unmarried perhaps for life if the doctor refused to perform the ceremony i know not what is quite certain is that they one and all men and women became suddenly as mute as mice and perfectly obedient to the commands of roger the clerk who told them where to stand when to kneel what to say and what to do a curtain ring acted as wedding ring for all the doctor would omit nothing from the service which he read from beginning to end in his loud musical voice when he had married the whole six he shut the prayer book produced six stamped certificates rapidly filled in the names and dates which he also entered in his register a great book with parchment cover roger acted as witness then the brides were presented by the doctor with the certificates of their marriage the ceremony lasted altogether about half an hour you are now ladies and gentlemen he said smiling pleasantly married fast and firm one to the other i congratulate you marriage in the case of sailors and sailors' wives is a condition of peculiar happiness as you will all of you presently discover the husband at the outset is liable for the debts of his wife here the men looked sheepishly at each other this no doubt will be brought home to all of you there are several brave gentlemen of the sea now languishing in the fleet prison through inability to pay off these encumbrances they will continue to lie there for the whole term of their lives these unfortunate men husbands are also liable for the debts incurred by their wives while they are abroad here one or two of the men murmured something about london port and giving it a wide berth which i did not understand as for the wives of seafaring men their blessings and privileges are also peculiar and numerous they will have to remain at home and pray for the safety of the husbands whom they will see perhaps once every five years or so they will in this widowed state be able to practise many christian virtues which those who enjoy the constant presence of a husband are less often called upon to illustrate such are patience under privation resignation and hope most of them will find the allowance made to them by their husbands insufficient or irregularly paid if any of them marry again or be already married it is let me tell you a hanging matter yea there are already in newgate hard by several unfortunate women cast for execution who have married again while their husbands were at sea lying in the cells they are waiting for the cart and the gallows here the women looked at one another and trembled while their cheeks grew pale it is too late now should there be any woman here who has committed the crime of bigamy let that woman know that it is too late for aught but repentance the gallows awaits her you are now therefore my friends bound to each other i trust and hope that these marriages have not been hastily or lightly entered upon you have heard the duties of husband to wife and wife to husband in the words of the service duly read to you by a clergyman of the church of england go now perform those duties be bright and shining examples of temperance fidelity and virtue should any man among you find that his marriage hath led him through such a cause as i have indicated to the king's bench or the fleet or the compter should he have to exchange against his will the free air of the sea for the confinement of a gaol and the rolling deck for the narrow courtyard should he see himself reduced having never learned any handicraft or trade to starvation through these liabilities of his wife or should any woman among you have hereafter to stand her trial for bigamy either for this work newly accomplished or for any future crime of the same nature it will then be your comfort to reflect that you were not married by an irregular self constituted self styled fleet parson but by an ordained clergyman and a doctor of divinity wherefore i wish you well now go less noisily than you came but the noise i impute to your ignorance as not knowing the quality of the man into whose presence you so rudely pushed as for the marriage feast see that you enjoy it in moderation above all let your liquors be good to which end i speak it purely out of my benevolence and for the good of head and stomach you will find the rum at the bishop blaize cheap and wholesome be not tempted to prefer the rainbow or the naked boy where the liquor is deplorable and perhaps in an hour or so i may look in and drink your healths roger turn them out they went away sheepish and crestfallen who had come noisy and triumphant i was ashamed thinking of my father and yet lost in wonder looking at my uncle who had so easily tamed this savage crew i am glad said the doctor when they had gone that this chance did not become the windfall of an irregular and unlicensed practitioner they cannot say that i warned them not well let them have their way a few days more and the men will be afloat again all their money gone and the women will they starve sir i asked i doubt it much he replied come child i have a thought of a plan for thee follow me and you good woman come with us that you may see your charge in safety the thing that i had seen was like a dream the appearance of the disorderly sailors and the women whom they married the words of the service read solemnly in this unhallowed room the exaction of the money beforehand the bleeding faces and marks of the recent fight the exhortation of the doctor the disappearance of the actors the swollen nose black eye and the importance of the clerk reading the responses what strange place was this whereunto i had been led one pitied too the poor fellows on whom fate had bestowed such wives i thought child as i was how terrible must be life encumbered with such women womanlike i was harder on the women than the men yet truly women are what men make them follow me child he led us out of the house turning to the right in the market was a lot of country people who were standing about a stall and we heard a voice there's the doctor there goes the great dr shovel my uncle drew himself up to his full height and stalked grandly along with the eyes of the people upon him see he seemed to say by the swelling folds of his gown see my fame how widespread it is my reputation how great he stopped at the corner of fleet lane where the houses were no longer taverns and announcements of marriages were no longer to be seen it was a house of three stories high with a door which like all the doors in that neighbourhood stood ever open here the doctor stopped and addressed mrs gambit you spoke of safety i am about to confide this child to the care of two gentlewomen poor but of good birth and character whom unjust laws and the wickedness of men have condemned to imprisonment i know of no better guardians but you shall satisfy yourself before you go away wait a moment while i confer with the ladies we stayed below for ten minutes then my uncle came down the stairs and bade me return with him to be presented to the ladies who had kindly accepted the charge on condition he said of my good conduct i followed him mrs gambit keeping close to me we stopped at a door on the first floor the room was poor and shabby the furniture of which there was not much was old and worn there was no carpet a white blind was half drawn over the window the place to judge by the presence of a saucepan a kettle and a gridiron was apparently a kitchen as well as a sitting room all except a great portrait of a gentleman in majestic wig and splendid gown which hung over the fireplace was mean and pinched two ladies of fifty or thereabouts stood before me holding out hands of welcome they were both exactly alike being small and thin with hollow cheeks bright eyes and pointed features like a pair of birds they wore white caps a sort of grey frock in cheap stuff their hair was white their hands were thin with delicate fingers transparent like the fingers of those who have been long in bed with sickness they were of the same height and appeared to be of the same age namely fifty or thereabouts my first thought as i looked at them was that they had not enough to eat which indeed like all first thoughts was correct because that had generally been the case with these poor creatures kitty said the doctor taking me by the hand i present you to mrs esther pimpernel here the lady on the left dipped and curtsied and i also mighty grave and to mrs deborah pimpernel here the same ceremony with the lady on the right ladies this is my niece kitty pleydell daughter of my deceased sister barbara and her husband lawrence pleydell of pious memory i trust that in consenting thus generously to receive this child in your ward and keeping you will find a reward for your benevolence in her obedience docility and gratitude doctor murmured mrs esther in a voice like a turtledove's for softness i am sure that a niece of yours must be all sensibility and goodness goodness at least said her sister in sharper tones i saw that the difference between the sisters lay chiefly in their voices she will i trust be serviceable to you said the doctor waving his hand she hath been well and piously brought up to obedient ways under your care ladies i look for a good account of her dear and reverend sir mrs esther cooed we are pleased and happy to be of use to you in this matter no doubt little miss who is well grown of her years will repay your kindness with her prayers as for us the memory of your past and present goodness tut tut he replied shaking his great head till his cheeks waggled let us hear no more of that in this place here he laid his right hand upon his heart elevating his left and leaning his head to one side in this place where infamy and well deserved misery attend most of those who dwell in it it is yours as it should be mine to keep burning continually the pure flame of a christian life how sweet how noble murmured the sisters was it possible the man whom we had just seen reading the service of mother church which my father had taught me to regard as little less sacred than the words of the bible itself in a squalid room reeking with the fumes of rum and stale tobacco before a gang of half drunken sailors assumed naturally and easily as if it belonged to him the attitude and language of one devoted entirely to the contemplation and practice of virtue and good works why his face glowed with goodness like the sun at noonday or the sun after a shower or say the sun after a good action the doctor indeed as i learned later could assume almost any character he pleased it pleased him not out of hypocrisy but because for a time it was a return to the promise of his youth to be with these ladies the devout christian priest in that character he felt i am convinced the words which came spontaneously to his lips for the moment he was that character outside in the fleet market he was the great dr shovel great because among the fleet parsons he was the most successful the most learned the most eloquent the most important in his own room he married all comers after the manner we have seen and it raised the envy of his rivals to see how the crowd flocked to him but in the evening he received his friends and drank and talked with them in such fashion as i never saw but of which i have heard again it raised their envy to witness how men came from all quarters to drink with the doctor at that time he was no longer the christian advocate nor the clergyman he was a rollicking jovial boon companion who delighted to tell better stories sing better songs and hold better talk meaning more witty not more spiritual talk than any of those who sat with him i have never been able to comprehend what pleasure men especially men of mature years can find in telling stories and laughing drinking smoking tobacco and singing with one another women find their pleasures in more sober guise they may lie in small things but they are innocent think what this world would be were the women to live like the men as disorderly as wastefully as noisily now good woman said my uncle to mrs gambit are you satisfied that my niece is in safe hands the hands are good enough replied the woman looking round her but the place the place is what it is said the doctor sharply we cannot alter the place then i will go sir with that she gave me my parcel of money kissed me and bade me farewell curtsied to the ladies and left us i shall send up ladies said the doctor a few trifles of additional furniture a couple of chairs one of them an arm chair but not for this great strong girl if you please a bed a shelf for books some cups and saucers we shall provide for you and now ladies i wish you good morning and for your present wants i mean the wants of this hungry country maid who looks as if mutton hung in toothsome legs on every verdant hedge this will i think suffice he placed money in mrs esther's hand i could not but think how he had earned that money and left us when he was gone the two ladies looked at each other with a strange sad and wistful expression and mrs esther with the guineas in her hand burst into tears chapter vi how kitty began to enjoy the liberties of the fleet her tears disconcerted me extremely what did she cry for but she presently recovered and dried her eyes then she looked at me thoughtfully and said sister i suppose this child has been accustomed to have a dinner every day surely replied mrs deborah and to day we shall dine to day we should all dine were there then days when we should all go hungry you must know my dear mrs esther explained in a soft sad voice that we are very poor we have therefore on many days in a week to go without meat otherwise we should have to do worse she looked round the room and shuddered we should have to give up the independence of our solitude hunger my child is not the worst thing to bear a piece of roasting beef sister said mrs deborah who had now assumed a hat and a cloak with a summer cabbage and a pudding in the gravy and i think sister said mrs esther her eyes lighting up eagerly that we might take our dinner the child might like to take her dinner at twelve to day while mrs deborah went into the market i learned that the two sisters had taken no food except bread and water for a week and that their whole stock now amounted to two shillings in money and part of a loaf what a strange world was this of london in which gentlewomen had their lodging in so foul a place and starved on bread and water but she repeated with a wan smile there are worse things than hunger first we must pay our rent and here we are at least alone here we may continue to remember our breeding before mrs deborah returned i also learned that they were chiefly dependent on a cousin for supplies of money which were made to them grudgingly and indeed he was not rich and that the doctor had provided for my maintenance with the offer of so large a weekly sum that it promised to suffice for the wants of all we are said mrs esther but small eaters a little will suffice for us but you child are young eat without fear eat your fill the money is for you and we shall grudge you nothing while the beef was roasting i noticed how their eyes from time to time in spite of themselves would be fixed upon the meat with a hungry and eager look nor had i any enjoyment of the meal till i had seen their pangs appeased after the plenty of the vicarage and the hall to think of bread and water and not too much bread for days together yet hungry as they were they ate but little it shamed me to go on eating being always a girl of a vigorous appetite and hard set about the hour of noon it shamed me at first also to observe their ways of thrift so that not the least crumb should be wasted mrs deborah read my thoughts in this place she said we learn to value what it takes money to procure yet there are some here poorer than ourselves eat child eat for us this has been indeed a feast of belteshazzar dinner over we unpacked my box and they asked me questions i found that they were proud of their birth and breeding the portrait over the fire was they told me that of their father once lord mayor of london and they congratulated me upon being myself a pleydell which they said was a name very well known in the country although many great city families might be ignorant of it no gift my dear said mrs esther is so precious as gentle blood everything else may be won but birth never all day long there went on the same dreadful noise of shouting crying calling bawling rolling of carts cracking of whips and trampling of horses' feet in the evening i asked when the sun went down but the noise decreased not if it was always thus always they replied there is no cessation day or night it is part said mrs deborah of our punishment we are condemned child for the sin of having a negligent trustee we go in captivity shame and degradation all our lives nay said her sister not degradation sister no one but herself can degrade a gentlewoman truly the noise was terrible when i read in the paradise lost of fallen angels in their dark abode i think of fleet market and the fleet rules it began in the early morning with the rolling of the carts all day long in the market there was a continual crying of the butchers buy buy ladies buy rally up ladies rally up there were quarrels unceasing and ever beginning with fights shouting and cursing the fish women quarrelled at their stalls the poultry wives quarrelled over their baskets the porters quarrelled over their burdens the carters over the right of way the ragamuffin boys over stolen fruit there was nothing pleasant nothing quiet nothing to refresh nothing but noise brawling and contention and if any signs of joy these only drunken laughter from open tavern doors thus i began to live being then a maid of sixteen years and seven months in the rules and liberties of the fleet prison surely as bad a place outside newgate prison as could be found for a girl brought up in innocence and virtue for let one consider the situation of the rules they include all those houses which lie between the ditch or rather the market on the west and the old bailey on the east fit boundaries for such a place the filthy turbid ditch and the criminal's gaol and fleet lane on the north to ludgate hill on the south these streets are beyond and between the abodes of respectability and industry on the east was the great and wealthy city with the merchants' houses on the west the streets and squares where the families of the country had their town residence on the south the river on the north the dark and gloomy streets of clerkenwell where thieves lay in hiding and the robbers of the road had their customary quarters why jonathan wyld himself the greatest of villains lived hard by in ship court is there anywhere in any town an acre more thickly covered with infamy misery starvation and wretchedness if we walked abroad we could not go north because of clerkenwell where no honest woman may trust herself if we went south we had to walk the whole length of the market past the marrying taverns so that shame fell upon my heart to think how my uncle was one of those who thus disgraced his cloth when we got to the end we might walk over the fleet bridge among the noisy sellers of quack medicines pills powders hot furmety pies flounders mackerel and oysters or on ludgate hill where the touts of the fleet parsons ran up and down inviting couples to be married and the morocco men went about book in hand to sell their lottery shares the most quiet way when we took the air was to cross holborn bridge and so up the hill past st andrew's church where if the weather were fine we might go as far as the gardens of gray's inn and there sit down among the trees and feel for a little the joy of silence said mrs deborah one day when we two had sat there under the trees for half an hour listening to the cawing of the rooks child the place meaning the rules is the city of destruction after christian and christiana and the boys and mercy were all gone away we lived in one room which was both kitchen and parlour we had no servant the doctor's provision kept us in simple plenty we cleaned and dusted the place for ourselves we cooked our dinners and washed our dishes we made our dresses we did for ourselves all those things which are generally done by a servant mrs esther said that there was no shame in doing things which if left undone would cause a gentlewoman to lose her self respect 'twas all except the portrait of her father that she had left of her former life and to this she would cling as something dearer than life there were other lodgers in the house all who lodged there were of course prisoners enjoying the rules who else would live in the place on the ground floor was sir miles lackington baronet he was not yet thirty yet he had already got rid of a great and noble estate by means of gambling and now was compelled to hide his head in this refuge and to live upon an allowance of two guineas made weekly to him by a cousin this one would have thought was a disgrace enough to overwhelm a gentleman of his rank and age with shame but it touched him not for he was ever gay cheerful and ready to laugh he was kind to my ladies and to me his manners when he was sober were gentle though his face was always flushed and cheeks swollen by reason of his midnight potations he was still a handsome fellow he was careless of his appearance as of his fortune he would go with waistcoat unbuttoned wig awry neckcloth loose ruffles limp but however he went it was with a laugh when he received his two guineas he generally gave away the half among his friends in the evening they used to carry him home to his room on the ground floor too drunk to stand i soon got to know him and we had frequent talks he seemed to be ever meeting me on the stairs when i went a marketing he called upon us often and would sit with me during the warm summer afternoons when the sisters dropped off to sleep i grew to like him and he encouraged me to say freely what i thought even to the extent of rating him for his profligate practices why he would say laughing i am at the lowest i can go no lower yet i have my two guineas a week i have enough to eat i drink freely what more can i want i told him what his life seemed to me he laughed again at this but perhaps uneasily does it seem so terrible a thing he said leaning against the window with his hands in his pockets to have no cares believe me kitty fortune has brought me into a harbour where winds and tempests never blow while i had my estate my conscience plagued me night and morning and yet i knew that all this must fly hazard doth always serve her children so and leaves them naked well it is gone so can i play no more but he who plays should keep sober if he would win now that i cannot play i may drink and again when formerly i was rich and a prodigal friend and enemy came to me with advice i believe they thought the book of proverbs had been written specially to meet my case so much did they quote the words of solomon agar and lemuel but no doubt there have been fools before and truly it helpeth a fool no whit to show him his folly 'as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouth of fools' i remember that proverb now that hazard hath taken all there is no longer occasion for advice child you look upon one who hath thrown away his life and yet is happier in his fall and repents not for i make no doubt but that had i my fortune back 'twould fly away again in the same fashion he concluded with an allusion to the enemy of mankind for which i rebuked him and he laughed saying pretty puritan i will offend no more had i been older and more experienced i should have known or suspected why he came so often and met me daily kitty had found favour in the sight of this dethroned king he loved the maid her freshness her rosy cheeks her youth her innocence pleased him i suppose we know not we women for what qualities there are in us that we are loved by men so that they will commit so many follies for our sake thou art such a girl sweet kitty he said to me one day so pretty and so good as would tempt a man wallowing contentedly in the pigsties of the world to get up wash himself and go cleanly for thy sake yet what a miserable wretch should i be did i thus learn to feel my own downfall and again he told me once that he was too far gone to love me and not far enough gone to do me an injury wherefore he added i must worship at thy shrine in silent admiration it was kindly done of sir miles to spare an ignorant girl for so ignorant was kitty and so brotherly did he seem that had he asked her to become his wife i think she would have consented oh the fine state to be my lady lackington and to live in the rules of the fleet another lodger in our house a man whose face inspired me with horror so full of selfish passion was it was a captain dunquerque with him were his wife and children it was of the children poor things that our esther spoke when she said there were some in the place poorer than themselves for the wife and children starved while the captain their father ate and drank his fill a gloomy man as well as selfish who reviled the fate which he had brought upon himself yet for all his reviling he spared himself nothing so that his children might have something i am glad that this bad man has little to do with my history another lodger who had the garret at the top was solomon stallabras the poet it is very well known that the profession of letters of all the trades callings and conditions of men is the most precarious and the most miserable i doubt indeed whether that ought to be called a profession which requires no training no colleges or schools no degree and no diploma other professions are in a way independent the barrister doth not court though he may depend upon the favour of attorneys the rector of the parish doth not ask the farmers to support him but takes the tithes to which he is entitled the poor author however is obliged to receive of his publisher whatever is offered nor is there any corporate body or guild of authors by whom the situation of the poet may be considered and his condition improved alone among learned men the author is doomed to perpetual dependence and poverty indeed when one considers it scarce anything else is to be expected for in becoming an author a man is so vain as to expect that to him will be granted what has been given to no man except shakespeare a continual flow of strength spirits ingenuity wit and dexterity so as to sustain without diminution or relaxation the rapid production of works for the delight of the world i say rapid because the books are bought by publishers at a low rate though they are sold to the public at large sums and if we think of it scarce any author produces more than one or two books which please the world therefore when the fountain runs dry whither is that poor author to turn the public will have none of him his publisher will have none of him there remains it is true one hope and that unworthy to get subscriptions for a volume which he will never produce because he will have eaten up beforehand the money paid for it before it is written the fleet prison and its rules have always been a favourite resort and refuge for poets and men of letters robert lloyd died there but long after i went away richard savage died there churchill was married in the place and would have died there had he not anticipated his certain fate by dying early samuel boyce died there sir richard baker died there william oldys who died to be sure outside the rules yet drank every night within them lastly within a stone's throw of the rules though he was never a prisoner died the great john bunyan himself i heard my ladies from time to time talk of a certain mr stallabras they wondered why he did not call as usual and laid the blame upon me little madam had made him shy one day however mrs esther being called out by one of captain dunquerque's children came back presently saying that mr stallabras was starving to death in his room mrs deborah made no reply but instantly hurried to the cupboard when she took down the cold beef which was to be our dinner and cut off three or four goodly slices these she laid on a plate with bread and salt and put the whole upon a napkin and then she disappeared swiftly the poor young man the dear young man cried mrs esther wringing her hands what can we do my dear the sweetest and most mellifluous of poets the pride and glory of his age it was he who wrote 'hours of the night' the 'pleasures of solitude' the 'loves of amoret and amoretta' and other delightful verses yet they let him languish in the fleet what are my countrymen thinking of would it not be better to rescue while still living so ingenious and charming a writer from his poverty than to give him as they must after his death a grave in westminster abbey i asked her if we should read together these delightful poems we have no copy she said mr stallabras who is all sensibility insists from time to time upon our having copies so that we may read them aloud to him yet his necessities are such that he is fain to take them away again and sell them as for his manners my dear they are very fine being such as to confer distinction upon the rules he has not the easy bearing of sir miles lackington of course which one would not expect save in a man born to good breeding but he possesses in full measure the courtesy which comes from study and self dignity yet he is but a hosier's son mrs deborah here returned bearing an empty plate she had trouble at first she said to persuade him to eat his prejudices as a gentleman and a scholar were offended by the absence of horse radish but as he had eaten nothing for two days he was induced to waive this scruple and presently made a hearty meal she had also persuaded him to come downstairs in the evening and take a dish of tea thanks to the doctor's liberality in the matter of my weekly board tea was now a luxury in which we could sometimes indulge nothing gave mrs esther more gratification than the return after long deprivation to that polite beverage at about five o'clock the poet made his appearance he was short of stature with a turned up nose and was dressed in a drab coloured coat with bag wig and shoes with steel buckles everything that he wore had once been fine but their splendour was faded now his linen was in rags his shoes in holes but he carried himself with pride his dignity did not depend upon his purse he bore his head high because he thought of his fame it inflicted no wound to his pride to remember that he had that day been on the eve of starvation and was still without a farthing miss kitty he said bowing very low you see before you one who though a favourite of the muses is no favourite of fortune ''gainst hostile fate his heart is calm the while though fortune frown the tuneful sisters smile' poetry ladies brings with it the truest consolation and religion said mrs esther there lives not be sure the wretch cried the poet who would dissociate religion and the muse this was very grand and pleased us all we had our dish of tea with bread and butter i went on cutting it for the poet till the loaf was quite gone during the evening he gave utterance to many noble sentiments so noble indeed that they seemed to me taken out of books and before he went away he laid down his views as to the profession of letters of which i have already spoken perhaps too severely it is the mission of the poet and author he said to delight and to improve while delighting the man of science may instruct the poet embodies the knowledge and dresses it up in a captivating way to attract the people the divine teaches the dogmas of the church the poet conveys in more pleasing form the lessons and instructions of religion the philosopher and moralist lay down the laws of our being the author by tropes and figures by fiction by poetry shows the proper conduct of life and teaches how the way of virtue leads to happiness is not this a noble and elevating career does not a man do well who says to himself 'this shall be my life this my lot' he paused and we murmured assent to his enthusiasm it is true he went on that the ungrateful world thinks little of its best friends that it allows me me solomon stallabras to languish in the rules of the fleet even that however has its consolation because ladies it has brought me the honour and happiness of your friendship he rose saluted us all three in turn and sat down again art he went on so inspires a man with great thoughts that it makes more than a gentleman it makes a nobleman of him who i would ask when he reads the sorrows of clarissa thinks of the trade the mere mechanical trade in which the author's money was earned i cannot but believe that the time will come when the court itself unfriendly as it now is to men of letters will confer titles and place upon that poor poet whose very name cannot now reach the walls of the palace my ladies' good fortune i mean in receiving the weekly stipend for my maintenance was thus shared by the starving poet whom they no longer saw helpless to relieve him suffering the privation of hunger often have i observed one or other of the sisters willingly go without her dinner pleading a headache in order that her portion might be reserved for mr stallabras for sensibility said mrs esther is like walking up a hill it promotes appetite so does youth said mrs deborah more practical mr stallabras is still a young man kitty though you think thirty old that he was a very great poet we all agreed and the more so when after a lucky letter he secured a subscriber or two for his next volume and was able to present us once more with a book of his own poetry i do not know whether he more enjoyed hearing me read them aloud for then he bowed spread his hands and inclined his head this way and that in appreciation of the melody and delicacy of the sentiments or whether he preferred to read them himself for then he could stop when he pleased with this idea ladies was conceived while wandering amid the fields near bagnigge wells this came to me while watching the gay throng in the mall this i confess was an inspiration caught in church kitty should enter these confessions in a book said mrs esther surely they will become valuable in the day far distant i trust when your life has to be written mr stallabras oh madam he bowed again and lifted his hands in deprecation but he was pleased perhaps he said meaner bards have found a place in the abbey and a volume dedicated to their lives if miss kitty will condescend to thus preserve recollections of me i shall be greatly flattered i did keep a book and entered in it all that dropped from his lips about himself his opinions his maxims his thoughts and so forth he gradually got possessed of the idea that i would myself some day write his life and he began insensibly to direct his conversation mainly to me sometimes he met me in the market or on the stairs when he would tell me more i always knew he said from the very first that i was born to greatness it was in me as a child when like pope i lisped in numbers my station originally was not lofty miss kitty he spoke as if he had risen to a dazzling height i was but the son of a hosier born in fetter lane and taught at the school or academy kept by one jacob crooks who was handier with the rod than with the gradus ad parnassum but i read and taught myself became at first the hack of mr dodsley and gradually rose to eminence he had indeed risen he was the occupant of a garret his fame lay in his own imagination and he had not a guinea in the world miss kitty he said one day there is only one thing that disqualifies you from being my biographer i asked him what that was you are not as you should be my wife if virtue and beauty fitted you for the station of a poet's wife the thing were easy alas child the poet is poor and his mistress would be poorer nevertheless believe that the means and not the will are wanting to make thee my laura my stella and me thy petrarch or thy sidney it was not till later that i understood how this starveling poet as well as the broken baronet had both expressed their desire under more favourable circumstances to make love to me grand would have been my lot as lady lackington but grander still as mistress stallabras wife of the illustrious poet who lived like the sparrows from hand to mouth chapter vii how kitty learned to know the doctor those evenings of riot from which sir miles was so often carried home speechless were spent in no other place than that very room where i had seen the marriage of the sailors and the president of the rabble rout was no other than the doctor himself i learned this of sir miles if my ladies knew it of which i am not certain they were content to shut their eyes to it and to think of the thing as one of the faults which women in contempt and pity ascribe to the strange nature of man i cannot being now of ripe years believe that heaven hath created in man a special aptitude for debauchery sin and profligacy while women have been designed for the illustration of virtues which are the opposite to them so that when i hear it said that it is the way of men i am apt to think that way sinful it was sir miles himself who told me of it one morning i found him leaning against the doorpost with a tankard of ale in his hand fie sir miles i said is it not shameful for a gentleman to be carried home at night like a pig it is he replied kitty the morning is the time for repentance i repent until i have cleared my brain with this draught of cool october it is as if a man should drag a napkin in the mud of the fleet ditch to clean it i said he drank off his tankard and said he felt better pretty miss kitty he said it is a fine morning shall we abroad will you trust yourself with me to view the shops in cheapside or the beaux in the mall i am at thy service though for a norfolk baronet my ruffles are of the shabbiest i told him that i would ask mrs esther for permission he said he wanted first a second pint as the evening had been long and the drink abundant after which his brain would be perfectly clear and his hand steady i told him it was a shame that a gentleman of his rank should mate with men whose proper place was among the thieves of turnmill street or the porters of chick lane and that i would not walk with a man whose brain required a quart of strong ale in the morning to clear it as for my companions he said taking the second pint which the boy brought him and turning it about in his hands we have very good company in the liberties quite as good as your friend christian in that story you love so much might have had in vanity fair had he been a lad of mettle and a toper there are gentlemen of good family like myself poets like solomon stallabras merchants half pay captains and broke lieutenants clerks tradesmen lawyers parsons farmers men of all degrees it is like the outside world except that here all are equal who can pay their shot why with the doctor at the head of the table and a bowl of punch just begun hang me if i know any place where a man may feel more comfortable or drink more at his ease the doctor i asked now i had seen so little of my uncle that i had almost forgotten the marriage of the sailors and was beginning again to think of him as the pious and serious minister who spoke of sacred things to my guardians the doctor ay sir miles drank off the whole of his second pint who else his voice became suddenly thick and his eyes fixed with a strange light in them who else but the doctor why what would the rules be without the doctor he is our prince our bishop our chaplain what you will the right reverend his most gracious majesty the king of the rules sir miles waved his hand dramatically he keeps us sweet he polishes our wits but for him we should be wallowing swine he brings strangers and visitors to enliven us drinks with us sings with us makes wit for us from the treasures of his learning condescends to call us his friends pays our shot for us lends us money gives food to the starving and drink yes drink by gad to the thirsty and clothes to the naked ah poor girl you can never see the doctor in his glory with all his admirers round him and every man a glass of punch in his hand and a clean tobacco pipe in his mouth the doctor he is our boast a most complete and perfect doctor the pride of cambridge the crown and sum of all doctors in divinity he had forgotten i suppose his invitation to take me for a walk for he left me here staggering off in the direction of the hand and pen where i doubt not he spent the rest of his idle and wasted day it would have been useless and cruel to talk to my guardian about this discovery it was another thing to be ashamed of sir miles told me less than the truth in fact the doctor's house was the nightly resort of all those residents in the rules whom he would admit to his society hither too came attracted by his reputation for eloquence wit and curious knowledge gentlemen from the temple lincoln's inn and other places who were expected as a contribution to the evening to send for bowls of punch but of this presently i saw my uncle seldom he visited the sisters from time to time and never failed to ask particularly after my progress in knowledge and especially in the doctrines of the church of england on these occasions he generally left behind him as a present some maxim or precept tending to virtue which we could repeat after his departure and turn over in our minds at leisure once he found me alone mrs deborah being indisposed and confined to her room where her sister was nursing her he took advantage of their absence to impress upon me the necessity of circumspection in my manner of life heaven knows child he said what thy future will be hither come none but profligates and spendthrifts yet what else can i do with thee where bestow thee oh sir i said let me not be taken from my dear ladies thou shalt not child at least for the present but it is bad for thee to live here it is bad for thee to have as an uncle one whose life is sadly inconsistent with his christian profession and who might despair were it not for the example of solomon methinks from his history may be sucked consolation by all elderly and reverend sinners like him what i lack in practice i partly make up with precept he who like me is a fleet parson should be judged differently from his fellows he is without the license and therefore hath forfeited paternal affection of his bishop he is exposed to temptations which beset not other folk among those who flock to him for marriage are some who would fain commute their fees for brandy and strong drinks or even bilk the clergyman altogether a sin which it is difficult to believe can be forgiven hence arise strifes and wraths unseemly for one who wears a cassock hither come those who seek good fellowship and think to find it in the rules templars young bloods and wits hence arise drinking and brawling and as one is outside the law so to speak so one is tempted to neglect the law i say nothing of the temptations of an empty purse these i felt with many prickings and instigations of the evil one while i was yet curate of st martin's in the fields before i escaped my creditors by coming here then i was poor and found as the wise man says that 'the poor is hated even of his own neighbour' he went on half preaching half talking a man who sinned greatly yet preached much who daily fell yet daily exhorted his neighbour to stand upright who knew and loved as one loves a thing impossible to attain the life of virtue who drank laughed and bawled songs of an evening with his boon companions who married all comers no questions asked without scruple and without remorse a priest whose life was a disgrace to his profession who did kind and generous things and paid that homage to virtue which becomes one who knows her loveliness it pleased him to talk but only with me about himself he was always excusing himself to me ashamed of his life yet boasting of it and glorying in it conscious of his infamy and yet proud of his success always thinking by what plea he could justify himself and maintain his self respect i am a man he said who is the best of a bad profession my work is inglorious but i am glorious my rivals who would rob me of my very practice do not hate me but esteem and envy me i have yea outside these rules friends who love me still some of them pity me and some would see me which is impossible restored to the fold and bosom of the church some who drink with me talk with me borrow of me walk with me smoke with me and are honoured by my friendship there is no man living who would wish me harm surely i am one of those who do good to themselves whom therefore their fellow men respect i have said that he was generous sir miles spoke the truth when he declared that the doctor fed the starving and clothed the naked truly it seems to me natural to believe that these good deeds of his must be a set off to the great wickedness of his life there were no occupants of the prison and its liberties who were rich some there were who would have starved but for the charity of their friends the poor prisoners were allowed to beg but how could poor gentlewomen like my guardians bear to beg for daily bread rather would they starve as for the prison i know nothing of it i never saw the inside it was enough for me to see its long and dreary wall i used to think at night of the poor creatures shut up there in hopeless misery as i thought though sir miles declared that most of them were happier in the prison than out and beside the latticed gate there stood every day a man behind bars begging with a plate and crying pity the poor prisoners is it not sad that the same punishment of imprisonment must be meted out to the rogue and the debtor save that we let the rogue go free while we keep the debtor locked up truly the vicar of st bride's or even the dean of st paul's himself could preach no better sermon could use no words more fitted to arrest the profligate and bring the thoughtless to reason than that doleful cry behind the bars nor could any more salutary lesson be impressed upon young spendthrifts than to take them from house to house in the rules and show them the end of graceless ways chapter viii how kitty spent her time as soon as they were settled together and the ladies had decided in their own minds that the girl would lighten their lives they resolved that kitty's education must not be neglected and for this end began to devise such a comprehensive scheme as would have required the staff of a whole university to carry it through everything was set down upon a slate which it behoved a girl to know unfortunately the means at their disposal did not allow of this great scheme thus it was fitting that music should be taught mrs deborah had once been a proficient on the spinnet but there was no spinnet to be had the french tongue forms part of polite education but though both ladies had learned it of old their memory was defective and they had neither dictionary nor grammar nor any book in the language limning both with pencil and in water colours should be taught but the sisters could neither of them draw and hardly knew a curve from a straight line calligraphy is almost a necessary but the handwriting of both ladies was tremulous and of antiquated fashion they knew not the modern italian hand there was in the rules a professor in the art and an attempt was made to get lessons from him but he was already old and hastening to the grave which speedily closed over him his hand shook because he drank strong waters his coat was stained with beer and punch his wig smelt always of tobacco mrs deborah undertook as a beginning to teach the girl book keeping by single and double entry how or why she ever came to learn this science has never been understood yet she knew it and was proud of it it is a science she said which controls the commerce of the world by its means are we made rich by the aid of book keeping we apportion the profit and the loss which are the rewards of the prudent or the punishment of the thriftless without book keeping my dear the mysteries and methods of which i am about to impart to you neither a whittington nor a gresham nor even a pimpernel would have risen to be lord mayor of london kitty only imperfectly grasped the rudiments of this science no doubt had she been placed in a position of life where it was required she would have found it eminently useful mrs esther for her part taught her embroidery and sampler work as for preserving pickling making of pastry and home made wines cookery distilling and so forth although the sisters had been in their younger days notable it was impossible to teach these arts because even if there had been anything to pickle or preserve there was only one sitting room in which to do it therefore to her present sorrow kitty speedily forgot all that she had formerly learned in the still room at lady levett's for there is no station so exalted in which a lady is not the better for knowing the way in which such things should be done if it is only that she may keep her maids in order and if as the learned dr johnson hath informed us a lady means one who dispenses gifts of hospitality and kindness there is another reason why she should know the value of her gifts there is something divine in the contemplation of the allotment of duty to the two sexes man must work build up invent and acquire for woman to distribute administer and divide as for reading they had a book on the history of england with the cover off and wanting the title page with several chapters there was one of those still remaining in which the author exhorted his readers her teachers told the girl that the admonition belonged to women as well as men never to grow faint or to weary in the defence of their liberties she ignorantly confounded the liberties of the country with the liberties of the fleet and could not avoid the reflection that a woman would certainly put more heart into her defence of the liberties if these were cleaner and if there were fewer men who swore and got drunk there were also a bible and a church prayer book there were three odd volumes of sermons and there were besides odd volumes of romances poems and other works which mr solomon stallabras was able to lend mrs deborah added to her knowledge of book keeping some mastery over the sublime science of astronomy by standing on chairs at the window when the west wind blew the fogs away and the sky was clear it was possible to learn nearly everything that she had to teach the moon was sometimes visible and a great many of the stars because looking over the market the space was wide among them were the pole star the great bear orion's belt and cassiopeia's chair it was elevating to the soul on such occasions to watch the heavenly bodies and to listen while mrs deborah discoursed on the motions of the planets and the courses of the stars the moon my dear she would say originally hung in the heavens by the hand of the creator goes regularly every four weeks round the sun while the sun goeth daily round the earth when the sun is between the earth and the moon which happens accidentally once a month or thereabouts part of the latter body is eclipsed wherefore it is then of a crescent shape the earth itself goes round something i forget what every year while the planets according to addison's hymn go once a year or perhaps he meant once a month round the moon this is the reason why they are seen in different positions in the sky and i believe i am right in saying that if you look steadily at the great bear you may plainly see that every night it travels once about the earth at least or it may be oftener at different seasons when we reflect here she quoted from recollection that these bodies are so far distant from us that we cannot measure the space between that some of them are supposed to be actually greater than our own world that they are probably inhabited by men and women like ourselves that all their movements round each other are regular uniform never intermittent how ought we to admire the wisdom and strength of the almighty hand which placed them there then she repeated with becoming reverence the words of mr addison the christian poet beginning soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of her birth while all the stars that round her burn and all the planets in their turn confirm the tidings as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole in such meditations and exercises did these imprisoned ladies seek to raise their souls above the miseries of their lot indeed one may think there is nothing which more tends to make the mind contented and to prevent repining than to feel the vastness of nature the depth and height of knowledge open to man's intellect the smallness of one's self and the wisdom of god and although poor mrs deborah's astronomy was as has been seen a jumble although she knew so little indeed of constellations or of planets that the child did not learn to distinguish jupiter from the pole star and never could understand until that ingenious gentleman who lately exhibited an orrery in piccadilly taught her how the planets and stars could go round the moon and the moon round the sun and the sun round the earth without knocking against and destroying one another she must be and is deeply grateful for the thoughts which the good lady awakened in all things the sisters endeavoured to keep up the habits and manners of gentlefolk the dinner was at times scanty yet was it served on a fair white cloth with plates and knives orderly placed a grace before the meat and a grace after in the afternoon when the dinner was eaten the cloth removed and the plates washed they were able sometimes to sally forth and take a walk in the summer afternoons it was it has been said pleasant to walk to the gardens of gray's inn but when they ventured to pass through the market there was great choice for them the daily service in the afternoons at st paul's was close at hand here while the body was refreshed with the coolness of the air the mind was calmed with the peace of the church and the soul elevated by the chanting of the white robed choristers and the canons while the organ echoed in the roof after the service they would linger among the tombs of which there are not many and read the famous latin inscription over the door of the cathedral si monumentum requiris circumspice i knew him mrs esther would whisper standing before the great man's monument he was a friend of my father's and he often came and talked my sister and myself being then but little on the greatness of astronomy geometry and architecture in the latter years of his life he would sit in the sunshine gazing on the noble cathedral he had built yet grand as he is he would still lament that his earlier plans which were grander still had not been accepted then out into the noisy street again back to the shouts of chairmen waggon drivers coachmen the bawling of those who cried up and down pavements the cries of flying piemen newsmen boys with broadsheets dying confessions and ballads back to the clamour of fleet market another excursion which could only be undertaken when the days were long was that to westminster abbey the way lay along the strand which when the crowded houses behind st clement's and st mary's were passed was a wide and pleasant thoroughfare convenient for walking occupied by stately palaces like northumberland and somerset houses and by great shops at charing cross one might cross over into spring gardens where mrs esther said there was much idle talk among young people with drinking of rhenish wine beyond the gardens was st james's park kitty saw it once in those days being taken by sir miles lackington but so crowded was it with gallant gentlemen whose wigs and silken coats were a proper set off to the hoops and satins of the ladies that she was ashamed of her poor stuff frock and bade sir miles lead her away which he did being that day sorrowful and in a repentant mood i have myself worn those silk waistcoats and that silver lace he said with a sigh my place should be amongst them now were it not for hazard thy own fit station pretty pauper is with those ladies but heaven forbid you should learn what they know alas i knew not when i ought to stop in the path of pleasure fie said she young men ought not to find their pleasure in gambling humanity said sir miles becoming more cheerful when the park was left has with one consent resolved to follow pleasure the reverend divines bid us on sunday be content to forego pleasure in the week they too get what pleasure they can out of a punch bowl i am content to follow with other men come little puritan what is thy idea of pleasure that seemed simple enough to answer i would live in the country said she readily away from this dreadful town i would have enough money to drink tea every day of course i would have a good dinner too and to buy books to visit and be visited and make my ladies happy and all be gentlewomen together and never a man among you all no we should want no man you men do but eat drink devour and waste the rules are full of unhappy women ruined by your extravagances go live all together and carry each other home at night where no woman can see or hear he shook his head with a laugh and answered nothing that same night however he was led home at midnight bawling some drinking song at the top of his voice so that the girl's admonition had no effect upon him perhaps profligate men feel a pleasure not only in their intemperance but also in repentance it always seemed to me as if sir miles enjoyed the lamentations of a sinner the morning after a debauch on the few occasions when their journey was prolonged beyond charing cross the ladies were generally attended and protected by mr solomon stallabras who though little in stature was brave and would have cudgelled a porter or cuffed a guardsman in the defence of ladies as well as the strongest and biggest gentleman there are many other things to see in westminster abbey the coronation throne henry the seventh's chapel the monuments of kings queens great lords and noble generals but mr stallabras had an eye to one spot only there he said is the poet's corner with dryden ben jonson and the glorious dead of this spot shall perhaps my ashes be mixed ladies immortality is the poet's meed the poor man needed some solace in these days when his poverty was excessive later on he found a little success obtained an order for a volume of travels in cashmere whither he had never been which brought him in eight guineas he afterwards added a romantic tale the scene of which was laid in the same sweet abode of sensibility it was interspersed with verses as full of delicacy as the tale itself but the publisher who gave him five guineas for it complained afterwards that he had lost by his bargain mr stallabras often boasted of the great things he could do were there no publishers and regretted the invention of printing which rendered this class who prey upon the very vitals of poor poets a necessity these holidays these after hours of rest in the tranquil aisles of st paul's or the awful gothic shades of westminster were far between mostly the three sat together over their work while the tumult raged below patience child said mrs deborah patience awhile we have borne it for nigh thirty years can you who have hope not bear it a little longer said mrs esther providence wisely orders every event so that each year or each day shall add something to the education of the soul it is doubtless for some wise purpose we have been kept in scarceness among runagates and spendthrifts on sundays they generally went to the church of st giles cripplegate it was a long way from the rules but the ladies liked it because it was the church where their father lay buried from the place where they sat in the seats of the poor which have neither cushions nor backs they could read the tablet to the memory of the late joshua pimpernel once lord mayor of london and alderman of portsoken ward the great church was full of city memories dear to them from their childhood when they were girls they used to sit in a stately pew with red serge seats and hassocks now they worshipped in the same church but on the benches among the poor women and the children yet there was the same service with the rector and the clerk in their desks the schoolboys of the charity along the left and the schoolgirls of the charity along the right the beadles and vergers the old women who swept the church opened the pew doors curtsied to the quality and remained behind for doles all brought back their childhood they were as poor themselves as these old trots but they could not stay for doles it is a large and handsome church filled with grave citizens responsible men whose ventures are abroad on many seas respected for wealth and upright conduct good men and true such as was in his day my lord mayor pimpernel himself with the citizens sit their wives bravely attired and their daughters making gallant show in hoops patches lace sarsnet and muslin outside the church a graveyard piled and full still with a tree or two upon it whose boughs in june are covered with bright green leaves among which the sparrows twitter and fly about there is also a great round tower of antique look which once had been part of the roman wall of london here they went to worship when the minister came to the words in the litany lord have mercy upon all prisoners and captives the sisters would catch each other by the hand and audibly follow the reader in prayer as well as response for thirty years for fifty two sundays in each year they had made that prayer in the same words for most of the time in the same church yet what answer kitty took the prayer presently for herself as well if these ladies were prisoners why what was she if they might not sleep abroad and only walk in the streets by permission and licence of the law how was she different from them since she could not being but a maid and young and penniless go abroad at all without them or some other protection the sight of the leaves on the trees outside the fluttering and flying of the sparrows now and then the buzzing of a foolish bee who had found his way into the church carried the girl's thoughts away to the quiet place in the country where between hall and vicarage she had been brought up would the sweet country never more be seen was her life to be like that of these poor ladies one long prison among reprobates and profligates the summer came on apace it grew hot in june in july it was so hot that they were fain to sit all day and to sleep all night with open windows the air was cooler perhaps at night but it was laden with the odours of decaying cabbages trodden peas and beans rotten strawberries bruised cherries broken gooseberries with the nauseous breath of the butcher's stall and the pestilential smell of the poulterer's shop moreover they could not but hear the oaths and ribaldries of those who sat and lounged about the market staying in the open air because it was warm and because it was cheap the bulkheads bunks booths stalls and counters of the market were free and open to the world a log of wood for a pillow a hard plank for a bed this was the reward of a free and lawless life on most nights it seemed best to lie with windows closed and endure the heat yet closed windows could not altogether keep out the noise for on these summer nights all the knaves and thieves unhung in this great town seemed to be gathered here pleased to be all together a parliament of rogues under the pent houses and on the stalls of the market and as in some roman catholic countries nuns and monks maintain a perpetual adoration to the blessed virgin whom they ignorantly worship so did these reprobates maintain a perpetual litany of ribaldry and foul conversation it never ceased when one grew tired he lay down and slept his friends carried on the talk the drinking booths were open all night long so that those who talked might slake their thirst and if any waked and felt thirsty he too might have a drain and so lie down again day and night there was a never ending riot the ladies as the hot days continued grew thinner and paler but they bore it patiently they had borne it for thirty years between two and three in the morning there generally came a little respite most of the brawlers were then asleep drunk or tired out only at corners where there was drink to be had men and women still gathered together talking and joking at four or thereabouts the market carts began to arrive and noise of another kind began one morning in july kitty awoke it was a hot and close night just when all the city clocks were striking three it was broad daylight she sprang from bed and drawing the blind aside a little looked out upon the market below and the city around in the clear and cloudless air before the new day had charged it with a fresh covering or headpiece of smoke she saw the beautiful spires of st bride's st dunstan's st andrew's st mary's and st clement's rising one beyond the other into the clear blue sky their weather cocks touched by the morning sun on the south over the river were visible the green hills of surrey the sun shining on their hanging woods as plain as if they were half a mile away on the north there were the low hills of highgate hampstead and hornsey the paradise of cits and yet places most beautiful wooded and retired everywhere north west and south spires of churches rising up to the heavens as if praying for the folk beneath and under her eyes the folk themselves they were human ruins of the past the present and the future old men were among them who lay with curled up limbs shaking with cold warm though the night was and old women huddled up in scanty petticoats lying with tremulous lips and clasped hands the cheeks both of the old men and the old women were swollen with drink what was the record of their lives some of them had been rogues and vagabonds from the very first though how they managed to scape the gallows would be hard to tell doubtless their backs were well scarred with the fustigations of the alderman's whip and they could remember the slow tread of the cart behind which they had marched from newgate to tyburn the cruel cat falling at every step upon their naked and bleeding shoulders yet what help they must starve or they must steal and being taken they must be hanged or must be flogged why these poor old men and poor old women should had they not missed the meaning of their lives have been sitting in high places with the state and reverence due to honoured age with the memory of a life well fought hung with chains of gold draped with cloth of silver and lace yet they were here crouched in this filthy evil smelling place eyes shut backs bent lips trembling cheeks twitching and minds hardened to iniquity did any of them perchance remember how one who knew declared that never had he seen the righteous forsaken or the good man beg his bread a dreadful shivering seized the girl what plank of safety what harbour of refuge was open to her that she too might escape this fate what assurance had she that her end might not be like unto the end of these truly none save that faith by which as paul hath taught the only way to heaven itself is opened then there were young men with red and swollen faces thieves and vagabonds by profession who found the air of the market more pleasant than that of turnmill or chick street yet it was an ominous and suspicious place to sleep in a place full of bad dreams for thieves criminals and debtors since close at hand was the fleet prison its wards crowded with the careless who lounged and jested and the hopeless who sat in despair since but a hundred yards from them stood the black and gloomy newgate its condemned cells full of wretches no worse than themselves waiting to be hanged its courts full of other wretches no worse than themselves waiting to be tried sentenced and cast for execution and its gaol fever hanging over all alike delivering the wards from their prisoners cheating the hangman hurrying to death judge jury counsel prisoner and warders together but they never think upon such things these poor rogues each hopes that while his neighbour is hanged he will escape they cannot stop to think they cannot turn back behind them is the devil driving them downwards before them if they dare to lift their eyes the horrid machinery of justice with pillory whip and gallows among them here and there pretty boys and girls lying asleep side by side upon the hard wooden stalls boys with curly hair and rosy faces girls with long eyelashes parted lips and ruddy cheeks pity pity that when they woke they should begin again the only trade they knew to thieve filch and pick pockets with the reward of ducking pumping flogging and hanging so clear was the air so bright the morning that what she saw was impressed upon her memory clearly so that she can never forget it the old men and old women are dead the young men and women are one supposes hanged what else could be their fate and as for the boys and girls the little rogues and thieves who had no conscience and took all except the whippings for frolic are any left still to sleep on hot nights in that foul place or are all hanged whipped at the cart tail burnt in the hand or at best transported to labour under the lash in the plantations sinner succeeds unto sinner as the year follows year the crop of gallows fruit increases day by day but the criminals do not seem to become fewer chapter ix how the south sea bubble made two women prisoners one sunday evening in the autumn the market being then quiet the two ladies and the girl sat round a fire of coal talking together by its light the memories of the sisters by some accident were carried back to the past and they told the child the story of which she already knew a part how by a great and crying injustice of the law they had been shut up in prison for no fault of their own for nearly thirty years my father's eyes said mrs deborah looking at the portrait over the fireplace seem to rest upon me to night mrs esther shuddered it is a sign sister she said that something will happen to us mrs deborah laughed a little bitterly i thought afterwards that the laugh was like that of sarai because a thing did happen to her as will presently be seen nothing she said will happen to you and to me any more esther except more pain and more starvation patience deborah sighed mrs esther we who have borne our captivity for nine and twenty years and seven months said her sister can surely bear it a little longer we were girls when we came here said mrs deborah girls who might have had lovers and become mothers of brave sons not that you kitty should let your thoughts run on such matters but there are no honest lovers for honest girls in the rules of the fleet lovers echoed mrs esther with a heavy sigh mothers with sons ah no not for us we are old women now sister well everything is short that hath an end let us take comfort to earthly prison is a certain end appointed we came to the gaol sister continued mrs esther two girls weeping hand in hand poor girls poor girls my heart bleeds to think of them so young and so innocent we shall go out of it said her sister with tears of joy they shall write upon our tombstones 'these sisters thank god for death' what fault we asked ah deborah how often we asked it what fault had we committed for what sin or crime of ours did this ruin fall upon us i ask it still said deborah the impatient i ask it every day how can they call this a land of justice when two innocent women can be locked up for life my sister we may not kick against the pricks if laws are unjust they must be changed not disobeyed mrs deborah replied by a gesture of impatience we were blessed with parents said mrs esther half talking to herself half to me whose worth and piety were as eminent as their lofty positions in the city our respected father was lord mayor in the year when with our esteemed mother who was by birth a balchin and the granddaughter of sir rowland balchin also once lord mayor he had the honour of entertaining his highness prince george of denmark we were present at that royal banquet in the gallery our father was also of course an alderman of portsoken ward said mrs deborah and worshipful master of the company of armour scourers and churchwarden of st dionis backchurch said mrs deborah which he beautified adding a gallery at his own expense and where in a tablet was placed in the wall to his memory added mrs deborah and one to the memory of esther his wife continued the elder sister who died in the year so that we being still minors unfortunately became wards of a merchant an old and trusted friend of our father a costly friend he proved to us said mrs deborah nay sister blame him not perhaps he thought to multiply our fortunes tenfold then came the year of when by visitation of the lord all orders and conditions of men went mad and we like thousands of others lost our little all and from rich heiresses of twenty thousand pounds apiece such kitty was then our enviable condition became mere beggar girls worse said mrs deborah grimly beggar wenches are not in debt they may go and lay their heads where they please we were debtors but to whom i know not we owed a large sum of money but how much i know not nor have ever been able to understand how our guardian ruined us with himself i was twenty two and my sister twenty one we were of age no one could do anything for us needs must we come to the fleet and be lodged in prison esther cried her sister shuddering must we tell her all my child continued mrs esther we suffered at first more than we dare to tell you there was then in charge of the prison a wretch a murderer a man whose sins towards me i have i hope forgiven as is my christian duty but his sins towards my sister i can never forgive no never it is not i believe she said with more asperity than i had ever before remarked in her it cannot be expected of any christian woman that she should forgive in a wicked man his wickedness to others that is my case said mrs deborah the dreadful cruelties of bambridge so far as i am concerned are forgiven i cannot however forgive those he inflicted upon you esther and i never mean to this seemed at the moment an edifying example of obedience to the divine law afterwards the girl wondered whether any person was justified in nourishing hatred against another and as to that bambridge was dead he had committed suicide he had gone where no human hate could harm him every one knows that this man must have been a most dreadful monster he was the tenant so to speak of the prison and paid so much a year for the privilege of extorting what money he could from the unfortunate debtors he made them pay commitment fees lodging fees and fees of all kinds so that the very entrance to the prison cost a poor wretch sometimes more than forty pounds he took from the two ladies all the money they had to the last guinea he threatened them with the same punishment which he illegally inflicted on the unfortunate men he would he said clap them in irons set them in tubs put them in the strong room which was a damp and dark and filthy dungeon not fit for a turk he kept their lives in continual terror of some new misery they had ever before their eyes the spectacle of his cruelties to captain macpheadrid whom he lamed captain sinclair whom he confined until his memory was lost and the use of his limbs jacob mendez whom he kept locked up till he gave up his uttermost farthing and sir william rich whom he slashed with a hanger and beat with sticks because he could not pay his lodging and as every one knows bambridge was at last turned out through the exertions of general oglethorpe and how can i forget the generous band who touched with human woe redressive searched into the horrors of the gloomy gaol we endured these miseries continued mrs esther for four years when our cousin was able to go security and pay the fees for us to leave the dreadful place and enjoy the rules here at least we have some liberty though we must live among scenes of rudeness and see and hear daily a thousand things which a gentlewoman should be able to escape and forget our cousin she went on after a pause is not rich and is able to do little for us he sends us from time to time out of his poverty something for our necessities out of this we have paid our rent and being able sometimes to do some sewing work we have lived though but poorly two women want but little a penny will purchase a dish of broth it is not the poverty we lament said mrs deborah it is the place wherein we live then mrs esther went on heaven sent us a friend my dear be it known to you that had it not been for the doctor we had ere now been starved he it was who found us in hunger and cold he fed us clothed us and warmed us to us at least he will always be the best of men said mrs deborah more than that sister he hath brought us this child to be our joy and comfort though god in his mercy forbid that your young days should all be wasted in this wicked place which surely is the very mouth here they were interrupted by an uproar in the street below us a bawling and bellowing of many men they were bringing home the baronet who was already drunk among the voices kitty heard and hung her head with shame the tones of her uncle as clear and sonorous as the great bell of st paul's they said nothing for a space when all was quiet again and the brawlers had withdrawn mrs esther spoke in her gentle way a man's life doth doubtless seem to himself different from what he seems to the women who know him we know not his moments of repentance his secret prayers or his temptations men are stronger than women and they are also weaker their virtues are nobler their vices are more conspicuous we must not judge but continue to think the best i was saying my dear when we were interrupted by the brawling of sabbath breakers that your uncle the worthy doctor is the most kind hearted and generous of men for all that he has done to us three poor and defenceless women we have nothing to give in return but our prayers let us give him these at least may the lord of all goodness and mercy reward him strengthen him and forgive him whatever frailties do beset him chapter x how the doctor was at home to his friends if it be true which doubtless will be denied by no one that women are fond of changing their fashions and of pranking themselves continually in some new finery it is certainly no less true that men i mean young ones are for ever changing their follies as well as their fashions the follies of old men who ought to be grave in contemplation of the next world seem to remain the same some of them practise gluttony some love the bottle some of them the green table some even more foolish pretend to renew their youth and counterfeit a passion for our sex as for the fashions of the young men one year it is the cocking of a hat the next it is the colour of a waistcoat the cut of a skirt the dressing of a wig the ribbon behind must be lengthened or reduced the foretop must stick up like a horn one year and lie flat the next the curls must be amplified till a man looks like a monstrous ram or reduced till he resembles a monkey who has been shaved the sword must have hilt and scabbard of the fashionable shape which changes every year it must be worn at a certain angle the rule about the breadth of the ruffle or the length of the skirt must be observed so that even as regards their fashions the men are even with the women where we cannot vie with them is in the fashion of their amusements in which they change for ever and more rapidly than we change the colour of a ribbon one season ranelagh is the vogue the next vauxhall the men were for a year or two bitten by that strange madness of scouring the streets by night upsetting constables throwing pence against window panes chasing belated and peaceful passengers shouting and bellowing waking from sleep timid and helpless women and children could one devise a braver and more noble amusement another time there was the mischievous practice of man hunting it was thought the work of a fine fellow a lad of spirit to lie hidden with other lads of spirit in lincoln's inn fields or some such quiet place behind the bushes until there might pass by some unfortunate wretch alone and unprotected then would they spring to their feet shouting that's he that's he after him boys and pursue the poor man through the streets with drawn swords and horrid cries until half dead he rushed into some tavern or place of refuge as for actors singers or dancers they take them up for a season and then abandon them for no merit or fault in them whatever one day they are all for church and the next they applaud orator henley one day they shout for nancy dawson and the next for garrick one day they are whig and the next tory one year they brandish thick clubs wear heavy greatcoats with triple capes swear drink porter and go like common coachmen the next with amber canes scented gloves lace ruffles flowered silk waistcoats skirts extended like a woman's hooped petticoat they amble along as if the common air was too coarse for them mince their words are shocked at coarse language and can drink nothing less fine than rhenish or champagne though the latter be seven shillings and sixpence a flask and as for their walk they go on tip toe like a city madam trying to look like a gentlewoman the next year again they are all for hockley in the hole and bear baiting this year the fashion was for a short space and among such as could get taken there to spend the evenings in the rules of the fleet where the bloods of the town had discovered was to be found excellent company for such as liked to pay for it among those who had been spent and ruined in the service of fashion gaming and gallantry there are plenty of taverns and houses of call in london where a gentleman may not only call for what he pleases to order but may also be diverted by the jests and songs of some debauched idle fellow who lies and lops about all day doing no work and earning no money but in the evening is ready to sing and make merriment for a bowl of punch this rollicking roaring blade the lad of mettle was once a gentleman perhaps or a companion to gentlemen to him nature intending her worst hath given a reckless temperament an improvident brain a merry laugh a musical voice a genius for mimicry of which gifts he makes such excellent use that they generally lead him to end his days in such a position men need not for certain go to fleet market to find these buffoons yet within the rules there was an extraordinary number of these careless vagabonds always ready to enjoy the present hour could some friend be found to pay the shot in the morning they roamed the place leaned against bulkheads sat in doorways or hid themselves within doors dejected repentant full of gloomy anticipations in the evening their old courage came back to them they were again jocund light hearted the oracle of the tavern the jester and jack pudding of the feast pouring out songs from the collections of tom d'urfey and jokes from browne and ned ward many of the taverns the bishop blaize for example and the rainbow kept one or two of these fellows in their regular employ they gave them dinner with as soon as the guests arrived in the evening liberty to call for what they pleased if the visitors treated them so much the better for the house but there were however conditions unwritten but understood they were never to be sad never grave never to show the least signs of repentance reflection or shame and they were not to get drunk early in the evening or before the better sort of visitors whose entertainment they were to provide shameful condition shameful servitude for man who hath a soul to think of to obey one has to confess with shame that among the tavern buffoons the professional tom fools of the fleet were several of those clergymen whose trade it was to make rash couples wretched for life this peculiarity not to be found elsewhere provided perhaps a novelty in vice which for a time made the rules a favourite resort of men about town the knowledge that the man who without a rag left of the gravity belonging to his profession laughed sang and acted for the amusement of all comers should have borne himself as a grave and reverend divine gave point to his jest and added music to his song it is not every day that one sees a merry andrew in full bottomed wig bands and flowing gown it is not in every tavern that one finds the reverend james lands dancing a hornpipe in clogs or the reverend william flood bawling a comic song while he grins through a horse collar nor could the wits find at the coffee houses of st james's or covent garden or at any ordinary place of amusement a clergyman at the head of the table ruffling it with the best albeit with tattered gown and shabby wig ready with jest more profane wit more irreverent song and story more profligate than any of the rest as for doctor shovel it must not be supposed that he was to be found in any of these places what he was wont to cry should a man of reputation a scholar whose latin verses have been the delight of bishops and the pride of his college a clergyman of dignity and eloquence condescend to take the pay of a common vintner make merriment for the company of a mug house hobnob with a tradesmen's club play buffoon for a troop of templars and crack jests for any ragamuffin prentice with half a crown to call for a bottle no sir the man who would know doctor gregory shovel must seek him in his own house where as a gentleman and a scholar he receives such as may be properly introduced on every night of the year sundays excepted when he takes his drink for the most part alone in fact his house was the chief attraction of the rules but access was only granted to those who were brought by his friends once introduced however a man was free of the house and might not only come again as often as he pleased but bring other friends now as men prize most that which is least easy to procure whether they want it or not it became a distinction to have this right of spending the evening in the fleet market a fine distinction truly those however who went there were not unlikely to find themselves among a goodly assemblage of wits and men of fashion the doctor played the host with the dignity of a bishop and the hospitality of a nobleman chairs were set around the table in that room where he performed his daily marriages those who came late could stand or send for a bench from the market roger and william the two clerks were in attendance to go and fetch the punch which the doctor or his guests provided for the entertainment of all tobacco was on the table the doctor was in the chair his long pipe in his mouth his great head leaning back his eyes rolling as he talked before him his glass of punch he was no buffoon he did not cut capers nor did he dance nor did he sing tom d'urfey's songs nor did he quote ned ward's jokes if the company laughed it was at one of his own stories and when he sang the words were such as might have been heard in any gentlewoman's parlour and the music was arne's bull's lilly's or carey's round him were poets authors scholars lawyers country gentlemen and even grave merchants some of them were out at elbows threadbare and sometimes hungry but they were as welcome as the richer sort who paid for the punch the younger men came to listen to one who was notorious for his impudent defiance of the law and was reported to possess excellent gifts of conversation and of manner the elder men came to look upon a man unabashed in his disgrace whom they had known the favourite of the town all the world sir miles lackington told me ran after doctor shovel when he was a young man and evening lecturer at st martin's in the fields never was clergyman more popular in the world or in the pulpit what was to be looked for when such a young man spent his morning with great ladies who cried 'oh sweet sir oh reverend sir how eloquent how gracious are your words' but that he should see within reach promise of preferment and run into debt to maintain a fine appearance and a fine lodging the fine ladies had gone off after other favourite divines their promises were forgotten they had listened to other voices as musical and bowed their heads before other divines as pious the debts were unpaid the doctor in the rules he possessed no longer the wonderful comeliness with which he had stolen away the hearts of women he preached no more in any pulpit but his old dignity was left with his eloquence and his wit he who had charmed women now attracted men fie he would say remind me not of that time i was once the pet and plaything of ladies a sort of lapdog to be carried in their coaches a lackey in a cassock with my little store of compliments pretty sayings and polite maxims my advice on patches powder and eau de chypre my family prayers my grace before meat my sermons on divine right and the authority of the church and my anecdotes to make my lady laugh and take the cross looks out of little miss's dimpled cheeks and gentlemen withal a needy curate a poor starveling a pauper with never a guinea and a troop of debts which would not disgrace a peer whereas he would continue here i live free of duns and debt the countesses may go hang i look for no more patrons i expect no beggarly preferment i laugh at my ease while my creditors bark but cannot bite to those who objected that in former times he preached to the flock and that his eloquence was now as good as lost to the church he replied that as chaplain of the fleet he preached daily whereas formerly he had preached but once a week which was a clear gain for righteousness what would you have me send forth my newly married lambs without a word of exhortation beyond the rubric nay sir that were to throw away the gift of speech and to lose a golden occasion none leave my chapel of ease unless fortified and exhorted to virtue by such an admonition as they have never before enjoyed one evening in october when the summer was over and the autumn already set in the doctor sat as usual in his arm chair before him stood his tobacco box and beside it lay his pipe as yet for it was but eight o'clock there was no punch four great wax candles stood lighted on the table and in the doorway were the two impudent varlets whom he called his clerks leaning against the posts one on either hand there was but one visitor as yet he was a young templar almost a boy pale and thin because of his late hours and his excesses and the doctor was admonishing him being at the time in a mood of repentance or rather of virtue young man he said i have observed thee and made inquiry among thy friends regarding thy conduct which resembles at present that of the prodigal son while revelling in his prodigality learn from this place and the wretches who are condemned to live in it the end of profligacy what the words of solomon have hitherto been powerless to teach let the chaplain of the fleet enforce the wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook says the wise man yet ye drink not of that stream also he saith that wisdom crieth at the gates at the entry of the city but ye regard not he hath told ye how the young man void of understanding falls continually into the pit of destruction but ye heed not the drunkard and the glutton he hath declared shall come to poverty ye listen not but continue to eat and to drink wherefore young man look around thee and behold this place we who are here sit among wine bibbers and spendthrifts we have not in our comings and goings but alas we never go any gracious paths of pleasantness we go never among the meadows to breathe the air of buttercups and to ponder on the divine wisdom we listen perpetually to the cackle of fools the braying of asses whom we could indeed wish to be wild and on their native asiatic plains and the merriment of madmen which is like unto the crackling of thorns beneath the pot we have though our sins are multitudinous as the moments no time nor opportunity for repentance and even if we did repent there is no way out for us no escape at all but still we must remain among the wicked until we die even the christian priest who finds himself through thoughtlessness over money matters being continually occupied with higher things brought hither must leave the ways which are right and cleave unto those which are wrong it is only by lying bullying and swearing that money by which we live is drawn here out of the purses of silly and unwary people granted that we draw it what boots it if one's rogues bring in a hundred couples in a month the guineas melt away like snow in the sunshine and nothing remains but the evil memory of the sins by which they were gotten the templar astonished at such a sermon from such a man hung his head abashed he came to drink and be merry and lo an exhortation to virtue while the doctor was yet speaking there came a second visitor no other than mr stallabras the poet who came his head erect his hand thrust in his bosom as if fresh from an interview with the muses the doctor regarded him for a moment as one in a pulpit might regard a late comer who disturbed his sermon and went on with his discourse this is a place young man where gnashing of teeth may be heard day and night by him who has ears to hear and who knows that the sound of riot and merriment are but raised to drown despair to him every song is a throb of agony every jest rings in his ears like a cry of remorse we are in a prison though we seem to be free we are laid by the heels though we are said to enjoy the liberties of the fleet we live and breathe like our fellows but we have no hope for the rest of our lives we go not forth though the doors are open we are living monuments that foolish youth may learn by our luckless fate to avoid the courses which have brought us hither wherefore young man beware discite justitiam moniti he paused awhile and then continued yet we should not be pitied because forsooth we do but lie in the beds that we have chosen no other paradise save a heaven of gluttony would serve our turn in the garden of eden should we peradventure and by some singular grace win thither we should instantly take to wallowing in the mud and enjoying the sunshine some of us would sit among the pigsties in happy conversation and friendship with the swine some would creep downstairs and bask among the saucepans before the kitchen fire some would lie among the bottles and casks in the cellar not for such as have come here are the gardens the streams the meadows and the hilltops then came two more guests whom he saluted gravely these were accustomed to the doctor's moods and sat down to the table waiting in silence he too became silent sitting with his head upon his hand then came others who also found the doctor indisposed for mirth presently however he banged the table with his fist and cried out in those deep tones which he could use so well come life is short lamenting lengthens not our days brothers let us drink and sing roger go bring the bowl gentlemen all be welcome to this poor house here is tobacco punch is coming the night is young let every man be merry the room was half full there were besides the residents and lodgers of the place young lawyers from the temple gray's inn and lincoln's inn poets not yet in limbo authors who were still able to pay for their lodgings young fellows whose creditors were still forbearing and a few whose rich coats and lace betokened their rank and wealth the evening began the doctor's voice loud above all the rest half an hour afterwards when the air of the room was already heavy with tobacco smoke sir miles lackington who usually came with the earliest arrived bringing with him a young gentleman of twenty two years or thereabouts who was bravely dressed in a crimson coat lined with white silk he had also a flowered silk waistcoat and the hilt of his sword was set with jewels he was in fact one of those gentlemen who were curious to see this jovial priest self styled chaplain of the place where there were so many parsons who set the laws of the country at defiance with an audacity so splendid he looked surprised as if he had not expected so large an assembly follow me my lord said the baronet whose jolly face was already flushed and his voice already thick with wine come my lord let us get nearer the doctor gentlemen by your leave will you make place for his lordship doctor this gentleman is none other than the young lord chudleigh who hath heard of your eloquence and your learning and greatly desires your better acquaintance rascal roger chairs for my lord and myself he pushed his way through the crowd followed by his guest the doctor turned his head half rose his melancholy mood had passed away he was in happy vein he had sung one or two songs in a voice which might have been heard at temple bar he had taken two or three glasses of punch and smoked a pipe and a half of the best virginian he was in the paradise which he loved yet when sir miles lackington spoke when he named his guest the doctor's face became suddenly pale he seemed to totter his eyes glared and he caught at the arm of his chair as if about to be stricken with some kind of fit his friends who had never seen those ample and rubicund cheeks other than of a glowing ruddiness were greatly terrified at this phenomenon the doctor is ill cried solomon stallabras starting to his feet give air open the windows let us carry the doctor into the street but he recovered it is nothing he said a sudden faintness the day has been close let no one move he drank off his glass of punch the colour came back to his face and the firmness to his legs i am well again sir miles you are always welcome were the liberties peopled with such as you we should be well sped indeed quick with the chairs roger i rejoice to see your lordship in this poor house of mine had other noblemen of your lordship's rank but kept their word i should this day have welcomed you in the palace of a bishop forget my lord that i am not a bishop be assured that if i cannot bestow the episcopal absolution and benediction which he of london hath ever ready for a nobleman my welcome is worthy of a prelate and the punch not to be surpassed even at lambeth palace sir miles you forgot i think to make me acquainted with his lordship's noble name i am the lord chudleigh said the young man doubtfully and with a pleasing blush again your lordship is welcome said the doctor in the old days when i was young and able to stir abroad in the world without a creditor in every street and a vindictive dun in every shop whose revenge in this my confinement has only brought lamentation on every mother's son because they remain all unpaid it was my privilege to be much with your noble father in truth i knew not that he was dead my father died two years ago at his country house indeed the doctor gravely gazed in his guest's face both still standing is that really so but we who live in this retirement hear little news so lord chudleigh is dead i went upon the grand tour with him i was his tutor his companion his friend as he was kind enough to call me he was two years younger than myself but our tastes were common and what he bought i enjoyed and often chose there came a time when but your lordship is young you know not yet how rank and class separate friends how the man of low birth may trust his noble friend too much and he of rank may think the decalogue written for the vulgar your father is dead i had hoped to see him if but once more before he died it was not to be i would have written to him upon his deathbed had i known i owed him much very much more than i could hope to repay yet would i have repaid something your father died suddenly my lord or after painful illness he died doctor shovel after a long and very painful illness why there cried the doctor as if disappointed had i only known there would have been time for half a dozen letters i would i had been with him myself it is kind of you sir said his lordship thus to speak of my father did he but i suppose he had forgotten did he condescend to speak of me never replied lord chudleigh at least not to me there were certain passages in his life the doctor went on thoughtfully of such a kind as recur to the memory of sick and dying men when the good and evil deeds of our lives stand arrayed before us like ministering spirits and threatening demons certain passages i say which were intimately associated with myself indeed it cannot be that they entirely perished from his lordship's memory since he spoke not of them let me not speak i am sorry my lord to have saddened you by thus recalling the thought of your dead father nay sir said lord chudleigh to have met so old a friend of my father's is a pleasure i did not expect i humbly desire sir your better acquaintance the company during this long talk were mostly standing it was no new thing to meet a man of rank at the doctor's but altogether new to have the conversation assume so serious a tone every one felt however that the dignity of the doctor was greatly increased by this event then the doctor waved his hand and resumed his cheerful expression gentlemen he said be seated all i pray my lord your chair is at my right enough of the past we are here to enjoy the present hour which is always with us and always flying from us we crown it with flowers and honour it with libations we sing its presence with us we welcome its coming and speed its parting with wine and song so far are we pagans join with us in these heathen rites wherein we rejoice in our life and forget our mortality none but poets are immortal solomon solomon stallabras the modern apollo the favourite of the nine we drink your health and wish the long deferring of your immortality let us drink let us talk let us be merry let us while away the rosy hours he banged the table with his fist and set the glasses clinking then he filled a glass with punch and handed it to lord chudleigh as for you sir miles he said you may help yourself ah tippler the blush of the bottle is already on thy cheeks and its light is in thy eyes wherefore be moderate at the outset roger thou villain go order another bowl and after that more bowls and still more bowls i am athirst i shall drink continually i shall become this night a mere hogshead of punch so will all this honourable company bid the vintner beware the lemon and be sparing of the sugar but liberal with the clove and the nutmeg this night shall be such a night as the rules have never before seen run rogue run roger vanished let me sing you my lord a song of my youth when nymphs and shepherdesses ran in my head more than hebrew and theology he sang in his rich full and musical voice the following ditty cried the nymph while her swain sought for phrases in vain 'ah corydon let me a shy lover teach your flowers and rings your verses and things are pretty but dumb and i love a bold speech 'to dangle and sigh to stammer and cry such foolishness angers us maidens in time and if you would please neither tremble nor tease but remember to woo us with laughter and rhyme 'go hang up thy crook change that sorrowful look and seek merry rhymes and glad sayings in verse remember that kitty rhymes still unto pity and polly takes folly for better or worse 'come jocund and gay as the roses in may with a rolling leg and a conquering smile forget not that mirth ever rhymes unto worth and lucky the lover who laughs all the while' i wrote the song said the doctor when it was the fashion to be sighing at the feet of chloe not that my song produced any impression on the fashion pray my lord is it the custom nowadays to woo with a long face and a mournful sigh lord chudleigh laughed and put the question by what do women care for lovers' sighs i believe gentlemen they like to be carried by assault who can resist a brave fellow all fire and passion who marches to the attack with a confident laugh and a gallant bearing it is the nature of the sex to admire gallantry therefore gentlemen put on your best ruffles cock your hats tie your wigs settle the angle of your swords and on with a hearty countenance i remember being then in constantinople and at a slave market where circassians were to be bought there came into the place as handsome a young turk as ever you might wish to set eyes upon perhaps he was a poet because when he had the slaves brought out for his inspection at sight of the prettiest and youngest of them all he fell to sighing just like an english gentleman in love presently there came in an old ruffler of fifty who without any sighs or protestations tugged out his purse and bought the slave and she went off delighted at having fetched so good a price and pleased so resolute a fellow the doctor continued to pour forth stories of adventure and experience interspersed with philosophical maxims he told of courts and cities as he saw them in the year which was the year in which he made the grand tour with the late lord chudleigh he told old tales of cambridge life while he talked the company listened drank and smoked no one interrupted him meanwhile he sent the punch about gave toasts with every glass a toast with every toast a full glass and swore that on such a night no one should pay but himself wherefore let every man fill up come gentlemen we let the glasses flag i will sing you another song written for the good old days of tom d'urfey when men were giants and such humble topers as ourselves would have met with scant respect come all ye honest topers lend an ear lend an ear while we drain the bowl and push the bottle round bottle round we are merry lads and cosy cosy here cosy here though outside the toil and moil may resound may resound let us drink reformation to mankind to mankind example may they follow from our ways from our ways and whereas to their follies they are blind they are blind their eyes may they open to their craze to their craze for the miser all day long hugs his gold hugs his gold and the lover for his mistress ever sighs ever sighs and the parson wastes his words upon his fold upon his fold and the merchant to the ledger glues his eyes glues his eyes but we wrangle not but laugh while we drink while we drink and we envy no man's happiness or wealth or his wealth we rest from toil and cease from pen and ink pen and ink and we only pray for liquor and for health and for health then the miser shall like us call for wine call for wine and the lover cry for lemon and the bowl and the bowl and the merchant send his clerks for brandy fine brandy fine and the parson with a bottle soothe his soul soothe his soul and the rogue shall honest grow o'er a glass o'er a glass and the thief shall repent beside a keg beside a keg and enmity to friendship quickly pass quickly pass while good fellows each to others drink a peg drink a peg all kill joy envies then shall disappear disappear contented shall we push the bottle round bottle round for 'tis cosy topers all cosy here cosy here though outside the toil and moil may resound may resound thus did the doctor stimulate his guests to drink as the night wore on one by one dropped away some among whom were sir miles dropped asleep a few lay upon the floor as for lord chudleigh the fiery liquor and the fumes of the tobacco were mounting to his brain but he was not like the rest overpowered he would have got up and gone away but that the doctor's voice or his eyes held him to his place i am thinking said the doctor with a strange smile how your father at one time might have rejoiced to think that you should come here the recollection of his services to me must have soothed his last moments would that i could repay them lord chudleigh assured him that so far as he knew there was nothing to repay and that if there had been his father's wish would certainly have been to forgive the debt he could not forgive the debt said the doctor laughing it was not in his power he would have owned the debt it was not money however but a kindness of quite another sort then said lord chudleigh prettily bowing let me thank you beforehand and assure you that i shall be proud to receive any kindness in return that you may have an opportunity to show me believe me my lord said the doctor i have the will if not the power and i shall not forget the will at least it is strange he continued that he never spoke about his younger days lord chudleigh attracted to himself between the age of five and twenty and thirty the friendship and respect of many men like myself of scholarship and taste without fortune he with his friends was going to supply that defect a promise which circumstances prevented him from fulfilling the earthen vessel swims merrily in smooth water beside the vessel of brass when a storm rises it breaks to atoms we were the earthen vessels he the brazen we are all broken to atoms and

as a smallcoal man in blue surplice his shoulder laden with his wooden tinder and his measure twisted into the mouth of his sack another a light weight and a younger son became a jockey and wore the leathern cap the cut bob the buff breeches and the fustian frock till he was thrown and broke his neck i laugh when i think of what an end hath come to all the greatness of those days to be sure my lord paid for all and promised future favours but we were fine gentlemen on nothing connoisseurs with never a guinea dilettanti who could not pay for the very eye glasses we carried in the province of love and gallantry every man beggar as he was thought himself a perfect oroondates we sang with taste we were charming men nonpareils we had the tastes of men of fortune we talked as if the things we loved were within our reach we dreamed of pictures bronzes busts intaglios old china or etruscan paterae and we had the vices of the great as well as their tastes like them we drank like them we diced like them we played all night at brag all fours teetotum hussle cup chuck farthing hazard lansquenet so we lived and so we presently found the fate of earthen vessels heaven hath been kinder to some of us than we deserve wherefore gentlemen drink about here the doctor looked round him gentlemen i perceive that i have been for some time talking to a sleeping audience roger pour me out another glass swine of circe i drink to your headaches in the morning now lads turn all out chapter xi how the doctor dismissed his friends those of the guests who had not already departed were sitting or lying asleep upon the floor or on the chairs the last to succumb had been lord chudleigh not because his was the strongest head but because he had drunk the least and struggled the hardest not to fall a victim to the punch sir miles had long since sunk peacefully upon the floor where he lay in oblivion one of the men having loosened his cravat to prevent the danger of apoplexy solomon stallabras among whose vices was not included the love of strong drink was one of the earliest to depart the young templar whom the doctor exhorted to virtue early in the evening was now lying curled up like a child in the corner his virtuous resolutions if he had ever formed any forgotten others there were but all were crapulous stupid senseless or asleep the doctor stood over his victims victorious he had taken singly more punch than any three of them together yet there they all lay helpless while he was steady of head and speech it was past two o'clock in the morning the candles low now and nearly spent burned dim in the thick tobacco laden air the walls were streaming with the heat generated by the presence of so many men and so much drink roger with the red nose and pale cheeks still stood stolidly at the door waiting for the half finished bowl and the last orders beside him his fellow lackey and clerk william turn all out roger said the doctor aye sir said roger both men addressed themselves to the task they were accustomed to turn out their master's guests in this fashion first they lifted the fallen form of sir miles and bore him carefully to his lodging then they carried out the young templar and the others who lay snoring upon the floor and deposited them upon the stalls of the market outside where the fresh air of the night might be expected to restore them speedily meanwhile roger and william for their better protection would themselves watch over them until such time as they should awake rise and be ready to be led home with tottering step and rolling gait for such reward as the varlets might demand the doctor's clerks had a hard life they began to tout on ludgate hill and the fleet bridge at eight they fought for their couples all the morning with other touts in the evening they waited on the doctor's guests at midnight they bore them into the market there they watched over them till they could be taken home a hard and difficult service but there were few of the men about the fleet who did not envy a situation so well paid indeed one cannot but admire the hardness of men to whom a daily fight with constant black eyes broken teeth and bleeding nose appears of such slight importance in the day's work as not to be taken into account there remained lord chudleigh who had fallen asleep in his chair and was the last as for this young gentleman roger said the doctor carry him upstairs and lay him upon my bed he is of different stuff do not wake him if you can help it nothing but an earthquake or an explosion of gunpowder could have awakened the young man so senseless and heavy was he they bore him up the stairs the doctor following they took off his boots his coat and waistcoat put on him the doctor's nightcap and laid him in the bed all finished the doctor bade them drink off the rest of the punch and begone the doctor left quite alone opened the windows and doors and stepped out into the market at two o'clock on a cold october morning even that noisy place is quiet a west wind had driven away the smoke and the sky was clear glittering with innumerable stars the doctor threw open his arms and took a deep breath of the cold air standing with his wig off so that the wind might freshen his brain before him he saw but he took no heed the helpless forms of his guests lying on the stalls beside them sat wrapped in heavy coats his two serving men looking like vultures ready to devour their prey but for fear of their master who would infallibly cause them to be hanged after a few minutes in the open air the doctor returned to his room he was sober although he had taken enough punch to make ten men drunk and steady of hand although he had smoked so much tobacco but the veins on his face stood out like purple cords his eyes were bloodshot his great lips were trembling he did not go to bed but lit a fresh pair of candles and sat in his chair thinking his thoughts carried him back to some time of trouble for he presently reached out his hand seized his tobacco pipe and crushed it in fragments then he took the glass from which he had been drinking and crushed that too in his great strong fingers i knew not he murmured that the villain was dead if i had known that he was ill i should have gone to see him if only to remind him with a curse of the past he is dead i can never curse him face to face as i hoped to do i did not think that he would die before me he seemed stronger and he was younger i looked to seek him out at any time when i wanted a holiday or when i wanted a diversion i thought i would take him in his own house and show him in such words as only i can command how mean a creature he was and what a treacherous cur now he is dead he actually never will be punished at all this reflection caused him the greatest sadness he shook his head as he thought it over it is not he said to himself that i wished to be revenged on him though doubtless as men are but frail that desire entered somewhat into my hopes so much as that i saw in him a man who above most men deserved to be punished i break the law daily incurring thereby the penalty of a hundred pounds which i never pay for each offence yet truly am i less burdened in my conscience than should have been this lord chudleigh and he hath died in honour in this world one man steals a pig and receives the approbation of his kind another looks over a wall and is clapped in gaol for it one man slaughters a thousand and is made a duke another kills one and is hanged i am in prison who never did anything against the law until i came here nor harmed any except my creditors my lord who thought the ten commandments made for creatures of baser blood and the round world with all that therein is only created for his own insatiable appetite lives in honour and dies what can i tell perhaps in grace fortified at least with the consolations of the church and the benedictions of his chaplain so all things seem matter of chance as solomon stallabras says in one of his fables 'we little flies who buzz and die should never ask the reason why' he yawned then struck with a sudden thought he took one of the candles and softly mounted the stairs shading the light with his hand he looked upon the face of the young man sleeping on his bed a handsome young man with regular features strongly marked delicate lips and pointed chin truly said the doctor a youth of great beauty another david he is more handsome than his father even in those young days when he caressed me to my ruin and led me on with promises to my undoing yet he hath the trick of the chudleigh lip and he hath his father's nose would that his father were alive and that it was he and not his son lying here at my mercy the son is something out of regard to his father's memory he shall not get off scot free but what is to be done there is nothing i think that i would not do his red face grew purple as he thought of his wrongs were his father living and could i make him feel through his son nothing i believe as i am a christian man if my lord were alive this day i think i could tie a stone round the boy's neck and chuck him into the fleet ditch at holborn bridge and yet what a poor and miserable thing to do a moment of brutal satisfaction in thinking of the father's agony an eternity of remorse but his father is dead he cannot feel at all any more whatever i do if i could his face grew dark again and he ground his teeth i believe i could drag the boy downwards little by little and destroy his very soul to make his father suffer the more he gasped and caught his breath why he murmured what is this it is well for men that they are not led into temptation this young lord hath fallen into my hands good what shall i do with him he knows nothing yet he must suffer something it is the law we are all under the law for the third and fourth generation and he is only the first generation his children and his grandchildren will have to suffer after him it is not my fault i am clearly carrying out the law he is providentially led here not that i may take revenge upon the son of my enemy for his father's wrong but that he might receive chastisement at my hands being those of the fittest person even as solomon was chosen to slay both joab and shimei what then shall i do the reverend gregory shovel cannot murder the boy that would be the common vulgar thought of a fleet market butcher or a hodman murder a nauseous thought he took up the candle and stole noiselessly down the stairs as if the thought had driven him from the place when he was back in his own room he began to walk up and down thinking he is but a boy he said a handsome boy 'twould be a sin to harm him yet being sent here as he is in a way that can be no other than providential 'twould be a sin to let him go how if i make him pay all my debts and so leave the liberties and live respectably ever after respectably he laughed a little why who would believe that the great doctor shovel could be respectable the mud of this place this dwelling beside a ditch hath entered into my soul as the iron of the chains entereth into the soul of the prisoner my name is too deeply daubed with the fleet mud it cannot be cleansed and should i give up my place should i leave to another the honour i have won and the income i make therefrom shall there be another chaplain of the fleet while i survive no that will never do how could i live away from this room wherein i wallow day and night here am i at mine ease here i get wealth i cannot leave this place he was in great perplexity he wandered up and down he was torn between his wrath against the father and his consciousness that it would be a mean and dreadful villainy to take revenge upon the son i must have taken too much punch he said thus to be agitated punch like wine 'is a mocker strong drink is raging' the christian should forgive the father is dead the lad is a handsome lad and may be good besides whatever i do to the boy his sire will neither know nor feel i might as well suppose that the legs and heads on temple bar feel what is said about them below i am a fool yet am i but a man for such a crime even a saint would feel a righteous wrath yet it is cowardly to take revenge upon the son the committer of the crime having gone to his own place yet he is that man's son what then to do he turned the question over a thousand times yet found no answer at last a thought came to him he nodded his head and laughed aloud then he sought his arm chair adjusted his ample gown so as to get the greatest amount of comfort out of it placed his feet upon a stool and folded his arms i have taken at least a quart of punch more than is good for me that is most certain otherwise i should have known at once what i should do i have actually forgotten the peculiarities of my own position which shows that i am neither so young nor so strong as i have been perhaps the system wants a fillip i will take a dose of norway tar water to morrow but first my lord you shall find out early in the morning why i am called the chaplain of the fleet chapter xii how kitty executed the doctor's revenge the doctor seldom transacted business before nine o'clock in the morning unless as sometimes happened a spirited apprentice a lad of mettle came with his master's daughter both stealing away at seven before the master and mistress were up when she was supposed to be attending morning prayers at church or helping molly the maid with the mop and he was expected to be cleaning out the shop and dressing the window the ceremony over they would go home again but separately young miss carrying her prayer book before her as demure as a kitten looking as if she had never heard of a fleet marriage and was ignorant of the great doctor shovel chaplain yea bishop of that place while the boy with brush and broom and watering can would be zealously about his master's work when that poor man his morning dish of chocolate or pint of small ale despatched appeared in the shop for the conduct of the day's affairs afterwards they could choose their own time for declaring what had been done thus did the doctor make or mar the fortunes of many a bold prentice boy this morning the doctor awoke from sleep at seven or thereabouts having in four hours slept off the punch and tobacco in his arm chair his face became almost benign in its thoughtful kindliness as he remembered the guest lying asleep upstairs and what he was about to do for him he rose shook himself opened the windows and doors and went out into the market still in his nightcap carrying his wig in one hand and his silk handkerchief in the other the market was already crowded with purchasers principally those who buy a barrowful of fruit and vegetables and bawl through the streets until all is sold but there was a good sprinkling of maids and housewives buying provisions for the day the morning was fresh with a little autumn fog and the sun shining through it like a great yellow disk the waggons stood about with their loads of cabbages carrots parsnips potatoes apples plums and sloes waiting till they could be discharged on the heaped up pile of fruits and vegetables you could see hanging still the slender threads and cobwebs which are spun every night in autumn time by invisible spiders and appear in the morning strung with beads of dew stand aside cried the stall keepers one and all make way for the doctor don't you see the doctor room for the doctor he walked magisterially to the pump under which he held his bare head for a few moments while a boy pumped the cold water over him this done he shook his head mopped his poll with his silk handkerchief clapped on his wig and returned to his own house his robes majestically floating around him the market proud of its doctor made way for him with salutations and inquiries after his reverence's health at the house he found his two runners waiting for him as fresh if pale cheeks and red noses can look fresh as if they had not been up until two o'clock in the morning he sent for a pint of small ale and began to consider what next roger he said canst thou at the present moment lay thy hand upon a woman willing to be a bride either in the prison or elsewhere roger hesitated it depends your reverence on the bridegroom about tower steps for instance and down wapping way there are brides in plenty to be picked up for the asking not brides for me roger think again i want a bride who wants a husband and not a sailor's money who will stick to her husband and make him as happy in his wedded life as you and the rest of mankind are or have been roger grinned he was himself a widower and could be tickled with the joke i think i know the very woman he said a young widow good said the doctor she has been extravagant and is in debt very good said the doctor a prisoner in the fleet but i can fetch her out in a twinkling for half a crown ay ay said the doctor go on honest roger a widow extravagant and in debt that promises well her husband was an honest draper in gracechurch street who lately died of smallpox leaving her a good business and a thousand pounds in money she hath already squandered the thousand wasted the business and brought herself to ruin she is comely and is but thirty years of age to get out of the fleet i think she would marry the she shall marry better than that roger go fetch her here tell her to come and talk with me and that if she pleases me in her conversation and appearance she may shortly marry a gentleman this said the doctor when his man was gone will be a good stroke of business this shall be his punishment my lord shall marry this extravagant slut no paltry common revenge this just punishment for the first generation he will gain a pocketful of debts and a wife who will stick to him like a leech aha a city wench none of your proud city madams grand enough to be a countess but a plain tradesman's widow with no ideas beyond a dish of tea bagnigge wells strawberries at bayswater cakes at chelsea or at the best a night of wonder gaping at the quality at vauxhall a wife of whom he will be ashamed from the very first this is good business what a pity what a thousand pities that his noble father is no more the doctor laughed and rubbed his hands then he mounted the stairs again and entered his bedroom the lad was still sound asleep his cheeks less red and his breathing lighter his head will ache said the doctor i fear he is unaccustomed to punch when he wakes his limbs will feel like lead his throat will feel like a limekiln his tongue will be furred like the back of a squirrel his eyes will be hot and heavy as if he had a fever his hand will shake like the hand of a palsied man he will totter when he tries to walk ah cursed drink time was when i who am now as seasoned as a port wine cask or a keg of nantz would feel the same when i awoke after such a night age brings its consolations he rubbed his hands thinking that he could now drink without these symptoms i will marry him he continued while he is yet half drunk when he recovers it will be time to explain the position of things should i explain or should his wife ho ho a draper's widow of gracechurch street to marry the heir of all the chudleighs he stood over the bed again and passed his hand lightly over the sleeping boy's cheeks something in his looks touched the doctor and his eyes softened poor lad i never had a son perhaps if there had been one things would have been different he is a very handsome boy pity after all that he must marry this jade this extravagant wench who will waste and scatter his patrimony and likely bring him to shame when being so young so handsome and so rich he might have had the prettiest girl in the country here he started might have had might have had can he not have is there a prettier girl or a better bred girl anywhere in the land than kitty pleydell what more can any man want she is of gentle blood on one side at least for the shovels it is very certain do somewhat smack of the soil never a shovel except the reverend gregory shovel doctor of divinity who hath risen to greatness clods all here is a great chance for such a revenge as would have driven the old lord mad and will be a blessing and a boon to the young lord ho ho my lord breaker of promises my lord trampler of dependents my lord villain and rogue how likes your lordship that your son should marry my niece as for you young spark i will give you a bride so sweet so fair so fresh that by heavens you ought to woo her for a twelvemonth and then go and hang your foolish neck by a garter because she would not say yea well well let us return good for evil let us still be christians yet no lord chudleigh hath deserved to have any benefit at my hands he rubbed his hands he laughed to himself his shoulders rolling from side to side he nodded his head pleasantly at his victim then he went downstairs again with grave and thoughtful mien he was thinking how best to bring about his purpose he found however waiting below roger his man with him there came a woman dressed in shabby finery she was a woman of about thirty two years of age stout and still comely she looked about the room as if in search of some one her face was eager and anxious when she saw the doctor she put her handkerchief to her eyes and burst or pretended to burst into tears alas doctor she cried i am truly ashamed to come in such a plight but i have nothing else to put on and roger good man says that the gentleman will not wait who is the gentleman surely not thomas humpage the mercer who always promised to marry me when my husband should die and now refuses because although a warm man he will not take upon him the burden of my poor debts alas men are ever thus towards us poor women pray doctor who is the gentleman far be it from me to keep the poor man waiting and indeed i was ever a pitiful woman and you are under a little mistake madam said the doctor interrupting her there is no gentleman here asking for you roger is an ass and a pig roger made no reply excess of zeal frequently led him into mistakes he stared straight before him and modestly edged away in the direction of the door so as to be out of reach both of the doctor's fist the weight of which he knew already and the lady's nails the poor woman's face fell and real tears crowded into her eyes now the doctor was a man who could not bear the sight of a woman crying so he hastened to soothe her your case madam he said hath awakened my commiseration i have sent for you to know whether should roger be able to find a suitable husband you would be willing to take him o doctor she sobbed best of men if only you can find me a husband i should be grateful to the end of my days i would marry any one any one even roger roger swiftly vanished through the door he may be as old as methusalem and as ugly as a foreign frenchman but i would marry him to take my place in the prison and go free once more roger said the doctor is a great match maker he hath persuaded many couples into this room that never thought when they went out to take the air and see the shops of coming here see now would the skipper of a merchantman serve your turn doctor i love a sailor they make confiding husbands and they bring home money once married you are free and then your creditors would have to catch your husband who if he is the handy tarpaulin that deserves you will show them a clean pair of heels off the nore madam i will do my best meanwhile perhaps a guinea would be of use to you she cried in earnest as she took it o doctor the debts are not much altogether a poor two hundred pounds and a man may always be happy in the prison there are skittles and beer but a woman never can and i would go to see him sometimes say twice a year she went away weeping but she stopped when she saw roger outside the door and held a few minutes' eager conversation with him before she returned to her prison perhaps he found some simple country lad or sailor who was beguiled into marrying her only to take upon him her debts and to lie within four walls instead of her but indeed i know not we had finished our breakfast and were tidying the room my thoughts were full of the country that morning because i had dreamed of the old place and the garden with its yellow leaves the trailing cobwebs banks covered with branches of mignonette nasturtium eight feet long pinks now mostly over bending their faded heads and the larkspur foxglove venus's looking glass bachelors' buttons mournful widow boys' love stocks their glory over now their leaves withering and all run to seed i was talking about these sweet things with my ladies when i heard the doctor's voice at the bottom of the stairs bidding me quickly take my hat and hood and run down to him for that he needed me for half an hour i obeyed little thinking what was to follow he said nothing but by a gesture bade me follow him when we came to his house roger and william his two runners were waiting outside the door and the room was set out in the usual fashion in readiness for any who might chance to call you said the doctor to the men wait outside until i call you stay fetch a quart of ale at once the ale brought the men retired and shut the door kitty said my uncle i have long intended to bestow upon thee the greatest good fortune which it is in my power to procure thou art a good girl thou art my sister's child thou hast shown a spirit of obedience i have reflected that it is not well for thee to remain much longer in the rules and the only way to provide thee with a home elsewhere is to provide thee with a husband but sir i said beginning to be extremely terrified i do not want a husband so say all young maids we child know what is best for them i could have found thee a husband among my friends sir miles lackington indeed spoke to me concerning the matter he is a baronet the lackingtons are an old family but he hath squandered his fortune and i cannot learn that any more money will come to him besides he drinks more than is befitting even in a gentleman of title oh sir i cried not sir miles no kitty the doctor smiled benevolently upon me i regard thy happiness first no drunkard shall marry my niece mr stallabras hath also opened his mind upon thee he is an ingenious man with a pretty wit and if verses were guineas would be a great catch for thee but alas he hath no money so i dismissed him poor solomon that then was the reason of a late melancholy which we had remarked in him mrs esther took it as caused by the wrestling of genius and said that the soul within him was too great for the bodily strength but kitty here the doctor beamed upon me like the sun in splendour i have here yea even in this house the husband of my choice the man who will make thee happy start not it is resolved child obey me i declare that i was so terrified by the doctor's words so amazed by his announcement so spellbound by his words and manner that i did not dare resist had he told me that i was to be hanged i could not have made an effort to save myself obey me he repeated bending his eyebrows and looking upon me no longer as a sun in splendour but as an angry judge might look upon a criminal stand here so do not move keep thy face covered with thy hood all but thine eyes give me your hand when i ask it and be silent save when i bid thee speak be not afraid girl i do this for thine own good i give thee a gentleman for thy husband thou shalt not leave this place yet awhile but needs must that thou be married i return in five minutes he took the jug of beer and climbed the stairs i meanwhile stood where he had placed me my hood over my head in the most dreadful terror that ever assailed the heart of any girl upstairs the doctor awakened lord chudleigh with some difficulty he sat up on the bed and looked round him wondering where he was i know now he murmured you are doctor shovel and this is your lordship is in the liberties of the fleet my head is like a lump of lead said the young man your lordship was very merry last night as indeed befits the happy occasion was i merry indeed i think i was very drunk what occasion drink a little small ale said the doctor it will revive you he took a long drink of the beer and tried to stand so he said i am better already but my head reels doctor and my legs are unsteady it serves me right it is the first time and it shall be the last i hope so since your lordship is about to undertake so important a charge what charge asked lord chudleigh still dazed and unsteady is it possible that your lordship hath forgotten your mistress of whom you would still be talking last night 'the sweetest girl in england the prettiest girl in all the world the fairest kindest nymph' i quote your lordship lord chudleigh stared in amazement the sweetest girl what girl oh your lordship is pleased to jest with me i remember you doctor shovel whom i came to see last night with sir miles lackington i remember the punch and the songs but i remember nothing about any girl why she is downstairs now waiting for your lordship you will come downstairs and keep your appointment he spoke in a peremptory manner as if ordering and expecting obedience my appointment have i gone mad it is this cursed punch of yours my appointment the doctor gave him his coat and wig and helped him to put them on i attend your lordship she is downstairs take a little more ale to clear your head you will remember then the young man drank again the beer mounted to his brain i suppose because he laughed and straightened himself why i am a man again an appointment no doctor hang me if all the beer in your cellar will make me remember any appointment where is sir miles he might tell me something about it curse all punch i say yet if the lady be downstairs as you say i suppose i must have made some sort of appointment let me see her at any rate it will be easy to to here he reeled and caught hold of the doctor's hand what a crime what a terrible wicked thing was this which we did my uncle and i i heard the steps on the stairs i might have run away the door was before me but i was afraid yes i was afraid my uncle had made me fear him more than i feared the laws of my god or since that is hardly true he made me fear him so much that i forgot the laws of my god i did not run away but i waited with a dreadful fluttering of my heart i held my hood drawn over my head with my left hand so that only my eyes were visible and so i kept it all the time i saw in the door the most splendid young man i had ever seen he was richly dressed though his coat and ruffles showed some disorder in crimson coat and sash with flowered silk waistcoat and sword whose hilt gleamed with jewels his cheek was flushed and his eyes had a fixed and glassy look the doctor led him or rather half supported him was this young man to be my husband roger must have been watching outside for now he came in and locked the door behind him then he drew out his greasy prayer book standing by his lordship ready to support him if necessary so he said this is the sweetest girl in all england hang me if i remember look up my girl let me see thy face how can i tell unless i see thy face silence said the doctor in a voice of command i know not what strange power he possessed but at the sound of his voice the young man became suddenly silent and looked about the room as if wondering for myself i knew that i was to be married to him but why what did it mean the doctor had begun the service my bridegroom seemed to understand nothing looking stupidly before him roger read the responses the doctor did not hurry he read the exhortation the prayers the psalms through slowly and with reverence other fleet parsons scrambled through the service the doctor alone knew what was due to the church he read the service as a clergyman who respects the service ought to read wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife the man roger gave the dazed bridegroom a jog in the ribs say 'i will' he whispered loudly i will said the young man wilt thou the doctor turned to me have this man to thy wedded husband roger nodded to me say 'i will' he admonished me i obeyed yet i knew not what i said so frightened was i who giveth the doctor went on this woman to be married to this man the dirty battered rogue the clerk took my hand and laid it in that of the doctor i was given away by the villain roger then the service went on with this ring the man's hand was holding mine and it was dry and hot his face was red and his eyes were staring with this ring i thee wed with my body i thee worship with all my worldly goods i thee endow consider pray consider that when i took part in this great wickedness i was but a young girl not yet seventeen years old that the thing came upon me so suddenly that i had not the sense to remember what it meant that my uncle was a man of whom any girl would have been afraid yet i knew that i ought to have fled when my bridegroom held my hand in his i observed that it was hot and trembling his eyes did not meet mine he gazed upon the doctor as if asking what all this meant i took him in my innocence for a madman and wondered all the more what this freak of the doctor's could mean for ring the doctor drew from his guest's little finger a diamond ring which was full large for my third finger when the service was finished bride and bridegroom stood stupidly staring at each other only that still i wore my hood drawn over my face while roger placed upon the table a great volume bound in parchment with brass clasps this my lord is our register said the doctor opening it at a clean page sign there if you please in your usual hand i will fill in the page afterwards he took the pen and signed still looking with wondering eyes now child said the doctor do you sign here after your husband the certificate you shall have later for the present i will take care of it other practitioners of the fleet my lord he said with professional pride as he looked at his great volume would enter your name in a greasy pocket book and give your wife a certificate on unstamped paper here you have a register fit for a cathedral and a certificate stamped with no less illustrious a name than the archbishop of canterbury your lordship hath signed your name in a steady and workmanlike fashion so that none henceforth shall be able to malign your conduct on this day they shall not say that you were terrified or bribed or were in a state of liquor on the day of your marriage all is free and above suspicion i congratulate your lordship on this auspicious occasion roger your mark here as witness so it is customary my lord to present the officiating clergyman myself with a fee from a guinea upwards proportionate to the rank and station of the happy bridegroom from your lordship will i take nothing for myself for the witness i will take a guinea here the bridegroom pulled out his purse and threw it on the table he spoke not a word however i think his brain was wandering and he knew not what he did yet he obeyed the voice of the doctor and fell into the trap that was set for him like a silly bird allured by the whistle of the fowler i am certain that he knew not what he did the doctor pulled one guinea from the purse and handed it back to the owner roger he said go drink his lordship's health and hark ye silence if i hear that you have told of this morning's doings it shall be the worst day in all your life i threaten not in vain go then the doctor took up the tankard of ale which stood in the window seat your health my lord he drank a little and passed it to his lordship who drained it and then with a strange wild look he reeled to the doctor's arm chair and instantly fell fast asleep your husband is not a drunkard kitty though this morning he appears in that light but am i married i asked you are really married you are no longer kitty pleydell you are catherine lady chudleigh i wish your ladyship joy i stared at him but he does not know me he never saw me i remonstrated that he does not know you yet is very true replied the doctor when the fitting time comes for him to know you be sure that i will remind him for the present he shall not know whom he has married i perceive he went on seeing that i made no reply that thou art a good and obedient child ask no questions of me say not one word to any one of this day's work be silent and thou shalt have thy reward remember be silent now go child go lady chudleigh chapter xiii how lord chudleigh woke out of sleep alas there was small pride in that thought what joy of being lady chudleigh when i had to pick my way home through the dirty and crowded market thinking of the pain and grief this wicked thing would cause my ladies when they learned it of the shame with which my father's soul would have been filled had he known it and the wrath of lady levett when she should hear it oh kitty i thought how miserably art thou changed in four short months in the happy fields at home everything save when the rustics swore at their cattle breathed of religion and virtue in this dreadful place everything leads to profligacy and crime and what a crime and the poor young gentleman did ever any one hear the like that a young girl not yet quite seventeen should thus consent to marry a man whom she had never seen oh shame and disgrace and that young man so handsome and so gallant albeit so tipsy that he could scarcely stand who would have thought four months ago that kitty would be that wicked creature afterwards i thought of the dreadful wickedness of marrying while still in mourning for a father not yet six months dead but i confess that at first so confused was i that this thought did not oppress me indeed there was almost too much to think about suppose i was by a careless word to reveal the secret suppose the rascal roger were to tell it abroad in the market suppose the young man whose name i did not dare to pronounce were to see me and find my name suppose the doctor were at once to reveal to my husband i suppose i ought to call him who and what i was all these thoughts i say crowded into my mind together and filled me with repentant terrors i went straight home because there was no other place to go to mrs deborah reminded me when i had taken off my hood that we were still engaged upon the long outstanding account between richard roe gentleman and robert doe draper it was one of the problems of the book keeping treatise how rightly to state this account to the satisfaction both of doe who wanted all he could get and of roe who wanted to pay as little as possible i remember that richard roe had not only bought extraordinary things for a gentleman such as ladies' hoops and paniers but had bought them in immense quantities to be explained perhaps by the supposition that he was a benefactor to the female sex or perhaps that he was shipping things to madagascar where i believe a sarsnet pinner if in scarlet is considered worth a diamond as big as a pigeon's egg and a few bottles of eau de chypre are thought a bargain if purchased by a ruby weighing a pound or so we had been engaged for a month upon a statement of the account showing the exact liabilities of richard roe who used to pay in odd sums with pence and farthings at unexpected times we never got it right and then we began again fortunately it costs nothing to clean a slate i sat down to this task with listless brain what girl after being so suddenly hurled into matrimony with the possession of so great a secret could take any interest in the debts of richard roe the figures got mixed presently i was fain to lay the slate aside and to declare that i could do no more that day nor indeed could i do anything not even hear what was said so that my ladies thought i was sickening for some fever which was not improbable fever being rife at this time owing to the smell from the vegetables and one of the little dunquerques in our own house down with it ah could they only have guessed the truth what sorrow and pity would have been theirs with what righteous wrath at the sin when i was gone the doctor called back roger and they carried the unhappy bridegroom again to the bedroom where they laid him on the bed and then left him to himself he will sleep said the doctor experienced in these cases until the afternoon have a cup of mutton broth for him when he wakes with a pint of small ale then he returned and the ordinary business of the day began the couples came in half a dozen of them one pair gave him five guineas they were an irishman who thought he was marrying a rich widow and a woman head over ears in debt who thought she was marrying a wealthy squire a week afterwards the unhappy bridegroom came to the doctor to undo the match which was impossible he escaped his wife's creditors however and took to the road where after many gallant exploits he was caught tried and hanged at tyburn making a gallant and edifying end and ruffling it bravely to the very foot of the ladder the day therefore was profitable to the doctor well begun roger he said is well done the morning's work is worth ten guineas i would rest this afternoon wherefore bring no more couples yet one would fain not disappoint the poor creatures let them come then roger we may not weary in well doing and hark ye take this guinea to mistress dunquerque not the captain mind and bid her spend it for the children and inquire whether mr stallabras hath paid his rent lately if not pay it and buy me on ludgate hill a hat and feathers for miss kitty and varlet if thou so much as breathe of what was done here this morning i threaten not but i know the history of thy life think of the past think of newgate close by and be silent as the grave at three o'clock in the afternoon when the doctor after his dinner sat over a cool pipe of virginia lord chudleigh came downstairs he was dressed and in his right mind although somewhat flushed of cheek and his hand shaky doctor shovel he said i thank you for your hospitality and am sorry that i have abused it i am ashamed to have fallen into so drunken and helpless a condition your lordship said the doctor rising and bowing is welcome to such hospitality as this poor house of a prisoner in the liberties of the fleet can show a nobleman of your rank i am the more bound to show this welcome to your lordship because for such as is my condition i am beholden to the late lord chudleigh this was a speech which might have more than one meaning his lordship made no answer staring in some perplexity and fearful that the punch might still be in his head it was in this room he said presently that we drank last night i remember your chair and these walls but i remember little more fie doctor your way of treating guests is too generous yet i have had a curious and uneasy dream those books he pointed to the register and the prayer book were those upon the table last night they were in my dream a very vivid and real dream i thought i was standing here your man was beside me opposite to me was a girl or woman her face and figure covered with a hood so that i knew not what she was like then you read the marriage service drew the ring from off my finger and placed it upon hers and you pronounced us man and wife a strange and interesting dream what was the ring my lord a diamond ring set round with seven pearls within the crest of my house and my initials let me see the ring my lord he changed colour i cannot find it my lord i know where is that ring the doctor spoke gravely bending his great eyebrows lord chudleigh was a man of fine presence being at least five feet ten inches in height without counting the heels of his boots and the foretop of his wig yet the doctor whose heels were thicker and his toupee higher was six feet two without those advantages therefore he towered over his guest as he repeated i know where to find that ring you cannot mean doctor cried lord chudleigh all the blood flying to his face i mean my lord simply this that at eight o'clock this morning or thereabouts you rose came downstairs met a young lady who was waiting for you and were by me in presence of trustworthy witnesses duly and properly married but it was a dream he cried catching at the table no dream at all my lord a fact which you will find it difficult to contradict your marriage is entered in my register i have the lines on a five shilling stamp i am an ordained minister of the church of england the hours were canonical it is true that i may be fined a hundred pounds for consenting to perform the ceremony but it will be hard to collect that money meanwhile those who would inflict the fine would be the last to maintain that sacerdotal powers conferred upon me at ordination can suffer any loss by residence in the rules of the fleet ponder this my lord married cried lord chudleigh married it is impossible your dream my lord was no dream at all but sober truth believe me married he repeated married said doctor shovel i fear that your state of mind during the performance of the ceremony was not such as a clergyman could altogether wish to see still who am i to decide when a gentleman is too drunk to marry married oh this is some dreadful dream where is my bride show me my wife she is gone lord chudleigh gone where is she gone the doctor shook his head for an answer who is she what is her name how came she here i am sorry that i cannot answer your lordship in these particulars she came she was married she went away in her own good time she will doubtless appear again but who is she he repeated what is she like why did she marry me why did your lordship marry her that methinks would be the proper question show me your register man lord chudleigh was sober enough now and brought his fist down upon the table in peremptory fashion show me your register and your certificate ta ta ta cried the doctor softly young man softly we are not used to threats in this chapel of ease where i am archbishop bishop and chaplain all in one for the register it is securely locked up for the certificate it is perhaps in the hands of lady chudleigh lady chudleigh perhaps her ladyship hath consigned it to my keeping in either case you shall not see it this is a conspiracy cried lord chudleigh i have been deceived by rogues and knaves this is no true marriage you would say that i am lying say so but at your peril think so you are as truly married as if you had been united in your own parish church by your own bishop believe that for your own safety if you believe nothing else at the right time her ladyship will be revealed to you and remember my lord here the doctor towering over him shook his great forefinger in warning or menace should you attempt another marriage in the lifetime of your present wife you shall be brought to your trial for bigamy as sure as my name is gregory shovel laws in this country are not altogether made for the punishment of the poor and even a peer may not marry more than one woman i will have this wickedness exposed cried his lordship hotly alas my lord said the doctor the name of gregory shovel is already well known i am but what your father caused me to be my father then there is revenge the benefits which my father conferred upon you they were greater than any i can confer upon you he kept me with him as his private jester i found him wit he fed me upon promises he turned me forth to be flung into a debtor's prison that however was nothing your lordship will own here the doctor laughed but without merriment that i have returned good for evil for whereas your father robbed me of a wife i have presented you with one o villain cried my lord to revenge the wrongs of the father upon the son and this wretch continues to wear the gown of a clergyman say what you please so rejoiced am i with this day's work that i allow you to cast at me what names come readiest to your tongue but remember that curses sometimes come home where is my wife then he demanded furiously i shall not tell you meantime choose either let this matter be known to all the world or let it remain for the present a secret between you and me as for the lady she will be silent as for the rogue my clerk if he so much as breathes the secret to the cabbage stalks i have that which will hang him i want to see the woman who calls herself my wife he persisted that shall you not but perhaps my lord you would like to go home to st james's square with such a wedding party as we could provide for you a dozen of fleet parsons fuddled the bride's friends who might be called from their stalls in the market the music of the butchers with salt boxes marrow bones and cleavers the bride herself look out of the window my lord which of the ragged baggages and trollops among the market women most takes your lordship's fancy lord chudleigh looked and shuddered go your way the doctor went on and always remember you have a spouse some day for the better glorifying of your noble name i will produce her but not yet be under no immediate apprehension not yet at some future time when you are happy in the applause of a nation and the honours of a sovereign when your way is clear before you and your conscience gives you the sweet balm of approbation when you have forgotten this morning we shall come your wife and i with 'room for my lady chudleigh way there for her ladyship and doctor gregory shovel from the rules of the fleet' man replied lord chudleigh i believe you are a devil do what you will do your worst yet know that the woman may proclaim her infamy and your own as for me i will not speak to her nor listen to her nor own her good said the doctor rubbing his hands we talk in vain i now bid farewell to your lordship those convivial evenings which you desired to witness will still continue let me hope to welcome your lordship again on the scene of your unexpected triumphs many indeed is the man who hath come to this house single and gone out of it double but none for whom awaits a future of such golden promise my most hearty congratulations on this auspicious and joyful event what can come out of this place but youth beauty birth and virtue and yet my lord there is one singularity in the case one moment i pray for lord chudleigh was already outside the door you are the only man i ever knew who spent his honeymoon alone chapter xiv how mrs deborah was released no one would be interested to read more of my shame and repentance at that time nor does it help to tell how the doctor was asked by my ladies if i was subject to any kind of illness for which i might be sickening the reply of the doctor to them and his private admonitions to myself may be partly passed over it was true no doubt as he said while i trembled before him that a young girl ignorant and untaught would do well to trust her conscience into the spiritual direction of a regularly ordained clergyman of the church of england like himself as for the marriage i was to remember that it was done and could not be undone he hung round my neck by a black ribbon the diamond ring my wedding ring by which to keep my condition ever before myself to be sure it was not likely that i should forget it without the glitter and sparkle of the brilliants which i used to look at night and morning in secret what did he think of me this husband of mine the young man with the handsome face the white hands and the fixed strange eyes did he night and morning every day curse his unknown wife let him curse said the doctor words break no bones curses go home again deeds cannot be undone patience kitty before long thou shalt be confessed by all the world the lady chudleigh come cheer up child he concluded kindly as for what is done it is done partly i did it to clear off an old score whereof i may perhaps tell thee at another time and partly for thy honour and glory thy father kitty was proud of his name and family though he married my sister the daughter of a tenant farmer but never a pleydell yet has been lifted up so high as thou shalt be while as to the shovels i am myself the only great man they have yet sent into the world and they are not likely to go beyond the chaplain of the fleet then he held up his great forefinger as long and thick as a school ruler bent his shaggy eyebrows and pushed out his lips remember child silence and go no more moping and sorrowful because thou shalt soon sit in thine own coach with the world at thy feet singing the praises of the beautiful lady chudleigh such a girl as my kitty for sir miles lackington why he hath eyes for the beauty of a glass of bordeaux he hath sense to rejoice over a bowl of punch but from helen of troy or cleopatra of egypt he would turn away for a bottle of port or stallabras now should such a creature as he presume to think of such a woman let poets sing of women at a distance the farther off the better they sing that is right why child such curls as thine such roses of red and white such brown eyes such lips and cheek and chin such a figure as thou canst show to dazzle the eyes of foolish boys lord chudleigh should go on his knees before me in gratitude and transport and believe me some day he will we are all alike we women call us beautiful and you please us it was almost the first time that any one had called me beautiful save sir miles lackington when in his cups or solomon stallabras in his poetic way yet every pretty girl knows that she is pretty there are a thousand things to tell her the whispers of the women the sidelong looks of the folk in the streets the envy of envious girls the praise of kindly girls her glass the deference paid by men of all classes and all ages to beauty the warnings of teachers nurses governesses and matrons that beauty is but skin deep virtue is better than looks handsome is as handsome does 'tis better to be good than pretty comeliness lasts but a year while goodness lasts for ever and so on all these things make a girl on whom heaven has bestowed this most excellent gift of beauty know quite as well as other people what she possesses though she knows not yet the power of the gift you are pretty child said mrs esther to me on the very same day as the doctor you will be a beautiful woman which is no good to a girl in the rules said mrs deborah but rather a snare and a danger nay sister said mrs esther it is a consolation to be beautiful you dear when we were thirty years younger were beautiful enough to melt the heart even of the monster bambridge a beautiful face and person mrs deborah added with a smile on her poor face as she thought of the past should belong to a good and virtuous soul in the better world i have no doubt that the spirits of the just will arise in such beauty of face and form as shall be unto themselves and their friends an abiding joy let us think so when i die it may be a consolation to me that a return to the beauty of my youth is nigh at hand i am but a woman and there is nothing in the world except the love of my husband and my children that i think more precious than my past beauty soothed then by my uncle's flatteries comforted by his promises and terrified by his admonitions i fell in a very few days into the dreams by which youth beguiles the cares of the present my husband lord chudleigh would go his own way and never ask after me i should go mine as if he did not exist some time or other we should leave the liberties of the fleet and go to live near lady levett and my dear nancy as for the coronet and the rank i was too ignorant to think much about them they were so high above me i knew so little what they meant that i no more thought of getting them than of getting david's harp and crown i waited therefore being a wife and yet no wife married and yet never seen by my husband sacrificed to the wrath of the doctor as that poor greek maiden in the story told me by my father murdered at aulis to appease the wrath of a goddess two events happened which between them quite drove the marriage out of my mind and for awhile made me forget it altogether the first of these was the illness of mrs deborah there was fever about the market as i have said one of the little girls of mrs dunquerque in our house was laid down with it in autumn there was always fever in the place caused my ladies said by the chill and fog of the season by the stench of the vegetables and fruit of the market and perhaps by the proximity of newgate where gaol fever was always cheating the gallows one day therefore mrs deborah lay down and said she would rather not get up again any more she would not eat nor would she have any medicine except a little tar water which seemed to do her no good when she got very ill indeed she consented to see an apothecary he prescribed blood letting which contrary to expectation made her only weaker then we went to the old woman who kept a herb shop at the other end of fleet lane and was more skilful than any physician she gave us feverfew camomile and dandelion of which we made hot drinks as the patient grew worse instead of better she made an infusion of shepherd's purse pennycress and pepperwort to stimulate the system she brought a tansy pudding which poor mrs deborah refused to eat and when gentian water failed the old woman could do no more on the fifth day mrs deborah gave herself up and contemplated her end in a becoming spirit of cheerfulness she comforted her sister with the hope that she too would before long join her in a world where there is no noise my dear no fighting no profane swearing no dirt no confusion no bawling no starving no humiliation there shall we sit in peace and quiet enjoying the dignity and respect which will be no doubt paid to two christian gentlewomen i might have known it sighed poor mrs esther in her tears only a week ago a strange dog howled all night below our window i should have known it for a warning sent for you my dear or me or for kitty it cannot have been meant for sir miles for the poor gentleman being in his cups would not notice it nor to mr stallabras for he sets no store by such warnings it was for me said mrs deborah with resignation while mrs esther went on recollecting omens last night i heard the death watch then indeed sister i gave you up it was a message for me said the sick woman as if she had been christiana in the story and this morning i heard a hen crow in the market a hen in a basket alas who can have any doubt it is but six weeks said mrs deborah feebly since a hearse on its way to a funeral stopped before our door i remember now but we little thought then what that meant i saw only a fortnight ago continued mrs esther a winding sheet in the tallow i thought it pointed at kitty but would not frighten the child sister we are but purblind mortals far be it from me to laugh at beliefs which have so deep a root in englishwomen's hearts nor is it incredible to those who believe in the divine interference that signs and warnings of death should be sent beforehand if only to turn the thoughts heavenward and lead sinners to repent but this i think that if poor mrs deborah had not accepted these warnings for herself she might have lived on to a green old age as did her sister being therefore convinced in her mind that her time was come she was only anxious to make due preparation she would have been disappointed at getting well as one who has packed her boxes for a long journey but is told at the last moment that she must wait as she grew weaker her brain began to wander she talked of bagnigge wells of cupid's garden the entertainments of her father's company and the childish days when everything was hopeful while she talked mrs esther wept and whispered to me she was so pretty and merry oh child if you could have seen us both in our young days if you could have seen my deborah with her pretty saucy ways her roguish smile her ready wit made all to love her ah me me those happy days and now my dear deborah it is well that thou shouldst go this was on the morning of mrs deborah's last day in life in the afternoon her senses returned to her and we propped her up pale and weak and listened while she spoke words of love and farewell to be kept sacred in the memory of those who had to go on living for thirty years dear sister she murmured while their two thin hands were held in each other's clasp for thirty years we have prayed daily unto the lord to have pity upon all prisoners and captives meaning more especially ourselves now unto me hath he shown this most excellent mercy and calleth me away to a much better place than we can imagine or deserve i had thought it would be well if he would lead us out of this ward to some place where in green lanes and fields we might meditate for a space in quiet before we died i should like to have heard the song of the lark and seen the daisies but god thinks otherwise oh sister sister cried mrs esther 'there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain' said mrs deborah kitty child she turned her pale face to me be kind to my sister we wept together outside there was the usual tumult of the market men buying and selling with shouts and cries within three women weeping and one dying go dear said she who was dying call the doctor he hath been very generous to us tell him i would receive the last offices from his hands the doctor came he read the appointed service in that deep voice of his which was surely given him for the conversion of the wicked the tears streamed down his face as he bent over the bed saying in the words of the epistle appointed 'my daughter despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every child whom he receiveth' in the evening the poor lady died being released from her long imprisonment by that royal mandate the will of god we buried her in the green and pleasant churchyard of islington it is a sweet spot far removed from the noise of london and though her poor remains feel nothing nor can hear any more the tumult of crowds it is good to think that round her are no streets only the few houses of the village she lies surrounded by fields and trees the daisies grow over her grave the lark sings above the church she is at rest and in peace chapter xv how mrs esther was discharged after poor mrs deborah's death my lessons came to a sudden stop and have never been resumed some of that perspicacity of style which i have often admired in our modern divines might have fallen to my lot to enrich this narrative had i continued in my course of single and double book keeping i am not clever said mrs esther like deborah she was always the clever one as well as the beauty that gave her a right to her little temper poor dear i cannot teach astronomy because one star is to me exactly like another nor do i know aught about book keeping except that it is a very useful and necessary science therefore kitty thou must go untaught for that matter i think you know as much as a woman need ever know which is to read to write but one ought not to expect of a woman such exactness in spelling as of a scholar and to cipher to such a moderate degree as may enable her to add up her bills but it grieves me to think you are growing up so tall and straight without learning how to make so much as a single cordial or any strong waters and with our means what chance of teaching you to toss a pancake fold an omelette or dish a yorkshire pudding it was then that we began to console ourselves for my ignorance our troubles and even i bear mind for our late loss by reading clarissa a book which the doctor ever watchful in the interests of virtue presented to mrs esther with a speech of condolence he said that it was a work whose perusal could not fail most strongly to console her spirit and to dispose her for resignation while for purity of morals for justice of observation and for knowledge of the human heart it was unequalled in any language he then made a digression and compared the work with the ancient greek romances adventure he said was to be found in heliodorus and the story told by apuleius of cupid and psyche was exquisitely pathetic yet none of the earlier writers could be compared or even named in the same breath with mr richardson who reminded him especially of sophocles in the tenderness with which he prepared the minds of his audience for the impending tragedy which he could not alter or abate seeing that it was the will of necessity there was nothing he went on to say more calculated to inspire or to strengthen sentiments of virtue in the breasts of the young and especially in the young of the feminine sex than a contemplation of clarissa's virtue and lovelace's wickedness we were greatly edified by these praises coming from so great a scholar and one so eminently fitted to discourse on virtue we received the work prepared so far as i was concerned to partake of food for reflection of the satisfying kind so that the reader quickly lays aside the work while he meditates for a few days on what he has read which is supplied by the pious drelincourt on death hervey's meditations among the tombs or young's night thoughts after dinner my dear said mrs esther you shall read it aloud to me do not stop if i shut my eyes in order to hear the better these good books should be carefully listened to and read very slowly otherwise their lessons may be overlooked and this would be a sad pity after all the good doctor's trouble in first reading the book for us what scholarship kitty and what a passion nay what an ardour for virtue animates that reverend heart i cannot but pause here to ask whether if mr richardson had chosen to depict to the life the character of a clergyman who had fallen into such ways as my uncle with his sins his follies his degradation the doctor would himself have laid it to heart alas i fear not we know not ourselves as we are we still go dreaming we are something better than we seem to others we have a second and unreal self the shafts of the satirist seem to pierce the hearts of others i am sure that many a lovelace fresh from the ruin of another clarissa if indeed there could be another creature so incomparable must have read this great romance with tears of pity and indignation otherwise the race of lovelaces would long since have become extinct we received therefore clarissa expecting edification but not joy we even put it aside for a week because mrs esther hardly felt herself at first strong enough to begin a new book which might flood her mind with new ideas and make her unsettled at last however she felt that we must no longer postpone obeying the doctor only a short chapter my dear to begin with heavens how shall we struggle through eight long volumes i shall be ever thankful that it was my duty to read these dear delightful pages of this great romance you may judge of our joy when we read on day after day hurrying over household work in the morning neglecting our walks abroad and wasting candlelight in the evening the more to enjoy it we laid aside the book from time to time while we wept over the author's pathetic scenes oh the horrid usage of poor clarissa was ever girl more barbarously served was ever man so wicked as her lover were parents ever so blinded by prejudice had girl ever so unkind a brother ever so perverse a sister i thought of her all day long and at night i dreamed of her the image of clarissa was never absent from my brain everything in the book was as real to me as the adventures of robinson crusoe or those of christian on his pilgrimage from the city of destruction so long as the reading of this immortal book lasted we read page after page twice thrice or four times over to get out of them the fullest measure of sympathy sorrow and delight we loved with clarissa her sorrows were ours we breathed and talked clarissa mrs esther even prayed i believe though the book was already printed and therefore it was too late for prayer that the poor sweet innocent might escape the clutches of her wicked lover who sure was more a demon than a man we carried the thought of clarissa even to church with us we invited our friends to share with us this new found joy solomon stallabras was always ready to weep with us over a dish of tea never any man had a heart more formed for the tenderest sensibility pity that his nose was so broad and so much turned up otherwise this natural tenderness might have been manifested in his countenance while i read he gazed upon my face and was fain from time to time to draw forth his handkerchief and wipe the tears from his streaming eyes stop miss kitty he would say let us pause awhile let us come back to virtue and ourselves it is too much the spectacle of so much youth and beauty so much innocence the fate of our poor clarissa read by a nymph whose lot is so below her merits it is too much mrs pimpernel it is indeed in some way while i read this poet whose imagination as became his profession was strong mixed up clarissa with myself and imagined that my ending might be in some way similar to that of the heroine now with solomon stallabras to think was to believe nothing was wanting but a lovelace i believe that he waited about the market in hopes of finding him lurking in some corner perhaps he even suspected poor sir miles had he found him he assured mrs esther he fully intended to pierce him to the heart with a spit or skewer from one of the butcher's stalls adding that it would be sweet for him to die even from the cart at tyburn for my sake but no lovelace was trying to make me leave my shelter with mrs esther sometimes sir miles lackington came to join in the reading but we found him wanting in sensibility without that quality richardson's novels cannot be enjoyed he inclined rather to the low humour which makes men enjoy fielding's tom jones or smollett's peregrine pickle works full no doubt of a coarse vitality which some men like but quite wanting in the delicate shades of feeling that commend an author to the delicacy of gentlewomen and to think that old samuel richardson was nothing but a printer by trade heaven which denied this most precious gift of creation to such tender and poetic souls as that of solomon stallabras vouchsafed to bestow it upon a printer a mechanical printer who if he was not paid for setting up type himself yet employed common workmen superintended their labours paid them their wages and put profits into his purse it seems incredible but then shakespeare was only an actor the sunshine of genius said solomon falls upon the children of the lowly as well as those of the rich i am myself a scion of fetter lane sometimes indeed sir miles lackington was so wanting in delicacy and so rude as to laugh at us for our tears you cry over richardson he said but if i were to bring you 'tom jones' i warrant you would laugh 'tom jones' said mrs esther is clearly a work of coarseness ladies do not wish to laugh the laws of decorum forbid unrestrained mirth to females of good breeding fielding may suit the pewter pots of the tavern richardson goes best with the silver service of the mansion we looked about us as if our room was the mansion and our cupboard was lined with silver dishes sir miles laughed again give me a pewter mug well filled and often filled he said with 'tom jones' to bear it company and i ask no more 'clarissa' and the silver service may remain with you ladies strange however that folk should prefer a printer to a gentleman why fielding comes of an honourable house gentle blood replied mrs esther does not unfortunately always bring the gifts of poetry and sensibility you are yourself of gentle birth sir miles yet you own that you love not richardson many great authors have been of lowly extraction and mr stallabras was saying finely but yesterday that the sunshine of genius falls upon the children of the poor as often as upon those of the rich solomon inclined his head and coloured sir miles laughed again in his easy fashion but he said mr richardson knows nothing about the polite ton his men are master tradesmen disguised in swords and scarlet coats they are religious tradesmen wicked tradesmen and so forth but they are not gentlemen they cannot talk think or walk write or act like gentlemen if we want to read about polite society let us at least ask gentlemen to write for us sir miles read little yet his judgment was generally right and since i have seen the society of which richardson wrote i have learned that he was right in this case for richardson pathetic and powerful as he is had certainly never been among the class whose manners and conversation he attempted to portray presently we finished clarissa with floods of tears i believe that no book was ever written which has caused so many tears as this work just then it was about the end of the year we had already eaten our christmas plum porridge in the darkest and deadest time of the year the time when fogs fall over the town by day and stop all work when nights are long and days short when the market was quiet at night because it was too cold to stand about or to lie in the open when all the fighting and brawling were over before five o'clock and the evenings were tranquil though they were long it was just after we ended our book and were still tearful under its influence that our deliverance came to us i think it was on the st of december in that same year of grace seventeen hundred and fifty in which i had come to the liberties and twenty nine full years with some eleven months since the poor ladies had been incarcerated i well remember the day though not certain of the date it was evening we had finished work supper was on the table when we should care to take it bread and an excellent dutch cheese the candle was extinguished and we were sitting before the fire mrs esther was talking as women love sometimes to talk about the little things they remember she was telling me not for the first time of the great frost of when she was a young girl and of the fair which they held upon the ice of the dreadful scare there was in from the number of highwaymen and footpads for whose apprehension the government offered as much as l a head of orator henley who began to preach in clare market shortly after the ladies came to the fleet of the dreadful storm in which killed the famous colony of sparrows in the mile end road of the long frost of when from christmas unto february the poor watermen and fishermen could not earn a single penny of the fever of of the banishment of papists before the pretender's landing in of the great rebellion of when the city so nobly did its duty my dear she said we that is the citizens because the prisoners of the fleet and the persons who enjoy the liberties could hardly be expected to contribute money or aught but prayers and most of the poor creatures but little used to praying raised twelve thousand shirts with as many garments to correspond ten thousand woollen caps to serve i suppose as nightcaps for our brave fellows when they slept in the open air ten thousand pairs of stockings twelve thousand gloves a thousand blankets which only makes one blanket for twelve men but i hope they took turns about and nine thousand spatterdashes there was a camp on finchley common of which we heard but did not visit the militia were kept in readiness a double watch was set at every one of the city gates there were some in the liberties who thought that a successful invasion of england might lead to the burning of account books registers ledgers and warrants in which case we might all get out and keep out for my own part my dear and for my sister deborah's part i am happy to say that we preferred the protestant succession even to our own freedom and wished for no such lawless ending to a captivity however unjust but prayed night and day for the confusion of the young pretender happily our prayers were answered and great george preserved then we talked of the past year how it had brought mrs esther a daughter as she was good enough to say and taken away a sister she cried a little over her loss but presently recovered and taking my hand in hers said many kind and undeserved things to me who had been often petulant and troublesome as that we must not part who had been so strangely brought together unless my happiness should take me away from the fleet i thought then of my husband and wondered if he would ever come to take me away and then said that as we were at new year's eve we should make good resolutions for the next year which were to be kept resolutely not broken and thrown away that for her part she designed if i agreed and consented to the change to call me niece and i should call her aunt by which mutual adoption of each other our affection and duty one towards the other would be strengthened and founded as it were on a sure and stable basis not my dear she added that you can ever call yourself a pimpernel an honour granted to few or that you should ever wish to change your name but in all other respects you shall be the same as if you were indeed my own niece the daughter of my brother but i never had one or sister but i had only one and she was as myself truly the pleydells are a worthy family of whom we have no need to be ashamed i was assuring her that nothing could alter my love and gratitude for her exceeding kindness when we heard footsteps and voices on the stairs and presently a knock at the door and the doctor stood before us behind him were sir miles lackington and solomon stallabras madam said the doctor i wish you a good evening with the compliments of the season merry as well as happy may you be next year i declare that directly i saw his face my heart leaped into my mouth i knew that he was come with great and glorious news for his eyes glowed with the light of some suppressed knowledge and a capacious smile began with his lips and glowed over the vast expanse of his ruddy cheeks merry doctor no but happy if god will ta ta ta we shall see he replied now madam i have a thing to say which will take some time to say i have taken the liberty of bringing with me a bottle of good old port the best to be procured which strengthens the nerves and acts as a sovereign cordial in cases of sudden excitement besides it is to night new year's eve when all should rejoice he produced the bottle from under his gown and placed it on the table i have also taken the liberty to bring with me our friends and well wishers sir miles lackington and mr stallabras partly to to here he remembered that a corkscrew was not likely to be among our possessions to draw the cork of the bottle a thing which sir miles does with zeal and propriety the baronet with great gravity advanced and performed the operation by a dexterous handling of the poker which detached the upper part of the neck so continued the doctor and partly that they too who have been so long our true and faithful friends may hear what i have to say and so that we may all rejoice together and if need be sing psalms with merry hearts merry hearts were we to sing psalms with merry hearts in the place where for thirty years every day had brought with it its own suffering and disgrace to this poor lady yet what news could the doctor have which made his purple face so glad as if the sunlight instead of our fire of cannel coal was shining full upon it kitty child he went on light candles not one candle two candles three candles four candles all the candles you have in the place we will have an illumination sir miles will you please to sit mr stallabras will you take kitty's chair she will be occupied in serving glasses child for this honourable company why he banged his fist upon the table but with consideration for it was not so strong as his own great table why i am happier this night than ever i have been before i think in all my life such a story as i have to tell i placed on the table the three candlesticks which formed all our stock and set candles in them and lit them i put out such glasses as we had and then i stood beside mrs esther's chair and took her hand in mine i knew not what to expect yet i was certain that it was something very good for mrs esther had it been for me the doctor would have sent for me or for himself he would have told it without this prodigality of joy surely it must be for my good patron and protector my pulses were bounding and i could see that mrs esther too was rapidly rising to the same excitement certain i am said sir miles that something has happened doctor let us quickly congratulate you let us drink your health i burn to drink some one's health should something have happened said the poet i would it were something good for ladies who shall be nameless stay said the doctor he stood while the rest were sitting he thus increased the natural advantage of his great proportions we are not yet come to the drinking of healths but mrs pimpernel i must first invite you before i go on with what i have to say to take a glass of this most generous vintage the grapes which produced it grew fat and strong in thinking of the noble part they were about to fulfil the sunshine of spain passed into their juices and filled them with the spirit of strength and confidence that spirit lies imprisoned in the bottle before us it does it does murmured sir miles gazing thoughtfully at the bottle he ought to have been a poet whispered solomon the doctor looked round impatiently and swept the folds of his gown behind him with a large gesture for what did the grapes rejoice why was the vintage more than commonly rich because in the fulness of time it was destined to comfort the heart and to strengthen the courage of a most worthy and cruelly tried lady indeed mrs pimpernel wonderful are the decrees of heaven drink madam he poured out a glass of wine and handed it to her she stared in his face almost stupidly she was trying to repress a wild thought which seized her her lips were parted her gaze fixed her hands trembling drink it madam ordered the doctor what is it oh what is it she cried drink the wine madam said sir miles kindly believe me the wine will give you courage i took the glass and held it to her lips while she drank submissively with a bottle of port before him said sir miles encouragingly a man may have patience for anything with the help of such a friend would i receive with resignation and joy good fortune for myself or disasters to all my cousins male and female go on doctor the lady hath taken one glass to prepare her palate for the next patience now said the doctor and silence all of you solomon stallabras if you liken me again to a poet you shall leave this room and lose the joy of hearing what i have to tell it is now some three months that the thought came into my mind of investigating the case of certain prisoners lying forgotten in the prison or dragging along a wretched existence in the rules it matters not what these cases were or how i have sped in my search one case however has filled me with gratitude and joy because madam he turned suddenly on poor mrs esther you will please to listen patiently this case concerns the unhappy fate of two poor ladies their history gentlemen oh why could he not get on faster is partly known to you they were daughters of a most worthy and respected city merchant who in his time served many civic offices with dignity and usefulness including the highest he was a benefactor to his parish beautified his church and died leaving behind him two young daughters the youngest of whom came of age in the year to each of them he left a large fortune no less than twenty thousand pounds alas gentlemen this money placed in the hands of their guardian and trustee a friend as honourable as the late lord mayor himself the ladies' father namely alderman medlicott was in the year shamefully pillaged and stolen by the alderman's clerk one christopher march insomuch that the alderman having gone mad by reason of his losses the poor girls had no longer any fortune or any friends to help for in that bad time most all the merchants were hit and every one had to look after himself as best he could also this plundering villain had so invested part of their money in their own name by forgeries as to make them liable for large sums which they had not the means of paying they were therefore arrested and confined in the prison hard by where under the rule of the rogue bambridge they suffered many things which it is painful to recall or to think about presently however that tormentor and plague of the human race captivorum flagellum scourge of innocent captives and languishing debtors having been mercifully removed and having hung himself like judas and so gone to his own place these ladies found the necessary security which ensures for all of us this partial liberty with the opportunity should we embrace it of improving the golden hours in other words gentlemen they came out of the prison and have ever since dwelt amongst us in this place gentlemen we have with us here many improvident and foolish persons who have mostly by their own misconduct reduced themselves to our unhappy condition it needs not that in this place which is not a pulpit i should speak of those who have gambled away their property sir miles shook his head or drank it away sir miles stared straight at the ceiling or have missed their chances or been forgotten by fortune mr stallabras groaned of these things i will not speak but it is a thing notorious to all of us that the liberties are not the chosen home of virtue here temperance sobriety morality gentle words courteous bearing truth honour kindness of thought and charity which seeketh not her own are rarely illustrated and discourteously entreated wherefore i say that for two ladies to have steadfastly resisted all the temptations of this place and to have exhibited so that all might copy the exemplar of a perfect christian life during thirty years is a fact which calls for the gratitude as well as the astonishment of the wondering rules he ought to have been a began solomon stallabras wiping a sympathetic tear but caught the doctor's frowning eye and stopped an an archbishop he added presently with a little hesitation sir said the doctor you are right i ought to have been an archbishop many an archbishop's latin verses have been poor indeed compared with mine but to proceed madam i would fain not be tedious oh sir said mrs esther whose brain seemed confused with this strange exordium after thirty years or thereabouts of most undeserved captivity and forced retirement from the polite world which they were born to adorn these ladies found themselves by the will of providence forced to separate one of them winged her glad flight to heaven the other was permitted to remain awhile below it was then that i began to investigate the conditions of their imprisonment madam he turned suddenly to mrs esther so that she started in her chair and trembled violently think of what you would most wish name no trifling matter it is not a gift of a guinea or two the bettering of a meal the purchase of a blanket the helping of a poor family no boon or benefit of a day or two let your imagination rove set her free think boldly aim high think of the best and most desirable thing of all she tried to speak her lips parted she half rose catching at my hand but her words were refused utterance her cheek grew so pale and white that i thought she would have swooned and seized her in my arms being so much stronger and bigger then i ventured to speak being moved myself to a flood of tears oh madam dear madam the doctor is not jesting with you he hath in his hands the thing that we desire most of all he brings you i am sure great news the greatest oh sir i spoke now for her who was struck dumb with hope fear and astonishment what can this poor lady want but her release from this dreadful place what can she pray for what can she ask morning and night after all these years of companionship with profligates spendthrifts rogues and villains the noisy market people the poor suffering women and children of this den of infamy but her deliverance sir if you have brought her that tell her so at once to ease her mind well said kitty cried sir miles doctor speak out no poet not even alexander pope could have spoken more eloquently cried solomon stallabras as for mrs esther she drew herself gently from me and stood with her handkerchief in her hand and tears in her eyes her poor thin figure trembling i have brought with me said the doctor taking her hand and kissing it the release of the most innocent prisoner in the world she steadied herself for a few moments then she spoke clearly and calmly that she said has ever been the utmost of my desire i have desired it so long and so vehemently with my sister deborah to whom it has been granted that it has become part of my very being i have desired it i think even more than my sister thirty years have i been a prisoner in the fleet though for twenty six in the enjoyment of these so called liberties gentlemen you know full well what manner of life has been ours you know the sights the sounds the wickednesses of this place here sir miles hung his head i am as the doctor most kindly hath told you a gentlewoman born my father besides being a great and honourable merchant of this most noble city of london once lord mayor an alderman of portsoken ward and worshipful master of the company of armour scourers was also a true christian man and taught us early the doctrines and virtues of the true faith we were educated as heiresses we were delicately brought up in the love of duty and religion too delicately for women fated to herd with the worst and bear the worst it is therefore no merit of ours if we have behaved according to our lights as christian gentlewomen yet sirs kind friends it has been great unhappiness to us bear with me a little for when i think of my sister's sufferings and my own i fain must weep it has been believe me great great unhappiness i think we all wept with her yet it was astonishing to see with what quiet dignity she spoke resuming at a moment's notice the air not only of a gentlewoman which she had never lost but of one who is no longer troubled by being in a false position and can command as well as receive respect i saw before me a great city lady as she had been trained and brought up to be small though she was her dignity made her tall as her unmerited sufferings and patience made her great sir miles laid his hand on the poet's shoulder great heaven he cried canst thou weep any more over the misfortunes of clarissa with this poor lady's sorrows in thy recollection the doctor wiped his eyes but for those backslidings which we have already lamented what an admirable character how full of generosity how full of sympathy how kind of heart was my uncle pray madam he said be seated again will you take another glass of wine no doctor she replied this is now no case for the help of wine pray finish the story of your benevolent care why madam as for benevolence he said i have but done what sir miles lackington or solomon stallabras the poet spread his arms and tapped his breast would have done had they possessed the power of doing what indeed this crying slip of a girl would have done had she known how benevolence are we then old bailey prisoners chained by the leg until the time comes for us to go forth to tyburn tree are we common rogues and vagabonds that have no bowels can such a life as yours be contemplated with unmoved eyes is sir miles a lovelace for hardness of heart or solomon stallabras a salamander am i a nero nay madam speak no more of benevolence know then that of all the people whom the conduct of the villain christopher march with regard to your affairs injured but two are left alive the heirs of the rest are scattered and dispersed these two have prospered and are generous as well as old their hearts melted at the tale of suffering they have agreed together to give back to you not only the security which keeps you here but also a formal release of your debt to them you can go whenever you please why then shouted sir miles grasping the bottle we can drink her stay said the doctor there is one thing more this generous gift restores to you not only liberty but also your father's country estate in hertfordshire worth six hundred pounds a year and here madam are the papers which vouch for all you have now your own estate and are once more a gentlewoman of fortune and position she took the papers and held them grasped tightly in her lap and now gentlemen said the doctor gently taking the bottle from the baronet's hand we will drink you too kitty my dear must join a happy new year to mrs esther pimpernel they drank it with no more words and sir miles fell on his knees and kissed her hand but without speaking aught mrs esther sat still and quiet trying to recover herself but the first eloquence would not return and she could not speak for crying and sobbing in broken words she said while she caught the doctor's great hand and held it that he had been in very sooth her guardian angel that it was he who had rescued her sister and herself from the monster bambridge and the horrors of the prison that but for him they would long ago have starved that but for him she should have languished for the rest of her days in the rules then she prayed that god would reward the protector and defender of the poor the doctor drew away his hand and without a word walked out of the room with hanging head followed by sir miles and mr stallabras we shall go my sweet kitty together we shall leave this dreadful place she murmured when we were alone what is mine is yours my child let us humbly to our knees part ii the queen of the wells chapter i how we returned to the polite world we love those places most where we lived when we were young and where we were wooed and won and where we had those sweet dreams which can only come to the very young of a happy future impossible in this transitory and fleeting life dear to me and romantic are the scenes which to many are associated with disease and infirmity or at best with the mad riot of the race the assembly and the ball truly there is no time for a woman like the time when she is young and beautiful and is courted by a troop of lovers she feels her power though she does not understand it she remembers it long after the power has gone with the witchery of bright eyes soft cheeks and blooming youth i think there can never be any faith or hope in the future so strong as to resist the sigh over the past the feeling that it is better to be young than to be old to blossom than to wither when we went to epsom wells we had managed between us by silence as to the past and a tacit understanding to forget the rules altogether forgetting indeed is easy surely the butterfly forgets the days when it was a mere crawling grub cophetua's queen no doubt soon learned to believe that she had royal blood or blue blood at least in her peasant veins for my own part i think the king should have mated with one nearer his own rank there is little difficulty in putting out of sight what we wish forgotten there was a man for instance about the fleet market running odd jobs who actually had forgotten that he was once hanged the people used to go there on purpose to see the wretch who was i remember bow legged and long armed with broad shoulders his face was marked with smallpox he squinted he had a great scar upon his cheek the bridge of his nose was broken he had no forehead visible his ears projected on either side and were long like the ears of a mule his eye teeth were like tusks and as for his expression it was that which john bunyan may have had in his mind when he wrote about the mob in vanity fair or the ill favoured ones who got over the wall and accosted christiana an expression which one may briefly describe as indicating a mind not set upon spiritual things now this man had actually once been hanged but being taken away after the hanging to barber surgeons' hall near st giles's church cripplegate was then restored to life by one who thought to dissect him that was why everybody looked after him and would have asked him questions if they had dared accost such a ruffian for it seemed to the unthinking as if he alone among living men had like dante and virgil gone into the regions of the dead conversed with the spirits of the unjust being himself a monstrous criminal and after witnessing their tortures had returned to the living to those who bribed him with rum and then put questions he replied that as for the hanging it might be as the gentleman said but he had forgotten it as for what he saw between his hanging and his restoration to life he had forgotten that too now if a man can forget having been hung it stands to reason that he can forget anything at all events without the insensibility of this wretch we speedily agreed to forget the fleet rules and in all our conversations to make as if we had never been there at all and knew of the place if at all then only by hearsay and common bruit and rumour as for the chaplain of the fleet the great promoter of those marriages which made the place infamous and the chief performer of them notorious we agreed that we were only to think of him as our benefactor not that we put these resolutions into words but we arrived at them in the manner common among women with whom a smile or a glance is as intelligible as many words with a bottle of wine among men it was due to this desire to forget the past that we never even read through the farewell to the fleet presented to us by mr solomon stallabras on the morning of our departure the first four lines which was as far as i got ran as follows with easy air of conscious worth expressed fair pimpernel her sorrows oft addressed the listening echoes poured her sighs abroad which all unheard by men were heard by god he handed the verses to us with a low bow as we stepped into the coach leaving him behind still poor wretch enjoying the liberties we first repaired with the view of spending a period of retirement to a convenient lodging in red lion street where mrs esther set herself seriously to resume the dress manner language and feelings of a gentlewoman we have been she said like the sun in eclipse it is true that one does not cease to enjoy under all circumstances the pride of gentle birth which has been my chief consolation during all our troubles but if one cannot illustrate to the eyes of the world the dignified deportment and genteel appearance due to that position the possession of the privilege is a mere private grace like the gift of good temper patience or hope at first and for some weeks we held daily conversations and consultations on the subject of dress we were as may be guessed somewhat like pocahontas of virginia when she left the savages and came into the polite world because we had to begin from the very first having hardly anything in which a lady could go abroad and very little in which she could sit at home truly delightful was it to receive every day the packages of brocades lace satins silks sarsnets besides chintzes muslins woollen things and fine linen wherewith to deck ourselves and to talk with the dressmaker over the latest fashion the most proper style for madam a lady no longer young and for me who as a girl should be dressed modestly and yet fashionably we must go fine child said mrs esther i for my part because a fine appearance is due to my position you because you are young and beautiful the gallants to do them justice are never slow in running after a pretty face but they are only fixed by a pretty face in a pretty setting alas to think that my face pretty or not already belonged willy nilly to a man who had never run after it mrs esther found that not only the fashions of dress but those of furniture of language of manners and of thought were changed since her long imprisonment began we therefore made it our endeavour by reading papers by watching people and by going to such places as the mall the park and even the fashionable churches to catch as far as possible the mode mrs esther never quite succeeded retaining to the last a touch of antiquated manners an old fashioned bearing and trick of speech which greatly became her though she knew it not meanwhile we held long and serious talk about the rust of thirty years and the best way to wear it off in one of the sermons of the reverend melchior smallbrook a divine now forgotten but formerly much read the learned clergyman states that the sunshine of prosperity is only dangerous to that soul in which tares are as ready to spring as wheat adducing as a remarkable example and proof of this opinion the modern prelates of the church of england whose lives he said are always models to less fortunate christians although their fortunes are so great now in mrs esther's soul were no tares at all so that the sunshine of prosperity caused no decrease or diminution of her virtues she only changed for the better and especially in point of cheerfulness and confidence for instance whereas we were formerly wont being poorly clad to creep humbly to church sit in the seats reserved for the poor which have no backs to them because the bishops consider the backs of the poor to be specially strengthened by providence which hath laid such heavy burdens upon them and afterwards spend the day sadly over hervey's meditations among the tombs we now went in hoops laces mantles or cardinals with faces patched to the new church in queen square where we had front seats in the gallery and after church we dined off roast meat with pudding and after dinner read such discourses as presented instead of penitential meditations a thankful nay a cheerful view of life i am sure for my own part i found the change greatly for the better but we made no new friends because mrs esther wished to remain in strict retirement until she had recovered what she called the pimpernel manner it is a manner my dear as you will perceive when i recover it at once dignified and modest my father and my grandfather both lord mayors possessed it to an eminent degree and were justly celebrated for it my poor sister would never have acquired it being by nature too sprightly i was gradually learning it when our misfortunes came naturally afterwards it would have been absurd to cultivate its further development the pimpernel manner would have been thrown away in such a place as that to which we retired i am so stupid that i never clearly understood the pimpernel manner even when mrs esther afterwards assured me that she had now fully recovered it meantime my education was resumed in the lighter departments no girl who had once tackled book keeping by single and double entry could want any more solid instruction my guardian played the harpsichord for me while my dancing master gave me lessons in the minuet or she personated a duchess a countess or even the most exalted lady in the land while the master a pink of courtesy who had once danced on the boards of drury lane presented me dressed in hoops and a train i was so diligent in dancing that i was soon ready he assured me to make a figure at any assembly whether at bath epsom tunbridge wells vauxhall or ranelagh but for the present these gaieties had to be postponed partly because the pimpernel manner was slow in developing and without it my guardian would not stir abroad partly because we had no gentleman to go with us sir miles lackington would i am sure have gone with us had we asked him to take us but he was not to be depended upon if a bottle of wine came in the way solomon stallabras would have gone but the poor poet had no clothes fit for a polite assembly moreover there was an objection mrs esther said to both those gentlemen that the fact of their being in the enjoyment of the liberties of the fleet might have been thrown in our teeth at a polite assembly it seemed to me then being ignorant of the extreme wickedness of men a grievous thing that gentlewomen cannot go whithersoever they please without the protection of a man what sort of an age i asked is this which pretends to have cast aside gothic barbarism yet cannot suffer its ladies to go unprotected for fear of insult or damage to their reputation scourers and mohocks i said no longer infest the streets which are for the most part secure even from footpads and purse cutters i was as yet however unacquainted with that class of man which loves to follow a woman to stare at her and to make her tremble with fear being no better but rather worse than so many highwaymen common bullies and professed rogues sir miles lackington did not desert us neither my cruelty he said nor his own unworthiness could persuade him to do that he must needs follow and worship at the shrine of his unattainable sun and shining star with such nonsense as men will still be talking even when they know that the woman is not for them on the occasion of the first visit i privately informed him that we wished to have no mention made of the place where we were once residing he very kindly agreed to silence on this point and we sustained between us a conversation after the manner of polite circles sir miles would ask us with a pinch of snuff if we liked our present lodging which was as i have said in red lion street not far from the fields and the foundling hospital better than those to be obtained in hill street and bruton street or some other place frequented by the best families madam with a fashionable bow would reply that we were favourably placed as regards air that of bloomsbury being good for persons like herself of delicate chests and that concerning educational conveniences for miss she found the quarter superior to that mentioned by sir miles then the honest baronet would relate without yawning or showing any signs of fatigue such stories of fashionable life as he had learned from those who had lately come to the fleet or remembered from his short career among the world of fashion we agreed always without unnecessary waste of words to consider him as a gentleman about town familiar with the great the doctor came but rarely he brought wise counsel he was a miracle of wisdom no one is ever so wise in the conduct of his friends' affairs as he who has wrecked his own have we not seen far seeing and prudent ministers of state who have conducted the business of the nation with skill and success yet cannot manage their own far more simple business mrs esther talked to no one but to him about the past she had no secrets from him she even wished him if possible to share in her good fortune and wanted him to appease his creditors with half of all that was hers but he refused my imprisonment he said is also my freedom while i am lying in the fleet i can go abroad as i please i fear no arrest my conscience does not reproach me when i pass a shop and think of what i owe the tradesman who keeps it because my creditors have paid themselves by capture of my body your purse dear madam were it ten times as long would not appease the hungry maw of all my creditors and lawyers of old before i took refuge among the offal and off scouring of humanity the prodigal sons and the swine there was no street west of temple bar where i did not fear the voice of a creditor or expect the unfriendly shoulder tap of a bailiff besides were i free what course would be open to me now i live in state with the income of a dean outside i should live in meanness with the income of a curate i will retire from my present position call it cure of souls madam when the church recognises merit by translating me from the fleet market to a fat prebendal stall and believe me virtue may find a home even beside those stalls and among those grunting swine i understand now being much older and abler to take a just view of things that if my uncle could have obtained his discharge he would have been unwilling to take it for granted that he was a learned and eloquent man that he would have attracted multitudes to hear him learning and eloquence in the church do not always obtain for a clergyman the highest preferment the doctor who was no longer young might have had to languish as a curate on forty or perhaps sixty pounds per annum even though it became the fashion to attend his sermons and besides his character was for ever gone among his brethren of the cloth a man who has been a fleet parson is like one who has passed a morning in hedging and ditching he must needs wash all over truly i think that the doctor was right to exercise the functions of his sacred calling all the morning for profit to drink with his friends all the evening to spend a large portion of his gains in deeds of charity and generosity among a poor necessitous prodigal greedy spendthrift hungry thirsty and shameful folk who rewarded his liberality by a profusion of thanks blessings and good wishes was more in accordance with the doctor's habits of thought he persuaded himself or tried to persuade others that he was doing a good work in the morning in the afternoon he performed works of charity in the evening he abandoned himself to the tempter who led him to sing drink and jest among the rabble rout of comus one morning he bade me put on my hat and walk with him because he had a thing to say i obeyed with fear being certain he was going to speak about my unknown husband girl he said as we walked past the last house in red lion street and along the pathway which leads to the foundling hospital girl i have to remind you and to warn you i knew well what was to be the warning remember you are now seventeen and more you are no longer a young and silly girl you are a young woman thanks to your friends you have taken the position of a young gentlewoman even an heiress you will soon leave this quiet lodging and go where you will meet society and the great world you are pretty and well mannered you will have beaux and gallants dangling their clouded canes at your heels and asking your favours but you are married remember that you are married you must be careful not to let a single stain rest upon your reputation oh sir i cried i have endeavoured to forget that morning was that marriage real the poor young gentleman was tipsy can a tipsy man be married real the doctor stood and gazed at me with angry eyes and puffed cheeks so that the old terror seized me in spite of my fine frock and hoop real is the girl mad am i not gregory shovel doctor of divinity of christ's college cambridge not even the king's most sacred majesty is married in more workmanlike fashion let your husband try to escape the bond know that he shall be watched let him try to set it aside he shall learn by the intervention of learned lawyers if he do not trust my word that he is as much married as st peter himself alas i said but how shall my husband love me tut tut what is love you young people think of nothing but love the fond inclination of one person for another are you a pin the worse supposing he never loves you love or no love make up thy mind child that happy shall be thy lot be contented patient and silent when the right day comes thou shalt step forth to the world as catherine lady chudleigh that day he said no more to me but he showed that the subject was not out of his thoughts by inquiries into the direction and progress of my studies which he hinted should be such as would befit my rank and position madam thought he meant my rank as her heiress a position which could not be illustrated with too much assiduity soon after we went to red lion street my uncle gave madam my bag of guineas here is the child's fortune he said let her spend it but with moderation in buying the frocks fal lals and trifles which a young gentlewoman of fortune should wear grudge not the spending should more be wanting more shall be found in everything my dear lady make my niece an accomplished woman a woman of ton a woman who can hold her own a woman who can go into any society a woman fit to become the wife well the wife of a lord it was on new year's day that we left the fleet it was in the summer at the end of june when we decided that enough had been done to rub off the rust of that unfashionable place you my dear said mrs esther have the sprightly graces of a well born and well bred young woman i can present you in any society i for my part have recovered the pimpernel manner i can now make an appearance worthy of my father i assured my kind lady that although to be sure i had never been able to witness the great original and model from which the pimpernel manner was derived yet that no lady had so fine an air as herself which was certainly true madam being at once dignified and gifted with a formal condescension very pretty and uncommon chapter ii how we went to the wells access to the polite world is more readily gained by those who have no friends at one of the watering places than in london considering this we counselled whether it would not be better to visit one or all of the english spas rather than to climb slowly and painfully up the ladder of london fashion mrs esther at first inclined to bath which certainly though it is a long journey thither is a most stately city provided with every requisite for comfort possessing the finest assembly rooms and the most convenient lodgings it also affords opportunities for making the acquaintance and studying the manners of the great moreover there can be no doubt that its waters are efficient in the cure of almost all disorders and the social enjoyment of the hot bath taken in the company of the wits and toasts who go to be parboiled together in that liquid court of scandal chocolate and sweets is surely a thing without a rival on the other hand tunbridge wells is nearer london the roads are good a coach reaches the place in one day and so amazing is the rapidity of communication in which we so far excel our ancestors that the london morning papers reach the wells in the evening and a letter posted from the wells in the morning can be answered in the following evening also the air is fine at tunbridge the waters wholesome and the amusements are said to be varied add to this that it is greatly frequented by the better sort of london citizens those substantial merchants with their proud and richly dressed wives and daughters whom mrs esther always looked upon as forming the most desirable company in the world so that it was at first resolved to go to tunbridge but while we were making our preparations to go there a curious longing came upon mrs esther to revisit the scenes of her youth my dear she said i should like to see once more the wells of epsom whither my father carried us every year when we were children the last summer i spent there was after his death in the dreadful year of when the place was crowded with germans jews and the people who flocked to london with schemes which were to have made all our fortunes but which only ruined us filled the prisons and madhouses drove honest men upon the road and their children to the gutters let us go to epsom epsom wells to be sure was no longer what it had been indeed for a time the place had fallen into decay yet of late with their horse racing in april and june and the strange repute of the bone setter sally wallin the salubrity of the air on the downs the easy access to the town which lieth but sixteen miles or thereabouts from paul's and the goodness of the lodgings the fame of the place had revived the gentry of the country side came to the monday breakfasts and assemblies when there was music card playing and dancing the old buildings were again repaired and epsom wells for a few years was once more crowded to me as will presently be very well understood the place will ever remain a dear romantic spot sacred to the memory of the sweetest time in a woman's life when her heart goes out of her keeping and she listens with fear and delight to the wooing of the man she loves we went there in the coach which took about three hours we arrived in the afternoon of a sunny day it was a friday which is an unlucky day to begin a journey upon in the middle of july we were presently taken to a neat and clean lodging in church parade where we engaged rooms at a moderate charge the landlady one mrs crump was the widow she told us of a respectable hosier of cheapside who had left her with but a slender stock her children however were in good service and thriving and with her youngest daughter cicely she kept this lodging house a poor but genteel mode of earning a livelihood the first evening we sat at home until sunset when we put on our hoods and walked under the trees which everywhere at epsom afford a delightful shade during the heat of the day and a romantic obscurity in the twilight a lane or avenue of noble lime trees was planted in the church parade small avenues of trees led to the houses and formed porches with rich canopies of green leaves there was a good deal of company abroad and we could hear not far off the strains of the music to which they were dancing in the assembly rooms we have done well kitty said mrs esther to come to this place which is far less changed than since last i came here i trust it is not sinful to look back with pleasure and regret on the time of youth here she sighed the good woman of the house i perceive with pleasure remembers the name of pimpernel and made me a becoming courtesy when i informed her of my father's rank she remembers seeing his lord mayor's show there are it appears many families of the highest distinction here with several nabobs rich turkey and russian merchants great lawyers and county gentry she assures me that all are made welcome and that the assemblies are open to the whole company and she paid a tribute to thy pretty face my dear in the morning we were awakened to our surprise and delight by a delectable concert of music performed for us by way of salutation or greeting by the band belonging to the place they played in succession a number of the most delightful airs such as a hunting we will go fain i would spring's a coming sweet nelly my heart's delight and the girl i left behind me the morning was bright and a breeze came into my open window from the surrey downs fresh and fragrant with the scent of wild flowers my brain was filled with the most ravishing ideas though i knew not of what my dear said mrs esther at breakfast the compliment of the music shows the discernment of the people they have learned already that we have pretensions to rank and are no ordinary visitors not haberdashers' daughters or grocers' it is we afterwards discovered the rule of the place thus to salute new comers without inquiry at all into their rank or fortune we rewarded the players with half a crown from madam and two shillings from myself it is surely a delightful thing to dress one's self in the morning to the accompaniment of sweet music if i were a queen i would have a concert of music every day to begin when i put foot out of bed to sing in tune while putting on one's stockings to dance before the glass while lacing one's stays to handle a comb as if it was a fan and to brush one's hair with a swimming grace as if one was doing a minuet while the fiddles and the flutes and the hautboys are playing for you before i had finished dressing however cicely crump who was a lively sprightly girl with bright eyes and little nose about my own age came to help me and told me that those ladies who went abroad to take the air before breakfast wore in the morning an easy dishabille and advised me to tie a hood beneath the chin but not she said with a laugh not to hide too much of your face what will they say to such a face at the ball we followed her advice and presently sallied forth although it was but seven o'clock we found a goodly assemblage already gathered together upon the terrace where early as it was the shade of the trees was agreeable as well as beautiful the ladies who looked at us with curiosity were dressed much like ourselves and the gentlemen wore morning gowns without swords some of the elder men even wore nightcaps which seemed to me an excessive simplicity everybody talked to his neighbour and there was a cheerful buzz of conversation nothing is changed my dear said mrs esther looking about her with great satisfaction nothing except the dresses and these not so much as we might have expected i have been asleep dear like the beauty in the story for thirty years but she kept her youth that lucky girl while i heigh ho cicely came with us to show us the way we went first along the terrace and then to the new parade which was also beautifully shaded with elms and limes between them lies the pond with gold and silver fish very pretty to look at and the tumble down watch house at one end then she showed us the pump room here is the spring she said which cures all disorders the best medicine in the world there was in the room a dipper as they call the women who hand the water to those who go to drink it we were told that it was customary to pay our footing with half a crown but we drank none of the water which is not like that of tunbridge wells sweet and pleasant to the taste then cicely led us to another building hard by a handsome place having a broad porch with columns very elegant this it appeared was the assembly room where were held the public balls concerts and breakfasts we entered and looked about us mrs esther recalled her triumphs in this very room and shed a tear over the past then a girl accosted us and begged permission to enter our names in a great book this with five shillings each by way of fees made us free of all the entertainments of the season near the assembly rooms was the coffee house used only by the gentlemen they pretend said cicely to come here for letter writing and to read the news i do not know how many letters they write but i do know what they talk about because i had it of the girl who pours out their coffee and it is not about religion nor politics but all about the toast of the day what is the toast of the day i asked cicely smiled like a saucy baggage as she was and said that no doubt miss kitty would soon find out already she said mr walsingham is looking at you i saw an old gentleman already dressed for the morning with lace ruffles and a handkerchief for the neck of rich crimson silk who sat on one of the benches beneath the trees his hand upon a stick looking at me with a sort of earnestness hush cried cicely whispering he is more than eighty years of age he goes every year to epsom bath and tunbridge all three and he can tell you the name of the toast in every place for fifty years and describe her face a toast then was another word for a young lady as we passed his bench the old gentleman rose and bowed with great ceremony to madam your most obedient servant madam he said still looking at me i trust that the wells will be honoured by your ladyship with a long stay my name is walsingham madam and i am not unknown here permit me to offer my services to you and to your lovely daughter my niece sir madam returned the bow with a curtsey as deep my niece miss kitty pleydell we arrived last night and we expect to find our stay so agreeable as to prolong it the wells madam will be delighted he bowed again i hope to be of assistance some little assistance in making your visit pleasant i have known epsom wells and indeed bath and tunbridge as well for fifty years every year has been made remarkable in one of these places by the appearance of at least one beautiful face sometimes there have been even three or four so that gentlemen have been divided in opinion in for instance a duel was fought at tunbridge wells between my lord tangueray and sir humphrey lydgate about two rival beauties generally however the wells acknowledge but one queen yesterday i was publicly lamenting that we had as yet no one at epsom whom we could hope to call queen of the wells miss kitty pleydell again he bowed low i can make that complaint no longer i salute your majesty oh sir i said abashed and confused you are jesting with me he replied gravely that he never jested on so serious a subject as the beauty of a woman then he hoped to see us again upon the terrace or on the downs in the course of the day and left us with a low bow i told you miss said cicely that it would not be long before you found out what is meant by a toast she next took us to a book shop where we learned that for a crown we could carry home any book we pleased from the shop and read it at our ease only that we must return it in as good condition as we took it out which seems reasonable the people in the shop as are all the people at epsom were mighty civil and madam partly with a view of showing the seriousness of her reading took down a volume of sermons which i carried home for her next day however she exchanged this for a volume of pamela which now began to occupy our attention almost as much as clarissa had done but caused fewer tears to flow now is it not a convenient thing for people who cannot afford to buy all they would read thus to pay a subscription and to borrow books as many as they wish i think that nothing has ever yet been invented so excellent for the spread of knowledge and the cultivation of taste yet it must not go too far either for should none but the libraries buy new novels poems and other works of imagination where would be the reward of the ingenious gentlemen who write them no let those who can afford buy books let those who cannot buy all they can and join the library for those they cannot afford to buy what room looks more comfortably furnished than one which has its books in goodly rows upon the shelves they are better than pictures better than vases better than plates better than china monkeys for the house that is so furnished need never feel the dulness of a rainy day there remained but two subscriptions to pay before our footing was fairly established the leader of the music presented himself bowing with his subscription book in his hand the usual amount was half a guinea madam gave a guinea being half for herself and half for me writing down our names in the book i saw as we came away that a little group of gentlemen quickly gathered round the leader and almost tore the book from his hand they are anxious to find out your name miss said cicely then they will go away and talk in the coffee house and wonder who you are and whence you came and what fortune you have yet they call us women gossips lastly there was the clergyman's book heaven forbid said madam that we pay for the music and let the prayers go starving this done we could return home having fairly paid our way for everything and we found at our lodgings an excellent country breakfast of cream new laid eggs fresh wild strawberries from durdans park delicate cakes of mrs crump's own baking and chocolate with cicely to wait upon us it was the godly custom of the place to attend public worship after breakfast and at the ringing of the bell we put on our hats and went to the parish church where we found most of the ladies assembled they were escorted to the doors of the sacred house by the gentlemen who left them there why men who are certainly greater sinners or sinners in a bolder and more desperate fashion than women should have less need of prayers than we i know not nor why a man should be ashamed of doing what a woman glories in doing after their drinkings their duels their prodigalities and wastefulness men should methinks crowd into the doors of every church they can find women leading them thereto but let us not forget that men when they live outside the fashion and are natural are by the bent of their mind generally more religiously disposed than women and as they make greater sinners so also do they make more illustrious saints when we came out of the church i forgot to say that we were now dressed and ready to make as brave a show as the rest we found outside the doors a lane of gentlemen who as we passed bowed low hat in hand at the end stood old mr walsingham he stood with his hat raised high in air and a smile upon his lined and crowsfooted face what did i say miss kitty he whispered hath not the queen of the wells arrived i do not know what i might have said but i heard a cry of kitty kitty and looking round saw oh the joy none other than my nancy prettier than ever though still but a little thing who ran up to me and threw herself in my arms chapter iii how nancy reckoned up the company nancy levett herself pretty and merry prattling rattling nancy not grown a bit and hardly taller than my shoulder i held her out at arm's length you here nancy then we kissed again and not a bit changed nancy and oh so changed kitty so tall and grand come to my mother lady levett was standing close by with sir robert who took me by the shoulders and kissed my cheeks forehead and lips in fatherly fashion gadso he cried this is brave indeed things are likely to go well at epsom we have got back our kitty wife lady levett was colder perhaps she had misgivings on what had been done with me for the last twelvemonth and then i who had gone away a simple rustic maid was now in hoops patches and powder kitty will tell us presently she said i doubt not what she has done and under whose protection she is travelling then i hastened to present mrs esther who stood aside somewhat embarrassed madam i said i present to you my benefactress and guardian mrs esther to whose care i was entrusted by my uncle dear aunt this is my lady levett mrs esther pimpernel madam hath done me the singular kindness of calling me her niece my niece and daughter by adoption said that kind lady your ladyship will be pleased out of your goodness of heart to hear the best report of this dear child's health and conduct the good principles my lady which she learned of you and of her lamented father have borne fruit in virtues of obedience and duty both ladies made a deep reverence then said lady levett i assure you my dear madam i looked for nothing less in this dear child from such a father as was hers could aught but good descend madam i desire your better acquaintance for kitty's sake i hope we may be friends why said sir robert we are friends already kitty thou art grown thou art a fine girl i warrant we shall have breaking of hearts before all is done epsom wells was never so full of gallants well breaking of hearts is rare sport and seldom hurts the men though they make so great a coil about it in their rhymes and nonsense but have a care both of you sometimes the girls get their own little cockleshells of hearts broken in earnest i should like to see the man among them all who could break my heart said nancy pertly laughing yours her father asked tapping her pretty rosy cheek it is such a little one no one can find it nevertheless lass it is big enough to carry all thy father's in it big as he is then we began to ask questions all together i to inquire after the village and the hall the church the ponies the garden the hounds the fruit all the things we used to think about and will they told me was at home but was coming to the wells for certain races in which he would himself ride harry temple was gone to london but would perhaps come to epsom as soon as he knew who was there why had i written not one single letter i blushed and hung my head i could not tell the truth for the sake of mrs esther how i was ashamed at first to speak of the place in which i found myself and afterwards was afraid but i should have to explain my silence it was not i stammered that i was ungrateful to your ladyship for all your kindness but things were strange at first and there was nothing that i could take any pleasure in telling your ladyship and a london letter from a simple girl who can send no news of the great world is a worthless thing to deliver by the post nay child said lady levett we should not have grudged the charge for good tidings of thy welfare our kitty said mrs esther colouring a little for it is never pleasant to help at concealing dissembling or falsifying things has had a busy time of late your ladyship knows doubtless that her education was not completed we have had masters and teachers of dancing music deportment and the like during the last few months and i trust that we shall find she will do credit to the instruction she has received meanwhile i have for reasons which it would not interest your ladyship to learn been living in great retirement we had a lodging lately in red lion street not far from the foundling hospital where the air is good and the situation quiet we fell presently into a sort of procession first went lady levett and mrs esther i overheard the latter speaking at length of her father the lord mayor of her grandfather also the lord mayor and of her last visit to epsom then came nancy sir robert who held my hand and myself the music which had stopped during prayers began again now the terrace was crowded with the visitors and nancy began to point them out to me as we walked along look child oh how beautiful you have grown there is mr pagoda tree it is really samuel tree or obadiah tree or i think crabapple tree but they all call him pagoda tree he has made a quarter of a million in bengal and is come running to bath epsom and tunbridge in search of a wife with all his money i for one would not have him the yellow little nabob he has five and twenty blacks at his lodgings and they say he sticks dinner knives into them if his curry be not hot enough there goes the dean of st sepulchre's he is come to drink the waters which are good for a stomach enfeebled by great dinners there is no better fox hunter in the county and no finer judge of port pity to be seventy years old when one has all the will and the power to go on doing good to the christian church by fox hunting and drinking he was certainly a very red faced divine who looked as if this world was more in his thoughts than the next where so far as we know fox hunting will not be practised and port will not be held in esteem you see yonder little fribble my dear do not look at him or it will make him think the better of himself he is a haberdasher from town who pretends to be a templar a fribble kitty oh you innocent tall beautiful creature a fribble is a thing made up of rags wig ruffles wind froth amber cane paint powder coat skirts and sword nothing else i assure you no brains no heart no ears no taste nothing there are many fribbles at the wells who will dance with you talk to you and if you have enough money would like to run away with you don't throw yourself away on a fribble kitty and don't run away with anybody nothing so uncomfortable that gallant youth in the red coat is an officer who had better be with his colours in america than showing his scarlet at the wells yet he is a pretty fellow is he not here are more clergymen one of them somewhat reminded me of my uncle for he wore like him a full wig a cassock of silk and a flowing gown also he carried his head with the assurance which belongs to one who is a teacher of men and respects his own wisdom but he differed from my uncle in being sleek which the famous chaplain of the fleet certainly was not he dropped his eyes as he went inwardly rapt no doubt by heavenly thoughts that nancy went on is the great court preacher the reverend bellamour parolles master of arts the shabby divine beside him is the vicar of sissinghurst in kent who is here to drink the waters for a complaint that troubles the poor man what a difference the country parson went dressed in a grey striped calamanco nightgown he wore a wig which had once been white but was now by the influence of this uncertain climate turned to a pale orange his brown hat was encompassed by a black hatband his bands which might have been cleaner decently retired under the shadow of his chin his grey stockings were darned with blue worsted as they walked together it seemed to me that the country parson was saying to the crowd you see i am in rags i go in darns patches and poverty yet by my sacred profession and my learning i am the equal of my brother in silk while the more prosperous one might have been thought to say behold the brotherhood and equality of the church when i the great and fashionable know no difference between myself and my humble brethren in the afternoon and evening there was however this difference that the town parson was seen at the assembly rooms among the ladies while his country brother might have been seen at the crown over a pipe and a brown george full of strong october then nancy went on to point out more of the visitors there were merchants well known on the royal exchange courtiers from st james's country gentlemen with their madams brave in muslin pinners and sarsnet hoods from estates remote from the great town where they had never ceased to consider themselves the feudal lords of the people as well as the land there were younger sons full of talk about horses and hounds there were doctors in black with bag wigs there were lawyers in vacation their faces as full of sharpness as is the face of a fox there were young fellows not yet launched upon the fashionable world who looked on with the shyness and impudence of youth trying to catch the trick of dress manner and carriage which marks the perfect beau there were old fellows like mr walsingham who sat on the benches or ran about proud of their activity in attendance on the ladies it was indeed a motley crew they say that epsom has come into fashion again nancy went on i know not tunbridge is a dangerous rival yet this year the place is full that young man coming to speak to me you may distinguish by your acquaintance my dear what a distinction he is i hope your lordship is well this morning he is the young lord eardesley whose father is but just dead he is a virginian by birth and all his fortune with which the family estates have been recovered was made by tobacco on his plantations he has hundreds of negro slaves besides convicts yet he is of grave and serious disposition and abhors the smell of a pipe peggy baker thinks to catch his lordship yet coronets are not so easily won she stopped again to speak to some ladies of her acquaintance well my dear as for our manner of life here it is the same as at all watering places we dress and undress we meet at church and on the terrace and the new parade and the assembly rooms we go to the downs to see races before dinner and after dinner we talk scandal we say wicked things about each other we try to catch the eyes of the men we hate each other with malice and uncharitableness we raffle we gamble we listen to the music we exchange pretty nothings with the beaux we find out all the stories about everybody here and we dance at the assembly she stopped to breathe this is a rattle said sir robert which never stops like the clack of the water wheel go on nan one of our amusements she went on tossing her little head is to buy strawberries cherries vegetables salad fowls and ducks of the higglers who bring them to the market or carry them round to the houses of the town the gentlemen i observe derive a peculiar satisfaction in chucking those of the higglers who are young and good looking under the chin this i confess is a pleasure which i cannot for my own part understand saucy baggage said her father you and i kitty she continued who do not want to chuck farmers' daughters under the chin may when we are tired of the races or the promenade take an airing in a coach or watch the raffling or the card players here they play cards all day long except on sunday or we may go to the book shop and hear the latest scandal or we may go home and trim our own things and talk about frocks and patches and poetry and lace and lovers but for heaven's sake kitty do not in this censorious place make that pretty face too cheap and let no one follow you on the terrace but the best of the company good advice said sir robert this girl of mine has got her father's head as for cards nancy went on taking no notice of her father's interruption the tables are always laid in the assembly room the ladies mostly play at quadrille and the gentlemen at whist but there are tables for hazard lansquenet faro and baccarat where all comers are welcome provided they have got money to lose and can lose it without also losing their temper a thing we women throw away daily and lose without regarding it so cheap and abundant a commodity it is my dear so long as i value my face i will never touch the odious delightful things yet the joy of winning your enemy's money oh oh and the dreadful grief to lose your own there is a concert this evening i would not advise you to attend it but to wait for monday's ball there to make your first appearance i shall go because some of my swains are going to play with the paid musicians and of course i look to see them break down and spoil the whole music to their great confusion but monday monday is our day of days all sunday we think about it and cannot say our prayers for thinking of the dear delightful day and what the clergyman preaches about none of us know for wishing the day was here on monday we have a great public breakfast to begin with the gentry come to it from all the country side with the great people from durdans in fine weather we breakfast under the trees upon the terrace while the music plays you will find it pleasant to take your chocolate to the strains of flute and clarionet french horn and hautboy the sunshine raises the spirits and the music fills the head with pretty fancies besides every girl likes to be surrounded by tall fellows who though we care not a pin for one of them are useful for providing conversation cakes and creams telling stories saying gallant things fetching carrying and making peggy baker jealous on monday too there are always matches on the downs we pretend to be interested in the horses we come back to dinner and a concert in the afternoon some of the gentlemen give tea and chocolate and at six o'clock the fiddles tune up oh the delicious scraping we all take our places and then begins oh oh oh the dear delightful ball my child let miss peggy baker dress her best put on her finest airs and swim about with her most languishing sprawl i know who shall outshine her and be the queen of the wells yourself dear nancy no not myself dear nancy she replied imitating oh you well may blush for shame pretty hypocrite 'tis yourself dear kitty that i mean you shall burst upon their astonished gaze like venus rising from the sea in our picture at home only better dressed than that poor creature just then a young lady with the largest hoop i had ever seen with patches and powder and accompanied by three or four gentlemen came slowly along the walk as she drew near she looked at me with curiosity she was a tall girl nearly as tall as myself with features rather larger than ordinary and as she moved i understood what nancy meant by languishing and swimming nancy ran to meet her taking her by both hands and affecting a mighty joy dear miss peggy she began i am charmed to see you looking so well and lovely how that dress becomes your shape with what an air sits that hat oh miss nancy miss peggy swam and languished agitating her fan and half shutting her eyes which were very large and limpid praise from such a judge of beauty and dress as yourself is rare indeed what should we poor women do without the discrimination of our own sex men have no discernment a well dressed woman and a draggletail are all one to them not all men dear miss peggy continued nancy her eyes sparkling mr walsingham was only saying this morning that you are like himself a proof of the salubrity of the wells since it is now the fifth season the third dear child miss peggy interrupted with a tap of her fan on nancy's knuckles indeed she deserved it i am very much obliged to mr walsingham whose tongue is free with all the ladies at the wells it is but yesterday since he said of you this is my friend miss kitty pleydell said nancy quickly rubbing her knuckles kitty my dear you have heard of the beautiful peggy baker last year the toast of tunbridge wells and the year before the toast of bath up to the present she has been our pride on monday evening you shall see her in her bravest attire the centre of attraction envied by us poor homely creatures who have to content ourselves with the rustic beaux the parsons the lawyers and the half pay officers now whether this artful girl did it on purpose or whether it was by accident i know not but every word of this speech contained an innuendo against poor miss peggy for it was true that she had been for two years following a toast but she was still unmarried and without a lover though she had so many men for ever in her train and it was also true that among her courtiers at epsom the little band who held back while the ladies talked there were as i afterwards learned at least three rustic beaux two lawyers a fashionable parson and six half pay officers however she disguised whatever resentment she might have felt very kindly bade me welcome to the wells hoped that i should enjoy the place told nancy that her tongue run away with her and that she was a saucy little baggage tapped her knuckles for the second time with her fan and moved away when nancy had finished telling me of the amusements of the place and the people i omit most of what she said as to the people because although doubtless true the stories did not redound to their credit and may now very well be forgotten we left the terrace sir robert now joining madam and looked at the stalls and booths which were ranged along the side they were full of pretty things exhibited for sale and instead of rude prentice boys for salesmen they were good looking girls with whom some of the gentlemen were talking and laughing more chin chucking my dear said nancy it was the fashion to have a lottery at almost every stall so that when you bought anything you received a ticket with your purchase which entitled you to a chance of the prize when you chose a bottle of scent the girl who gave it you handed with it a ticket which gave you the chance of winning five guineas with a pair of stockings came a ticket for a ten guinea lottery it was the same thing with all the shops a leg of mutton bought at the butcher's might procure for the purchaser the sum of twenty guineas the barber who dressed your hair presented you with a chance for his five guinea draw the very taverns and ordinaries had their lotteries so that for every sixpenny plate of boiled beef a 'prentice had his chance with the rest and might win a guinea you ordered a dozen oysters and they came with the fishmonger's compliments and a ticket for his lottery the first prize of which would be two guineas the drawing to take place on such a day with auditors appointed to see all fair and school children named to pull out the tickets even the woman who sold apples and cherries in a basket loudly bellowed along the street that she had a half crown draw a five shilling draw and so on every one of us treasured up the tickets but i never met any who won yet we had the pleasure of attending the drawing dreaming of lucky numbers and spending our prizes beforehand i am sure that nancy must have spent in this way many hundreds of pounds during the season and by talking over all the fine things she would buy the way in which their exhibition upon her little figure would excite the passion of envy in the breast of peggy baker and others and her own importance thus bedecked she had quite as much pleasure out of her imaginary winnings as if they had been real ones it is a happy circumstance for mankind that they are able to enjoy what they never can possess and to be in imagination the great the glorious the rich the powerful personages which they can never in the situation wherein providence has placed them hope to become presently we went home to dinner which was served for us by cicely crump after dinner while mrs esther dozed cicely told me her history her father she said had been a substantial tradesman in cheapside and though little of stature was in his youth a man of the most determined courage and resolution when only just out of his apprenticeship he fell in love with a beautiful young lady named jenny medlicott daughter of the same alderman medlicott whose ruin brought poor mrs esther to destruction as he knew that he could never get the consent of the alderman being poor and of obscure birth and knowing besides that all is fair in love this lad of mettle represented himself to his nymph as a young gentleman of the temple son of a country squire in this disguise he persuaded her to run away with him and they were married but when they returned to london they found that the alderman was ruined and gone off his head therefore they separated the lady going to virginia with lady eardesley mother of the young lord now at epsom and the husband going back to the shop after the death of poor jenny he married again and said cicely though my mother is no gentlewoman one cannot but feel that she might have been miss jenny medlicott herself had things turned out differently and that makes all of us hold up our heads and as for poor father he never forgot his first wife and was always pleased to relate how he ran away with her all the way to scotland armed to the teeth and ready for her sake to fight a dozen highwaymen such a resolute spirit he had then nancy levett came bringing with her a milliner mrs bergamot kitty she cried i cannot rest for thinking of your first ball and i have brought you mrs bergamot to advise my dear you must be well dressed then she whispered do you want money dear i have some i told her i had as much as a hundred and twenty guineas at which she screamed with delight kitty she cried again clasping my hands a hundred guineas a hundred guineas and twenty more my dear that odd twenty that poor overflowing of thy rich measure is the utmost i could get for this season at the wells oh happy happy girl to have such a face such a shape such eyes such hair such hands and feet and a hundred and twenty guineas to set all off she sat down clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven as if in thankfulness i think i see her now the little dainty merry maid so arch so apt sitting before me with a look which might be of envy or of joy she had eyes so bright a mouth so little dimples so cunning a cheek so rosy and a chin so rounded that one could not choose but love her miss pleydell she said to the milliner has not brought all her things from london you must get what she wants at once for monday's ball now let us see then we held a parliament of four counting cicely over the great question of my frocks nancy was prime minister and did all the talking turning over the things let me see mrs bergamot fetch us if you have them what you have in flowered brocades all colours violet pink italian posies rose myrtle jessamine anything a watered tabby would become you kitty any painted lawns silks and satins would be almost too old for you do not forget the patches a la grecque kitty be very careful of the patches gauzes what you have mrs bergamot we want more hoods a feathered muff stomacher paris nets eau de chypre or eau de luce whichever you have ear rings are no use to you my poor child pity that they did not pierce your ears see the little drops dangling at mine at any rate thank heaven that we neither of us want vermilion for the cheeks poor peggy she paints these two years and more ruffs mrs bergamot and tippets cardinals any pretty thing in sarsnets and what you have in purple kitty purple is your colour you shall have a dress all purple for the next ball ah if i could carry purple but you kitty with your height and figure stand up child why she will be juno herself truly said the dressmaker as for miss pleydell purple has come into fashion in pudding time as folk say a pretty woman nancy went on examining me as if i had been a dummy not a pretty 'little thing' like me is as rare in epsom as a black swan or a white blackbird or green yellow hammer or a red blue tit when the dressmaker was gone and we were left alone nancy began again out of her great experience to talk of the place we were in my dear she said before one's father one cannot say all that one would wish could such wisdom be possible at seventeen and a half this is a very shocking and wicked place we used to be taught that girls ought to sit in a corner after they had put on their best things and wait to be spoken to and not to think about attracting the men and not indeed to think about the men at all save in their own room where they might perhaps pray that if there were any men in the world not addicted to gambling drinking cursing hunting fighting and striking those men might be led by heaven to cast eyes of love upon them oh here she held up her hands and shook her head just like a woman four times her age and steeped in experience in this place it is not long that the girls sit in a corner and indeed i do not greatly love corners myself but the very wives the matrons the married women my dear her voice rose with each word till it had mounted nearly to the top of the possible scale are coquettes who interfere with the girls and would have the gallants dangling at their heels as for their husbands they are the last persons considered worthy of their notice they put on their dresses and deck themselves out to please anybody rather than the persons whom it should be their only study to please nancy i whispered when you are married will you never never dress to please anybody but your husband why she replied my father my mother my children if i have any my friends will be pleased to see me go fine but not for lovers oh we agreed that would be lovers should be received and properly dealt with before marriage bashfulness here continued the pretty moralist is heaven help us lack of breeding what goes down is defiance of manners and modesty propriety is laughed at noise is wit laughter is repartee most of the women gamble nearly all are in debt nobody reads anything serious and we backbite each other perpetually i know not what had put her in so strange a mood for moralising however she said now that you are come we shall get on better i have made up my mind that you are to be the toast of the season i shall set you off because you are brown and i am fair you are tall and i am short you are grave and i am merry you are thoughtful and i am silly you have brown eyes and i have blue we will have none but the best men about us we will set such an example as will shame the hoydens of girls and tame the mohocks among the men miss lamb of hackney who thinks herself a beauty will then be ashamed to jump about and scream at the assembly with nothing over her skinny shoulders peggy baker shall have after her none but the married men who are of no possible use except to spoil a girl's reputation although she sighs and swims and sprawls with her eyes half shut do you know that she sat for her portrait to zincke at marylebone gardens as anne boleyn and was painted with eyelashes down to the corners of her mouth nancy i cried you are jealous of miss peggy baker she laughed and talked of something else from this i conjectured that peggy had said or reported something which offended her what had really been said i learned afterwards was that nancy was running after lord eardesley which was unkind as well as untrue last year she said after you went away nothing would serve my mother but a visit to bath it is not so gay as tunbridge wells because the company are mostly country folk like ourselves who stand upon their dignity but it is better than this place where there are so many london cits that it passes one's patience sometimes to see their manners really nancy must have been seriously put out however i dare say bath is as wicked as any of the watering towns when you come to know it i liked the bathing what do you think kitty of everybody promenading in the water up to their chins that is to say the little people like me up to their noses only i wore pattens to make myself higher and the tall men up to their shoulders in hot water everybody frolicking flirting and chattering while japanned trays float about covered with confectionery tea oils and perfumes for the ladies and when you go away your chair is nothing but a tub full of hot water in which you are carried home we stayed there all july and august though my mother would have kept me if she could from the baths till i was bigger harry temple was there too part of the time and how doth harry he is a good honest fellow said nancy though conceited and a prig his mouth full of learned words and his head full of books he seemed to pine after your departure kitty but soon recovered himself and now eats and drinks again as before he found some congenial spirits from oxford at bath and they used to talk of art and pictures when any one was listening and bronzes and all sorts of things that we poor people know nothing of then she told me how harry had made a poem upon me after my departure which he turned into latin greek and italian and had given nancy a copy and how will had christened one pup kitty and another pleydell and a third kitty pleydell and was casting around how to give a fourth puppy my name as well it seemed so long ago that i had almost forgotten poor rustic will with his red face his short sturdy figure and his determination dear kitty said nancy if thou couldst take a fancy for our will he is a brave lad though dull of parts and slow of apprehension as for harry here she stopped and blushed i remembered my secret and blushed as well but for guilt and shame while poor nancy blushed in maiden modesty dear nancy i replied kissing her believe me but i could never marry your brother will and as for harry as for harry she echoed with downcast eyes it was easy to read her secret though she could not guess mine as for harry i said where could he be better bestowed than here i kissed her again and said no more because between two women what more need be said alas i had quite forgotten indeed i never suspected that i was actually engaged to become the wife of both harry and will who was at this same time the wife of lord chudleigh and both men were on their way to epsom to claim the promise chapter iv how kitty went to her first ball if i were to write all that nancy said on saturday afternoon it would fill a volume and if i were to write down all that we four said about my dress for the monday ball it would take four volumes at least so nimbly ran our tongues it was determined however that the purple frock should be put in hand at once with ribbons and everything to correspond but that for this occasion as time pressed we would take my best frock a new white satin never before worn mrs bergamot would dress me and the hairdresser was engaged for two o'clock everything said nancy depends upon the first impression already the world is agog to see the beautiful miss pleydell dressed as for me my dear nobody noticed my first appearance at all and yet i thought i looked very nice to be sure a person of my inches cannot expect to command attention i am feeling my way however and though i am little my tongue is sharp after monday we will have our court you and i to ourselves the men will be at our feet and peggy may lie all on a rock deploring i asked her afterwards how she could speak so openly before this milliner who would probably tell all the town what she had said my dear she replied sharply your nancy is not altogether a goose and she knows what she is doing mrs bergamot is a most trustworthy person i quite rely upon her i have never known her fail in her duties as town crier she will spread it abroad that you have brought a hundred guineas and more to spend in frocks and things she will tell everybody that you have ordered a purple velvet in the first fashion she will not fail to repeat that you and i together mean to lead the company at the wells she will probably tell peggy that she may go and sit on a rock deploring and she will inform miss lamb of hackney that her shoulders are skinny they cannot hate us worse than they do therefore we will make them fear us what a little spitfire was this nancy of mine to the religious and the sober sunday is a day of serious meditation as well as of rest to me the sunday before the ball was a day of such worldly tumult as should afford ample room for repentance in these later years unhappily we repent but seldom of these youthful sins yet when we went to church the organ seemed to play a minuet the hymns they sang might have been a hey or a jig in a country dance and the sermon of the preacher might have been a discourse on the pleasures and enjoyments of the world so rapt was my mind in contemplation of these vanities the service over we walked out through a lane of the godless men who had not gone to church nancy came after me very demure carrying her prayer book her eyes cast down as if rapt in heavenly meditation but her thoughts were as worldly as my own and she presently found an opportunity of whispering that peggy baker had thrown glances of the greatest ferocity from her pew at herself and me that mrs bergamot had already spread the news about and that the concourse of men at the door of the sacred place was entirely on my account if it was not sunday she added and if it were not for the crowd around us i should dance and sing the time for opening the ball was six at which time dancing began and was continued until eleven according to the laws wisely laid down by that public benefactor and accomplished amphitryon mr nash who effected so much improvement for bath and tunbridge that his rules were adopted for all other watering places before his time there were no fixed hours or fixed prices the laws of precedence were badly observed the gentlemen wore their swords and disputes which sometimes ended in duels were frequent and unseemly now however nothing could be more orderly than the manner of conducting the entertainment the charge for admission was half a crown for gentlemen and one shilling for ladies no swords were permitted and the ball was opened by the gentleman of the highest rank in the room at epsom a country squire or a city knight was generally the best that could be procured whereas at bath an earl was not uncommon and even a duke was sometimes seen my hairdresser who was on these occasions engaged from six o'clock in the morning until six in the evening was fortunately able to give me half an hour at two o'clock so that i had not more than four hours or so to sit without moving my head this was a very happy circumstance many ladies having to be dressed early in the morning so that for the whole day they could neither walk about nor move for fear of the structure toppling over altogether mrs bergamot herself dressed me i wore my white satin frock over a great hoop with fine new point lace for tuckers my kerchief and ruffles were in lace and i had on a pearl and coral necklace presented to me by mrs esther who was contented to wear a black ribbon round her neck in order that i might go the finer as for herself she wore a rich brocade which greatly became her and made her look like a countess nay child she said not a countess but like a gentlewoman as hath ever been my simple ambition and the daughter of a great london merchant but to think that in every house in epsom there was one girl at least or perhaps two who were spending as much time and thought as myself upon the decoration of our persons for this ball and what chance had i of distinction among so many fine women of less rustic breeding she will do mrs bergamot i think said mrs esther madam replied the dressmaker who no doubt considered it part of her business to flatter her customers madam i dare swear that there hath not appeared i do not say at epsom alone but at tunbridge and at bath so beautiful a creature in the memory of man mr walsingham who remembers all the beauties for fifty years declares that miss kitty surpasses all straight as a lance madam and shapely as a statue with such a face as will deal havoc and destruction among the men mrs esther nodded her head and laughed then she shook her head and looked grave we must not become vain kitty she said beauty is but skin deep it fades like the flowers think only of virtue and goodness which never fade and yet child thou art young thou art beautiful be happy in the sunshine as is meet thank heaven for sunshine she pressed my hand in hers and the tears rose to her eyes was she thinking of her own youth which had been so unhappy when mrs bergamot left us she confessed to me that like me she had been in a strange agitation of spirit at the contemplation of this assembly it is thirty years she said since i have been in a gay crowd i thought that such a thing as the sight of youth and happiness would never come to me again and to think that after all these years i should go back to the very room where in amid a crowd of adventurers speculators and gamblers who were going to ruin us all i attended my last ball this was while we were waiting for the chairs i think she went on in her soft voice which was like the rippling of a stream that my child will do credit to herself i am glad that you have kept your neck covered my dear i would rather see you go modest than fine i hope that lady levett will be there before us in such cases as this the sight of a friend gives us as it were an encouragement it is like a prop to lean against i hope the chairs will not be late on the other hand one would not surely arrive too early my dear i am trembling all over are you sure you have forgotten none of your steps ah if no one were to ask you to dance i should die of shame and mortification but they will oh they will my kitty is too beautiful to sit among the crowd of lookers on here came cicely running to tell us that the chairs were below and that the men swore they could not wait a minute one minute only dear dear how quick the girl is cicely take one last look at miss kitty do you think child she has got everything and is properly dressed quite properly madam no lady in the assembly will shine like miss pleydell good girl and cicely if you see that anything is wanting in my dress do not scruple to tell me young eyes are sometimes quicker than old ones nothing madam your ladyship is dressed in the fashion then the chairmen who like all their tribe were unmannerly fellows bellowed that they would wait no longer and we descended the stairs one would have been ashamed to confess the fact but it actually was the very first time i had ever sat in a chair the shaking was extremely disagreeable and one could not at the beginning feel anything but pity for the poor men who made their living by carrying about the heavy bodies of people too fine or too lazy to walk however that feeling soon wore off just as the west indian and virginian planters learn by degrees to believe that their negro slaves like to work in the fields are thankful for the lash and prefer digging under a hot sun to sleeping in the shade we arrived at the assembly rooms a few minutes before six the rooms were already crowded the curtains were drawn and the light of day excluded but in its place there was a ravishing display of wax candles arranged upon the walls on sconces or hanging from the ceiling the musicians in the gallery were already beginning as is their wont to tune their instruments twanging and blowing just as a preacher begins with a preliminary hem my eyes swam as i surveyed the brilliant gathering for a moment i held mrs esther by the wrist and could say nothing nor move i felt like an actress making her appearance for the first time upon the stage and terrified for the moment by the faces looking up curious and critical from the crowded pit and glittering boxes at that moment lady levett arrived with her party i think sir robert saw our distress and my guardian's anxiety to appear at her ease for he kindly took mrs esther by the hand and led her as if she were the greatest lady in the assembly to the upper end while nancy and i followed after o kitty she whispered there is no one half so beautiful as you no one in all the room how the men stare did they never see a pretty woman before wait in patience for a little ye would be lovers till your betters are served peggy baker my dear you will burst with envy look here she comes with her courtiers in fact miss baker herself here appeared with her mother surrounded by three or four gentlemen who hovered about her and she languidly advanced up the room she came straight to us and after saluting lady levett and mrs esther held out her hand to nancy and curtseyed to me you look charming to night dear miss nancy that frock of yours one is never tired of it and you oh dear miss peggy nancy turned white because her frock was really rather an old one it is good wearing stuff said miss peggy yet i had thought that mode gone out so it had my dear said nancy sharply and i believe it went out five seasons ago that is longer than i can recollect but it has come back again fashions do revive sometimes this was a very ill natured thing to say and made poor miss peggy wince and colour and she did not retaliate because i suppose she could think of nothing to say then old mr walsingham who had constituted himself the director of the ceremonies appeared he was dressed in the most beautiful crimson silk coat lined with white and purple waistcoat and he came slowly up the hall with a gentleman whose bearing was as great as his own but whose years were less it is young lord chudleigh whispered peggy baker fanning herself anxiously he has come from durdans with his party lord chudleigh heavens to meet in such a manner in such a place my own husband what is the matter kitty dear asked nancy you turned quite pale bite your lips my dear to get the colour back it is nothing i am faint with the heat and the lights i suppose do not take notice of me peggy baker assumed an air of languor and sensibility which though extremely fine was perhaps over acted lord chudleigh she said is of course the person of the highest distinction in the room he will invite i presume lady levett to open the ball with the first minuet if lady levett declines he will be free to select another partner in fact mr walsingham conducted lord chudleigh to lady levett and presented him to her her ladyship excused herself on the ground that her dancing days were over which was of course expected his lordship then said a few words to mr walsingham who nodded smiled and conducted him to the little group composed of nancy peggy baker and myself but he presented his lordship to me since he said while the room went round with me since lady levett will not condescend to open the ball with your lordship i beg to present you to miss kitty pleydell who appears to night for the first time at our assembly and i am assured for the first time in any assembly my lord the sun when he rises in splendour dims the light of the moon and stars miss kitty i would i were fifty years younger that i might challenge this happy young gentleman for the honour of the dance then lord chudleigh spoke i remembered his voice a deep shame fell upon my soul thinking where and how i had heard that voice before miss pleydell he said bowing low i humbly desire the honour of opening the ball with you it was time to rally my spirits for the eyes of all the company were upon us there was only one thing to do to forget for the moment what was past and address myself to the future i can look back upon the evening with pride because i remember how i was able to push away shame and remembrance and to think for the moment about my steps and my partner twang twang twang went the fiddles the conductor raised his wand the music crashed and rang about the room courage kitty whispered nancy courage think you are at home the hall was cleared now and the people stood round in a triple circle watching while my lord his hat beneath his arm offered me his hand and led me into the middle of the room the last things i observed as i went with him were mrs esther wiping away what looked like a little tear of pride and peggy baker with red face fanning herself violently poor peggy last year it was she who would have taken the place of the most distinguished lady in the company they told me afterwards that i acquitted myself creditably i would not permit myself to think under what different circumstances that hand had once before held mine i would not break down before the eyes of so many people and with peggy baker standing by ready to condole with me on my discomfiture but i could not bring myself to look in the face of my partner and that dance was accomplished with eyes down dropped oh it was over at last the dance which was to me the most anxious the most delightful the most painful that ever girl danced in all this world and what do you think strengthened my heart the while it was the strangest thing but i thought of a certain verse in a certain old history and i repeated to myself as one says things when one is troubled now the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight so that he set the royal crown upon her head child whispered mrs esther her face aglow with pleasure and pride we are all proud of you kitty said lady levett who was more critical because she knew more of the polite world you acquitted yourself creditably next time do not be afraid to look your partner in the face my lord i trust that miss pleydell's performance has made you congratulate yourself on my declining the honour of the minuet your ladyship said lord chudleigh may be assured that if anything could compensate for that disappointment the grace and beauty of my fair partner have effected that object gadzooks cried sir robert here is a beating about the bush kitty my pretty maid no duchess could have danced better and never a queen in christendom is more beautiful say i well my lord excellently well sir robert you have said more than i dared not more than i thought then mr walsingham came bustling to congratulate me but one opinion only one opinion miss pleydell lady levett your obedient servant mrs pimpernel i offer my congratulations on this young lady's success i would it had been bath or even tunbridge whence the rumour of such beauty and such grace would have been more quickly carried about the country but it will be spread abroad there are three hundred tongues here to night who will talk and three hundred pens who will write miss kitty once more i salute your majesty queen of the wells then lord chudleigh and sir robert levett and the gentlemen standing round sank on one knee and bowed almost to the ground crying queen of the wells queen of the wells and nancy in her pretty saucy way ran and stood beside me laughing and i am her majesty's maid of honour remember that gentlemen all the saucy baggage cried sir robert and peggy baker for whom in this hour of triumph one felt a little pity came too with a curtsey and a smile which looked more like a frown miss pleydell must accept my homage too she said we are fortunate in having one so inimitably lovely for our queen it makes one wonder where so much beauty could have been hidden i suppose she meant this as an innuendo that i was not therefore accustomed to such good company i thought of fleet lane and the market and i laughed aloud but lord chudleigh was expected to dance with another lady before the ball was opened and here was another disappointment for poor peggy for he led out nancy who took his hand with a pride and joy which did one's heart good to look at if i had been afraid to raise my eyes nancy was not she looked in my lord's face and laughed she talked and prattled all the time she was dancing and she danced as if the music was too slow for her as if she would fain have been spinning round like a school girl when she makes cheeses as if her limbs were springs as if she would gladly have taken her partner by both hands and run round and round with him as she had so often done with me when we were children together playing in the meadows beside the hall all the people looked on and laughed and clapped their hands never was so merry a minuet if that stately dance could ever be made merry as for me i was able to look at his face again though that was only to begin the punishment of my crime what did i remember of him a tall young man of slender figure with cheeks red and puffed a forehead on which the veins stood out ready to burst a hand that shook eyes that looked wildly round him a dreadful terrible and shameful memory but now how changed as for his features i hardly recognised them at all yet i knew him for the same man go get a cunning limner and painter make him draw you a face stamped with some degrading vice or taken at the moment of committing some grievous sin against the conscience suppose for instance that the cheeks swell out with gluttony or let the lips tremble with intemperance or let the eyes grow keen and hawk like with gambling let any vice he pleases be stamped upon that face then let him go away and draw that face which before was dark with sin and marked with the seal of the devil as it should be pure wise and noble as god who hath somewhere laid by the model and type of every created face intended it to be you will know it and you will know it not the face which i had seen was not the face of a drunkard but of a drunken man of a man heavy and stupid with unaccustomed drink i had always thought of him as of a creature of whose violence in his cups i should go in daily terror when it should please the doctor to take me to my husband now that i saw the face again the spirit of drunkenness gone out of it it seemed as if the man could never stoop to weakness or folly so strong were the features so noble were the eyes how could such a man with such a face and such a bearing go about with such a secret but perhaps like me he did not suffer himself to think about it for his face was as that of david when he was full of his great mission or of apollo the sun god or of adonis whom the syrian women weep or of troilus when he believed that cressida was true to be sure he never thought of the thing at all he put it behind him as an evil dream he would take no steps until he wished to be married when he would instruct his lawyers and they would break the bonds which were no true bonds asunder if he thought at all he would think that he was married if that was indeed a marriage to some poor unworthy wretch who might be set aside at pleasure why should his thoughts ever dwell so i said to myself with jealous bitterness on the girl who stood before him for ten minutes her face muffled in a hood her eyes cast down who placed a trembling and wicked hand in his and swore to follow his fortunes for better for worse alas poor kitty her case seemed sad indeed then my lord finished his minuet with nancy and other couples advanced into the arena and the dancing became general of course there was nothing but minuets until eight o'clock nancy was merry she said that her partner was delightful to dance with partly because he was a lord and a title she said gives an air of grace to any block partly because he danced well and talked amiably he is a pretty fellow my dear she said though of position too exalted for one so humble as myself he had exhausted all his compliments upon the queen and had none for a simple maid of honour which i told him at parting and it made him blush like a girl how i love to see a man blush it is a sign that there is yet left some remains of grace perhaps lord chudleigh is not so hardened as his fellows look at peggy's languid airs she thinks a minuet should be danced as if you were going to die the very next minute and she rolls her eyes about as if she were fainting for a man to kiss her my dear lord chudleigh i fear is above us both yet he is but a man and all men are made of tinder and a woman is the spark i think he may be on fire before long think not upon him until you find out how his affections are disposed and whether he is free a roving lord at the watering places who is young and handsome is as dangerous to us poor damsels and plays as much havoc among our hearts as samson when he had got that jawbone among the philistines a truly dreadful thing it would be it was wonderful that she should be saying all this in ignorance how every word went home to set your affections upon a lord and to find out afterwards that he was pledged to somebody else hateful thing she would be while the minuets were dancing we stood and watched the gay throng never had i dreamed of anything so gay and animated there were three hundred people at least as many men as women and all dressed in their very best as for the ladies it was the fashion when i was a girl for all to be powdered but there were many modes of dressing the head for some wore aigrettes of jewels who could afford them some false flowers and some true flowers which were pretty and becoming for a young girl and some had coiffures a la culbutte some en dorlotte some en papillon or en vergette en equivoque en desespoir or en tete de mouton the last was the commonest in which there were curls all over the back of the head and there were french curls which looked something like eggs strung on a wire round the head and italian curls or scallop shells the petticoats were ornamented with falbalas and pretantailles most ladies wore criardes and all had hoops but some wore hoops en coupole and some small hoops and some looked like a state bed on castors and as if they had robbed the valance for the skirt and the tester for the trimmings but there is no end to the changes of fashion as for the gentlemen their vanities were mostly in the wig for though the full wig was now gone out of fashion having given place to the neat and elegant tie wig with a broad black ribbon and a little bag or a queue yet there was not wanting the full bottomed periwig the large flowing grizzle and the great wig with three tails and every kind of face the vacant the foolish the sensual the envious the eager the pert the dignified the brave the anxious the confident but none so noble as that face of my lord is our queen meditating i started for he was beside me it is my first ball i said and i am wondering at the pretty sight of so many happy and merry people their merriment i grant he replied as for their happiness we had better perhaps agree to take that for granted i suppose we all agree to give ourselves up to the pleasures of the hour i said can we not be happy even if we have a care which we try to hide i hope at least he said that miss pleydell has no cares i shook my head thinking how if all hearts were opened and all secrets known there would be wailing instead of laughter and my lord and myself would start asunder with shame on my part and loathing on his yes he said an assembly of people to please and to be pleased is a charming sight for a time we live in an atmosphere of ease and contentment and bask at the feet of the queen of hearts oh my lord i said do not pay me compliments i am only used to plain truth surely that is the honest truth he said to be queen of the wells is nothing but to be the queen of hearts is everything nay then i returned blushing i see i must put myself under the protection of mr walsingham the old beau was hovering round and gave me his hand with a great air of happiness from me he said miss pleydell knows that she will hear nothing but truth the language of gallantry with a beautiful woman is pure truth it was eight o'clock and country dances began i danced one with lord chudleigh and one with some gentleman of essex whose name i forget but i remember that next day he offered me by letter his hand and eight hundred pounds a year at nine we had tea and chocolate then more country dances in which my nancy danced with such enjoyment and happiness as made sir robert clap his hands and laugh aloud at eleven all was over mantles hoods and capuchins were donned and we walked home to our lodgings escorted by the gentlemen the last face i saw as we entered the house was that of my lord as he bowed farewell cicely was waiting to receive us o madam she cried i was looking through the door when my lord took out miss for the minuet oh oh oh how beautiful how grand she did it sure never was such a handsome pair my dear said mrs esther to me when cicely had left us i believe there never was known so great a success for a first appearance there is no doubt you are the reigning toast of the season child well enjoy when you can and be not spoiled by flattery kitty which is vanity such a face they all declare such a figure such eyes such a carriage were never before seen at epsom beware of flatterers my dear where did you get such graces from pay no heed to the compliments of the men child sure it is the prettiest creature ever formed they would turn thy head my dear in the middle of the night i awoke from an uneasy dream i thought that i was dancing with my lord before all the people at the assembly they applauded loudly and i heard them whispering what a noble pair sure heaven hath made them for each other then suddenly peggy baker burst through the crowd leading by the hand my uncle and crying lord chudleigh i congratulate you upon your marriage your bride is with you and here is the chaplain of the fleet who made you happy then the people laughed and hissed the doctor lifted his great forefinger and shook it at my lord i saw his face change from love to disgust and with a cry i hid my shameful cheeks in my hands and fled the place the waking was no better than the dreaming the husband whom i had almost forgotten and whom to remember gave me no more than a passing pang was here with me in the same town what was i to do how treat him in what words to tell him if i must tell him the dreadful the humiliating truth or again a thought which pierced my breast like a knife suppose i were condemned to see him with my own eyes falling in love step by step with another woman suppose that i were punished by perceiving that my humble and homely charms would not fix though they might attract for a single night his wandering eyes oh how could i look on in silence and endure without a word the worst that a woman can suffer ah happy esther whom the king loved above all women so that he set the royal crown upon her head the day broke while i was lying tortured by these dreadful suspicions and fears my window looked towards the east i rose opened the casement and let in the fresh morning air the downs rose beyond the house with deep heavy woods of elm and birch there was already the movement and stir of life which begins with the early dawn it is as if the wings of the birds are shaking as their pretty owners dream before they wake as if the insects on the leaves were all together exhorting each other to fly about and enjoy the morning sun because haply life being so uncertain to the insect tribe and birds so numerous that hour might be their last as if the creatures of the underwood the rabbits hares weasels ferrets snakes and the rest were moving in their beds and rustling the dry leaves on which they lie over the tree tops spread broader and broader the red glow of the morning the sounds of life grew more distinct and the great sun sprang up then i heard a late singing thrush break into his sweet song which means a morning hymn of content the other birds had mostly done their singing long before july but near him there sang a turtle with a gentle coo which seemed to say that she had got all she wanted or could look for in life and was happy truly not the spacious firmament on high alone but all created things do continually teach man to laud praise and glorify the name of the great creator whoso says the psalmist is wise and will observe these things but alas for our foolishness i looked and drank the sweetness of the air and felt the warmth of the sun but i thought of nothing but my husband mine and yet not mine nor could he ever be mine save for such confession and shame as made my heart sick to think of to be already in love with a man whom one had seen but twice was it not a shame yet such a man and he was already vowed to me and i to him although he knew it not and although in a secret shameful way the holy church had made us one so that as the service hath it god himself hath bound us together to be in love already o kitty kitty there is a chapter in the song of solomon which is as learned men tell us written of christ and his church the poet speaking in such an allegory that to all but the most spiritual minded he seemeth to speak of the simple love of a man and a maid and surely it may be read without sin by either man or maid in love i am she says the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land when i had read that chapter and dried my weeping eyes and perhaps prayed awhile i lay down upon my bed again and slept till cicely came at seven and called me up to dress and walk abroad chapter v how kitty wore her crown thus happily began our stay at epsom wells after our morning walk we returned home being both fatigued with the excitement and late hours and one at least desirous to sit alone and think about the strange and perilous adventure of the evening strange indeed since when before did a man dance with his own wife and not recognise her perilous truly for should that man go away and give no more heed to his wife then would poor kitty be lost for ever for already was her heart engaged in this adventure and like a gambler she had staked her whole upon a single chance fortunately for her the stake was consecrated with tears of repentance bitterness of shame and prayers for forgiveness mrs esther gently dozed away the morning over pamela i was occupied with needlework cicely ran in and out of the room looking as if she longed to speak but dared not for fear of waking madam after a while she beckoned me to the door and whispered me that outside was a higgler with ducklings and cherries should we please to choose them for our dinner i followed her and after a bargain in which the surrey maiden showed herself as good as if she had been bred in fleet market though without the dreadful language she began upon the business which she was burning to tell me sure miss kitty she said all the world is talking this morning about the beautiful miss pleydell the book shop is full of nothing else the gentlemen in the coffee house can talk of nothing but of miss pleydell and up and down the terrace it is nothing but 'oh madam did you see the dancing of miss pleydell last night' 'dear madam did you remark the dress of miss pleydell' and 'can you tell me whence she comes this beautiful miss pleydell' and the men are all sighing as if their hearts would burst poor fellows and they say that lord chudleigh gave a supper after the ball to the gentlemen of his acquaintance when he toasted the beautiful miss pleydell oh the happiness he is a young nobleman with a great estate and said to be of a most virtuous and religious disposition the gentlemen are mounting ribbons in honour of the peerless kitty so i hear and you will not be offended at their venturing so to take your name and with a little encouragement they will all be fighting for a smile from the fair kitty silly girl to repeat such stories nay she replied it is all truth every word they say that never since the wells began has there been such a beauty the oldest dipper old mrs humphreys who is past eighty declares that miss pleydell is the loveliest lady that ever came to epsom when you go out this afternoon you will be finely beset and so on all the morning as her occasion brought her into the room whisking about duster in hand and always clatter clatter like the mill wheel after dinner we received a visit from no other than lord chudleigh himself he offered a thousand apologies for presenting himself without asking permission kindly adding that however he might find miss kitty whether dressed or in dishabille she could not be otherwise than charming i know one person who thought kitty in her morning frock muslin pinner and brown hair which was covered with little curls looped up loosely or allowed to flow freely to her waist prettier than kitty dressed up in hoop and patches and powder it was the mirror which told that person so and she never dared to tell it to any other he had ventured he said still speaking to mrs esther to present an offering of flowers and fruit sent to him that morning from his country house in kent and then cicely brought upstairs the most beautiful basket ever seen filled with the finest flowers peaches plums apricots and cherries i had seen none such since i said farewell to the old vicarage garden where all those things grew better i believe than anywhere else in england my lord said my aunt quite confused at such a gift such condescension what can we say but that we accept the present most gratefully indeed madam he replied there is nothing to say i am truly pleased that my poor house is able to provide a little pleasure to two ladies it is the first time i assure you that i have experienced the joy of possessing my garden then he went on to congratulate mrs esther on my appearance at the ball i hear he said that on the terrace and in the coffee house one hears nothing but the praises of the fair miss pleydell i blushed not so much at hearing my name thus mentioned because i was already in a single day fie kitty accustomed and so to speak hardened but because he smiled as he spoke my lord's smile was not like some men's bestowed upon every trifle but like his speech considered i fear indeed that even then so early in the day my heart was already thoroughly possessed of his image the child said mrs esther must not have her head turned by flattery yet i own she looked and moved like one of the three graces yet we who love her must not spoil her it was her first ball and she did her best poor child to acquit herself with credit credit said my lord kindly is a poor cold word to use for such a grace we thank your lordship mrs esther bowed with dignity this surely was a return to the pimpernel manner we have been living in seclusion for reasons which need not be related for some time therefore kitty has never been before to any public assembly to be sure i do not approve of bringing forward young girls too early although for my own part i had already at her age been present at several entertainments of the most sumptuous and splendid character not only at bagnigge wells and cupid's garden but also at many great city feasts and banquets for the reception of illustrious personages particularly in the year of grace when my lamented father was lord mayor of london the dear lady could never avoid introducing the fact that she was thus honourably connected lord chudleigh however seemed interested i learned later that some had been putting about among other idle rumours that i was the daughter of a tattered country curate indeed he said i knew not that the late mr pleydell had been the lord mayor it is a most distinguished position not mr pleydell my lord sir samuel pimpernel knight my father was the lord mayor in question his father was lord mayor before him kitty pleydell is not my blood relation but my niece and ward by adoption her father was a most distinguished cambridge scholar and divine there are pleydells said lord chudleigh in warwickshire perhaps my father i said was rector of a country parish in kent where sir robert levett hath a large estate he was the younger son of the warwickshire family of that name and died in the spring of last year my relations of that county i have never met now my lord you have my genealogy complete it is an important thing to know he said laughing in a place like epsom where scandal is the staple of talk as many freedoms are taken with a lady's family as with her reputation i am glad to be provided with an answer to those who would enact the part of town crier or backbiter a character here greatly aspired to no doubt the agreeable ladies whose tongues in the next world will surely be converted into two edged swords have already furnished miss kitty with highwaymen tallow chandlers or attorneys for ancestors and wapping houndsditch or the rules of the fleet it was lucky that mrs esther had a fan for their place of residence in the same way they have most undoubtedly proved to each other that she has not a feature worth looking at that her eyes squint pray pardon me miss kitty her hair is red her figure they would have the audacity to call crooked and her voice they would maliciously say was cracked it is the joy of these people to detract from merit you can afford to be charitable miss kitty the enumeration of impossible disgraces and the distortion of the rarest charms afford these ladies some consolation for their envy and disappointment i hope my lord i said that it will not afford me a consolation or happiness to believe that my sex is so mean and envious thus to treat a harmless stranger he laughed when miss kitty grows older he said to mrs esther she will learn to place less confidence in her fellows age said mrs esther sadly brings the knowledge of evil let none of us wish to grow older not that your lordship hath yet gained the right to boast this knowledge then my lord proceeded to inform us that he purposed presenting some of the ladies of the wells with an entertainment such as it seems is expected from gentlemen of his rank but i would not he said invite the rest of the company before i had made sure that the queen of the wells would honour me with her presence i have engaged the music and if the weather holds fine we will repair to durdans park where we shall find dancing on the grass with lamps in the trees supper and such amusements as ladies love and we can provide this was indeed a delightful prospect we accepted with great joy and so with protestations of service his lordship departed there is said mrs esther about the manners of the great a charming freedom good breeding is to manners what christianity is to religion it is if one may reverently say so a law of perfect liberty my dear i think that we are singularly fortunate in having at the wells so admirable a young nobleman as well as our friends also well bred gentlefolks sir robert and lady levett i hear that the young lord eardesley is also at the wells and was at last night's assembly and no doubt there are other members of the aristocracy by whom we shall be shortly known you observed kitty the interest shown by his lordship when i delicately alluded to the rank and exalted station of my late father it is well for people to know wherever we are and especially when we are in the society of nobility that we are not common folk what ancestors did his lordship say that envious tongues would give us tallow chandlers attorneys a lying and censorious place indeed later on we put on our best and sallied forth dressed for the evening in our hoops patches and powder but not so fine as for monday's ball the terrace and new parade were crowded with people and very soon we were surrounded by gentlemen anxious to establish a reputation for wit or position by exchanging a few words with the reigning beauty of the season none other if you please than kitty pleydell but to think in how short a time only a few hours a single night that girl was so changed that she accepted almost without wondering all the incense of flattery that was offered up to her yet she knew being a girl of some sense that it was unreal and could not mean anything else a woman so bepraised and flattered would lose her head the very extravagance of gallantry preserves the sex from that calamity a woman must be a fool indeed who can really believe that her person is that of a grace her smile the smile of venus her beauty surpassing that of helen and her wit and her understanding that of sappho she knows better she knows that her wit is small and petty beside the wit of a man her wisdom nothing but to learn a little of what men have said her very beauty of which so much is said but a flower of a few years whereas the beauty of manhood lasts all a life therefore when all is said and done the incense burned the mock prayers said the hymn of flattery sung and the idol bedecked with flowers and gems she loves to step down from the altar slip away from the worshippers and run to a place in the meadows where waits a swain who will say sweet girl i love thee with all thy faults on this day therefore began my brief reign as queen of the wells mr walsingham was one of the first to salute me with courtly grace he bowed low saying we greet our queen and trust her majesty is in health and spirits then all the gentlemen round formed a lane down which we walked my old courtier marching backwards the scene mrs esther said afterwards reminded her of a certain day long ago when they crowned a queen of beauty at bagnigge wells in the presence of the lord mayor her father to be sure it was a very pretty sight to watch all these gallants making legs and handling their canes with such grace as each could command some of them having studied in those noble schools of manners the salons of paris or the reception rooms of great ladies in london yet it was certain to me that not one of them could compare with my lord my own lord i mean presently we came upon lady levett and her party when after a few words of kind greeting from her ladyship and an admonition not to believe more of what i was told than i knew to be true we divided nancy coming with me and mrs esther remaining with lady levett the music was playing and the sun shining but a fine air blew from the downs and we were beneath the shade of the trees we sat upon one of the benches and the gentlemen gathered round us gentlemen said nancy i am the queen's maid of honour you may all of you do your best to amuse her majesty and me we give you permission to exhaust yourselves in making the court happy what were they to do what had they to offer there was a bull baiting in the market at which my maid of honour cried fie there was a match with quarterstaves on the downs for the afternoon but that met with little favour we need not leave home said nancy to see two stout fellows bang each other about the head with sticks that amusement may be witnessed any summer evening with grinning through a horse collar and fighting with gloves on the village green at home pray go on to the next amusement on the list the cock pit you can leave out one young gentleman proposed that we might play with pantines a ridiculous fashion of paper doll then in vogue as a toy for ladies with nothing to do another that we should go hear the ingenious mr king lecture on astronomy another that we should raffle for chocolate creams another that we should do nothing at all for said he why do we come to the wells but for rest and quiet and if miss pleydell and her maid of honour do but grant us the privilege of beholding their charms what need we of anything but rest 'to walk and dine and walk and sup to fill the leisure moments up idly enough but to the few who've really nothing else to do yet here the sports exulting reign and laughing loves a num'rous train here beauty holds her splendid court and flatt'ring pleasures here resort' i for one should have enjoyed the witnessing of a little sport better than the homage of lovers here is miss peggy baker cried nancy jumping up oh i must speak to my dear friend miss peggy miss baker was walking slowly down the terrace accompanied by her little troop of admirers at sight of us her face clouded for a moment but she quickly recovered and smiled a languid greeting dear miss peggy cried nancy i knew she was going to say something mischievous you come in the nick of time pray command me she replied graciously it is a simple question miss baker looked suspicious oh a mere trifle miss baker looked uneasy it is only pray gentlemen were any of you in the book shop this morning all protested that they were not a denial which confirmed my opinion that impertinence was coming nay said nancy we all know the truthfulness of gallants which is as notorious as their constancy had you been there you would not have paid miss pleydell those pretty compliments which are as well deserved as they are sincere but miss peggy a scandalous report hath got abroad they say that you said this morning at the book shop that kitty pleydell's eyes squinted oh oh cried mr walsingham holding up his hands and all the rest cried oh oh and held up theirs i vow and protest cried peggy baker blushing very much i vow and protest i said interrupted nancy that it was the cruellest slander you are all good nature stand up kitty dear now tell us miss peggy before all these gentlemen do those eyes squint certainly not said poor peggy in great confusion look at them well continued nancy brown eyes full and clear eyes like an antelope saw any one eyes more straight never said peggy fanning herself violently or more beautiful eyes never replied miss peggy there said nancy i knew it i said that from the lips of miss peggy baker nothing but kind words can fall you hear gentlemen women are sometimes found who can say good things of each other and if we find the malicious person who dared report that miss peggy baker said such a thing i hope you will duck her in the horse pond miss peggy bowed to us with her most languishing air and passed on nancy held up her hands while the gentlemen looked at one another and laughed oh calumny she cried to say that kitty's eyes were askew for there had been a discussion at the book shop that morning in which the name of miss pleydell was frequently mentioned and her person bearing and face were all particularly dwelt upon miss baker as usual in their parliaments spoke oftenest and with the most animation she possessed on such occasions an insight into the defects of women that was truly remarkable and a power of representing them to others which while it was eloquent and persuasive perhaps erred on the side of exaggeration she summed up what she had to say in these kind words after all one could forgive fine clothes worn as if the girl had never had a dress on fit to be seen before and manners like a hoyden trying to seem a nun and the way of dancing taught to the cits who go to sadler's wells and a sunburnt complexion and hands as big as my fan all these things are rustic and might be cured or endured but i cannot forgive her squint and now she had to recant publicly and confess that there was no squint at all this audacious trick of nancy's was you may be sure immediately spread abroad so that for that day at least the unfortunate creature found the people looking after and laughing wherever she went naturally she hated me who really had done her no harm at all more and more the gentlemen or one among them i knew not who offered this evening a general tea drinking with the music it was served under the trees upon the open walk and was very gay and merry after the tea when the day began to decline we went to the rooms where though there was no dancing there was talking and laughing in one room and in the other games of cards of every kind cribbage whist quadrille hazard and lansquenet we wandered round the tables watching the players intent upon the chances of the cards i thought of poor sir miles lackington who might had it not been for his love of gaming have been now as he began a country gentleman with a fine estate in this room we found lord chudleigh he was not playing but was looking on at a table where sat a young gentleman and an officer in the army he did not see us and under pretence of watching the play of a party of four ladies playing quadrille one of whom was lady levett i sat down to watch him was he a gambler i presently discovered that he was not looking at the game but the players presently he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the younger man and said in a quiet voice now eardesley you have had enough this gentleman knows the game better than you i hope my lord cried the other player springing to his feet that your lordship doth not insinuate i speak what i mean sir lord eardesley will if he takes my advice play no more with you your lordship cried the gentleman in scarlet will perhaps remember that you are speaking to a gentleman who left bath a fortnight ago under such circumstances as makes it the more necessary for me to warn my friend no sir his eye grew hard and his face stern no sir do not bluster or threaten i will neither play with you nor suffer my friends to play with you nor sir will i fight with you unless you happen to attack me upon the road and sir if i see you here to morrow the master of the ceremonies will put you to the door by means of his lackeys come eardesley the gamester thus roundly accused began to bluster his honour was at stake he had been grossly insulted he would have the satisfaction of a gentleman he would let his lordship know that his rank should not protect him with these noble sentiments he left the room and the wells saw him no more then seeing me alone for i had escaped from my court being weary of compliments and speeches he came to my chair i saw you my lord i said rescue that young gentleman from the man who i suppose would have won his money is it prudent to engage in such quarrels the young gentleman he replied is in a sense my ward the man is a notorious sharper who hath been lately expelled from bath and will now i think find it prudent to leave the wells i hope miss kitty that you do not like gaming indeed my lord i do not know if i should like what i have never tried 'tis the first time i have seen card playing then you must have been brought up in a nunnery not quite that but in a village where as i have already told you my father was vicar i do not know any games of cards how did you amuse yourself in your village i read made puddings worked samplers cut out and sewed my dresses and learned lessons with nancy levett the pretty little girl who is always laughing she should always remain young never grow old and grave what else did you do we had a choir for the sunday psalms many people came every sunday to hear us sing that was another occupation then i used to ride with the boys or sometimes we would go fishing or nutting or black berrying oh there was plenty to do and the days were never too long a better education than most ladies can show he replied with his quiet air of authority and you my lord do you never play cards no he replied pray do not question me further on my favourite vices miss kitty i would not confess all my sins even to so charming and so kind a confessor as yourself i forgive you my lord i said beforehand especially if you promise to abandon them all there are sins he said slowly which sometimes leave behind them consequences which can never be forgotten or undone alas i knew what he meant his sin had left him burdened with a wife a creature who had been so wicked as to take advantage of his wickedness a woman whom he feared to hear of and already loathed poor wife poor sinner poor kitty chapter vi how the doctor wrote to kitty the next morning at dinner we heard the summons of the post boy's horn and cicely presently ran in with a letter in her hand it was addressed to me in a large bold handwriting and was sealed with red wax i opened it and found a smaller letter inside it marked private for my niece's eye alone so that both letters were from my uncle the doctor your private letter said mrs esther doubtless contains some admonition or advice designed for you alone put it in your pocket child and read it in your own room as for the other letter as it is not marked private it would be well for you to read it aloud after dinner and while we are eating one of my lord chudleigh's delicious peaches to this i willingly complied because i greatly feared the private letter would contain some instructions concerning the secret which the doctor and i possessed between us accordingly the dinner over i began the perusal of my uncle's letter my dear niece you will first of all and before reading any further convey my dutiful respects to the lady by whose goodness you have been placed in a position as much above what you could have wished as her benevolence is above the ordinary experience of mortals oh the excellent man cried mrs esther i have to report that under providence i am well in health and in all respects doing well the occupation in which i am now engaged having received a stimulus by the threatening of a new act for the prevention of so called unlawful marriages the increase in the number of applicants for marriage hath also as is natural caused an increase in the upstarts and pretenders who claim to have received canonical orders being most of them as ignorant as a butcher's block and no more ordained than the fellows who bang a cushion in a conventicle the clergymen of london complain that the parsons of the fleet take away their parishioners and deprive them of their fees they cannot say that i who never take less than a guinea undersell them you will be glad to learn that sir miles lackington hath left this place he hath lately received a legacy from a cousin of a small estate and hath made an arrangement with his creditors by virtue of which his detainers are now removed nevertheless we expect him back before long being well assured that the same temptation and vice of gambling which brought him here before will again beset him yet he promiseth brave things we gave him a farewell evening in which his health was toasted and more punch drunk than was good for the heads of some present among whom were gentlemen members of the utter bar from the two temples and lincoln's inn with many others and honourable company it will also be a pleasure to you to learn that the ingenious mr stallabras is also at large probably he too will return to us ere long for the present his sole detaining creditor who had supplied him for years with such articles of apparel at second hand as were necessary for his decent appearance on the credit of his future glory agreed to take ten guineas in full discharge of a bill for forty which the poet could never hope to pay nor the tradesman to receive the calling of poet is at best but a poor one nor should i counsel any one to practise the writing of verse unless he be a man of fortune like mr alexander pope unfortunately a papist or a fellow of some substantial college such as the houses of trinity peter and christ at cambridge like mr ray nor is there any greater unhappiness than to draw a bill to speak after the manner of merchants upon your future success and industry and to be compelled to discount it he hath now conceived the idea of a tragedy and of an epic poem the first he will endeavour to produce at drury lane as soon as it is written the second he will immediately get subscribed among his friends and patrons unfortunately he has already obtained subscriptions for a volume of verses and having eaten the subscriptions cannot now find a publisher in truth i believe the verses are not yet written this melancholy accident obliges him to seek for new patrons i wish him well it is my dear niece with the greatest satisfaction that i learn you have with mrs esther gone to epsom the situation of the place the purity of the air upon the downs the salubrity of the waters the gaiety of the company will i hope all be conducive to the health of that most excellent lady your best friend oh the good man cried mrs esther to whom i charge you be dutiful obedient and careful in the smallest punctilio the cheerfulness of the amusements if epsom be the same as when i once visited it when tutor to a young gentleman of quality should communicate to her spirits something of the joy with which i could now wish her to regard the world as for yourself my child i am under no apprehension but that music gay companions and your time of life will together make you as mirthful as is possible for human being remember however that happiness is but for a season that mirth must never pass beyond the bound of good manners and that when a woman is no longer young the reputation she has earned as a girl remains with her even to the grave wherefore kitty be circumspect the town news is but little the so styled young pretender is said to be moving again but little importance is now attached to his doings and for the moment the protestant dynasty seems firm but heaven knows here followed a quantity of news about the ministers the houses of parliament the foreign news and so forth which i omit i have seen a sermon published this year by one laurence sterne on 'conscience' which i would commend to mrs pimpernel i also commend to you dr samuel johnson's 'vanity of human wishes' and the first number of the 'rambler' of which i hear great things mr henry fielding hath produced a novel called 'tom jones' of which the town is talking i mention it here in order that you may be cautioned against a book whose sole merit is the faithful delineation of scenes and characters shocking to the female moralist for the same reason i would have thee beware of mr smollett's 'peregrine pickle' in which as a man who knows alas the wickedness of the world i find a great deal to commend the weather has been strangely hot even for july and fever is rife in this neighbourhood i hear that the bishop of london threatens me with pains and penalties i have sent word to his lordship that if he will not allow me to marry i will bury and that at such prices as will leave his clergy nothing but the fees of the paupers beggars and malefactors i think that i have no more news to send i would that i were able to send thee such tidings as might be looked for in a london letter but i know not what actor is carrying away all hearts nor what lady is the reigning toast nor what is the latest fashion in cardinal sack patch or tie wig nor anything at all that is dear to the hearts of an assembly on the terrace of epsom therefore with my duty to mrs pimpernel i remain my dear niece your loving uncle gregory shovel doctor of divinity post scriptum i enclose herewith a short letter of admonition which thou mayest read by thyself as such things are not interesting to mistress pimpernel now cried mrs esther was there ever such a man living in such a place he preserves his virtue among such dregs and offscourings of mankind he stands still erect proclaiming and preaching christian virtue o kitty why was not that man made a bishop sure there is no other position in the world fit for him with what eloquence would he defend christian faith with what righteous indignation would he not expel evil doers i did not dare to ask which of course occurred to me what indignation he would show against such as violated the law by marrying in the fleet now i said with your permission madam i will retire in order to read my uncle's private letter of admonition i opened the short note in fear yet there was nothing alarming in it my dear niece i add a word to say that lord chudleigh is going to visit epsom and hath either engaged or been offered the mansion of durdans for the summer perhaps he is already there it may be that you will make his acquaintance in any case you cannot fail of being interested in his doings since his visit to the fleet i hear that he has been afflicted with a continual melancholy of which you and i know the cause he has also led a very regular and almost monastic life reproaching himself continually for that lapse from temperance which led to what he regards as the curse of his life child if he pays you attentions receive them with such coquettish allurements as your sex knows how to hang out on this point i cannot advise but if he is attracted by more showy and more beautiful women i looked at the glass and smiled then be careful not to exhibit any jealousy or anger remember that jealousy and anger have ruined many a femina furens or raging woman let things go on as if nothing of all that you and i wot of had happened he will be watched and at the right time will be called upon to acknowledge his wife such a return for the evil done me by his father shall be mine and with such a return of good for evil a brilliant position for yourself if he should fall in love if he hath not already done so with another woman you would in one moment blast his hopes trample on all that he held dear and make him ridiculous a criminal and a deceiver but it is at all times a more christian thing for a man to fall in love with his own wife remember my dear kitty i place the utmost reliance on thy good sense above all no woman's jealousies rages and fits of madness these things will only do thee harm your loving uncle gregory shovel doctor of divinity were one a stock or a stone had one no feelings were one destitute of pity sympathy and compassion these letters might have been useful as guides to conduct but the thing had happened to me which my uncle in his worldly wisdom could never calculate upon i had fallen in love with lord chudleigh i was passionately anxious that he should fall in love with me what room in such a condition of mind as was this man for advice so cold so interested as this return good for evil what had i to do with that i wanted to wreak no vengeance on my lord i would have surrounded him with love and been willing to become his servant his slave anything if only he would forgive me take me for his sweetheart and make me his wife but to lay those snares to look on coldly while he made love to other women to wait my time so as to bring shame and remorse upon that noble heart that kitty was impossible yet i could not write to my uncle things which he could not understand i could not say that i repented and was very sorry that i loved my lord and was determined to inflict no harm upon him and that if he chose to fall in love with another woman who was i indeed that he should love me i was firmly resolved that no act or word of mine should injure him even though i had to stand in the church and see him with my own eyes married to that other that happy woman before the altar chapter vii how kitty broke her promise no one must think that i was sorry or even embarrassed when i heard that harry temple had joined the company at epsom and though the name of coquette was given me by him and that of jilt with such other abusive terms as the english tongue provides by will levett later on i beg that every one will believe me when i declare that i had no knowledge at all of being betrothed or under any kind of promise to either of these two young men yet as will have been perceived by any who have read the second chapter of this narrative both of them had just grounds for believing me to be their promised wife in fact i was at the time so silly and ignorant that i did not understand what they meant nor had i being so much tossed about and seeing so many changes ever thought upon their words at all since and whereas there was no day in which the thought of my dear and fond nancy did not come into my mind there never was a day at all in which my memory dwelt upon either will or harry save as companions of nancy and although grievous things followed upon this neglect of mine i cannot possibly charge myself with any blame in the matter as for will indeed his conduct was such as to relieve me of any necessity for repentance while harry even if he did play the fool for a while speedily recovered his senses and found consolation in the arms of another lastly men ought not to go frantic for any woman they should reflect that there are good wives in plenty to be had for the asking women virtuously reared who account it an honour as they should to receive the offer of an honest man's faithful service that no woman is so good as to have no equal among her contemporaries while as for beauty that is mostly matter of opinion i am sure i cannot understand why they made me queen of the wells when nancy levett was passed over and i have since seen many a plain girl honoured as a beauty while the most lovely faces were neglected the first then of my two lovers or promised husbands who arrived at epsom was harry temple we were walking on the new parade in the afternoon making a grand display i in my new purple velvet with purple ribbons a purple mantle and purple trimmings to my hat very grand indeed mr walsingham was talking like a lover in a novel i mean of the old fashioned and romantic school of novel now gone out the art of saying fine things now too much neglected by the young was then studied by old and young ladies he was saying should never be seen save in the splendour of full dress they should not eat in public unless it be chocolates and turkish sweets nor drink unless it be a dish of tea they should not laugh lest they derange the position of the patch or the nice adjustment of the coiffure they may smile however upon their lovers all their movements should be trim and evenly balanced according to rules of grace in fact just as a woman was the last and most finished work in nature so a lady dressed taught and cultivated should be the last and most finished work in art the power of beauty miss pleydell will approve this should be assisted by the insinuation of polite address rank should be enhanced by the assumption of a becoming dignity dishabille should hide at home nor should she show herself abroad until she has heightened and set off her charms by silk and satin ribbons and lace paint powder and patches i suppose sir said nancy pointing to an absurd creature whose follies were the diversion of the whole company the dress of the lady over there in the short sack would please you her body a state bed running upon castors and her head dress made up of trimmings taken from the tester she is sir i take it a finished work of art then she screamed o kitty here is harry temple and then she blushed so that mr walsingham looked at both of us with a meaning smile he came sauntering along the walk looking about him carelessly for as yet he knew none of the company his manner was improved since last i saw him a year and more ago that was doubtless due to a visit to the continent he was a handsome fellow certainly though not so tall or so handsome as lord chudleigh his features were smaller and his air less distinguished but still a pretty fellow i thought of nancy's secret and laughed to myself as yet never suspecting what he would say the great difference at first sight between harry temple and lord chudleigh was that the former looked as if he was ready to take the place which the world would assign to him while the latter would step to the front and stand there as if in his proper place it is a grand thing to be a leader of men suddenly he saw us and stood still with such a look of bewilderment and astonishment as i never saw nancy he had his eyes upon me all the time i knew you were here but but here nancy burst out laughing harry does not remember you kitty oh the inconstancy of men kitty it was his turn to look confused now is it possible kitty pleydell yet surely i am sorry that mr temple so easily forgets his old friends i said no no forget not at all he was so disconcerted that he spoke in single words but such a change a year ago i said i was in russet and brown holland with a straw hat but this watering place is not my native village and i wear brown holland frocks no longer save in a pastoral said mr walsingham a shepherdess should always wear brown holland with ribbons and patches powder and paint and a crook beautifully wreathed with green ribbons gentlemen i said to my followers this is my old friend mr harry temple of wootton hampstead kent whom you will i doubt not welcome among you but what punishment shall be inflicted upon him for forgetting a lady's face this gave rise to a dispute on an abstract point of gallantry one held that under no circumstances and during no time of absence however prolonged should a gentleman forget the face of his mistress another that if the lady changed say from a child to a woman the forgetfulness of her face must not be charged as a crime we argued the point with great solemnity nancy gave it as her opinion that the rest of a woman's face might be forgotten but not the eyes because they never change mr walsingham combated this opinion he said that the eyes of ladies change when they marry what change i asked the eyes of a woman who is fancy free said he gravely are like stars when she marries they are planets nay said nancy a woman does not wait to be married before her eyes undergo that change as soon as she falls in love they become planets for whereas before that time they go twinkle twinkle upon every pretty fellow who has the good taste to fall in love with her as mine do when i look upon lord eardesley the young fellow blushed so after she is in love they burn with a steady light upon the face of the man she loves as mine do when i turn them upon mr walsingham she gazed with so exaggerated an ardour into the old beau's wrinkled and crows' footed face that the rest of us laughed he for his part made a profound salute and declared that the happiness of his life was now achieved and that he had nothing left to live for in the evening a private ball was given in the assembly rooms by some of the gentlemen lord chudleigh among the number to a circle of the most distinguished ladies at the wells in right of my position as queen i opened the ball of course with his lordship afterwards i danced with harry when the country dances began i danced again with harry who kept looking in my eyes and squeezing my hand in a ridiculous fashion at first i set it down to rejoicing and fraternal affection but he quickly undeceived me when the dance was over for while we stood aside to let others have their turn he began about the promise which we know of little did i think sweet kitty he said with half shut eyes that when i made that promise to bring you back into kent you would grow into so wonderful a beauty well harry i replied it was kindly meant of you and i thank you for your promise which i now return you you return me my promise he asked as if surprised whereas he ought most certainly to have considered what had been my country ignorance and my maidenly innocence when he gave me his promise certainly i said seeing that i am now under the protection of mrs esther pimpernel and have no longer any need for your services my services as if still more surprised i am convinced that he was only acting astonishment because he must have known the truth had he reflected at all why kitty i do not understand you are not surely going to throw me over then i understood at last harry i said there has been i fear some mistake no he replied no mistake no mistake at all how could there be a mistake you promised that you would return with me never to go away again why so i did but harry i never thought you must have known what i meant kitty do not pretend that you did not oh you may open your eyes as wide as you like but i shall believe it nevertheless you have made a great mistake i said that is very certain now let us have no more talk of such things harry lord chudleigh came at that moment to lead me in to supper i thought very little of what had passed being only a little vexed that harry had made so great a blunder the supper was pleasant too with plenty of wax candles cold chickens capons wheat ears ice creams and champagne which is certainly the most delicious wine ever made after supper my lord asked me if there was any friend of mine whom i would especially like to be invited to his party at durdans i named harry temple whom my lord immediately sought out and invited in my name harry bowed sulkily but accepted is there any person lord chudleigh asked next whom you would like not to be asked no i said i have no enemies as if the queen of the wells could avoid having enemies he laughed but there are none who can do you harm even by the venom of spiteful tongues he was silent for a minute or two and then he went on with hesitation pardon me miss pleydell i have no right to speak of these things to you my interest is greater than my politeness and i venture to ask you a question pray speak my lord a spiteful tongue has whispered it abroad that you have to day given your plighted lover a cold reception who is my plighted lover mr harry temple tell me miss pleydell if there is any promise between you and this gentleman he looked at me in such a way as made me both rejoice and tremble no my lord i said blushing against my will and to my great confusion i am not promised to mr temple will your lordship take me to the dancing room it was a bright moonlight night when we came away we walked home escorted by some of the gentlemen lord chudleigh as he stooped to take my hand raised it rapidly to his lips and pressed my fingers the action was not seen i think by the others that night i tried to put the case plainly to myself i said kitty my dear the man you want above all other men to fall in love with you has done it at least it seems so he seeks you perpetually he talks to you he singles you out from the rest he is jealous his eyes follow you about he sends fruit and flowers to you he gives an entertainment and calls you the queen of the feast he presses your hand and kisses your fingers what more kitty would you have on the other hand i thought if he falls in love with you being already married as he believes to another woman he commits a sin against his marriage vows yet what sin can there be in breaking vows pronounced in such a state as he was in and in such a way why they seem to me no vows at all in spite of the validity of the doctor's orders and the so called blessing of the church yet he cannot part from his wife by simply wishing and knowing that he does actually commit the sin of deceit in loving another woman kitty what would you have for if he doth not love you then are you miserable above all women and if he does then are you grieved for his own sake for it is a sin and ashamed for your own because your confession will be a bitter thing to say yet must it be made soon or late oh with what face will you say to him 'my lord i am that wife of the fleet wedding' or 'my lord you need not woo me for i was won before i was wooed' or perhaps worst thing of all 'my lord the girl who caught your fickle fancy for a moment at epsom whom you passed over after a day or two for another who was not pretty enough to fix your affections is your lawful wife' kitty i fear that the case is hopeless indeed for should he really love you what forelook or expectancy is there but that the love will turn to hatred when he finds that he has been deceived then i could not but remember how a great lord with a long rent roll of illustrious descent might think it pleasant for a day or two to dance attendance upon a pretty girl by way of sport meaning nothing further but that he could not think seriously of so humble a girl as myself in marriage it would matter little to him that she was descended from a long line of gentlemen although but a vicars daughter the pleydells were only simply country gentlefolk i was a simple country clergyman's daughter whose proper place would be in his mother's still room a daughter of one of those men whose very vocation for the most part awakens a smile of pity or contempt according as they are the sycophants of the squire whose living they enjoy or the drudges of their master the rector whose work they do it was not in reason to think that lord chudleigh would to heaven he had not come to epsom wells at all then when the doctor chose the day for revealing the truth i might have borne the hatred and scorn which now i thought would kill me oh if one could fix him by what arts do girls draw to themselves the love of men and then keep that love for ever so that they never seek to wander elsewhere and the world is for them like the garden of eden with but one man and one woman in it i would have all his heart and that so firmly and irrevocably given to me that forgiveness should follow confession and the heart remain still in my keeping when he knew all my wickedness and shame then a sudden thought struck me long ago when i was a child i had learned or taught myself a thing which i could fain believe was not altogether superstitious one day my father who would still be talking of ancient things and cared for little of more modern date than the gospels told me of a practice among the ancients by which they thought to look into the future it was an evil practice he said because if these oracles were favourable they advanced with blind confidence and if unfavourable with a heart already prepared for certain defeat and death their method was nothing in the world but the opening of a virgil anywhere and accepting the first line which offered itself as a prophecy of the event of their undertaking i was but a little thing when he told me this but i pondered it in my mind and i reasoned in this way nothing doubting that the ancients did really in this manner read the future if these pagans could tell the event by consulting the words of virgil a heathen like unto themselves how much more readily ought we to learn what is going to happen by consulting the actual word of god thereupon without telling any one i used to consult this oracle probably by myself in every little childish thing which interested me it was a thing presumptuous though in my childhood i did not know that it was a sin yet i did it on this very night a grown up woman trying to get a help to soothe my mind the moonlight was so bright that i could read at the open window without a candle i had long since extinguished mine i opened the bible at random kept my finger on a verse and took the book to the casement there i read wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i say on the lord now these words i thankfully accepted as a solemn message from heaven an answer to my prayer so i laid me down and presently fell fast asleep chapter viii how kitty had letters and verses everybody knows that a watering place in summer is a nest of singing birds i do not mean the birds of the air nor the ladies who sing at the concerts nor the virtuosos male and female who gather together to talk of appogiatura sonata and and the rest of the musical jargon i mean rather those epigrammatists libellous imitators of pasquin and love verse writers who abound at such places mostly they are anonymous so that one cannot thank them as one would the verses this year at epsom came down upon us in showers they were stuck up on the pillars of the porch of the assembly rooms they were laid upon the table of the book shop they were handed about on the terrace also they came to me at my lodgings and to nancy at hers and very likely to peggy baker at hers here for instance is one set which were shown round at the assembly epsom could boast no reigning toast the terrace wept for pity kind fortune said 'come lift your head i send you stately kitty' she came she reigned but still disdained the crowd's applause and fancy quoth fortune 'then content ye men with pretty witty nancy' every morning lovers were at our feet on paper they wrote letters enjoining me by those soft killing eyes which rhymed with sighs to take pity on their misery or to let them die you would have thought to read their vows that all the men in the town were in profound wretchedness they could not sleep they could no longer go abroad they were wasting and pining away they were the victims of a passion which was rapidly devouring them death they said would be welcomed as a deliverer yet it will hardly be believed that in spite of so dreadful an epidemic of low fever no outward signs of it were visible in the town at all the gentlemen were certainly fat and in good case their hearts seemed merry within them they laughed made jokes sang and were jolly to outward show their appetites were good they were making apparently no preparations for demise their letters and verses were however anonymous so that it was impossible to point with accuracy to any sufferer who thus dissembled from information conveyed to me by cicely crump i believe that the verses and letters came in great measure from the apprentices and shopmen employed by the mercers haberdashers hosiers and drapers of the town young men whose employment brings them constantly into the presence of ladies but whose humble positions in the world forbid them to do anything more than worship at a great distance yet their hearts are as inflammable as their betters and their aspirations are sometimes above their rank as witness the gallant elopement of joshua crump cicely's father with miss jenny medlicott daughter of an alderman then they find relief and assume a temporary dignity as they fondly think in writing anonymous love letters i think the letters must have come from these foolish and conceited young men because i cannot understand how a gentleman who values his self respect could so far humiliate himself as to write letters which he would be ashamed to sign declaring himself the foolish victim of a foolish passion and addressing a fellow creature a being like himself with all the imperfections of humanity upon her as an angel which is blasphemous and a sun of glory which is nonsense or a bright particular star which is copied from the preface to the bible i confess that we liked the open compliments and public attentions of the gentlemen they pleased us and we took them in sober honesty for what they were worth the base coin of gallantry rings as pleasantly sometimes as the guinea gold of love but it is one thing to be called a goddess in the accepted language of exaggeration and mock humility commonly used in polite assemblies and another to be addressed in a grovelling strain seriously and humbly as if one were the lama of thibet or the great bashaw or the pope himself it is pleasant to see a young fellow dancing along the walk with his hat under his arm making reverence with his eyes full of admiration his face lit with smiles and compliments upon his tongue because one knows that it is the natural homage paid by an honest fellow to a pretty girl and that when years have robbed the beauty the homage will be paid to some one else but for these silly boys' letters and then we made the sad discovery by comparing our letters that they were not even original many of them were word for word the same showing that they had been copied from the same model if it be true that passion makes the most tongue tied lover eloquent then this discovery proved that the violence of the passion was as feigned as the letters were false unless nancy's supposition was true fie cried she the wretch has written the same letters to both of us can he be in love with two maids at the same time then she took both letters and showed them about among the company there was another kind of letter which i received it was filled with slander and abuse and was written in disguised handwriting several of them came to me and i was foolish enough to be vexed over them even to shed tears of vexation my anonymous correspondent gave me in fact such information and advice as the following which was not conveyed to me all at once but in several letters your lord chudleigh is very well known to be a gambler who hath already dipped more than half his estate do you think it possible that he should marry the daughter of that poor thing a country parson with no more fortune to her back than what a city madam may chance to give her be not deceived your triumph is to walk the terrace with him at your elbow your disgrace will be when he leaves you to lament alone do not think that any other gentleman will stoop to pick up the cast off fancy of lord chudleigh when he leaves you expect nothing but general desertion and contempt this advice comes from a well wisher lord chudleigh is as is very well known the falsest and the most fickle of men when he hath added you to the list of women whom he hath deceived he will go away to bath or town there to boast of what he hath done he belongs to the seven devils' club whose boast it is to spare no man in play and no woman in love be warned in time poor kitty pleydell your reputation is now indeed cracked if not broken altogether better retire to the obscurity of your town lodging where with mrs pimpernel you may weep over the chances that you think to have lost but have never really possessed better take up while is yet time with harry temple all the wells is talking of your infatuation about lord chudleigh he for his part is amused with his friends he laughs and makes sport and so on and so on words which like the buzzing of a fly or the sting of a gnat annoy for a while and are then forgotten for the moment one is angry then one remembers things and words which show how false are these charges one reflects that the writer is more to be pitied than the receiver and one forgives perhaps i was the readier to forgive because i saw a letter written by no other from the similarity of the t's and k's than miss peggy baker and was fully persuaded that the writer of these unsigned letters was that angry nymph herself as for the verses which were left at the door and brought by boys who delivered them and ran away nancy said they had no clothes on except a quiver and a pair of wings and so ran away for shame lest cicely should see them they bore a marvellous resemblance to those which the ingenious mr stallabras was wont to manufacture they spoke of nymphs and doves and bosky groves of kids and swains on verdant plains of shepherds' reeds and flowery meads of rustic flutes and rural fruits the fashion of verses said mrs esther seems little changed since we were here in doubtless the english language has never been able to achieve a greater excellence than that arrived at by dryden pope addison and steele perhaps the language of love is always the same and when a man feels that tender emotion he naturally desires to quit the garish town and the artificial restraints of society and with his inamorata to seek the simple delights of the meadows and the fields there to be together come live with me and be my love and we will all the pleasures prove so that to every lover the old language with its musty tropes and rusty figures is new and fresh just as any other delight in life when first tasted i say nothing for that poor weakling that hothouse plant the passion affected by beaux at a watering place for fashionable beauties which may use the strong language of real love and yet is so fragile as to be in danger of perishing with every cold blast and frosty air i would not laugh at these simple poets because i have learned since then that there are youths who too bashful to speak may yet conceive such a pure and noble passion for a woman who certainly does not deserve it as may serve for them as a stimulus and goad to great actions for no creature whether man or woman can do fit suit and service to another whether in thought or action without endeavouring to make himself fit and worthy to be her servant and if he be but one of a hundred following in a crowd of worshippers it is good for him to mark and obey the laws of gallantry and knightly service and to lay aside for a while the talk of barrack stable coffee house and gaming room pretty moralist said nancy you would like the young fellows at your heel doing suit and service and you would like to feel that their attendance is doing good to their innocent souls now for my part i think only how they may be doing good to myself and when i see them figuring and capering hat under arm one foot valiantly stuck out so the ties of their wigs wagging behind them and their canes bobbing at their wrists i feel my dear as if i was not born in vain all this posturing all this capering like a french dancing master or a bear with a hurdy gurdy is meant for me that is except what is meant for you which is the larger half it may do good to the men i am sure i wish from my heart it does because the poor profligates want so much good done to them but i rather love to think of the honour it confers upon us women and the envy hatred and malice it awakens in the breast of our sisters my dear peggy baker is turning positively green with this hateful passion of jealousy to be a toast even a second toast like me when your superior charms i am not a bit jealous kitty my dear have had their due acknowledgment is a very great honour in years to come say about the beginning of the nineteenth century if i live so long i shall say to my grandchildren who will then be about eighteen or nineteen and as beautiful as the day 'my dears' i shall say 'your grandmother though you will find it difficult to believe was not always toothless nor did her hands always shake nor were her cheeks wrinkled nor were her chin and nose close together look in the glass girls and you may guess what your poor old grandmother once was in the days when she was pretty nancy levett a toast when the beautiful kitty pleydell was queen of the wells kitty pleydell who married ' no my dear i will not say it because it might bring you bad luck i told nancy about harry temple's strange mistake she grew very serious over it and reflected what was best to be done i warned her to say nothing herself but to leave him to his own reflections first he sulked that is to say he avoided me in public and did not even pay his respects to mrs pimpernel in private then he implored me to give him another hearing i gave him what he asked i heard him tell his story over again then i assured him once more that it was impossible he behaved very strangely refused to take my answer as final and vexed us by betraying in public the discontent and anger which had he possessed any real regard for me he ought to have kept a secret in his own breast some of the backbiters as lord chudleigh told me put it about that i had thrown over my former lover allusion to this calumny was made as has already been shown in the anonymous letters lord chudleigh paid me no compliments and wrote me no verses nor did he often join in our train upon the terrace but he distinguished us by frequently paying a visit to our lodgings in the morning when he would sit and read or talk and sometimes share our simple dinner we who belong to the great city houses said mrs esther after one of these visits are accustomed from infancy to familiarity with nobility my father when worshipful master of the scourers' company or in his year of office as lord mayor would sometimes have a peer on one side and a bishop on the other baronets and simple knights we hardly valued therefore these visits of his lordship which are no doubt a great distinction for both of us seem like a return of my childhood we learned from lord chudleigh that it was his intention afterwards fully carried out to take that active part in the administration of state affairs to which his exalted rank naturally called him i am ever of opinion he said that a gentleman in this country owes it to his birth and position to do his utmost for the preservation of our liberties and the maintenance of sound government and he once told us to our astonishment that had he lived in the days of charles the first he should have joined the party of the parliament it seemed to me who watched him narrowly and with trembling that he was desirous in these visits to find out what manner of person i was and whether i possessed any virtues to illustrate that external comeliness which had already taken his fancy alas i thought continually with shame of the time when i should have to throw myself at his feet and implore his mercy and forgiveness then he encouraged me to talk about my childhood and my father taking pleasure i thought in the contemplation of a life given up to heaven and learning and smiling at the picture of lady levett who ruled us all the two boys who came home to tease the girls and little nancy so fond and so pretty i wondered then that he should care to hear about the way i lived the books i read the death of my honoured father and the little things which make up a country maid's life wherein the ripples and the gentle breezes are as important to her as great storms and gales to men and women of the world i know now that when a man loves a girl there is nothing concerned with her that he does not want to know so that her image may be present to him from the beginning and that he may feel that there has been no year of her life no action of hers at all that he does not know with what she thought what she did who were her friends and what she was like thus he told me about his own country house which was a very fine place indeed and his gardens stables library pictures and all the splendid things which he had inherited two things we hid from each other the one that i was the girl whom he had married the other that he was already married child said nancy the young lord hath plainly bewitched thee remember my dear that a woman must not be won too easily can we not break his heart a little lady levett took occasion to speak to me to the same effect kitty she said i have eyes in my head and can see do not encourage the man too much yet it would be a grand match and i should be well content to see a coronet on that pretty head still be not too ready but he is a handsome fellow and i believe as good as we can expect of any man in this profligate age nay child do not change colour i know nothing against his character except that he has a town house and that he has lived much in london but make him feel a little the pangs of love listen or pretend to listen to the addresses of another man when my husband came courting me do you think i said yes all at once not so there were other suitors in the field let me tell thee kitty as young and as rich as sir robert and of as good a family to be sure there was none so good in my eyes as for one he rode to hounds all day and in the evening slept in his chair he broke his neck jumping a brook when he was but thirty another he drank october all day long and at night was carried to bed like a log when he was forty he was taken with a seizure being still a bachelor all for love of me and his brown jug which i think he loved still more and a third he was choleric and used to beat his grooms now my dear a man who beats his grooms is just as likely to beat his wife wherefore beware of strikers and a fourth he was a gambler and all night over his cards so that i would have none of him he lost his estate and went into the austrian service there he was run through the body and killed in a duel by a french chevalier who had first robbed him at faro but do not think i let my true love know my resolution i plagued him first and teased him until he was humble then i bade him be happy and the good man hath been happy ever since alas i could not tease my lord or plague him i could not coquet with other men even though peggy went about saying the silly wretch is in love with him she shows it in her eyes oh the impudence chapter ix how lord chudleigh went to london without telling any one of his intention lord chudleigh posted one morning to town i was acquainted with this news by miss peggy baker who informed me of it in her kindest manner dear miss pleydell she said after morning service as we were coming out of church have you heard the dreadful news i have heard no news i replied we have lost the chief ornament of the company yes you may well turn pale i am sure i did nothing of the kind lord chudleigh has left epsom some say for the season some say on account of some distaste he has conceived for the place some say on account of previous engagements what kind of engagements i thought you would ask that it is rumoured that he is shortly to be married to a young lady of good birth and with a fortune equal to his own it is certain that he will not return really said nancy who had now come to my aid how shall you be able to exist dear miss peggy without him i oh indeed i am not concerned with lord chudleigh i mean how can you exist when the principal subject for scandalous talk and the chief cause of anonymous letters is removed she blushed and bit her lips i think miss levett she gasped that you allow your tongue greater liberties than are consistent with good breeding better the tongue than the pen dear miss baker replied nancy come kitty we will go weep the absence of this truant lord the temple still remains he he said miss baker this was a conversation at which i could laugh spiteful though it was i knew not that my lord was gone away nor why but one thing i knew very well he was not gone to marry any one if that can be called ease which was mostly shame i felt easy because ordinary jealousy was not possible with me he could not marry if he wished poor lad his fate was sealed with mine yet thinking over what might happen i resolved that night upon a thing which would perhaps incense my uncle the doctor beyond all measure i resolved that should that thing happen which most i dreaded that my lord should fall in love with another woman i would myself without his ever knowing who had done it release him from his ties i knew where the doctor kept his registers i would subtract the leaf which certified our union and would send it to my lord or should the doctor as was possible propose any legal action i would refuse to appear or to act now without me the doctor was powerless lord chudleigh went to town in fact to see the doctor he drove to his town house in st james's square and in the morning he sallied forth and walked to the fleet market the reverend doctor shovel was doing a great and splendid business already there were rumours of the intention of government to bring in a bill for the suppression of these lawless fleet marriages therefore in order to stimulate the lagging he had sent his messengers touters and runners abroad in every part of the city calling on all those who wished to be married secretly or to avoid wedding expenses feasts and junketings and to be securely married to make haste while there was yet time therefore there was a throng every day from seven in the morning of prentices with their masters' daughters old men with their cooks tradesmen who would avoid the feasting sailors home for a few weeks as eager to marry a wife as if they were to be home for the whole of their natural lives officers who wanted to secure an heiress and many honest folk who saw in a fleet wedding the easiest way of avoiding the expenses of their friends' congratulations with the foolish charges of music bells dancing and rejoicing which often cripple a young married couple for years why the parents connived with the girls and when these ran away early in the morning and came home falling upon their knees to confess the truth the play had been arranged and rehearsed beforehand and the forgiveness took the form of money for furniture instead of for feasting but still the parents went about holding up their hands and calling heaven to witness that they could not have believed their daughter so sly and deceitful a puss hither came lord chudleigh heavy of heart the doctor at eleven in the morning was in the full swing of his work two couples of the lower class were being married in the house outside the place was beset with wedding parties couples coming shyly and timidly and couples coming openly and without shame the touters and runners of the rival fleet parsons were fighting swearing cajoling and inviting people to stop with them holding out offers of cheapness safe marriage expedition secrecy and rum punch strangers to london who had never heard of doctor shovel's greatness were led away to those pretenders whose canonical orders were so doubtful i believe the world at large entertains contempt for all fleet parsons as a body happily no longer existent but for my own part while i hold the memory of the doctor in mingled shame and respect i despise the rest because he himself held them in such low esteem roger the touter recognised his lordship as he made his way slowly through the mob along the side of the market good morning my lord he said his face was bloody and bruised his tie wig was awry his coat was torn so fierce had been the struggle of the morning good morning my lord we have not seen your lordship this long while would your lordship like speech with the doctor he is busy now and six couples wait him warm work it is now but i think he will see your lordship we should be glad to drink your lordship's health the fellow made his way through the crowd and presently returned saying that the doctor was very near the benediction after which he would give his lordship ten minutes but no longer and should lose a guinea for every minute the doctor in fact was dismissing a pair of couples with a few words of advice they were respectable young city people getting the secret marriage for the reasons which i have already described you are now he said married according to the rites of holy mother church you are tied to each other for life i hope you will thank and continually bless my name for tying the knot this morning remember what the church charges her children in the words of the service go be honest in your dealings thrifty in your habits cautious in your trusts careful of small gains so shall you prosper let the husband avoid the tavern in the morning and the conventicle on the sunday let the wife study plain roast and boiled make her own dresses pretend not to be a fine madam and have no words with gallants from the west of temple bar if on the other hand he went on knitting his brows the husband spends his money in clubs among the freemasons and in taverns if he do not stick to business if he cheat in his transactions or if the wife go finely dressed and talk with pretty fellows when she ought to be cleaning the furniture if they both go not to church regularly and obey the instruction of their rector vicar or curate then i say the fate of that couple shall be a signal example for the husband shall be hanged at tyburn tree and the wife be flogged at bridewell go they bowed being overwhelmed with the terrors of this parting advice and departed outside they were greeted with a roar of rough congratulation and were followed by the shouts of the market till they reached fleet bridge where they were quickly lost in the crowd then the doctor turned to lord chudleigh your lordship has come i suppose he asked to inquire after the health of her ladyship i come doctor shovel replied my lord gravely to know from your own lips before i commit the affair to counsel how far i am compromised by the disgraceful trick you played upon me about a year ago your lordship is married said the doctor simply so far are you compromised and no further nay we seek no further complication in this business he sat down in his wooden arm chair and with his elbow on the table knitted his bushy eyebrows frowned and shook his great forefinger in his visitor's face your lordship is married he repeated of that have no doubt no doubt whatever is possible tell your lawyer all refer him to me the story said lord chudleigh is this i come here out of curiosity to see you a man of whom i had heard much though little to your credit i am received by you with courtesy and hospitality there is much drinking and i for which i have no defence to offer drink too much i awake in the morning still half unconscious i am taken downstairs by you and married while in that condition to some woman i had never before seen after this i am again put to bed when i awake i am informed by you what has taken place that is a story neatly told said the doctor if i had to tell it however the details would assume another complexion what brought your lordship to spend the night in such a place as the liberties of the fleet a common parson of the fleet nay that is improbable my modesty forbids me to believe so incredible a circumstance but we may suppose an appointment for the morning an appointment made and kept a secret marriage would you dare to tell such a story as that lord chudleigh interrupted the doctor with vehemence would you dare sir to hint that i lord chudleigh had designed a fleet marriage my lord where a member of your family where your father's son is concerned i dare a great deal i assure you and the woman who is she produce me this wretch this creature who became an accomplice in the plot all in good time be assured my lord that we shall produce her in good time at the right time also be resigned to the inevitable nothing can unmarry you now i think said his lordship that thou art the greatest villain in england ta ta ta the doctor lay back in his chair with his arms extended and a genial laugh your lordship is not complimentary still i make allowances i cannot fight you because i am a clergyman you can therefore say what you please and i own that it certainly is a vexatious thing for a gentleman of your rank and position to have a wife and yet to have no wife not to know her name and parentage why she may be in the soap suds over the family linen in the fleet liberties or selling hot furmety on fleet bridge or keeping a farthing sausage stall in the fleet market or making the rooms for the gentlemen in the fleet prison or frying beefsteaks in butcher row or she may be picking pockets in st paul's churchyard or she may be beating hemp in bridewell or she may be under the alderman's rod in newgate nay my lord do not swear in this place which is as one may say a chapel of ease then her parents your lordship's father and mother in law roger my touter say may be her parent or she may come of a dishonest stock in turnmill lane or she may be ignorant of father and mother and may belong to the numerous family of those who sleep in the baskets of covent garden and the ashes of the glass houses i repeat my lord that to swear in such a place and before such a man a reverend divine is impious avoid the habit of swearing altogether but if you must swear let it be outside this house you will not then even tell me where she is this wife of mine i will not my lord you will not even let me know the depth of my degradation my lord i will tell you nothing as for her ladyship i will say not a word but as i have shown you the possibilities on one side so i would show them to you on the other she may be the wretched creature you fear she may also be a gentlewoman by birth young beautiful accomplished fit my lord to bear your name and to be your wife no he cried that is impossible what gentlewoman would consent to such a marriage the doctor laughed there are many things in this world he said that even lord chudleigh cannot understand now my lord if you have nothing more to say you may leave me there are already half a dozen expectant brides upon the threshold one would not sure keep the poor things waiting i am generally at home my lord in the evening and should you feel inclined for another social night with punch and a song over the bowl your lordship will be welcome in spite of hard words lord chudleigh answered not a word but walked away small comfort had he got from the doctor now was he in a sad plight indeed for his heart was altogether filled with the image of kitty pleydell yet how hope to win her and how stand by and let her be won by another man to be married in such a way not to know who or what your wife might be is surely a thing quite beyond any history ever told chapter x how two old friends came to epsom the doctor's letter had informed us of the liberation of mr stallabras and sir miles lackington but we were not prepared for their arrival at epsom they came however travelling together by the coach their object being not so much i believe to visit the watering place of epsom or to enjoy its amusements as to renew certain honourable proposals formerly made in less happy times to kitty pleydell naturally we were at first somewhat perturbed fearing the scandal should certain tongues spread abroad the truth as to our residence in the fleet my dear said mrs esther with a little sigh my mind is made up we will go to tunbridge out of their way this was impossible because they would follow us for my own part i looked upon the fleet rules with less shame than poor mrs esther to her the memory of the long degradation was infinitely painful for everybody certainly a time of degradation however unmerited is never a pleasant thing to remember i think that the whole army of martyrs must agree together in forgetting the last scenes of their earthly pilgrimage the buffetings strippings scourgings roastings burnings and hangings the long time of prison the starvation the expectancy and fear the going forth to meet the hungry lion and the ruthless tiger surely it cannot be comfortable to remember these no martyr on the roll had ever been more innocent or undeserving of punishment than mrs esther pimpernel no sufferer ever complained less but she loved not to think of the past nor to be reminded of it by the arrival of one whom she had known there nevertheless when sir miles lackington presented himself at our lodging he was received with a gracious friendliness his newly recovered liberty made little alteration in the appearance of this prodigal son his dress was worn in the same easy disorder the ruffles being limp his wig tied carelessly the lace upon his hat torn as if in some scuffle and the buckles of his shoes were an odd pair his face preserved the same jolly content as if the gifts of fortune were to be regarded no more than her buffeting we are always said my guardian with a little hesitation we are always glad to welcome old friends even friends in common misfortune but sir miles it is not well to remind us or or to talk to others of those unhappy days he laughed i remember them not he said i never remember any day but the present why should we remember disagreeable things formerly we borrowed now we lend let us go on lending till we have to borrow again do you remember mr stallabras the poet surely we remembered solomon he goes abroad now in a silk lined coat with lace ruffles he has bought a new wig and started a subscription list for a new poem having eaten up the last before the poem was written i subscribed for three copies yesterday and we pretended both of us he that he did not want the money and i that i had always had it without forgetting and pretending where should we be indeed said mrs esther one would not willingly either forget or pretend but some things are best remembered in silence the memory of them should keep us humble sir miles i do not wish to be humble replied the baronet humble people do not sing and drink nor gamble nor make love they go in sadness and with hanging heads i would still go proud while he was with us came solomon himself bravely dressed indeed with about an ell of ribbon tied around his throat a new and fashionable wig and bearing himself with all the dignity possible in a poet of five feet three his chin was in the air and his hat under his arm when he marched into the little room i shook hands with him and whispered to him not to mention the word fleet thereupon he advanced to mrs esther with such a bow as would have graced a court saying madam i have had the honour of being presented to you in london but i know not if i am still distinguished by your recollection sir said mrs esther that person must indeed be blind to merit who can forget mr stallabras the favourite of the muses o madam this compliment o sir our hearts are not so insensible as to forget those delightful verses which should be the glory of an unthinking age i asked him then if he had received a bequest i have found what is better he said a female maecenas the virtues of antiquity linger only in the breasts of the fair she is a person of singularly cold and calm judgment despreaux himself had not a cooler head or a sounder critical faculty therefore when such a lady prophesies immortal renown to a poet that poet may congratulate himself i am poet laureate to lady tamarind relict of sir joseph tamarind brewer and sometime sheriff in the city of london her ladyship's taste is considered infallible in all subjects whether china tulips plays pictures fans snuff boxes black boys or poets his eyes twinkled so brightly his turn up nose seemed so joyfully to sniff the incense of praise prosperity had already made his cheeks so sleek and fat that we could hardly recognise our starveling poet the taste said mrs esther of a woman who recognises the merit of your verses mr stallabras is beyond a doubt he rubbed his hands and laughed i was already out he began but as we all manifested the greatest confusion at the beginning of this confession he stopped and turned red i mean i was i was you were beginning i think i interrupted to open a new subscription thank you miss kitty he replied i was as soon as i left the ru i mean as soon as i could i went round among my patrons with my project this lady immediately bought all my previous poems including the translation of 'lucretius' which the rascal publisher declared had been his ruin when he went bankrupt and presented me with a hundred guineas with which i was enabled here he surveyed his person with satisfaction and raised one leg to get a better view of his stockings and shoe buckles i was enabled to procure garments more suitable to a personage of ambition and to present myself to the honourable company assembled at epsom on a footing of easy equality but a hundred guineas will not last for ever i said thinking of the sums of money which i had already spent on frocks and ribbons since we came from london that is not all he said i have my new volume of poems which has been subscribed by lady tamarind and her friends this is a change is it not miss kitty formerly when i was in the ru i mean before my good fortune came a sixpenny ordinary was beyond me i have lived upon half a crown for a week i have written lines on a 'christian's joys' when starving and i have composed the 'lamentations of a sinner' when contemplating suicide as the only relief from my troubles now now how different fortune's wheel has turned fame is mine and as for poems i can write as many as i please to give the world and always find a subscription list ready to my hand this brain miss kitty like the fountain of helicon will run for ever that is while life and lady tamarind remain the stream may get muddy sometimes said sir miles with a smile fate which condemns poets to poverty also compensates them with hope if they are in present sunshine it will last for ever if in cold neglect the future will give what the past has refused posterity will continue to wave the censing pot and send up wreaths of spicy smoke a continual flow grateful to the blessed spirit above so that fortunate or in neglect they dwell in a perpetual dream which keeps them ever happy then the sanguine bard drew forth his new subscription list i call it he said by the modest title of a 'project for the publication of a new collection of odes and heroic pieces' by solomon stallabras esquire i am aware that my birth gives no warrant for the assumption of the rank of esquire but lady tamarind is good enough to say that the possession of genius lifts a man to the level of the gentry if not the nobility of the country it does solomon it does said sir miles i venture ladies therefore he said taking a pencil from his pocket to solicit your honoured names as subscribers for this poor effort of a perhaps too ambitious brain the poems when completed will be printed in royal quarto with the portrait of the author as he appears crowned by fame while the graces draped for the occasion in the modern taste stand behind him cupid will raise aloft the trumpet of fame the muses will be seen admiring from a gentle eminence which represents parnassus apollo will be figured presenting the poet with his own lyre and the sacred stream will flow at his feet my own design in the distance the skin of marsyas will hang upon a tree as a warning to the presumption of rivals the work will be bound in calf and will be issued at the price of two guineas for that small sum ladies solomon stallabras offers a copy of his poems o mr stallabras cried mrs esther for so charming a picture i would give not two but twenty guineas to say nothing of the poems go on dear sir raise our thoughts to virtue and strengthen our inclinations in the path of duty poets indeed make the way to heaven a path of roses now here was a change from old times solomon flourishing a subscription list in lace and silk and mrs esther offering guineas by the dozen sir miles who was leaning by the window just as he had been wont to do in our poor lodging nodded and laughed unseen by mrs esther permit me sir she said if you will be so good to put my name down for o madam the poet bowed low and brandished his pencil for ten copies of this immortal work in one of which i would ask you to write your name in your own hand for the enrichment of the volume and the admiration of posterity madam said solomon with emotion i will write my name in the whole ten and dear sir one copy for miss kitty such generosity such princessly noble patronage of the poetical art he fairly chuckled as he wrote down the names eleven copies twenty two guineas this is indeed to realise fame he received the money which mrs esther paid him with a countenance all smiles although he vainly tried to throw into his expression the pride of the poet to whom money is but filthy lucre we then conversed on epsom and its beauties and as the gentlemen had as yet seen none of them i proposed to lead them to the downs whence i promised them such a landscape as should infinitely rejoice their eyes they accepted with expressions of gratitude and we started when however we came to the doors of the spread eagle sir miles recollected that at twelve he always took a tankard of cool october for the good of his health he therefore left us promising to follow but as he did not come and we saw him no more that day i suppose he found the society of the tankard more enchanting than that of kitty pleydell we therefore walked up the hill alone and presently stood upon the open down which commands so noble a view the place was quite deserted that day save for a single group of gentlemen who were conducting a match but so far off that we heard not their voices i took advantage of this solitude to convey to the poet an instruction that it would be better not to talk freely at epsom concerning such vicissitudes of fortune as we had experienced i pointed out to him that until mrs esther's position was securely fixed it might do her injury to have her story garbled by censorious tongues that for his own sake his late connection with the liberties of the fleet would be better concealed and that for myself although it mattered less because i was never a prisoner while yet an inmate of the rules i did not wish my story such as it was to be passed about the wells and mangled in the telling mr stallabras declared stoutly that he would not for worlds reveal one word about the past for my sake nay i said not for mine but for the sake of that dear lady to whom you owe so much it is true he said i owe her even life she hath fed me from her slender stores when i was starving and when no one would even read my verses she would learn them by heart and repeat them with tears for her sake then if not for yours then his face assumed an expression like unto that with which he had once before made me an offer of his hand and i knew that he was going to do it again if such a thing is going to be done the sooner it is over the better therefore i waited with calmness hoping that the paroxysm would be short and not violent miss kitty he began turning very red some time ago i was penniless almost starving and detained in the absurdly called liberties of the fleet for the amount of forty pounds sixteen shillings and eightpence a sum so small that it made me blush to confess it most of my friends in the same place being incarcerated for substantial sums of hundreds and even thousands in this difficult position which required the philosophy of a stoic to endure with resignation i had the temerity to offer my hand to the most beautiful woman in the world i have often since wondered at my own audacity and her gentleness while she refused so presumptuous a proposal indeed mr stallabras i said you conferred great honour upon me he bowed the position of affairs he went on is now changed the poet's brows are crowned with bays by the hand of a lady as skilled in poets as she is in pug dogs his pockets are lined with guineas as for the fleet rules i whistle the memory of the place to the winds phew it is gone never to return i see before me a long and great future when booksellers will compete for the honour of publishing me and the greatest lords and ladies in the land will rush to subscribe for copies like shakespeare i shall amass a fortune like prior i shall receive offers of embassies like addison and chaucer i shall be placed in posts of honour and profit i hope mr stallabras i said that such will indeed be your future do you really hope so miss kitty his face flushed again and i was quite sorry for him knowing the pain i was about to inflict upon him do you hope so then that emboldens me to say fairest of your sex divine nymph accept the homage of a poet be celebrated for ever in his immortal verse be my laura let me be thy petrarch i will i replied i accept that offer joyfully i will be to you what laura was to petrarch if that will content you i gave him my hand which he seized with rapture oh beautiful kitty he cried with such joy in his eyes that i repented having said so much fortune has now bestowed upon me all i ask when goddess wilt thou crown my happiness it is already crowned i replied i have given you mr stallabras all you asked for let me remind you that you yourself told me the story of petrarch's love i will be your laura but i must have the liberty of doing what laura did namely the right to marry some one else his face fell oh he murmured why did i not say heloise because she was shut up in a convent come mr stallabras let us remain friends which is far better for both of us and less trying to the temper than being lovers and i will help you with your subscription book as for being married you would tire of me in a week upon this he fell to protesting that it was impossible for any man to tire of such a paragon among women and i dare say the poor deluded creature really meant what he said because men in love are blind when this failed to move me he lamented his ill fortune in having placed his hopes upon the heart of a beautiful statue as cold as dian nor was it until he had prophesied death to himself and prayed for ruin and loss of his fame both of which he said were now useless or comparatively useless to him that i succeeded in making him to a certain extent reasonable and calming his anger he really had thought that so grand an offer of marriage with a poet whom he placed on about the same level with homer would tempt any woman according to some detractors of the fair sex every woman believes that every man must fall in love with her but i am sure that there is no man who does not believe that he is irresistible when once he begins to show a preference or an inclination i then persuaded him with honeyed words to believe in my sorrow that i was not able to accept his proposals and i added that as he had by this time sufficiently admired the beauties of the landscape we might return to the town when i should have the honour of presenting him to some of the better sort among the visitors he came down the hill with me sighing after the manner of poets in love and panting a little because he was fat and short of breath and i walked fast we found the terrace crowded with people congregated for the morning talk the breakfasts being all eaten the tea drinking over morning prayers finished and the music playing merrily i presented the poet to lady levett as an ingenious gentleman whose verses known all over town were doubtless already well known to her ladyship she had not the hardness of heart to deny knowledge of the poet and gave him a kindly welcome to epsom where she said she had no doubt whatever but that he would meet with the reception due to qualities of such distinction then i ventured to suggest that mr stallabras was receiving names for a subscription edition of his new poems lady levett added hers and begged the poet to visit her at her lodging where she would discharge her debt in the course of an hour i presented stallabras to young lord eardesley harry temple and half the gentlemen at the wells asking of each a subscription to the poems so that the fortunate poet found himself some fifty guineas the richer by his morning's work miss kitty he said humbly i knew not indeed that you were so great a lady the 'queen of the wells' i am told not but all who know your worth and kindness must rejoice at this signal triumph i now plainly see why i must be content with the lot of petrarch once launched in society the poet became quickly a kind of celebrity just as in some years a watering place would boast of having among its visitors such famous men as dr johnson mr garrick or mr richardson so now it pointed to mr stallabras and said to strangers see the great mr stallabras the illustrious poet he like all men born in london was equal to the opportunity and rose on the wave of fashion his subscription list kept mounting up he sent his poems to the press he received proofs and read them beneath the portico which he compared to the columns where the roman poets had been accustomed to read their compositions we gathered round and listened we cried with our handkerchiefs to our eyes o mr stallabras how fine how wondrous pathetic how just then would he bow and twist and wave his hand and wag his head he became an oracle and like all oracles in the matter of taste he quickly learned to give the law he affected to understand pictures and talked about the brio of one painter and the three lights rule of another he was very sarcastic in the matter of poetry and would allow but two good poets in the century himself and mr alexander pope in the region of romance he would allow little credit to fielding but claimed immortality for richardson oh sir pardon me he said to one who attributed the greater merit to the former writer pardon me the characters and the situations of fielding are so wretchedly low and dirty that i cannot imagine any one being interested in them there is i admit some strength of humour in him but he hath over written himself i doubt he is a strong hulking sort of man but sir said lady levett we ladies like men to be strong and hearty as becomes a man you surely do not mean that every big man must have low tastes the mind and the body are united said the little poet they influence one another thus in a weak frame we find delicacy and in a strong frame bluntness softness and tenderness of mind are often remarkable in a body possessed of the same qualities tom jones could get drunk on the night of his uncle's recovery no doubt mr fielding would manifest his joy in the same manner he went on to assure us that lady bellaston was an intimate friend of mr fielding's that booth was himself tom jones again himself amelia his first wife his brawls gaols sponging houses and quarrels all drawn from his own personal experience he who associates with low companions ladies concluded the ex prisoner of the fleet must needs himself be low taste consorts only with tasteful persons should not a lady be beautiful mr stallabras asked a bystander i always supposed so but since a man is not to be strong perhaps i was wrong sir mr stallabras drew himself up to his fall height and his fingers closed upon the roll of proof sheets as if it had been a sword hilt sir all ladies who have taste are beautiful i am ready to be the champion of the sex some are more beautiful than others here he raised his eyes to me and sighed some flowers are more beautiful than others the man of taste loves to let his eyes rest on such a pleasing object here two young gentlemen winked at each other she is a credit to her sex when goodness is joined to such beauty as is the case with here he looked at me and hesitated oh cried nancy say with me mr stallabras or miss peggy baker may i say miss pleydell he asked with a comprehensive smile there indeed is all clarissa and the heart of sensibility in contemplating her perfections reverts to the scenes of our divine richardson chapter xi how sir miles renewed his offer thus did i get rid of one suitor knowing that there were still two more in the field and anxious about my lord's absence which i doubted not was concerned in some way with me heavens if he should find out the secret if the doctor should communicate to him the thing which i desired to tell at my own time and place the evil one at this juncture suggested a temptation of his own suppose a message which my lord could trust were to reach him stating that there would be no attempt to follow up the so called marriage in the rules that he could go his own way unmolested that the very certificate and the leaf of the register containing the proof of the marriage would be restored to him how would that be yet what sort of happiness could a wife expect who every day had to fear the chance of detection and exposure some time or other he would learn that i was the niece of the man who had dealt him this blow some day he would learn the whole story why there was not only the doctor but his man roger the villain with the pale face the scarred cheeks and the red nose if the doctor were dead what would prevent such a man from telling the story abroad and proclaiming it to all comers for poor kitty there was only one course open she must work her way to happiness through shame and confession yet with all the shame and confession there was no certainty that the happiness would follow a man vehemently loves and desires a woman but a woman vehemently desires the love and desire of a man i desired with all my strength and with all my might the affections of my lord his image his idea were with me always for me there was no other man in the world but first i had to deal with my present suitors solomon dismissed and made happy with praises and guineas a poet is a creature whose vanity seems always to outweigh all other qualities i had next to reckon with sir miles who was more reasonable and yet more persistent i knew that he had come to epsom on purpose to seek me out that was borne in upon me with a force not to be resisted he always did me the honour of showing me a preference when we lived under the same roof and when he would lie in wait for me at the foot of the sanded stairs and of course i liked him he was good natured he had the air noble he would not certainly beat his wife or treat her unkindly although he would probably spend all the money in drink and play and whether he was rich or poor in the rules or in the prison or wandering free he would still be the same easy careless creature happy in the sunshine happier by candlelight over a bowl of punch on the terrace where we met him in the afternoon he was the same save that his clothes were newer as when just as he lounged now beneath the trees he had then lounged among the bulkheads and stalls of the market till evening came with the joys of the day always with the carriage of a gentleman most of the beaux of epsom were such gentlemen as claim the title of esquire by right of their profession as attorneys barristers officers nabobs rich merchants and the like as for their manners they were easy so long as they were natural and then they were somewhat barbarous when they endeavoured to assume the manners of such as lord chudleigh they were awkward as for the young fellows from the country estates they were always clowns they came clowns to the wells they put on fine clothes laughed and grimaced lost their money at horse racing and lansquenet and went home clowns but sir miles was always even when drunk a gentleman i suppose he had the impudence at first to suppose that i was going to seek him out and distinguish him before all the company with my particular regard when he discovered that it was difficult to get speech with the queen of the wells unless you joined her court he came along with the rest and was speedily as ready with his compliment his innuendo his jest and his anecdote he was more ready than most because he had seen the great world in his youth and had caught their manner the general run of gallants were it seemed to me afraid of him to be sure he was a big strong man could have crunched two or three of the slender beaux between his arms yet he was the most kind hearted fellow in the world three days after his arrival lord chudleigh having then been away for a week and i beginning to wonder what business kept him so long from the apron strings of kitty he invited me to go with him to the downs to see a match i would go with him though well i knew what he meant and of course when we got to the downs the match was over and the people going home egad miss kitty he said there is always such a plaguy crowd after your ladyship's heels that a man gets never a chance of a word with you save edgeways with the pretty little beaux well i have told solomon to go to the house and take care of mrs esther there they are cheek by jowl and her handkerchief up to her eyes over his sentimental poetry you and i can have a talk to ourselves it is only a quarter of a mile from here to your lodging but if you like to come with me by way of the old well and banstead we can make it half a mile thank you sir miles i said i am not anxious to double that quarter of a mile consider if you please that i have to get home dine and dress for the day very good have it your own way that to be sure you always will have i think for my part that you never looked so nice as when you wore your hair in curls and a holland frock miss kitty do you remember a certain day when a baronet out at elbows offered you his hand with nothing in it i remember it perfectly i laughed at the recollection and oh sir miles to think of how you looked when you made that condescending proposal it was after a most disgraceful evening you best know where you had been brought home singing your neck ribbon was untied your wig awry your hand shaky your cheeks red and in your left hand a brown mug full of old october what a suitor yes he replied laughing without the least appearance of being offended by my picture when in the rules i behaved according to the custom of the place i am no longer in the rules but at the wells i remember that tankard considering that the day is sultry i wish i had one in my hand this very moment i am sure sir miles that your conduct under these happier circumstances will reflect greater credit upon you happier circumstances he said well i suppose so in the fleet i could borrow of my cousins a guinea a week or thereabout yet borrowing is uncertain and undignified the manner of living was cheap but it was rude drink there was more than one had a right to expect drink was plentiful but only the doctor got good punch no morals were expected of a fleet rules christian i know not that things are happier now than then however you might think so girls never have any philosophy i have come into a small estate of six hundred pounds a year it is not so much by five times six hundred as what i started with still with six hundred a year one can live do you not think so it seems to me a very handsome provision i replied thinking that mrs esther had about the same yes it will do he fanned his face with his hat and begged me to sit down on the grass and listen to him for a moment men even the most careless like sir miles have a way of becoming suddenly solemn when they ask a woman to become their wife i know not whether their gravity springs from a sense of their own great worth or from a feeling of unworthiness whether it is a compliment to the woman they woo or to themselves or it may be a confession of the holiness of the state of matrimony which one would fain hope to be the case sir miles then blushing and confused offered me for the second time his hand you see he said the right hand doth no longer shake nor doth the left hand hold a pot of october i no longer am carried home at night he sighed as if the reminiscence of past times was pleasing but saddening i am not any more the man that once i was will you sweet kitty will you be lady lackington i cannot i said there is an income of six hundred pounds a year he went on i believe there is a small house somewhere we could live in it rent free you were always fond of hens and pigs and milk flowers apples and all these things i will keep two hundred pounds for myself and give you four with two hundred i shall have to manage once a week or so a little hazard or a trifling lansquenet what i asked marry a gamester what matter as to that when he will settle his money on his wife think of it kitty i am a baronet though a poor one and of as good a family as any in norfolk why the lackingtons as everybody knows were on their lands before the conqueror and if it is not enough to be a gamester you are also o sir miles the shame of it we gentlemen of norfolk he replied without any appearance of shame are honest topers all i deny it not yet what matters such a trifle in the habits of a man did any gentlemen in the county drink harder than my father yet he was hale and tough at sixty and would have lived to eighty but for a fall he got riding home one night after dinner having a cask or thereabouts of port inside him by reason of which he mistook an open quarry for the lane which should have led him home and therefore broke his neck so that if his wife loved him as no doubt she did it was the drink that robbed her of a husband your tale hath a useful moral sir miles come pretty puritan look at me i am twenty nine in my thirtieth year strong and hearty if i do get drunk of an evening what then do you want to talk to your husband all night better know that he is safe asleep and likely to remain asleep till the drink is gone out of his head oh the delights of wedlock to have your husband brought home every night by four stout fellows evening drink hurts no man have i a bottle nose do my hands shake are my cheeks fat and pale look at me kitty he held out his arms and laughed yes sir miles i replied i think you are a very lusty fellow and in a wrestling bout i should think few could stand against you but as a husband for the reasons i have stated i say no take the four hundred kitty and make me happy i love thee my girl with all my heart sir miles i cannot do it honestly perhaps i wish i could you won't he looked me full in the face i see you won't you have such a telltale straightforward face kitty that it proclaims the truth always i believe you are truth itself they pulled you out of a well down in your country place in a bucket and then went about saying you had been born thank you sir miles am i therefore to go hang myself in my garters or yours if you will give them to me if you do i shall be the first to run and cut you down sweet it were he murmured to be even cut down by your fair hand if one was sure that you would come in time you will be reasonable dear sir and you will neither say nor do anything silly i do not suppose i shall pine away in despair nor shall i hang my head nor shall i go about saying that there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it because when we fished you we fished the best and i swear kitty here he did swear after men's profane way but he needed not to have sworn so loudly or so long that truly sweet kitty thou art the fairest the loveliest and the best fish that ever came out of any sea a bewitching mermaid i wish thee a good husband on stella's lap he laid his head and looking in her eyes he cried 'remember when i'm dead that i deserved the prize' thank you sir miles a shorter and a less profane oath would surely have better graced the subject it cannot be graced too much he said as if to swear lustily was to confer honour upon the woman he thought to love for your sake kitty i would ever forswear punch tobacco and strong waters drink nothing but october and never get drunk save on saturday nights for your sake would i go live in the country among the cocks and the hens the ducks and the pigs for you would i go religiously to church every sunday at forenoon and expect the parson for the beef and pudding after the sermon for your sake would i gamble no more save once in a way when quarter day brought in the rents that would be a mighty reformation indeed sir miles now however since you will not have me i shall play with four hundred a year out of the six but i will be careful all the same i shall punt low and never lose more than a guinea a night thus i was rid of my second suitor sir miles ceased to attend the count of followers who attended on the terrace but sat all day in the card room playing from time to time he met and saluted me be not afraid he would say on my behalf the card tables are more pleasant than the air under the trees and i think the players are better company than your priggish popinjays as for my habits fair kitty pattern of virtue they have become virtuous i am never drunk well not often and you have brought me luck i have won five hundred guineas from a nabob think of the joy when he pays me of losing it all again chapter xii how harry temple proved his valour thus were poet and baronet reduced to submission the third suitor was harder to manage because he turned sulky sportsmen have said that a fish or a bird or a fox when he sulks is then most difficult to secure thus to be captured or cajoled the victim must be in a good temper now harry temple went in gloomy indignation as was visible to all eyes he walked alone upon the terrace or sat alone in the assembly room a killjoy to behold that would not have mattered because no girl feels much sorrow for a man who foolishly sulks because he cannot marry her but everybody knew or thought they knew the cause of his heavy looks peggy baker said i had thrown him over for the sake of a lord who she added kindly would certainly throw me over in turn some of the company cried shame on the flinty hearted woman who could let so pretty a fellow go love sick kitty his melancholy seemed to say you left us a simple country girl you would have been proud of my addresses had you understood my meaning this was quite true you are now a woman of fashion and you have ambition your head is turned with flattery you aspire to nothing short of a coronet in those days you were satisfied with the approval of your looking glass and your conscience now you would draw all men to your heels and are not happy unless you make them all miserable but that was not true at all i did not wish to make men miserable and it was nothing to me whether they were miserable or happy i thought of one man only as is natural to a woman in love if i said to him one day being tired by such exhibition of temper if you do not like the place why make yourself unhappy by staying here cambridge methinks would be a more fitting abode for you where there are books and scholars not a watering place where people come together to amuse themselves and be merry i shall stay here he replied until i find there is no hope for me oh silly harry i said is there no other woman in the world who will make you happy except poor kitty pleydell no none he shook his melancholy wig the tie at the back of his head wagging sorrowfully how was it possible to have any sympathy with so rueful a lover why it made one ridiculous everybody said that harry temple was in love with me that i for the worst of motives viz to catch a coronet refused him and that he was an excellent match especially for one who was nothing better than a country parson's daughter i believe only a curate my dear peggy baker would say no doubt she lived on bacon fat and oatmeal and knitted her own stockings and yet she refuses harry temple a pretty fellow though studious and a man whom any of us gentlewomen born would be glad to encourage oh i said to him why do you not go why do you look reproaches on me because he replied i still love you unworthy as you are unworthy mr temple methinks that a little civility yes unworthy i say that a girl who throws over her oldest friends with the almost avowed intention of securing a title without knowing anything of the character of the man who bears it this is too much i said first sir let me know what there is against lord chudleigh's character tell me upon your word sir do you know anything at all is he not a man of principle and honour i know nothing against him i dare say that he is what you think well sir and in the next place how dare you accuse me of deliberately trying to attract my lord do you know me so well as to read my soul do you know me so well as to be justified to yourself when you attribute such a motive to me what other motive can i attribute to you he asked bitterly is he not a peer is he not rich o harry i cried you will drive me mad between you cannot a peer be a good man cannot a girl i say may not a girl harry you force me to say it is it not possible for a girl to fall in love with a man who is even a peer and a rich man go sir you have humbled me and made me say words of which i am ashamed go if you please and tell all the world what i have said then he fell to asking my forgiveness he was he said wretched indeed he had long lost my love man i said you never had it and now he was like to lose my friendship this talk about friendship between a man and woman when both are young seems to me a mighty foolish thing for if the woman is in love with some one else her friendship is to be sure worth just nothing at all because she must needs be for ever thinking of the man she loves there is but one man in all the world for her and that man not he who would fain be her friend therefore she gives not a thought to him now if a man be in love with one woman and in friendship with another i think that either his love for one must be a poor lukewarm passion which i for one would not be anxious to receive or his friendship for the other must be a chilly sort of thing however one must not be angry for ever harry temple had made me say a thing which i could not have said to any woman not even nancy and was ashamed of having said yet when he begged forgiveness i accorded it to him harry i was sure would not repeat what i had said somebody about this time wrote another of those little worthless epigrams or poems and handed it about kitty a fair dissenter grown sad pattern doth afford the temple's laws she will not own yet still doth love her lord do not be angry kitty said nancy this is the penalty of greatness what would peggy baker give to be lampooned harry is a fool my dear any woman could tell with half an eye that you are not the least in love with him what are the eyes of men like are they so blinded by vanity as not to be able to see without being told when they are disagreeable objects for a woman's contemplation i condole with you miss pleydell said peggy baker to be the victim of an irreligious and even impious epigram must be truly distressing to one like yourself brought up in the bosom of the church thank you dear miss peggy i replied returning her smiling courtesy the epigram's wound is easily healed is it true that you are yourself the author o lord no she replied i am but a poor poet and could not for the world write or say anything to wound another woman's feelings she would not indeed dear kitty cried nancy who was with me it is not true though you may hear it so stated that miss peggy said yesterday on the parade that your father was only a curate and that you made your own stockings she is the kindest and most generous of women we think so truly dear miss peggy we would willingly if we could send you half a dozen or so of our swains to swell your train but they will not leave us was there ever so saucy a girl miss peggy bit her lips and i think she would have liked to box nancy's ears there and then had she dared but a few gentlemen were standing round us laughing at nancy's sally so she refrained o miss nancy she replied trying to laugh you are indeed kind but i love not the attentions of men at second hand you are welcome to all my cast off lovers pray miss pleydell may i ask when we may expect his lordship back again i do not know i replied lord chudleigh does not send me letters as to his movements or intentions i said so she replied triumphant for the moment i said so this morning at the book shop when they were asking each other what news of lord chudleigh some said miss pleydell would surely know i said that i did not think there was anything between his lordship and miss pleydell and i ventured to predict that you knew no more about his movements than myself indeed said nancy coming to my assistance i should have thought you were likely to know more than kitty indeed why because said nancy laughing his lordship who is i believe one of your cast off lovers might perhaps have written to you for old acquaintance' sake miss peggy had no reason for loving me who had dethroned her but she had reason for hating nancy who always delighted in bringing her to open shame what have i done to you miss levett she asked her once when they were alone you are not the reigning toast i am not jealous of you you have done no harm to me nor i to you yet you delight in saying the most ill natured things you have done nothing to me miss peggy nancy told her but you have done a great deal to my poor kitty who is innocence itself you have slandered her you have traduced her family which everybody knows is as good as your own though her father was a country clergyman and a younger son you have denied her beauty you have written anonymous letters to her calumniating a young nobleman who i verily believe is a paragon of peers no doubt too you have written letters to him calumniating her character truly with the best intentions you could not do much to hurt her for my kitty is above suspicion very well miss said miss peggy very well we understand each other as for your charges about anonymous letters we keep them all said nancy and with them a letter written and signed by yourself and i think i shall show the letters about on the terrace if you dare but here she checked herself though in a great rage you will do as you please miss levett i shall know some day how to revenge myself for your insults as for your curate's girl i warrant her innocence and her being 'above suspicion' indeed to be pretty hypocrisy and pretence as if any woman was above suspicion oh said nancy as a parting shot nobody i assure you ever thought miss peggy baker or any of her friends above suspicion let us do you dear miss so much justice you shall not find us ungrateful or unmindful of the benefits you have conferred or are about to confer upon us malice and spite when they are impotent are amusing like the tricks of a monkey in a cage or a bear dancing at a stake such angry passions as these disturbed the peaceful atmosphere of the wells what use was it for mr nash of bath to deprive the gentlemen of their swords when he left the ladies their tongues the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison the accident which followed a day or two after this may or may not have been instigated by an enemy nancy always declared it was but then she may have been prejudiced and we never got at the truth every friday or saturday there came down from london a coach full of gentlemen from the city or the inns of court to spend two or three days at the wells these were our most noisy visitors they pushed into the coteries and endeavoured to form parts of the trains of the beauties in vogue they drank too much wine gambled fiercely for small sums and turned the quiet decorum of the assembly into a babel of riot noise loud laughter coarse jokes and ill breeding the sunday was thus spoiled those of us who loved quiet stayed for the most part at home when we were not in church or wandered on the quiet downs where we were undisturbed solomon stallabras attended us on these occasions and we turned our conversation on grave matters i exhorted him for instance to direct his splendid genius to the creation of a sacred epic which should be to the eighteenth century what milton's paradise lost was to the seventeenth he promised to think of it and we talked over various plans the deluge st paul the apocalypse were discussed in turn for my own part i thought that the book of revelation would prove a subject too sublime for our poet's strength and recommended as a fitter subject for his easy and graceful verses the life and travels of st paul in these considerations we forgot for awhile the calumnies of our enemy and each put aside for a time his own private anxieties one saturday evening while lord chudleigh was still away a noisier party than usual were in the assembly rooms and although there was no dancing the talk and quarrelling of the gamblers were incessant while lights were hung out among the trees and the walk was crowded with people neither nancy nor i was present having little desire to be stared at by ill bred young citizens or pushing templars unfortunately harry temple was among them while he was idling among the trees there passed him a group of three young fellows all talking together noisily i suppose they had been drinking one of them unfortunately caught sight of harry and began to laugh then they stopped and then one stepped forward and made harry a profound bow we welcome he said the knight of the rueful countenance we condole with your misfortune 'her temple's rule she doth not own though still she loves her lord' harry was not only melancholy but also as some such men are he was choleric and he was strong being bred and brought up to country pursuits in a moment his cane was in one hand and his assailant's cravat was in his other then he began to beat the man with his cane the others stood stupid with amazement sir miles who was on his way to the tables and had seen the beginning of the fray stepped to the front who interferes with mr temple has to do with me he shouted fair play gentlemen let them fight it out with fists like men first and stick each other afterwards with rapiers like frenchmen if they like gentlemen i am sir miles lackington baronet at your service if any one wants a little breathing he held his cane in readiness but the other gentlemen kept aloof when harry had spent his rage because so far as i can learn there was no resistance he shook off his opponent adjusted his wig which was a little deranged and turned quietly to sir miles you will oblige me sir miles thank you gentlemen all your servant he resumed his walk lounging among the trees the women looking after him with a mixture of fright and admiration as calm as if nothing had happened the man who was beaten was followed off the field by his friends nor could sir miles get speech of them that evening in the morning when he went to make his murderous appointment he found they were gone fighting it would seem was not to their liking though an insult to a harmless gentleman was quite in their way i am sorry harry i said honestly because a woman cannot help respecting a man who is brave and strong that the taking of my name has caused you this trouble i am sorry too he said sadly yet i blame them not kitty but you do blame me i replied harry if in a little while somehow i am able to show that i could not even if i wished grant the thing you want if i say i can make that quite clear and plain to you will you promise to be reconciled to what cannot cannot be avoided if kitty what an if but you ask the impossible there is no reason there cannot be why such a thing is impossible but again if harry promise me so much he laughed grimly well i promise give me your hand upon it i said now we shall be friends indeed why you silly harry you let the days go by and you neglect the most beautiful girls who could perhaps make you a hundred times as happy as kitty all because you deck her out with imaginary virtues which she doth not possess foolish harry open your eyes and look about you what do you see i for my part saw pretty nancy running along the walk to meet us love was in her eyes grace in her action youth beauty sweetness in her comely shape her rosy cheeks her pretty smile her winning tongue her curly locks she was in morning dress without hoop or patch through the leaves of the trees the sun shone softly upon her covering her with a soft light which might have been that in which venus stole along the shore in a golden mist to meet her son of which my father had read to me she was pretty she was sweet far prettier than i who was so tall far sweeter than i who was full of evil passions and shame being a great sinner foolish harry i said what do you see he only looked me in the face and replied i see nothing but the beautiful kitty oh blind blind chapter xiii how durdans was illuminated while these things were proceeding lord chudleigh being still absent from durdans i received a second letter from the doctor after the usual compliments to mrs esther he proceeded to the important part of his communication for your private eye only i have to tell you that yesterday i saw and conversed with lord chudleigh he sought me in order to find out if possible the name character and condition of a certain person i refused to grant him that information i also assured him that he would find it impossible to break the alliance with which i had provided him this i did with the greater pleasure having heard from a sure source that he hath lately paid addresses to you of so particular a kind as to make the whole company at epsom wells believe that they mean honourable proposals i presume therefore that could he destroy the evidence of his former marriage he would be prepared to offer his hand this is every way better than i could expect or wish because when the moment arrives for informing him of the truth i can point out to his lordship that his opinion and mine of what a wife should be exactly agree our triumph will then be complete our triumph this was what he called it i was to be the consenting party to inflict shame and humiliation upon my lord this was too much humiliation for him why it was for myself and my whole thoughts were how to save him how to set him free the doctor expected me to triumph over him why what did he know of a woman in love to triumph over a man for whose dear sake she would lay down her life to save him from humiliation it was certain to my heart that my lord already felt for me that warmth of affection which impels a man to make a woman his wife i was sure of this i was so sure that i already gave myself in imagination entirely to him and placed his interests above my own in short before i ventured to confess the fact to myself and before he spoke to me for as yet he had said no word except in compliment and common gallantry i loved him there was for me but one thing wanting to make me happy there was for me nothing to think of to hope for to pray for but the welfare of that one man and to such a woman did the doctor send such a letter proposing that i should join him in covering him with shame and indignation would i thus let him choose the moment to confess my shameful sin would i assist in covering the man i loved with confusion who would have clothed him in purple and placed a chain about his neck and helped him to ride forth in bravery and triumph forbid the thought kind heaven oh that a man should have such a mind so thick and cloudy as not to perceive that no woman but the basest and worst could join a conspiracy so hateful unhappy girl to be made the victim of a plot in which the punishment would fall upon herself while the wickedness would rest with the man who devised it and he against whom the plot was designed would be its sole avenger i resolved to be beforehand with the doctor i would myself choose the time i would tell him all i would assure him that innocent as i had been in intention i would never never seek to assert any rights over him that he was free and could go seek a wife where he pleased ah should he please to go elsewhere it were better had i never been born then whatever moment i might choose for the confession i could think of none which could be chosen as favourable to myself i might write to him that would be best i would write for how could a girl bear to see that face which had always looked upon her with kindness and affection suddenly grow hard and stern and reproach her for her great wickedness with looks of horror and indignation it seemed better to write but for reasons which will presently appear that letter was never written my lord returned he called upon us next forenoon and informed us looking grave and downcast that he proposed to hold his garden party in durdans park on the next day people had come from vauxhall to decorate the trees and there would be fireworks with supper and concert of horns i asked him deceitfully if his business in london had prospered he replied that it had not turned out so favourably as he hoped and then he checked himself and added that to be sure his affairs were of no interest to us said mrs esther your lordship will not i hope believe that anything which contributes to your happiness is so indifferent to us he bowed and we began to talk again about his fete his invitations included all the visitors of respectability at epsom nancy out of pure kindness had gone about inquiring of every one if he was invited and if not she got him an invitation at once we did not indeed include the tallow chandlers and hosiers of london who frequented epsom that year in great numbers but took up their own end of the assembly rooms and mostly walked on the new parade but we included all who could claim to belong to the polite world because nothing is more humiliating than to be omitted from such a festivity at a watering place i have known a lady of fashion retire from bath in mortification being forgotten at a public tea and never again show her face at that modish but giddy town the company were to assemble at five o'clock the place of meeting being fixed in that part of durdans park most remote from the mansion where the great trees of birch and elm make such an agreeable wilderness that one might fancy one's self in some vast forest we were escorted by sir miles lackington who came because all his brother gamblers had deserted the card room for the day and mr stallabras solomon was dressed in another new coat of purple and wore a sword with a surprisingly fine hilt he also had a pair of shoe buckles in gold given him by his female maecenas the widow of the brewer in return for a copy of verses he was greatly elated never before having received an invitation from a person of such exalted rank now indeed he said i feel the full sweetness of fame this it is miss kitty to be a poet his society is eagerly sought by the great he stands serene upon the giddy height of fashion ennobled by the muses who possess like our own august sovereign the right of conferring rank he takes his place as an equal among those who are ennobled by birth no longer do i deplore that obscurity of origin which once seemed to shut me out of the circles of the polite fetter lane may not be concealed in my biography it should rather be held up to fame as the place in which the sunshine of apollo's favour apollo miss kitty was the sun god as well as the god of poets which makes the image appropriate the sunshine of apollo has once rested during the birth of an humble child it was at number forty one in the second pair back a commodious garret that the child destined to immortality first saw the light no bees so far as i can learn played about his cradle nor did any miracles of precocious genius foreshadow his future greatness but with maternal prescience his mother named him solomon all this because nancy made lord chudleigh send him an invitation yet i doubt whether his lordship had ever read one of his poems it is a great blessing for a man to be a poet said sir miles smiling if i were a poet i dare say i should believe that my acres were my own again if i were a poet i should believe that luck would last does the name of kitty cease to charm i asked yes it was true sir miles had lost his five hundred guineas won of the nabob and was now reduced to punt at a guinea a night this hardship made him melancholy yet he said plucking up if i cannot play i can drink why my jolly poet slapping solomon on the shoulder we will presently toast miss kitty as long as his lordship's champagne lasts mrs esther said that she saw no reason why because one vice was no longer possible another should take its place madam said the baronet it is not that i love one more than the other when the purse is full hazard is my only queen when the purse is empty i call for the bowl in such converse we entered the park and followed in the procession of visitors who flocked to the place of meeting where under the trees like another robin hood lord chudleigh stood to receive his guests kind fortune has taken me to many feasts and rejoicings since that day but there are none to which my memory more fondly and tenderly reverts for here amid the sweet scent of woodland flowers under the umbrageous trees while the air of the downs fragrant and fresh fanned our cheeks my lord became my lover and i knew that he was mine for ever in that sweet bond of union which shall only be exchanged by death for another of more perfect love through god's sweet grace ah day of days whose every moment lives eternally in our hearts sometimes i think that there will hereafter be no past at all but that the sinner shall be punished by the ever present shame of his sins and the saints rewarded by the continual presence of great and noble thoughts horns were stationed at various parts of the park and while we drank tea served to us at rustic tables beneath the trees these answered one another in lively or plaintive strains the tea finished we danced to the music of violins on a natural lawn as level as a bowling green which seemed made for the feet of fairies after an hour of minuets the country dances began and were carried on until sunset then for a while we roamed beneath the trees and watched the twilight grow darker and presently rose the great yellow harvest moon in such a scene said solomon who was discoursing to a bevy of ladies man shrinks from speaking he is mute his tongue cleaves to his palate at all events the poet was not mute here nature proclaims the handiwork of the creator he tapped his forehead reflectively great nature speaks confused the sceptic flies rocks woods and stars sing truth to all the skies all the while the concert of the horns charmed the ear while the romantic aspect of the woods by night elevated the soul when we returned to our lawn we were delighted and surprised to find coloured lamps hanging from the trees already lit imparting a look most magical and wonderful so that we cried aloud for joy nor was this all the tables were laid for supper with every delicacy that our noble host could think of or provide everybody was happy that evening i think that even peggy baker forgot her jealousies and forgave me for the moment when lord chudleigh gave as a toast the queen of the wells and all the gentlemen drained a bumper in honour of kitty pleydell while the supper went on a choir of voices sang glees and madrigals never was party more enchanting never was an evening more balmy never were guests more pleased or host more careful for them after supper more lamps were lit and hung upon the trees the violins began again and country dances set in now while i looked on being more delighted to see than to dance besides my heart was strangely moved with what i now know was a presentiment of happiness lord chudleigh joined me and we began to talk not indifferently but from the first gravely and seriously you will not dance miss kitty he asked no my lord i replied i would rather watch the scene which is more beautiful than anything i have ever dreamed of come with me he said offering me his hand to a place more retired whence we can see the gaiety without hearing too much the laughter they should have been happy without laughing the cries of merriment consorted not with the scene around us outside the circle of the lamps the woods were quite dark but for the light of the solemn moon we wandered away from the noise of the dancers and presently came to a rustic bench beneath a tree where my lord invited me to rest it was not so dark but that i could see his face which was grave and unlike the face of an eager lover there was sadness in it and shame as belongs to one who has a thing to confess alas what ought to have been the shame and sadness of my face while they are dancing and laughing he said let us talk seriously you and i miss kitty pray go on my lord i said trembling he began not speaking of love but of general things of the ambition which is becoming to a man of rank of the serious charge and duties of his life of the plans which he had formed in his own mind worthily to pass through the years allotted to him and to prepare for the eternity which waits us all beyond but he said sadly we wander in the dark not knowing which way to turn and if we take a wrong step whether from inadvertence or design the fairest plan may be ruined the most careful schemes destroyed but we have a guide i said and a light we follow not our leader and we hide the light addison hath represented life under the image of a bridge over which men are perpetually passing but the bridge is set everywhere with hidden holes and pitfalls so that he who steps into one straightway falls through and is drowned we are not always drowned by the pitfalls of life but which is as bad we are maimed and broken so that for the rest of our course we go halt i pray my lord i said that you may escape these pitfalls and press on with the light before you to the goal of your most honourable ambition it is too late he said sadly miss kitty you see in me the most wretched of mortals who might i would sometimes venture to think have become the most happy you wretched lord chudleigh oh beating heart you wretched of all men you should be the most happy i have tried he said to escape from the consequences of a folly nay a crime but it is impossible i am fast bound and tied he took my hand and held it while he added i may not say what i would i may not even think or hope or dream of what might have been might have been my lord which cannot now ever be kitty i thought after i discovered that it was impossible that i would not return any more to epsom wells in the country or away on foreign travel i might in time forget your face your voice your eyes the virtues and graces which sit so well in a form so charming the elevated soul my lord my lord i cried spare me yet i added tell me all that is in your mind if i cannot rid you of your burden at least i may soothe your sorrow the matter he replied lies in a few words kitty i love you and i may not ask you to be my wife i was silent for a while he stood before me his face bent over mine why not i asked because i have been a fool nay worse than a fool a knave because i am tied by bonds which i cannot break and i am unworthy of so much goodness and virtue oh i cried you know not how can you know i am none of the things which you imagine in me i am a poor and weak girl if you knew me you would surely think so too i cannot bear that you should think me other than what i am why my angel your very modesty and your tears are the proof that you are all i think and more no i cried if i told you all if i could lay bare my very soul to you i think that you could i was going to add love me no longer but i caught myself up in time that you could no longer think of me as better but rather as worse than other girls you know he said that i love you kitty you have known that for some time have you not yes my lord i replied humbly i have known it and have felt my own unworthiness oh so unworthy so unworthy am i that i have wept tears of shame nay nay he said it is i who am unworthy my dear there is nothing you could tell me which would make me love you less i shook my head there was one thing which i had to tell could any man be found to forgive that i came back here resolved to tell you all if i could not ask for your love kitty i might at the very least win your pity what have you to tell me my lord it was well that the night was so dark that my face could not be seen oh telltale cheeks aglow with fear and joy what have you to tell me i repeated it is a story which i trust to your eyes alone he said i have written it down before we part to night i will give it to you come he took my hand again but his was cold come we must not stay longer let me lead you from this slippery and dangerous place one moment i would have lingered there all night to listen to the accents of his dear voice if you my lord have a secret to tell to me i also have one to tell you nay he replied i can hear none of your pretty secrets my peace is already destroyed besides he added desperately when you have read what i have written you will see that it would be idle to waste another thought upon me i will read it i said to night but my lord on one promise and that is that you will not leave epsom without my knowledge let me speak with you once more after i have read it if it is only to weep with you and to say farewell i promise and oh my lord if i may say it since your lordship may not marry me then i for your sake will never marry any other man kitty that is my promise my lord and perhaps sometimes you will give a thought to your poor fond kitty he caught me in his arms and showered kisses upon my cheeks and lips calling me his angel and a thousand other names until i gently pushed him from me and begged him to take me back to the company he knelt at my feet and took my hand in his holding it in silence i knew that he was praying for the blessing of heaven upon my unworthy head then he led me back to the circle of lights when the first person we met was miss peggy baker why here she cried looking sharply from one to the other are my lord and miss pleydell strange that the two people we have most missed should be found at the same time and together which is stranger still nancy left her swains and ran to greet me my dear she whispered you have been crying is all well i am the happiest woman and the most unhappy in the world i said i wish i were in my bed alone and crying on my pillow and she squeezed my hand and ran back to her lovers my lord himself walked home with us we left before the party broke up at parting he placed in my hand a roll of paper remember i whispered you have promised he made no answer but stooped and kissed my fingers chapter xiv how my lord made his confession it was not a long manuscript i kissed the dear handwriting before i began to the queen of my heart it began dearest girl since i first had the happiness of worshipping at your shrine i have learned from watching your movements listening to your voice and looking at your face something of what that heavenly beauty must have been like which we are told captivated and drove mad the ancients even by mere meditation and thought upon it did ever girl read more beautiful language and by conversations with you even in the gay assembly or on the crowded terrace i have learned to admire and to love that goodness of heart which god hath bestowed upon the most virtuous among women i say this in no flattery or desire to pay an empty compliment but sincerely and out of the respect and admiration as well as the love which i have conceived for one who is i dare maintain all goodness o kitty kitty to read this with blushing cheeks and biting conscience surely it must make people good to be believed good so that by a little faith we might raise and purify all mankind it is my purpose to night if i find an opportunity to tell you that i am the most wretched man in the world because by a fatal accident of which i must presently force myself to speak i am for ever shut out from the happiness which it was i believe the intention of a merciful providence to confer upon me yet am i also fortunate and esteem myself happy in this respect that i have for once in my life been in the presence of as much female beauty and virtue as was ever i believe found together in one human soul to tell you these things to speak of my love is an alleviation of suffering to tell the cause of this unhappiness is worse than to plunge a knife into my heart yet must it be told to your ear alone last year about the early summer a rumour began to run through the coffee houses that there was a man of extraordinary wit genius and humour to be met with in the liberties or rules of the fleet prison these rules of which you know nothing oh kitty nothing are houses or lodgings lying in certain streets adjacent to the fleet market where prisoners for debt are allowed on payment of certain fees and on finding security to reside outside the prison in fact they are free and yet being in the eyes of the law still prisoners they cannot any more be arrested for debt among these prisoners of the rules was a certain reverend gregory shovel a man of great learning and a doctor of divinity of cambridge a divine of eloquence and repute once a fashionable preacher who being of extravagant and luxurious habits which brought him into expenditure above his means at last found himself a prisoner in the fleet and presently through the influence of friends was placed in the enjoyment of the rules here whether because he had exhausted the generosity of his friends or because he craved for action or for the baser purposes of gain he became that most unworthy thing a fleet parson one of a most pestilent crew who go through the form of marriage for all comers and illegally bind together for life those whom heaven in mercy and knowledge had designed to be kept asunder i believe that by his extraordinary ability and impudence coupled with the fact that he really was what his rivals chiefly pretended to be a clergyman of the established church of england and ireland he has managed to secure the principal part of this nefarious trade to himself and has become what he has named himself 'the chaplain of the fleet' this person attracted to himself little by little a great gathering of followers admirers or friends no one i suppose could be the friend of one who had so fallen therefore the men who thronged to his lodgings nearly every night in the week were drawn thither by the fashion of running after a man who talked sang told stories and kept open house in so desperate a quarter as the fleet market and who yet had the manners of a gentleman the learning of a scholar and the experience of a traveller it was for this reason solely for curiosity that on one fatal evening last year i entreated sir miles lackington a former friend of my father's and myself to present me to the doctor you have made the acquaintance of sir miles he was once though perhaps the fact has not been made known to you by him also a prisoner of the rules to this had he been brought by his inordinate love of gambling by which he had stripped himself in six months of as fine an estate as ever fell to the lot of an english gentleman and brought himself to a debtor's prison sir miles who when he could no longer gamble showed signs of possessing virtues hitherto unsuspected in him offered on the occasion of borrowing a few guineas of me to conduct me if i wished to spend an evening with the doctor as he is called to the house which this doctor either owns or frequents i am not a lover of that low humour and those coarse scenes depicted by mr fielding and dr smollet i do not delight in seeing drunken men sprawl in the gutter nor women fight upon fleet bridge nor bears baited nor pickpockets and rogues pilloried or flogged but i was promised something very different from these scenes i was to meet sir miles told me a remarkable man who could narrate declaim preach or sing a drinking song just as he was in the vein i accepted the invitation the strangeness of which affected my curiosity rather than excited my hopes i was to witness i thought the spectacle of a degraded wretch who lived by breaking the law for each offence being liable to a penalty of not less than a hundred pounds it would be i expected such a sight as that which the drunken helot once presented to the virtuous spartan youth we made our way through a mean and filthy neighbourhood by the side of a market heaped with cabbage stalks past houses where through the common panes of green glass set in leaden frames one might see a rushlight or a tallow candle feebly glimmering for a crew of drunken men to shout songs and drink beside the room into which i was led opened off the street and was of fair proportions but low in it was a table at the head of which in a vast wooden chair sat a man who looked though perhaps he was not the biggest man i had ever seen some tall men have small hands or narrow shoulders or small heads doctor shovel is great all over with a large and red face a silk cassock a full and flowing wig clean bands and a flowered morning gown very large and comfortable he seemed struck with some astonishment on hearing my name but presently recovered and invited me to sit at his right hand sir miles sat at his left the room was pretty full and we found that the evening had already begun by the exhaustion of the first bowl of punch the guests consisted of gentlemen who came like myself to see and converse with the famous doctor and of prisoners who like sir miles were living in the rules as the punch went round the talk grew more jovial that is to say the talk of the doctor because no one else said anything he talked continuously he talked of everything he seemed to know everything and to have been everywhere when he was not talking he was singing at intervals he smoked a pipe of tobacco which did not interrupt his talk and he never ceased sending round the punch i found that the visitors were expected to provide this part of the entertainment i am sure that the kindest hearted of women will believe me when i tell her that i am no drunkard yet there are times when owing to the foolish custom of calling for toasts no heeltaps and a brimming glass the most careful head may be affected nor can i plead inexperience in the dangers of the bottle after three years at st john's cambridge where the fellows of the society and the noblemen and gentlemen commoners on the foundation drank freely at every college feast of the college port and the punch sent up from the butteries i had been like other young men but i trust that your imagination will not picture lord chudleigh carried away from the combination room and put to bed by a couple of the college gyps yet worse still i have to present that spectacle before your eyes not at a grave and reverend college feast but in the dissolute liberties of the fleet the atmosphere of the room was close and hot with the smell of the tobacco and the fumes of the punch bowl presently i found that my eyes were beginning to swim and my head to reel i half rose to go but the doctor laying his hand upon me cried with a great oath that we should not part yet by this time sir miles was lying with his head on the table some of the guests were lying on the floor some were singing some crying some kissing each other it was in short one of those scenes of debauchery which may be witnessed whenever a party of men meet together to drink i sat down it was plain that i could not escape from these hogs without myself becoming a hog i sat still therefore while the doctor still talked still laughed still waved his monstrous great hand in the air as he talked and the punch still went briskly round among the few who sat upright in the morning i was awakened by no other than my host of the preceding evening in whose bed i had spent the rest of the night unconscious he stood over me with grave face and in reproachful accents asked me how i fared and for what purpose i had come to him i was still half drunk i could not remember for what purpose he assisted me to dress and then because i could not stand he gave me a mug of small ale with which to clear my brain being thus partly restored to my senses i listened while he answered his own question and told me why i had come to him 'you came' he said 'to be married' i stared he repeated the words 'you came to be married' it seems incredible that a man should hear a statement so utterly false and not cry out upon the liar yet i did not my brain was confused that is my excuse also this great man seemed to hold me like a wizard while he held up his forefinger and with wrinkled brow shook it in my face 'you came to be married' good heavens what did this mean i was drunk horribly drunk the night before i could not remember so drunk was i how i came to the house with whom with what intent 'she waits below' he told me she who he gave me his arm to support me down the stairs i descended curious and agitated i remember a figure with a hood while i looked this chaplain of the devil began the marriage service his eyes still fixed on me while he recited and seemed to read when he had finished i was married after we had signed a book he gave me another great mug of ale which i drank to the bottom then i suppose i rolled over and was carried upstairs for i remember nothing more until the evening when i was again awakened by this rogue and common cheat who sitting by my bedside congratulated me calmly on the day's work i will not go on to tell you all the things he said i discovered that in some way i know not how but can guess my father had once done this man an injury this conspiracy was his revenge who was my wife he would not tell me what was her position her birth her name was she some wretched creature who could be bought off to keep silence while she lived although she was a thing to be ashamed of and to hide was she some person who would trade on her title parade her infamy and declare herself to the world as lady chudleigh by her lord's marriage in the fleet a hundred things i asked he gave me no reply her name i had forgotten it the register it had been put away i seemed to know the name somehow yet it escaped me in the night it came back to me in a dream yet in the morning it was gone again once after my first evening with you the name came to me once more in a dream yet it was gone when i awoke and could remember no other name than yours it is nearly a year ago i know not yet whom i married she hath made no sign yet i know full well that the day will come when she will confess herself and demand acknowledgment one hope remains that the marriage is not valid it is a slender hope for the man is an ordained clergyman of the established church i am going to london to see him to implore his pity to humble myself if necessary it is of no avail i have gone i have humbled myself and then flying into the opposite extreme i have cursed him he enjoyed both the wrath and the humility i have no longer any hope i have taken the advice of my lawyers who tell me that an act of parliament alone can set me free this act how can it be got when i do not know the name of the woman even if there were any reasonable chance that so dreadful a place could produce a woman of virtue and honour which there is not i could never look upon that woman with any but feelings of loathing and horror for not only is her idea black beyond compare but my heart is full and will remain for ever full of kitty pleydell strange to say as i wrote the words it seemed as if i had touched at last the chord of memory the name was on my lips no it was an illusion i have forgotten it again and can only murmur kitty pleydell sweet kitty divine kitty on whom may all the blessings of heaven rest for ever chapter xv how nancy had a quick tongue this was at once a sad and yet most joyful confession for while the girl who read it was full of shame and terror in thinking of his righteous wrath and loathing yet the tender love which filled the pages and fired her soul with wonder and rejoicing forbade her to believe that love was not stronger than wrath she was so ignorant and inexperienced the girl who joined in this treacherous deed she was so dominated by the will of that masterful man her uncle she was so taken by surprise surely when he learned these things he would forgive the past but should she tell him at once it would be better to tell him than that he should find it out there were many ways in which he could find it out oh the shame of being found out the meanness of taking all his secrets and giving none roger the doctor's man might for a bribe were the bribe heavy enough to outweigh his fear of the doctor tell the name of the bride the doctor might think the time had come when he should step forward and reveal the secret even there was danger that his lordship might remember the name which he had seen but once and ask me sternly if there were upon the earth two kitty pleydells of the same age the same height and the same face and what should i say then stimulated by this thought as by the touch of a sharp spur i procured an inkstand and paper and began to write a letter of confession my lord what to say next my lord in what words to clothe a most shameful story we cheat ourselves we do one thing and call it another we stop the voice of conscience by misrepresenting our actions and whereas we ought to be weighed down by the burden of our sins we carry ourselves confidently with light hearts as if we had done nothing to be ashamed of it is only when our crimes are set forth in plain english that we know them for the shameful things they are what was i to tell my lord a girl brought up in the fear of god and his commandments can be so weak as to obey a man who ordered her to do a wicked thing could she be afterwards so cowardly as not to tell the man whom she had thus injured even when she knew that he loved her a wicked crime and a course of deceit how could i frame the words so as to disarm that righteous wrath my lord it has been for a long time upon my conscience to tell you a thing which you ought to know before you waste one more thought upon the unworthy person to whom you addressed a confession that confession indeed depicted your lordship with such fidelity as to make me the more ashamed to unburden my conscience know then that here i stopped with trembling fingers which refused to move know that what that i was his wicked and unworthy wife the creature whom most of all he must hate and despise i could not tell him not then no it must be told by word of mouth with such extenuating phrases and softening of details as might present themselves to my troubled mind i tore the letter into a thousand fragments was girl ever so bested that sacred bond of union which brings happy lovers together the crown of courtship the end of wooing the marriage service itself was the thing which kept us asunder i would tell him later on there would come an opportunity i would make the opportunity somewhere at some time yes the best way would be to wait till we were alone and it should be in the evening when my face and his would be partly veiled by the night then i could whisper the story and ask his forgiveness but that opportunity never came as will be presently seen after morning prayers that day we walked upon the terrace where the company were as usual assembled and all talking together below the trees i held in my hand the manuscript of my lord's confession presently we saw him slowly advancing to meet us wearing a grave and melancholy look but then he was never one of those who think that the duties of life are to be met with a reckless laugh even in laughter said the wise man the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness dear miss pleydell whispered peggy baker as he appeared can his lordship have repented already of what he said beneath the trees last night the poor young gentleman wears a heavy countenance this morning it was best to make no answer to this raillery let her say what she would i cared nothing and was too heavy myself to made reply i would neither help nor hinder then leaving mrs esther with the party i advanced boldly and met my lord returning him his manuscripts before the eyes of all everybody stared wondering what could be in the packet i placed in his hands he however received it with a low bow and accompanied me to my party saying nothing for the moment the music was playing its loudest and as we walked my lord beside me and mrs esther with lady levett nancy remaining behind to exchange insinuations and pert speeches in which the saucy damsel took great delight with peggy baker i looked back and saw their heads wagging while the bystanders smiled and presently peggy fanned herself with agitation in her face by which it was easy to conclude that nancy had said something more than usually biting to which her opponent had for the moment no reply ready you have read these papers asked my lord and that in as careless a tone as if they contained nothing of importance yes i said i have read the sad story but i pity the poor woman who was persuaded to do your lordship this grievous wrong i think she needs and deserves little of our pity he replied and as for persuasion it could have wanted but little with a woman so designing as to join in such a plot a designing woman poor kitty then i tried beating about the bush to bring his mind round to see the possibility of a more charitable view remember my lord two things this doctor shovel could not have known of your coming the plot therefore was swiftly conceived and as quickly carried into execution you have told me in your paper i entreat you my lord burn it with all speed that this man's influence over you was so great as to coerce you because your brain was not in its natural clearness into doing and suffering what at ordinary times you would have rejected with scorn bethink you then with charity that this doctor shovel this so called chaplain of the fleet may have found some poor girl over whom he had authority and in like manner coerced and forced her to join with him in this most wicked plot you would make excuses he said for the greatest of sinners i doubt not that but this story is too improbable i cannot think that any woman could be so coerced against her will i sighed my lord i beg you to remember your promise to me you will not leave epsom without first telling me you will not seek out this man this doctor shovel or quarrel with him or do aught to increase his malice meantime i am feeble being only a woman and bound in obedience and duty to my guardian and protectress yet i bethink me of an old fable the lion was one day caught in the coils of a net and released by the teeth of a he started what does this mean o kitty what can you do i do not know yet perhaps i may be able to release you from the coils of this net have patience my lord kitty let us speak no more about it for the moment i replied perhaps my lord if my inquiries lead to the result you desire it is christian to forgive your enemies i cannot understand you he replied how should you how should any one release me truly if deliverance came forgiveness were a small thing to give chapter xvi how sped the masquerade it was at this time that the company at epsom held their masquerade the greatest assembly of the season to which not only the visitors at the wells but also the gentry from the country around and many from london came so that the inns and lodging houses overflowed and some were fain to be content to find a bed over shops and in the mean houses of the lower sort nay there were even many who put up tents on the downs and slept in them like soldiers on a campaign at other times my head would have been full of the coming festivity but the confession of my lord and the uncertainty into which it threw my spirits prevented my paying that attention to the subject which its importance demanded kitty cried nancy i have talked to you for half an hour and you have not heard one word oh how a girl is spoiled the moment she falls in love don't start my dear nor blush unless you like because there is no one here but ourselves as for that all the place knows that you and lord chudleigh are in love with each other though peggy baker will have it that it is mostly on one side 'my dear' she said at the book shop yesterday 'the woman shows her passion in a manner which makes a heart of sensibility blush for her sex' don't get angry kitty because i was there and set her down as she deserved 'dear me' i said 'we have not all of us the sensibility of miss peggy baker who if all reports are true has had time to get over the passion she once exhibited for the handsome lord chudleigh' why my dear how can any one help seeing that the women are monstrous jealous and my lord in so deep a quagmire of love that nothing but the marriage ring which cures the worst cases can pull him out i had in verity been thinking of my troubles while nancy was thinking over her frocks now i roused myself and listened my mother will go as the queen of sheba she will wear a train over her hoop a paper crown a sceptre and have two black boys to walk behind her that will show who she is i am to go as joan of arc with a sword in my hand but not to wear it dangling at my side lest it cause me to fall down peggy baker will be venus the goddess of love she will have a golden belt and a little cupid is to follow her with bow and arrows which he is to shoot or pretend to shoot at the company she will sprawl and languish in her most bewitching manner the dear creature but since she has failed with lord eardesley there is nobody at epsom good enough for her i hear she goes very shortly to bath where no doubt she will catch a nabob i hope his liver and temper will be good oh and mr stallabras will go as a greek pastoral poet theo something i forget his name with a lyre in one hand and a shepherd's crook in the other harry temple is to go as vulcan you will know him by his limp and by the hammer upon his shoulder sir miles wants to go as the god of cards but no one seems to know who that deity was my father says he shall go as a plain english country gentleman because he sees so few among the company that the sight may do them good i was going as the goddess of night because i wanted to have an excuse for wearing a domino all the evening most of the ladies throwing them aside early in the night my dress was a long black velvet hood covering me from head to foot without hoops and my hair dressed low so that the hood could cover the head and be even pulled down over the face at first i wanted my lord to find out by himself the incognita who had resolved to address him but he asked me to tell him beforehand and to be sure i could refuse him nothing the splendour of the lights was even greater than that at lord chudleigh's entertainment when he lit up the lawn among the trees with coloured oil lamps yet the scene lacked the awful contrast of the dark and gloomy wood behind in which as one retired to talk the music seemed out of place and the laughter of the gay throng impertinent here was there no dark wood or shade of venerable trees to distract the thoughts from the gaiety of the moment or sadden by a contrast of the long lived forest with the transitory crowd who danced beneath the branches as careless as a cloud of midges on the river bank born to buzz away their little hour know hope fear and love feel pain be cut off prematurely at their twentieth minute or wear on to a green old age and die at the protracted term of sixty minutes the terrace and the new parade were hung with festoons of coloured lamps there must have been thousands of them in graceful arches from branch to branch the doors of the assembly rooms had columns and arches of coloured lamps set up beside and over them there were porches of coloured lamps a temple of coloured lamps beside the watch house at the edge of the pond where horns were stationed to play while the music rested in the rooms was of course to be dancing and which was the greatest attraction there were amusements of various kinds almost as if one was at a country fair without the crowding of the rustics the fighting with quarterstaves the grinning through horse collars the climbing of greasy poles and the shouting i have always since that evening longed for the impossible namely a country fair without the country people why can we not have all to ourselves and away from a noisy mob of ill bred and rough people the amusements of the fair the stalls with the gingerbread richardson's theatre with a piece addressed to eyes and ears of sensibility a wax work dancing and riding people and clowns here the presenters of the masquerade had not it is true provided all these amusements but there were some an italian came to exhibit dancing puppets called fantoccini a conjurer promised to perform tricks and swallow red hot coals which is truly a most wonderful feat and makes one believe in the power of magic else how could the tender throat sustain the violence of the fire a girl was to dance upon the tight rope and a sorcerer or magician or astrologer was to be seated in a grotto to tell the fortunes of all who chose to search into the future nothing could be gayer or more beautiful than the assemblage gathered together beneath these lighted lamps or in the assembly rooms in the evening mrs esther was the only lady without some disguise sir robert whose dress has been already sufficiently indicated gave her his arm for the evening all the dresses were as nancy told me i knew venus by her golden cestus and her cupid armed he was indeed the milk boy and beneath the domino i could guess without having been told that no other than peggy baker swam and languished surely it is great presumption for a woman to call herself the goddess of beauty harry temple was fine as vulcan though he generally forgot to go lame he bore a real blacksmith's hammer on his shoulder but i am certain that vulcan never wore so modish a wig with so gallant a tie behind and his scowls meant for me were not out of keeping with his character nancy levett was the sweetest joan of arc ever seen and skipped about to the admiration of everybody with a cuirass and a sword although the real joan who was i believe a village maid probably wore a stuff frock instead of nancy's silk and i dare say hoops were not in fashion in her days nor would she have lace mittens or silk shoes but bare hands and wooden sandals nor would she powder her hair and dress it up two feet high but rather wear it plain blown about by the winds washed by the rain and curling as nature pleased as for mr stallabras it did one good to see him as theocritus nose in air shepherd's crook on shoulder lyre in hand in a splendid purple coat and wig newly combed and tied behind illustrating the dignity and grandeur of genius the queen of sheba's black pages they were a loan from a lady in london attracted general attention you knew her for a queen by her crown there were however other queens all of whom wore crowns and it was difficult sometimes to know which queen was designed if you failed to notice the symbol which distinguished one from the other thus queen elizabeth of england who bore on a little flag the motto dux faemina facti was greatly indignant when harry temple mistook her for cleopatra whose asp was for the moment hidden yet so good a scholar ought to have known because cleopatra ran away at actium and therefore could not carry such a motto while elizabeth conquered in the channel then it was hard at first sight to distinguish between julius caesar hannibal timour the tartar luther alfred and caractacus because they were all dressed very much alike save that luther carried a book alfred a sceptre caesar a short sword timour a pike hannibal a marshal's baton and caractacus a bludgeon the difficulties and mistakes however mattered little because when the first excitement of guessing a character was over one forgot about the masquerade and remembered the ball yet it was vexatious when a man had dressed carefully for say charles the first to be mistaken for don quixote or euripides who wore the same wigs i say nothing of the grotesque dresses with masks and artificial heads introduced by some of the young templars they amused as such things do for a while and until one became accustomed to them then their pranks ceased to amuse it is a power peculiar to man that he can continue to laugh at horse play buffoonery and low humour for hours while a woman is content to laugh for five minutes if she laughs at all i believe that the admirers of those coarse and unfeeling books tom jones and humphrey clinker are entirely men all the ladies began by wearing masks and a few of the men one of them personated a shepherd in lamentation for the loss of his mistress that is to say he wore ribbons of black and crimson tied in bows about his sleeve and carried a pastoral hook decorated with the same colours in this character some of the company easily recognised lord chudleigh and when he led out for the first minuet a tall hooded figure in black velvet some thought they recognised kitty pleydell but why is he in mourning asked peggy baker who understood what was meant she cannot have denied him he must have another mistress for whom he has put on the black ribbons poor kitty we are all of us sorry for her yet pride still goes before a fall no one knew what was meant except lord chudleigh's partner the figure in black velvet i suppose continued peggy alluding to the absence of my hoops that she wants to show how a woman would look without the aid of art i call it for my part odious after the minuet we left the dancers and walked beneath the lighted lamps on the terrace presently the music ceased for a while and the horns outside began to play kitty whispered my lord you used strange words the other night were they anything but a kind hope for the impossible could they mean anything beyond an attempt to console a despairing man no i replied they were more than a hope but as yet i cannot say more oh my lord let me enjoy a brief hour of happiness if it should die away and come to nothing i have said that part of the entertainment was a magician's cave we found ourselves opposite the entrance of this place people were going in and coming out or more correctly people were waiting outside for their turn to go in and those who came out appeared either elated beyond measure with the prophecies they had heard or depressed beyond measure some of the girls had tears in their eyes they were those to whom he had denied a lover some came out bounding and leaping with joy they were the maidens to whom he had promised a husband and children dear some of the young men came out with head erect and smiling lips i suppose the wizard had told them of fortune honour long life health and love things which every young man must greatly desire some came out with angry frowns and lips set sternly as if resolved to meet adverse fortune with undaunted courage which is of course the only true method but i fear the evening's happiness was destroyed for these luckless swains and nymphs the lamps would grow dim the music lose its gladness the wine its sparkle let us my lord i said little thinking of what was to happen within the cave let us too consult the oracle and learn the future at first he refused saying gravely that to inquire of wise men or wise women was the sin of saul with the witch of endor that whatever might have happened in olden time as in the case of the delphic oracles or the high places where they came to inquire of baal or moloch there was now no voice from the outer world nor any communication from the stars or from good spirits or from evil therefore he said we waste our time sweet kitty in idly asking questions of this man who knows no more than we know ourselves then i asked let us go in curiosity because i have never seen a wizard and i know not what he is like you i am sure will keep me safe from harm whatever frightful creature he may be so without thinking i led the way to the wizard's cave it stood in the parade beneath the trees at the door were assembled a crowd of the masqueraders either waiting their turn or discussing the reply of the oracle the entrance before which was a heavy curtain double was guarded by a negro armed with an immense cutlass which he ever and anon whirled round his head the light falling on the bright steel so that it seemed like a ring of fire behind which gleamed his two eyes as bright as a panther's eyes and his teeth as white as polished ivory the sight of him made some of the women retreat and refuse to go in at all the wise man received only one couple at a time but when the pair then with him emerged the negro stepped forward and beckoned to us though it was not our turn to enter the cave i observed that the last pair came out with downcast eyes i think i am as free from superstition as any woman yet i needs must remark in spite of my lord's disbelief in magic or astrology that the unhappy young man whose fortune this wizard told an evil fortune as was apparent from his face ran away with the girl who was with him an honest city merchant's daughter and having got through his whole stock took to the road and was presently caught tried sentenced and hanged in chains on bagshot heath where those who please may go and see him with such examples before one it is hard not to believe in the conjurer and the wise woman just as a thousand instances might be alleged from any woman's experience to prove that it is unlucky to spill salt without throwing some over your left shoulder or to dream of crying children or to cross two knives upon a plate with many other things which are better not learned would one wish to live a tranquil life what they called the wizard's cave was a little building constructed specially for the occasion of rude trunks of trees laid one upon the other the interstices filled up with moss to imitate a hermitage or monkish cell a gloomy abode consecrated to superstition and horrid rites the roof seemed to be made of thatch but i think that was only an illusion produced by the red light of an oil lamp which hung in the middle and gave a soft and flickering yet lurid light around the hut there also hung up beside the lamp and on the right hand the skin of a grisly crocodile stuffed the sight of which filled me with a dreadful apprehension and made me ever after reflect on the signal advantages possessed by those who dwell in a land where such monsters are unknown a table stood in the middle on which to my horror were three grinning skulls in a row and in each they had placed a lamp of different colours so that through the eye holes of one there came a green of another a red and of the third a blue light very horrible and diabolical to behold there was also a great book doubtless the book of fate upon the table behind it sat the sage himself he was a man with a big head covered with grey hair which hung down upon his shoulders long and unkempt and with a tall mitre which had mysterious characters engraved over it and between the letters what seemed in the dim light to be flames and devils the fit occupant of this abominable place he wore spectacles and a great turkish beard frightful and saracenic of aspect i thought of the witch of endor of those who practised divinations and of the idolatrous practices on high places and in groves and i trembled lest the fate of the prophets of baal might also be that of the profane inquirers outside the music played and the couples were dancing the wizard looked up as we stood before him behind the blue spectacles and the great beard even in the enormous head i recognised nothing and suspected nothing but when he spoke and in deep sonorous tones called my companion by his name lord chudleigh what wilt thou inquire of the oracle then indeed i turned giddy and faint and should have fallen but my lord caught me by the waist be soothed kitty he whispered here is nothing to fright us but the mummery of a foolish masquerade or the roguery of a rascal quack calm yourself alas i feared no more the crocodile nor the horrid death's heads nor the turkish beard nor the mitre painted with devils if they were devils they disquieted me at first sight it is true but now was i in deadly terror for i knew and feared the voice it was no other than the voice of the doctor the chaplain of the fleet for what trouble what mischief was he here then i recovered saying to myself kitty be firm resolve by neither act nor word to do harm to thy lover consent not to any snare be resolute and alert lord chudleigh seeing me thus composed stepped forward to the table and said sir magician wizard conjurer or whatever name best befits you for you and your pretended science i care not one jot nor do i believe but that it is imposture and falsehood perhaps however you are but acting a part in the masquerade but the young lady hath a desire to see what you do and to ask you a question or two your lordship must own that i know your name in spite of your domino tut tut everybody here knows my name whether i wear a domino or take it off that is nothing you are probably one of the company in disguise you doubt my power then without your leave my lord permit me to tell you a secret known to me yourself and one or two others only it is a secret which no one has yet whispered about none of the company at the wells know it it is a great secret an important secret all this time his voice kept growing deeper and deeper it is a secret of the darkest stay this young lady i think knows it for heaven's sake i cried but was interrupted by my lord tell me your secret he said calmly let us know this wonderful secret the doctor leaned forward over the table and whispered in his ear a few words lord chudleigh started back and gazed at him with dismay so he cried it is already becoming town talk is it the magician shook his head not so my lord no one knows it yet except the persons concerned in it no one will ever know it if your lordship so pleases i told you but to show the power of the black art i wonder then how you know the wizard by his art learns as much of the past as he desires to know he reads the present around him still by aid of this great art he can foretell the future not by the gift of prophecy but by studying the stars tell me then said lord chudleigh as if in desperation the future yet this is idle folly and imposture that which is done the sage opened the book and turned over the pages speaking in low deep tones cannot be undone whatever your lordship might ignorantly wish that which is loved may still be loved that which is hoped may yet come to pass is that all you have to say to me is it not enough my lord would any king's counsel or learned serjeant give you greater comfort good night leave now this young lady with me alone first read me the oracle of her future as you have told me mine though still i say this is folly and imposture the magician gravely turned over his pages without resenting this imputation and read or seemed to read love shall arise from ashes of buried scorn joy from a hate in a summer morning born when heart with heart and pulse with pulse shall beat farewell to the pain of the storm and the fear of the fleet good heavens cried lord chudleigh pressing his hand to his forehead am i dreaming are we mad now my lord said the pretended wizard go to the door leave this young lady with me i have more to tell her for her own ears she is quite safe she is not the least afraid at the smallest fright she will cry aloud for your help you will remain without the door within earshot yes i murmured terrified yet resolute leave me a few moments alone let me hear what he has to say to me then my lord left me alone with the doctor when the heavy curtain fell before the door the wizard took off the great mitre and laughed silently and long though i felt no cause for merriment confess child he said that i am an oracle of dodona a sacred oak lord chudleigh is well and properly deceived but we have little time for speech i came here kitty to see you and no one else by special messengers and information gained from letters i learned as i wrote to you to my great joy that this young lord is deeply enamoured you are already it is true in some sort nay in reality his bride though he knows it not yet i might waive my own dignity in the matter for the sake of thy happiness and if you like to wed him why nothing is easier than to let him know that his fleet wife is dead they die of drink daily roger my man will swear what i tell him to swear this i have the less compunction in persuading him to do because in consequence of his horrid thieving robbing fighting and blaspheming his soul is already irretrievably lost his conscience seared with a hot iron and his heart impenitent as the nether millstone also the evidence of the marriage the register is in my hands and may be kept or destroyed as i please therefore it matters nothing what this rogue may swear i think child the best thing would be to accept my lord's proposals to let him know through me that his former wife whose name he knows not is dead he may be told so that he may remain ashamed of himself and anxious to bury the thing in silence that she died of gin he would then be free to marry you and should he not redeem his promise and give you honourable marriage it will be time to reduce him to submission with the register shall i confess that at the first blush this proposal was welcome to me it seemed so easy a relief from all our troubles the supposed death of his wife the destruction of the register what could be better be under no fear continued the doctor of my fellow roger he dares not speak by heaven i have plenty to hang him with a dozen times over if i wished he would murder me if he dared and would carry me up to holborn bridge where i could be safely dropped into the fleet ditch but he dares not try why if he proclaimed this marriage on fleet bridge but that he dares not do no one would believe it on his word such a reputation has he while i have the register safely locked up whereas did they come forward to give evidence for me at my bidding so clear is my case and so abundant my proofs that no counsel could shake them this speech afforded me a little space wherein to collect my thoughts love makes a woman strong time was when i should have trembled before the doctor's eyes and obeyed him in the least particular but now i had to consider another beside myself what i thought was this suppose the plot carried out and myself married to my lord again there would be this dreadful story on my mind i should not dare to own my relationship with this famous doctor i should be afraid lest my husband should find it out i should be afraid of his getting on the scent as children say therefore i should be obliged to hide all that part of my life which was spent in the fleet yet there were many persons mrs esther sir miles solomon stallabras beside my uncle who knew all of it except that one story why any day any moment a chance word an idle recollection might make my husband suspicious and jealous then farewell to all my happiness better none at all than to have it snatched from me in that way there is a second plan he went on we may tell him exactly who and what you are oh sir i cried do nothing yet leave it all with me for a little i beg i implore you i love him and he loves me should i harm him therefore by deceiving him and marrying him while i hid the shameful story of the past you cannot ask me to do that i will not do it and should you against my will acquaint him with what has happened i swear that out of the love i bear him i will refuse and deny all your allegations yea the very fact itself with the register and the evidence of those two rogues sir which would the court believe the daughter of the rev lawrence pleydell or the rascal runner of a of yourself he said nothing he looked surprised no i went on i will have no more deception every day i suffer remorse from my sin there shall be no more my mind sir is made up i will confess to him everything not to night i cannot to night and then if he sends me away with hatred i will never never stand in his way i will be as one dead this said the doctor it is to be young and to be in love i was once like that myself go child thou shalt hear from me again he put on his mitre and beckoned me to the door i went out without another word without stood a crowd including peggy baker oh she cried she looks frightened yet exulting dear miss pleydell i hope he prophesied great things for you a title perhaps an estate in the country a young and handsome lover as generous as he is constant but we know the course of true love never here my lord took my hand and led me away from the throng another pair went in and the great negro before the door began again to flash his cutlass in the lights to show his white teeth and to turn those white eyes about which looked so fierce and terrible chapter xvii how kitty prevented a duel the agitation of spirits into which i was thrown by this interview with the doctor blinded me for the moment to the fact that harry temple of whose pretensions i thought i had disposed was still an angry and rejected suitor indeed for a few days he had ceased to persecute me but to night he manifested a jealousy which was inexcusable after all i had said to him no one as i had gone so far as almost to explain to him had a better right to give me his hand for the evening than my lord yet this young man as jealous as the blacksmith god whom he personated must needs cross our steps at every turn throwing angry glances both upon me and my partner he danced with no one he threw away his hammer left off limping consorted with none of the gay company but nursed his wrath in silence now the last dance of the evening which took place at two o'clock in the morning was to be one in which all the ladies threw their fans upon the table and the gentlemen danced each with her whose fan he picked from the pile my lord whispered to me that i was first to let him see my fan whereupon when the fans lay upon the table he deliberately chose my own and brought it to me i took off my domino which was now useless because all the company knew the disguise everybody laughed and we took our places to lead off the country dance it was three o'clock when we finished dancing and prepared to go home harry temple here came up to me and asked if he might have the honour of escorting me to my lodgings i answered that i had already promised that favour to lord chudleigh every dance the whole evening the supper the promenade all given to this happy gentleman surely kitty the queen of the wells might dispense her favours more generously the queen said lord chudleigh is the fountain of honour we have only to accept and be grateful i laughed and bade harry good night and offered him my hand which he refused sullenly and murmuring something about pride and old friends turned aside and let us go everybody it seems noticed the black looks of harry temple all the evening and expected though in my happiness i thought not of such a thing that high words would pass between this sulky young gentleman and his favoured rival to whom he was so rude and unmannerly now by the laws of the wells as laid down strictly in the rules of the great mr nash for tunbridge wells and bath and adopted at all watering places the gentlemen wore no swords on the parade and in the card rooms yet it was impossible to prevent altogether the quarrels of hot blooded men and the green grass of the downs had been stained with the blood of more than one poor fellow run through as the consequence of a foolish brawl when will men cease to fight duels and seek to kill each other for a trifling disagreement or a quarrel generally it takes two to make a quarrel and few men are so perverse as deliberately to force a duel upon another against his will yet this was what harry temple my old schoolfellow my old friend of whom i once held so high an opinion so great a respect actually did with lord chudleigh he forced the quarrel upon him my lord was always a gentleman of singular patience forbearance and sweetness and one who would take unprovoked a great deal of provocation never showing the usual sign of resentment or anger although he might be forced to take up the quarrel he held indeed the maxim that a man should always think so well of himself as to make an insult impossible unless it be deliberate open and clearly intended as for his courage he went on to say that it was a matter of self respect if a man's own conscience approve which is the ultimate judge for all but those whose consciences are deadened by an evil life let him fear not what men say knowing full well that if they dare say more than the customs of the polite world allow it is easy for every man to prove that he is no coward lord chudleigh then having led us to the door of our own lodging unfortunately returned to the assembly rooms where and outside upon the terrace some of the gentlemen yet lingered i say unfortunately because as for what followed i cannot believe but that poor harry whose disposition was not naturally quarrelsome might have been inflamed by drinking wine with them when he ought to have gone to bed now wine to one who is jealous is like oil upon fire and had my lord for his part retired to durdans as he might very properly have done seeing the lateness of the hour the morning's reflection would i am sure have persuaded harry that he had been a fool and had no reasonable ground for quarrel with his lordship or with me the sun was already rising for it was nearly four o'clock in the morning the ladies were all gone off to bed those who lay about the benches yawned and stretched themselves some were for bed some for another bottle some were talking of an early gallop on the downs the lamps yet glimmered in their sockets the terrace looked with its oil lamps still burning in the brightness of the morning sunshine with the odds and ends of finery the tattered bravery of torn dresses gold and silver lace tinfoil broken paper crowns and helmets as sad as a theatre the morning after a performance the stalls of the wizard the italian performers and the dancing girl were empty and open their hangings were already torn down the stand for the horses beside the pond was broken in parts when lord chudleigh came back he found waiting for him among the latest of the revellers harry temple his face pale his lips set his manner agitated as of one who contemplates a rash act my lord threw himself upon a bench under the trees his head upon his hand pensive thinking to calm the agitation of his spirits by the freshness of the morning air harry began walking up and down in front of him casting angry glances at him but as yet speaking not now within the deserted card room when the lights had all burned out and the windows were wide open sat all by himself sir miles lackington turning over a pack of cards at one of the empty tables and thinking over the last night's play at which he had won some money and regretted to have been stopped just when he was in luck there were now only a few gentlemen left and these were one by one dropping off presently with an effort harry temple stopped in front of his lordship and spoke to him i declare that up to this time poor harry had always been the most peaceful of creatures though strong and well accustomed to hold bouts with will in which he proved almost equal to that stalwart competitor at wrestling singlestick quarterstaff or boxing also as was proved by the affray of the saturday evening already related not unready on occasion but a bookish youth and not one who sought to fix quarrels upon any man or to commit murder in the name of honour and this shows how dangerous a passion is thwarted love which can produce in a peaceful man's bosom jealousy hatred rage and forgetfulness of that most sacred commandment which enjoins us not to slay i trust my lord he said laughing and blushing as if uncertain of himself that your lordship hath passed a pleasant evening with the queen of the wells lord chudleigh looked up surprised then he rose for there was a look in harry's eyes which meant mischief the unlucky love sick swain went on lord chudleigh and miss kitty pleydell the very names seem made for one another no doubt his lordship is as fine a gentleman as the lady is beautiful sir said lord chudleigh quietly you have perhaps been drinking this is the only excuse for such an association of my name with that young lady's in a public assembly oh he said i want no excuse for addressing your lordship the temples were gentlefolk before the chudleighs were heard of well mr temple so be it enjoy that superiority shall we close this discussion no my lord there is more to be said he spoke hotly and with an anger which ought surely to have been simulated such small provocation as he had received then sir in heaven's name let us say it and have done with it you have offended me my lord you best know how i believe i know mr temple you also know what grounds you have for believing that to be an offence i say my lord his voice rose and his eyes flashed that you have offended me had i done so wittingly returned lord chudleigh i should willingly ask pardon but i deny your right to take offence you have offended me highly he repeated and that in a manner which makes an apology only a deeper insult you have offended me in a manner which only one thing can satisfy before we go any farther mr temple said my lord sitting down again calmly and without heat i would know exactly the nature of my offence and your reasonable right to regard it as such it needs not my lord you know well enough what i mean i know that of course i would wish to know as well your right to be offended i say my lord that it is enough harry being in the wrong spoke still more loudly and those who were left drew near to see the quarrel you need not raise your voice sir said lord chudleigh i like any altercation in which i may be unhappily engaged to be conducted like the rest of my business in life namely with the decorum and quietness which become gentlemen like the temples and those of that younger family the chudleighs you have i believe travelled you have therefore without doubt had opportunities of observing the well bred and charming quietness with which gentlemen in france arrange these little matters particularly when as now the dispute threatens to involve the name of a lady now sir that we understand each other i must inform you that unless i know the exact nature of my offence to you which i have the right to demand this affair will proceed no further i would as soon accept a quarrel from a mad malay running amuck at all he meets my lord cried harry with red face and trembling fingers of course i do not pretend to be unable to form a guess lord chudleigh went on gravely but i must beg you to instruct me exactly what you mean you will observe sir that i am here as a visitor previously unknown to yourself it is therefore strange to learn that one has offended a gentleman towards whom my behaviour has been neither less nor more guarded than towards others my lord you have offended me by the attentions you have paid to a young lady indeed sir so i believed but permit me to ask if the young lady is connected with you or with your house by any ties of relationship or otherwise she is not my lord further have you any right of guardianship over this young lady none my lord but yet you have offended me the young lady is free to accept the attention of any man she may prefer to show her preference as openly as she considers proper i conclude this to be the case and if so i am unable to perceive in what way i can wilfully have offended you your lordship said harry temple enraged by his adversary's calmness but yet with sufficient self command to speak in lower tones has offended me in this that if you had not paid those attentions to miss pleydell she might have accepted those courtesies which i was prepared to offer her indeed sir that is a circumstance with which i am wholly unconcerned no doubt the same thing might be said by other gentlemen in this company i knew that young lady my lord long before you did it was my deliberate purpose long ago to make her my wife when the opportunity arrived the time has come resumed lord chudleigh but not the man i say it was my fixed intention to marry miss pleydell i did not my lord form these resolutions lightly nor abandon them without sufficient reason it is still my resolution i say that you shall not stand between me and my future wife indeed but suppose miss pleydell refuses to give her consent to this arrangement surely such a resolve however laudable demands the consent of the other party miss pleydell will not refuse my hand when you have left her abandon a field my lord which never belonged to yourself tut tut said lord chudleigh this sir is idle talk you cannot seriously imagine i seriously imagine that if necessary i will make my way to that young lady over your lordship's body if you stand in my way lord chudleigh took off his hat and bowed low then sir the sooner you take the first step in the pursuance of your resolution the better i will bar your way upon the downs at any time you may appoint harry returned the obeisance i wait your lordship's convenience he said my convenience shall be yours mr temple for it is you who desire to run me through not i you have your own way it is late to night said harry now quite calm though with a hot flush upon his cheek your lordship would like to rest perhaps to morrow after breakfast while the ladies are at morning prayer oh the bloodthirsty wretch lord chudleigh bowed again that time mr temple will i dare say suit the convenience of my second the code of honour be it observed does not allow the exhibition of any emotion of horror remorse or repugnance when you arrange to commit that private murder which gentlemen call a duel lord chudleigh bowed once more and left his adversary he walked across the terrace to the card room where sir miles was alone with the scattered packs of cards when he came out he bowed a third time and walked slowly away i hope that in his own chamber he reflected on the wickedness of the appointment he had made and on its possible consequences sir miles threw away the cards and came out rubbing his eyes ods my life sir he said addressing harry temple who now that the mischief was done looked somewhat sheepish though dignified the few gentlemen who were left drew nearer anxious to lose nothing of what might happen english people of all ranks love above all things to watch a quarrel or a fight whatever be the weapons ods my life sir repeated sir miles this is a pretty kettle of fish here we have all spent a pleasant night dancing playing and making love every one happy even though some gentlemen did lose their mistresses or their money and here you spoil sport by quarrelling at the end of it what the devil sir does it concern you whether my lord talks gallantry with one young lady or another that sir miles allow me to tell you is my business if you are his lordship's second let us arrange accordingly if a principal let us fight afterwards no sir replied the baronet it is everybody's business it concerns the cheerfulness the security the happiness of all this honourable company what if i amuse myself and a young lady too by writing poems on her dainty fingers must i needs go out and measure swords with every young hot head who would fain be doing the same seconds and principals have we nothing to do but to fight duels mr temple i thought better things from a gentleman of your rank and family what any jackanapes lawyer any pert young haberdasher might think it fine thus to insult and challenge a harmless nobleman of great name and excellent qualities but for you mr temple you sir a gentleman of your county and of ancient and most honourable stock fie sir fie i think sir miles said harry who wished now to have the preliminaries settled without more ado that things having so far advanced these reproaches may be spared let us proceed to business a girl can choose i suppose sir miles went on without the interference or the objection of a man who is neither her father her guardian her brother nor her cousin why as for this young lady whose name i say it is not respectful to name in this business i myself sir i myself paid her attentions till she bade me go about my business what sir do you think i should have suffered any man to question my right to make a lady lackington where i choose and where i could she laughed in my face mighty pretty laughing lips she has and teeth as white as pearls and a roguish eye when she chooses for all she goes so grave did i then go snivelling in the dumps did i take it ill that she showed a liking for lord chudleigh who is worth ten of me and a dozen of you did i hang my chops and wipe my eyes did i therefore insult his lordship and call him out all this sir miles harry replied impatiently has nothing to do with the question which lies between lord chudleigh and myself what i argued for my own comfort when sweet kitty said me nay was this that the marriage condition hath many drawbacks as is abundantly evident from history and poetry while freedom hath many sweets that a man may tire of a beauty and a toast in a month but he never tired of liberty that children often come after matrimony and they are expensive that as for the lady's good looks why as many pretty women are in the sea as ever came out of it and as for my wounded feelings why what is it but so much vanity granted that she is the toast this year prithee who will be the toast next last year they tell me it was peggy baker and a monstrous pretty woman too though not to compare with kitty now her nose is out of joint who next some little miss now getting rapped over the knuckles in the nursery mr temple and she will be in her turn quite as fine a woman as we shall live to see that is to say as i shall live to see because you of course will be no more at eleven o'clock upon the downs you will get your quietus when my lord's sword has once made daylight through your fine waistcoat 'tis pity but yet what help mighty little looking after pretty women where you are going to mr temple i advise you to consider your earthly concerns before you go out well 'tis a shame it is a well set up man like you with a likely face and pretty fortune to throw all away because a woman says nay 'shall i wasting in despair die because a woman's fair' tilly vally a pretty reason why two tall fellows should stick swords into each other i have a great mind sir not to allow my principal to go out on such a provocation i can easily give him more sir miles said harry hotly or you either as soon as you have finished your sermon oh sir sir miles laughed and bowed pray do not think that i desire to fight on that or any other provocation we gentlemen of norfolk sometimes try conclusions with the cudgel before the rapier comes into play therefore sir having given you my mind on the matter and having nothing more to say at this moment you may as well refer me at once to your friend harry turned to the group of lookers on gentlemen he said an unhappy difference as some of you have witnessed has arisen between the lord chudleigh and myself may i request the good offices of one among you in this affair one of them an officer in the king's scarlet stepped forward and offered his services harry thanked him briefly told him where he lodged introduced him formally to sir miles and walked away a few minutes' whispered consultations between sir miles and this officer concluded the affair the principals were to fight on the downs at eleven o'clock when there are generally unless a match is going on but few people up there this arranged sir miles walked away to tell lord chudleigh and harry with his second left the terrace thus the affair as gentlemen call an engagement in which their own lives and the happiness of helpless women are concerned was quietly arranged on the well known laws of honour just as if it were nothing more than the purchase of a horse a carriage or a house we at home sleeping meanwhile without suspicion dreaming very likely of love and joy even when death was threatening those dearest to us sometimes when i think of this uncertain life how it is surrounded by nature with unknown dangers how thoughtless and wicked men may in a moment destroy all that most we love how in a moment the strongest fortune is over thrown how our plans may be frustrated how the houses of cards which we have thought so stable tumble down without a warning and all our happiness with them when i say i think of these things i wonder how any one can laugh and be merry save the insensate wretches whose whole thought is of their own enjoyment for the moment yet the lord our father is above all in whose hand is the ordering of the smallest thing the meanest life moreover he hath purposed that youth should be a time of joy and so hath wisely hidden away the sources of evil cicely crump was stirring betimes in the morning and before six was in the market buying the provisions for the day and as she passed the door of the assembly rooms she looked in to see the dipper a friend of hers who sat at the distribution of the water though but few of the visitors took it regularly this good woman phoebe game by name had kept the secret for more than an hour having heard it under promise of strictest secrecy from one of the late revellers when she took her place among the glasses at five o'clock in the morning she was a good woman and discreet according to her lights but this dreadful secret was too much for her and if she had not told it to cicely must have told it to some one else at sight of her visitor therefore discretion abandoned this good woman and she babbled all she knew yet not in a hurry but little by little as becomes a woman with such a piece of intelligence the parting of which is as the parting with power cicely she said shaking her forefinger in an awful and threatening way i have heard this very morning ah only an hour or so since news which would make your poor young lady jump out of her pretty shoes for fright i have i have goodness cried cicely oh phoebe whatever in the world is it i dare not tell she replied it is as much as my place is worth to tell we dippers are not like common folk we must have no ears to hear and no tongue to speak we must listen and make no sign the quality says what they like and they does what they like it isn't for a humble dipper to speak nor to tell nor to spoil sport even if it is murder oh tell me cried cicely why phoebe your tongue can run twenty to the dozen if you like and if i knew why there isn't a mouse in all epsom can be muter or a guinea pig dumber only you tell me thus appealed to mrs game proceeded as she had from the first intended to transfer her secret to cicely with many interjections reflections sighs prayers and injunctions to tell no one but to go home and pray on her bended knees that lord chudleigh's hand might be strengthened and his eye directed so that this meddlesome young gentleman might be run through in some vital part cicely received the intelligence with dismay the good girl had more of my confidence than most ladies give to maids but she was above the common run and quick of apprehension besides she loved me what use she asked bitterly for mr nash to prohibit the gentlemen from wearing their swords when they have got them at home ready for using when they want mr temple indeed to think that my young lady would look at him when my lord is about well go child said the dipper you and me being two poor women with little but our characters which are thank the lord good so far as we have got cannot meddle nor make in this pie i am glad i told you though i felt before you came as if the top of my head was being lifted off with the force of it like a loaf with the yeast oh the wickedness of gentlefolk cicely walked slowly back thinking what she had best do whether to keep the secret or to tell me finally she resolved on telling me accordingly she woke me up for i was still asleep and communicated the dreadful intelligence there could be no doubt of its truth sir miles she told me had expostulated with harry temple who would hear no reason they would meet to kill each other at eleven o'clock when the ladies were at prayers on the downs behind durdans i thanked her and told her to leave me while i dressed but not to awaken mrs pimpernel who would be the better for a long sleep after her late night while i thought over what was to be done first of all i was in a mighty great rage with harry the rage i was in prevented me from doing what i ought to have done viz had i been in my right mind i should have gone to him instantly and then and there i should have ordered him to withdraw from the wells should he refuse i would have gone to sir robert a justice of the peace and caused the duel to be prevented i could find no excuse for harry even supposing that his passion was so violent which is a thing one ought to be ashamed of rather than to make a boast of it was that any reason why my happiness was to be destroyed men i believe would like to carry off their wives as the romans carried off the sabine women and no marriage feast would be more acceptable to their barbarous hearts than the one in which these rude soldiers celebrated this enforced union cicely and i looked at each other it was seven o'clock the duel was to take place at eleven could i seek out lord chudleigh no his honour was concerned or sir miles but the honest baronet looked on a duel as a necessity of life which might happen at any time to a gentleman though he himself preferred a bout with cudgels presently cicely spoke i once heard she said a story child this is no time for telling stories let me tell it first miss kitty nay it is not a silly story a gentleman once had planned to carry off a great heiress what has that to do with lord chudleigh he does not want to carry me off the gentleman was a wicked man and an adventurer he only wanted the lady's money one of her friends a woman it was found out the plot she wanted to prevent it without bloodshed or murder or duelling which would have happened if it had been prevented by any stupid interference of clumsy men o cicely get on with the story she did prevent it and how do you think how cicely ran and shut the door which was ajar then she looked all about the room and under the bed it was a most dreadful wicked thing to do yet to save a friend or a lover i would even do it what was it cicely i must whisper quick give me my hood child she put it on and tied it with trembling fingers because we were really going to do a most desperate thing is the house on the road cicely cannot he go by another way no he cannot go by any other way say not a word cicely let not madam think or suspect anything on the road which leads from the town by a gentle ascent to the downs there stood on the left hand side going up a large square house in red brick surrounded by a high wall on which were iron spikes the door of the wall opened into a sort of small lodge and the great gates were strong high and also protected by iron spikes i had often observed this house but being full of my own thoughts and not a curious person always wanting to discover the business of others i had not inquired into the reason of these fortifications yet i knew that the house was the residence of a certain learned physician dr jonathan powlett by name who daily walked upon the terrace dressed in black with a great gold headed cane and an immense full periwig he had a room in one of the houses of the terrace in which he received his patients and he made it his business to accost every stranger on his arrival with the view of getting his custom thus he would after inquiring after the stranger's health branch off upon a dissertation on the merits of the epsom waters and an account of the various diseases with their symptoms so that timid men often fancied they had contracted these disorders and ran to the doctor in terror which the waters would cure mrs esther was pleased to converse with him and i believe spent several guineas in consultations on the state of her health now excellent i had never spoken to him except once when he saluted me with a finely pompous compliment about youth and beauty the twin stars of such a company as was gathered together at epsom yet he said while even the physician cannot arrest the first of these the second may be long preserved by yearly visits to this invigorating spot not forgetting consultations with scientific and medical men provided they are properly qualified and hold the license of the college of physicians without which a so called doctor is but a common apothecary chirurgeon or leech fit only to blister and to bleed i made my way to his house hoping to catch him before he sallied forth in the morning the place was as i have said hidden by high brick walls and the gate was guarded by a lodge in which after ringing a great bell i found a man of rough and strong appearance who asked me rudely what was my business i told him my business was with his master after a little demur he bade me wait in the lodge while he went away and presently returned with the doctor my dear young lady he cried i trust there is nothing wrong with that most estimable lady mrs pimpernel indeed doctor i replied i come on quite a different errand and my business is for your ear alone upon this he bade the fellow retire and we were left alone in the little room of the lodge then i exposed my business he looked very serious when he quite understood what i wanted him to do it is very dangerous he said i then told him how it might be so managed as that there should be no danger in it at all he thought for a little and then he laughed to himself but madam he said suppose i do this for you safely and snugly what reward am i to have for my trouble and risk what do you think the business is worth he looked curiously in my face as if wondering how much he could safely say then he replied i believe it is worth exactly twenty guineas i can spare no more than ten i replied well he said ten guineas is a trifle indeed for so great a risk and so great a service still if no more is to be had and to oblige so sweet a young lady here he held out a fat white hand the fingers of which were curled as if from long habit in clutching guineas i gave him five as an instalment promising him the other five when the job was done all being safely in train i returned home to breakfast but after breakfast i returned to the physician's house and sat down in the lodge so placed that i could see without being seen and looked down the road after the bell for morning prayers had stopped i began to expect my friends sure enough the first who came into sight were my lord and sir miles the former looking grave and earnest a little while after them came a gentleman whom i knew to be one of the company at epsom he was alone now this was the most fortunate accident because had the gentleman who was none other than harry's second accompanied his principal my plot had failed but fortunately as i learned afterwards they missed each other in the town and so set off alone this at the time i knew not being ignorant of the laws of the duello and last there came along harry himself walking quickly as if afraid of being late i gave a signal which had been agreed upon and as he approached the house the great gates were thrown open and two strapping tall fellows stepping quickly into the road caught poor harry the would be murderer by the arms ran a thick rope round him before he had time to cry out and dragged him into the gates so quickly so strongly and so resolutely that he had not the least chance of making any resistance indeed it was done in so workmanlike a fashion that it seemed as if the rogues had done the same thing dozens of times before heavens to think that a man brought up so virtuously as harry temple a young man of such excellent promise so great a scholar and one who had actually studied theology and attended the lectures of a lady margaret professor should under any circumstances of life abandon himself to language so wicked and a rage so overwhelming nothing ever surprised me so much as to hear that gentle scholar use such dreadful language as bad as any that i had ever heard in the fleet market caught up in this unexpected way with his arms tied to his sides carried by two stout ruffians harry had to be sure some excuse for wrath his wig had fallen to the ground his face was red and distorted by passion so that even i hardly knew him when doctor powlett came out of his house and slowly advanced to meet him ay ay ay he asked slowly wagging his head and stroking his long chin deliberately in the manner of a physician who considereth what best treatment to recommend so this is the unfortunate young gentleman is it ay he looks very far gone nothing less i fear than dementia acuta cum rabie violenta resolute treatment in such cases is the best kindness you will take him keepers to the blue room and chain him carefully your promptitude in making the capture shall be rewarded as for you sir he shook his forefinger at the unlucky harry as if he was a schoolmaster admonishing a boy as for you sir it is lucky indeed that you have been caught you were traced to this town where i suppose you arrived early this morning ha i have known madmen to be run through their vitals by some gentlemen whom they have accosted or smothered between mattresses a reprehensible custom because it deprives the physician of his dues or brained with a cudgel you are fortunate sir but have a care this house is remarkable for its kindness to the victims of mania but have a care here harry burst into a fit of imprecations most dreadful to listen to anybody said the doctor may swear in this house a good many do that often relieves a congested brain and does no harm to me and my attendants but disobedience or violence is punished by cold water baths by being held under the pump by bread and water and by other methods with which i hope you will not make yourself better acquainted now keepers for the truth is that the doctor kept a house for the reception of madmen and unhappy lunatics and i had persuaded him to kidnap harry by mistake in four and twenty hours i thought he would have time to repent it was sad however to see a man of breeding and learning so easily give way to profane swearing and it shows the necessity of praying against temptation women fortunately do not know how to swear it was i confess impossible to pity him why he was going up the hill and on to the downs with no other object than to kill my lover chapter xviii how harry got released he is now said dr powlett returning to the lodge where i awaited him safely chained up in a strait waistcoat a strong young gentleman indeed and took four of my fellows to reduce him almost a pity he went on thinking of the case from a professional point of view that so valiant a fellow is in his right mind doctor what may that mean nay i was but thinking a physician must needs consider these things that a county gentleman with so great an estate would be indeed a windfall in such an establishment as mine why doctor would you have all the world mad they are already he replied as mad as march hares all of them i would only have them in establishments with strait waistcoats on and an experienced and humane physician to reduce them by means of those measures which are never known to fail i hope i said seriously because i began to fear that some violence might have been used that my poor friend has been treated gently we never replied the doctor treat them otherwise than gently my fellows understand that this ahem unfortunate escaped sufferer from lunacy or dementia because i have not yet had time to diagnose his case with precision is to be treated with singular forbearance one or two cuffs on the head an admonition by means of a keeper's boot he hath doubtless received these things are absolutely necessary but no collar bones put out or ribs broken in the case of violent patients ribs as a rule do get broken and give trouble in the setting your friend young lady has all his bones whole no discipline so far has been administered beyond a few buckets of water which it was absolutely necessary to pour over his head out of common humanity and in order to calm the excessive rage into which the poor gentleman fell he is quite calm now and has neither been put under the pump nor in the tank i have expressly ordered that there is to be no cudgelling and i have promised my fellows half a guinea apiece here he looked at me with a meaning smile if they are gentle with him i have told them that there is a young lady interested in his welfare my keepers i assure you madam have rough work to do but they are the most tender hearted of men otherwise they would be sent packing and at the sight of half a guinea their hearts yearn with affection towards the patients i smiled and promised the half guineas on the liberation of the prisoner cuffs and kicks a few buckets of cold water a strait waistcoat my poor harry surely this would be enough to cure any man of his passion and what a fitting end to a journey commenced with the intention of killing and murdering your old playfellow's lover yet to be sure it was a wicked thing i had done and i resolved to lose no time as soon as there was no longer any fear of a duel in beginning to repent all this accomplished which was after all only a beginning i left the house and walked up the hill intending to find the three gentlemen waiting for their duel these meetings generally took place i knew on the way to the old well i left durdans on the right and struck across the turf to the left presently i saw before me a group of three gentlemen standing together and talking that is to say two were talking and one lord chudleigh was standing apart they saw me presently and i heard sir miles in his loud and hearty voice crying out gad so it is pretty kitty herself you look gentlemen i said as if you were expecting quite another person but pray sir miles why on the downs so early there is no race to day nor any bull baiting the card room is open and i believe the inns are not shut we are here he replied unblushingly to take the air it is bracing it is good for the complexion it expands the chest and opens the breathing pipes it is as good as a draught of the waters and as stimulating as a bottle of port indeed then i am surprised you do not use the fresh air oftener for surely it is cheaper than drinking wine in future he said i intend to do so but why these swords sir miles you know the rule of the wells they wanted sharpening he replied the air of the downs is so keen that it sets an edge on sword blades you looked fie gentlemen for mr temple to help sharpen the blades as a butcher sharpens his knife by putting steel to steel sir miles you are a wicked and bloodthirsty man he laughed and so did the officer lord chudleigh changed colour gentlemen i went on i have to tell you i have come here to tell you that an accident has happened to mr temple which will prevent his keeping the appointment made for him at this hour i am sure if he knew that i was coming here he would ask me to express his great regret at keeping you waiting now however you may all go home again and put off killing each other for another day they looked at each other astonished my lord i said i am sure you will let me ask you what injury my poor friend harry temple has done you that you desire to compass his death nay he replied i desire not to compass any man's death i am here against my will i have no quarrel with him what do you say sir miles i asked are you determined that blood should be spilt not i he replied but as the affair concerns the honour of two gentlemen i think with respect to so fair a lady that it had better be left in the hands of gentlemen but i said it concerns me too now partly because i have brought you the reason of mr temple's absence and partly because he is one of my oldest friends and a gentleman for whom i have a very great regard and methinks sir miles with submission because a woman cannot understand the laws of the duello or the scruples of what gentlemen call honour that honour which allows a man to drink and gamble but not to take a hasty word that if i can persuade lord chudleigh that mr temple does not desire the duel and is unfeignedly ashamed of himself and if i can assure mr temple that lord chudleigh would not be any the happier for killing mr temple why then this dreadful encounter need not take place and we may all go home again in peace upon this they looked at each other doubtfully and sir miles burst out laughing when sir miles laughed i thought it would all end well at once but then harry's second spoke up gravely and threatened to trouble the waters i represent mr temple in this affair i cannot allow my principal to leave the field without satisfaction we have been insulted we demand reparation to our honour we cannot be set aside in this unbecoming manner by a young lady pray sir i asked does your scarlet coat and your commission i have said he was an officer enjoin you to set folks by the ears and to promote that method of murder which men call duelling what advantage will it be to you provided these two gentlemen fight and kill each other why as for advantage none he said but who ever heard then sir as it will be of infinite advantage to many of their friends and a subject of great joy and thankfulness that they should not fight be pleased not to embroil matters further and indeed sir i am quite sure that you have breathed the bracing air of the downs quite long enough and had better leave us here and go back to the town you may else want me to fight in the place of mr temple that would be a fine way of getting reparation to your wounded honour at this he became very red in the face and spoke more about honour laws among gentlemen and fooling away his time among people who it seemed either did not know their own minds or contrived accidents to happen in the nick of time hark ye brother said sir miles upon this the young lady is right in her way because say what we will our men were going out on a fool's errand why in the devil's name should they fight what occasion has mr temple to quarrel with my lord if mr temple likes said his second shrugging his shoulders after all it is his business not mine if in the army a man pulls another man's nose why will you please to understand sir i broke in that mr temple is really delayed by an accident it happened to him on his way here and was entirely unforeseen by him and was one which he could neither prevent nor expect if a woman had any honour in your sense i would give you my word of honour that this is so under these circumstances the gallant officer said i do not see why we are waiting here mr temple will of course tell his own story in his own way and unless the fight takes place on the original quarrel why he may find another second such a lame ending i never experienced and that interposed sir miles who surely was the most good natured of men that reminds me my good sir that in this matter unless we would make bad worse we all of us had better make up our minds to tell no story at all but leave it to mr temple wherefore if it please you i will walk to the town in your company there to contradict any idle gossip we may hear and to lay upon the back of the rightful person either with cudgels or rapiers any calumny which may be attached to mr temple's name but no doubt he is strong enough to defend himself really sir miles said the officer with a sneer i wonder you do not fight for him yourself here is your principal lord chudleigh ready for you sir he is not my friend but the friend of miss pleydell he is as i believe you or any other person who may quarrel with him would find perfectly well able to fight his own battles meantime i am ready to fight my own as is already pretty well known with that they both walked off the field not together but near each other the officer in a great huff and sir miles rolling along beside him big and good tempered yet like a bull dog an ugly dog to tackle lord chudleigh and i were left alone upon the downs kitty he cried what does this mean that there is to be no fighting between you and harry temple that is what it means my lord oh the wickedness of men but where is he what is the accident what does your presence mean did he send you i laughed but could not tell him then i reflected that the errand on which he had come was no laughing matter and i became grave again my lord i said is it well to tell a girl one day that you love her and the next to come out to fight with swords about a trifle do you think nothing of a broken heart my dear he replied it was forced upon me believe me a man must fight if he is insulted openly there is no help for it till customs change oh i cried can that man be in his senses who hopes to win a woman's heart by insulting and trying to kill her her lover yes kitty he caught my hand and kissed it your lover your most unhappy lover who can do no more than say he loves you and yet can never hope to marry you how did i dare to open my heart to you my dear with such a shameful story to tell my lord i said promise me if you sincerely love me which i cannot doubt not to fight with this hot headed young man i promise he replied to do all that a man of honour may in order to avoid a duel with him then my lord i promise once more in return if you would care to have such a promise from so poor a creature as myself kitty divine angel i swear even though you never wed me to remain single for your sake and even should you change your mind and bestow your affections upon another woman and scorn and loathe me never to think upon another man he seized me in his arms though we were on the open downs only there was not a soul within sight so far as i could see around and kissed me on the cheeks and lips my love he murmured my sweet and gracious lady next i had to consider what best to do about my prisoner i begged my lord to go home through the durdans while i returned by the road on the way i resolved to liberate harry at once but to make conditions with him i therefore returned to the doctor's and asked that i might be allowed to see the prisoner dr powlett was at first very unwilling he pointed out with some justice that there had not as yet been time enough to allow of a colourable pretence at discovering the supposed mistake a few days say a fortnight should elapse during which the search might be supposed to be a making in that interval harry was to sit chained in his cell with a strait waistcoat on and believe me said this kind physician he will learn from his imprisonment to admire the many kindnesses and great humanity shown to unhappy persons who are afflicted with the loss of their wits besides this he will have an opportunity of discovering for what moderate charges such persons are received entertained and treated with the highest medical skill at epsom by the learned physician jonathan powlett medicinae doctor he will swallow my pills drink my potions which are sovereign in all diseases of the brain be nourished on my gruel compounded scientifically with the epsom water will be tenderly handled by my keepers and all for the low charge of four guineas a week paid in advance including servants and he will when cured if providence assist come out twice as mad as he went in no doctor that if you please was not what i intended the mischief is averted for the present and if you will conduct me to your prisoner i think i can manage to avert it altogether well finding that there was nothing more to be got out of the case i am quite sure that he was ready to treat poor harry as really mad and to keep him there as long as any money could be got out of him the doctor gave way and led me to the room in which lay prisoner harry it was a room apart from the great common rooms in which idiots and imbecile persons are chained at regular intervals to the wall never leaving their places night or day until they die i was thus spared the pain of seeing what i am told is one of the most truly awful and terrifying spectacles in the world the doctor who measured his kindness by the guineas which he could extract from his patients' friends kept certain private chambers where if the poor creatures were chained they were not exposed to the sights and sounds of the common rooms in one of these therefore he had bestowed harry let me i said go in first and speak with him do you come presently i think if i had known beforehand what they were going to do i might have relented but no anything was better than that those two men should stand sword in hand face to face trying to kill each other for the sake of an unworthy girl yet the poor lad whom i had ever loved like a brother looked in piteous case for they had put the strait waistcoat over him which pinned his arms to his sides and a chain about his waist which was fastened to the wall behind him his wig was lying on the floor he seemed wet through which was the natural effect of those savage keepers' buckets his face wore a look of rage and despair sad to behold his eyes glared like the eyes of a bull at a baiting you here kitty he cried you what is the meaning of you in this house harry there has been it seems a very terrible blunder committed by dr powlett's servants they were told you were a certain escaped madman and they arrested you in the discharge of their duty it is most fortunate that the fact has been brought to my ears because i could hasten then quick kitty quick he cried go call the doctor and set me free it may not yet be too late quick kitty they are waiting for me he forgot i suppose what this waiting might mean to me who are waiting harry he did not reply what were you going to do on the downs this morning harry when they made a prisoner of you that is nothing to do with you he replied go call the rascally doctor whose ribs i will break and his men whom i will murder for this job nothing to do with me harry are you quite sure you look kitty as if you knew did lord chud no he would not did sir miles go sneaking to you with the news gad i feel inclined to try conclusions with the norfolk baronet with his cudgel about which he makes such a coil never mind who told me i know the whole wicked disgraceful murderous story disgraceful you talk like a woman shall a man sit down idly and see his wife snatched out of his arms what wife o harry you have gone mad about this business cannot you understand that i was never engaged to marry you that i never thought of such a thing i could never have been your wife whether there was any rival or no and did you think that you would make me think the more kindly of you should you kill the man who as you foolishly think had supplanted you or was it out of revenge and in the hope of making me miserable that you designed to fight this duel he was silent at this when a man is in a strait waistcoat and chained to a wall it is difficult to look dignified but harry's look of shame and confusion under the circumstances of having no arms was truly pitiful you can talk about that afterwards he said doggedly go call the scoundrel doctor presently i want to tell you first what i think about it was it kind to the woman you pretended to love to bring upon her the risk of this great unhappiness remember harry i told you all i told you what i could not have told even to nancy in the hope of breaking you of this mad passion i trusted that you were good and true of heart and this is the return it is done now he replied gloomily do not reproach me kitty let lord chudleigh run me through the body and so an end now fetch the doctor fellow and his men that would have been indeed an end i said but harry i have done better than that for you i have stayed the duel altogether you will not have to fight with that i told him how i had gone to the downs and what i had said to the gentlemen only be sure that i left out what passed in the road between his lordship and myself well master harry flew into a mighty rage upon hearing this and being still in the strait waistcoat and in chains his wrath was increased because he could not move he talked wildly about his injured honour swore that he would go and offer lord chudleigh first and sir miles later such an open and public affront as must be washed out with the blood of one declared that i might have destroyed his reputation for courage for good but that he was resolved the world should judge to the contrary as for the company at the wells he would challenge every man at epsom if necessary if he should dare to asperse his bravery more he said to the same effect but i interrupted him first i promised to go with him upon the terrace there to meet the people and give him such countenance as a woman could next i promised him that lord chudleigh should meet him in a friendly spirit that sir miles should be the first to proclaim mr temple's courage i assured him that he might be quite certain of finding many other opportunities of proving his valiancy should he continue in his present bloodthirsty frame of mind i congratulated him on his christian readiness to throw away a life which had hitherto been surrounded by so many blessings lastly i advised him to consider how far his present attitude and sentiments corresponded with the divine philosophy of the ancients whom he had once been so fond of quoting he refused to make any promise whatever then i bade him remember first where he was second under what circumstances he came there third that he was surrounded by raving madmen chained to the wall as one of them put in a strait waistcoat like one of them and about to be reduced to a diet of bread and water that no one knew where he was except myself and dr powlett that neither of us would tell anything about him and that in point of fact unless he promised what i asked he might remain where he was until all danger was past and that harry may be i know not when for be very well assured that as i have obtained from lord chudleigh a promise to seek no quarrel with you i will not let you go from this place until i am assured that you will seek no quarrel with him either on my account or under any other pretext whatever you are in great misery which you richly deserve for your wicked and murderous design you are wet and hungry if i go away without your promise you will continue in greater misery until i return bethink thee harry still he was obdurate strange that a man will face almost anything rather than possible ridicule what after long persuasion made him give way was a plain threat that if he would not promise what i required i would release him at once but tell his story to all the town so that for very ridicule's sake it would be impossible for the duel to take place it will tell very prettily harry i said nancy will dress it up for me and will relate it in her best and liveliest way how you tried to get a little country girl of sixteen to engage herself to you how when you found her a year later turned into a lady you thought that you could terrify her into accepting your proposals on the plea that she had already promised how you turned sulky how you quarrelled with lord chudleigh and made him accept your duel how you were taken prisoner by mistake and kicked cuffed i was not kicked he cried you were dr powlett's patients are always kicked then you had buckets of cold water thrown over you you were put into a strait waistcoat and chained to the wall while i came and asked you whether you preferred remaining in the madhouse or promising to behave like an honourable gentleman and abstain from insulting persons who have done no harm to you or yours i believe he said that it is none other than yourself who has had me captured and treated in this manner femina furens a mere mistake harry i replied of this good physician's zealous servants why it might have happened in any such establishment but for me to order it oh impossible though when one comes to think of it there are few things a woman femina furens the english of which master harry i know would not do to save two friends from hacking and slashing each other upon this he gave way i must he said get away from this place with what speed i may even if i have to pink half the men in epsom to prove i am no coward kitty call the doctor i believe mad nymph thou hast a devil nay harry all this was planned but to lay the devil believe me but promise first well then it is a hard pill to swallow kitty promise i promise not to pick any quarrel or to revive any old quarrel with lord chudleigh or sir miles lackington he repeated the words after me and to remain good friends with kitty pleydell and all who are her friends and followers he repeated these words as well though with some appearance of swallowing distasteful food i cannot shake hands with you harry because poor boy your hands are hidden away beneath that strait waistcoat but i know you to be an honourable gentleman as becomes a man of your birth and so great a scholar and i accept your word wherefore my dear old friend and schoolfellow seeing that there is to be no more pretence of love between us but only of friendship and good wishes i will call dr powlett that good man was waiting in the corridor or passage while harry and i held this long conversation he came as soon as i called him sir said i as soon as he came in i noticed that he looked anxiously behind him to see that his four varlets were at hand ready to defend him if necessary sir here is a most grievous mischance indeed for this gentleman is no other than mr harry temple justice of the peace bachelor of arts of the university of cambridge fellow commoner of his college member of the honourable society of lincoln's inn and a country gentleman with a great estate of east kent he is in truth doctor no more mad than you or i or any one else in the world the doctor affected the greatest surprise and indignation first he expressed his inability to believe my statement although it pained him deeply to differ from a lady then he called upon one of his men to bring him the hue and cry and read out a description of a runaway madman which so perfectly answered the appearance of harry that it would deceive any one except myself because i was sure he had himself written it after the capture he then asked me solemnly and gravely if i did not think having heard the description that the men were justified in their action i replied that the paper so exactly tallied with harry's appearance that such a mistake was most easy to account for and must at once when explained command forgiveness nevertheless harry's face looked far from forgiving varlets said dr powlett who in some respects reminded me of a certain doctor of divinity because his voice was deep and his manner stately go instantly every man jack upon his bended knees and ask the pardon of mr temple for an offence committed by pure inadvertence and excess of honourable zeal in the extirpation i mean the comfortable and kindly confinement of the lunatic insane and persons demented they all four fell upon their knees and asked forgiveness harry replied briefly that as for pardoning them he would wait until he was free when he would break all their ribs and wring their necks sir said the doctor you are doubtless in the right and are naturally for the moment annoyed at this little misadventure at which you will laugh when you consider it at leisure it will perhaps be of use to you as showing you on what humane kindly and gentle a system such establishments as ours are conducted as regards the pardon which you will extend to these honest fellows time is no object to them they would as soon receive their pardon to morrow or a week hence or a year or twenty years hence as to day because their consciences are at rest having done their duty therefore good sir they will wait to release you until you are ready with their pardon harry after thinking for a few moments over this statement said that so far as he was concerned the four men might go to the devil and that he pardoned them there remains only said the doctor one person who infinitely regrets the temporary annoyance your honour has been subjected to it is myself i have to ask of you for the sake of my establishment and my reputation two or three conditions the first of them is your forgiveness without which i feel that my self respect as a true christian and man of science would suffer the second absolute secrecy as regards these proceedings a knowledge of which might be prejudicial to me and the third here he hesitated and glanced sideways at me the third is of course he plucked up courage and spoke confidently a reimbursement of the expenses i have been put to as for instance here he drew out a long roll and read from it services of four men in watching for the escaped lunatic for five hours at five shillings an hour for each man five pounds to the capture of the same being done in expeditious and workmanlike fashion without confusion scandal cracking of crowns or breaking of ribs two guineas to bringing him in and receiving many cuffs blows kicks c on the way three guineas to use of private room for one month at one guinea a week we never let our private and comfortable chambers for less than one month four guineas to wear and tear of bucket strait waistcoat and chain used in confining and bringing to reason the prisoner two guineas to board and lodging of the patient for one month at two guineas a week we never receive a patient for less than one month eight guineas to attendants' fees for the same time two guineas for entrance and three guineas for departure to my own professional attendance at two guineas a week i never undertake a case for less than one month certain eight guineas the total good sir i find to amount to a mere trifle of thirty eight pounds twelve shillings heavens did one ever hear of such an extortionate charge and all for two hours in a strait waistcoat harry stormed and swore but the most he could get was a reduction of the bill by which certain items including the three guineas for giving and receiving kicks and cuffs and the two guineas for wear and tear of the bucket which had been emptied over him were to be remitted finally he accepted the conditions with the promise to pay thirty guineas in full discharge and really i think that dr powlett had done a good morning's work having taken ten guineas out of me and thirty out of harry but then as he said it was a delicate and dangerous business and might in less skilful hands meaning perhaps mine perhaps his own have led to very awkward results the terrace was full of people for it was now half past twelve as harry and i made our way slowly under the trees they parted for us left and right staring at us as we passed them with curious eyes for the rumour had spread abroad that there was to have been a duel that morning between lord chudleigh and mr temple and that it was stopped no one knew how by some accident which prevented mr temple from keeping his appointment now at the other end of the terrace we met lord chudleigh himself who after saluting me held out his hand before all the world to harry who took it with a bow and a blush there was a great sigh of disappointment no duel then would be fought at all and the two gentlemen who were to have fought it were shaking hands like ordinary mortals and the lady for whom they were going to fight was walking between them and all three were smiling and talking together like excellent friends thus then did i heal up the quarrel between harry temple and my lord it would have grieved me sore had poor harry almost my brother been wounded or killed but what would have been my lot had my lover fallen three suitors had i rejected in a month and a lover had i gained who was also though this i never ventured to confess my husband but there was one man whom i had forgotten quite and he was destined to be the cause of the greatest trouble of all who would have believed that will levett would have dared to call himself my accepted lover who would have believed that this sot this stable and kennel haunter would have remembered me for a whole year and would have come to epsom in the full confidence that he was coming to claim a bride chapter xix how will levett was disappointed thus was harry temple at last pacified and brought to reason in the course of a short time he was so far recovered from his passion as to declare his love for another woman whom he married this shows how fickle and fleeting are the affections of most men compared with those of women for i am truly of opinion that no woman can love more than one man in her life while a man appears capable of loving as many as he pleases all at once or in turn as the fancy seizes him could solomon have loved in very truth the whole seven hundred when i was no longer harassed by harry's gloomy face and jealous reproaches i thought that the time was come when i ought to consider how i should impart to my lord a knowledge of the truth and i said to myself day after day to morrow morning i will do it and in the morning i said nay but in the evening and sometimes i thought to write it and sometimes to tell it him by word of mouth yet the days passed and i did not tell him being a coward and rejoicing in the sunshine of his love and kindness which i could not bear to lose or put in any danger and now you shall hear how this delay was the cause of a most dreadful accident which had well nigh ruined and lost us altogether i could not but remember when harry temple reproached me with falsehood and faithlessness that will levett had made use of nearly the same words making allowance for will's rusticity the suspicion did certainly cross my mind more than once that will may have meant though i understood him not the same thing as harry and i remembered how he pulled a sixpence out of his pocket and gave me the half which i threw upon the table unheeding though every girl knows that a broken sixpence is a pledge of betrothal but i was in such great trouble and anxiety that i thought nothing of it and remembered nothing for long afterwards yet if harry came to claim a supposed promise at my hands why should not will which would be a thing much worse to meet because harry was now amenable to reason and by means of the strait waistcoat and bucket of cold water with a little talk i had persuaded him to adopt a wiser course but no reason ever availed anything with will save the reason of desire or the opposition of superior force as a boy he took everything he wanted unless he could be prevented by a hearty flogging and he bullied every other boy save those who could by superior strength compel him to behave properly i have already shown how he treated us when we were children and when we had grown up to be great girls so that with this suspicion and remembering will's dreadful temper and his masterfulness i felt uneasy indeed when nancy told me that her brother was coming to epsom we shall be horribly ashamed of him she said laughing though vexed indeed i doubt if we shall be able to show our faces on the terrace after will has been here a day or two because my dear he will thrash the men servants kiss the girls insult the company some of whom will certainly run him through the body while some he will beat with his cudgel get drunk in the taverns and run an indian muck through the dance at the assembly rooms i have told my father that the best thing for him to do is to pretend that will is no relation of ours at all only a rustic from our parish bearing the same name or perhaps we might go on a visit to london for a fortnight so as to get out of his way and that i think would be the best kitty think of will marching up and down the terrace a dozen dogs after him his wig uncombed his hunting coat stained with mud halloing and bawling as he goes carrying an enormous club like hercules he certainly is very much like hercules his mouth full of countrified oaths however he does not like fine folks and will not often show among us and while we are dancing in the rooms he will be sitting at the door of a tavern mostly smoking a pipe of tobacco and taking a mug of october with any who will sit beside him and hear his tales of badgers ferrets and dogs well fortunately no one can deny the good blood of the levetts which will we hope come out again in will's children and my father is a baronet of james the first's creation otherwise it would go hard with our gentility when do you expect him to come he sends word that he may come to night or to morrow bringing with him a horse which he proposes to match upon the downs with any horse at epsom for thirty guineas a side one match has been already fixed and will be run the next day provided both horses are fresh i hope will will not cheat as he was accused of doing at maidstone i suppose we shall all have to go to the downs to see why do men like horse racing i wonder crack goes the whip the horses rush past the people shout the race is over give me enjoyment which lasts a little longer such as a good country dance or a few words with peggy baker on the terrace does will know that i am here i asked i suppose not she replied why my dear how is will to know anything my father laid out large sums upon his education yet the end of all is that he never reads anything not even books on farriery as for letters he is well known not to read those which my mother sometimes sends him and as for sending any himself i believe he has forgotten the art of writing he does everything by word of mouth like the savages perhaps he remembers how to read because he cannot forget his sufferings over the criss cross row and horn book will kitty is an early briton he should be dressed in wool and painted with woad he lives by preference in a stable or a kennel he ought to have the body and tail and legs of a horse then he could stay in the stable altogether and be happy perhaps i thought he would not know me again but in this i was deceived as shall be presently shown well then knowing that nancy would help me in this possible trouble i told her exactly what happened between will and myself just as i had told her about harry and asked her advice it might be that will had clean forgotten his words or it might be that he had changed his mind he might have fallen in love with some girl of the village or he might find me changed and no longer care for pressing his suit nancy looked grave my brother will she said is as obstinate as he is pig headed i am afraid he will expect you to fulfil the engagement which he may think he has made never mind my dear do not think of it to distress yourself if he is obstinate so are you he cannot marry you against your will he came the next morning riding into town followed by two servants one of whom led the famous horse which was to ride the race there whispered nancy is my brother will we were standing in the church porch after morning prayers when he came clattering down the street he was really a handsome man for those who like a man to be like hercules for strength to have full rosy cheeks which later in life become fat and purple a resolute eye and a strong straight chin which means obstinacy oh how strong he is said nancy looking after him he could crush together half a dozen of our beaux and fribbles between his fingers and break all their ribs with a single flourish of his cudgel well will she added as her brother rode out of sight we shall meet at dinner i dare say do you remember kitty how he would tease and torment us and make us cry there ought to be no brothers and sisters at all the girls should grow up in one house and the boys in another they should never meet till they are old enough to be lovers and never be together when they are too old to be lovers fancy the stupidity of philosophers in putting men and women under the same name and calling us all humanity or mankind as their impudent way is of putting it what have they in common man drinks and gambles and fights woman sits at home and loves peace and moderation man wastes woman saves man loves to admire we love to be admired what single quality have we in common except a desire to be amiable and seem pleasing to the other sex very likely i replied thinking of something else no doubt he has long since forgotten the sixpence no doubt he thinks no more of me or the sixpence either i saw nothing of him that day because he had so much to do with his stable and so much to attend to in the matter of his race that he did not appear upon the terrace or at the assembly room harry temple shrugged his shoulders when i asked him if he had seen will i saw him he said engaged in his usual occupations he had just cudgelled a stable boy was swearing at a groom rubbing down his racehorse with his own hands and superintending the preparation of a warm mash for his hack he seems perfectly happy it was agreed in spite of my fears that we should make a party to see this race the next morning nowadays it is no longer the mode to seek health at epsom wells and on banstead downs the votaries of fashion go to bath and tunbridge the old wells are deserted i hear that the assembly rooms have fallen into decay and there are no longer the monday public breakfast the card table the music the dancing which made the place a little heaven for the young in those times when i myself was young but in one respect epsom has grown more frequented and more renowned every year on epsom downs when racing does begin large companies from every part come in the spring races were in april and the summer races in june but there was a constant racing all the year round with the horses of country gentlemen they would bring them to make matches with all comers at such stakes as they could afford to venture on the horses and in the morning the company would crowd upon the downs in goodly numbers to bet upon the race and shout to the winner sometimes ladies would go too not out of any love for the sport or interest in horses but to please their lovers a desire which is the cause of many a pretty maid's sudden liking for some manly sport i have known them even show an interest in such rough sports as badger drawing and otter hunting they have been seen to ride after hounds in the midst of the hallos and horns of the hunters they have even gone with the gentlemen on shooting parties thus there were plenty of girls at epsom ready to please their gallants by standing about on the downs where the wind plays havoc with powder and paint and destroys irretrievably the fabric of a head while the panting horses were spurred over the long course by the jockeys and the backers cried and shouted lord chudleigh took little joy in this kind of sport which perhaps is a reason why i also disliked the sight nancy also as well as myself cared but little to see this famous epsom sport nor indeed did any of the ladies who formed part of our more intimate company but on this occasion as will was to run a three year old of his own training and as he was going to ride the horse himself and had staked thirty guineas beside bets upon the event it was judged a duty owed to him by the family that all should go mrs esther went out of respect to lady levett mr stallabras because he remembered how pindar had sung of the olympian games and was suddenly fired with the desire of writing a pindaric ode upon the epsom contests now it behoves a poet who sings of a horse race first to witness one therefore he came to see how it would lend itself to modern metaphor sir miles came because he could get the chance of a few bets upon the race and because when there were no cards to the fore he liked he said to hear me talk harry temple came grumbling and protesting that for men of learning and fashion nothing was more barbarous and tedious than this sport could we have had chariot racing with athletic games after the manner of the ancients he would have been pleased as it was he hoped that will would win but feared that a clown and his money were soon parted with other remarks equally good natured the race was to be run at half past eleven we had chairs for such as preferred being carried but the younger ladies walked we made a gallant procession as we came upon the course all the ladies wearing will's colours which were red and blue they had railed off a piece of ground where the better sort could stand without being molested by the crowd which always congregates when a great race is to be run indeed on this occasion it seemed as if all the idle fellows for twenty miles round had gathered together on the downs with one consent and with them half the rustics of the villages the tradesmen and workmen of epsom leatherhead and dorking and the greater part of the company at the wells there were gipsies to tell our fortunes or steal our poultry but i for one had had enough already of fortune telling from the tent of the pretended wizard of the masquerade there were italians leading a bear there were a couple of rough men with a bull which was presently to be baited a canvas enclosure was run up on poles within which the cornish giant would wrestle all comers at sixpence a throw another where a prize fight would be held admittance one shilling with twopence each for the defeated man a puppet play was shown for a penny for twopence you might see a rare piece of art the subject of which i know not and in wax the histories of fair rosamond and susanna other amusements there were i at first took all in honour of will and his race but presently learned that a fair had been held at leatherhead the day before and that these people hearing of what was forward came over to get what could be picked up and as one fool makes many the knowledge of their coming with the race for an excuse brought out all the country people mouth agape as is their wont the horses presently rode out of the paddock a place where they weigh dress put on the saddles and adjust the preliminaries will in his cap pulled over his ears like a nightcap because a jockey wears no wig and in silk jacket striped with blue and red riding as if he was part of the animal he sat looked in his true place ever after i have thought of the gallant show he made while with left hand holding the whip he bridled the beautiful creature which but for his control would have been bounding and galloping over the plain but they explained to us that racehorses know when racing is meant and behave accordingly save that they cannot always be refrained from starting before the time will's rival and competitor whose name i forget but i had never seen him before was a man of slighter figure who rode equally well but did not at the same time appear to such advantage on horseback lord chudleigh explained to us that while will rode naturally sitting his horse as if he understood what the creature wished to do and where he wanted to go the other man sat him by rule of thumb as if the horse was to understand his master and not the master his horse i have ridden a great deal since then and i know now the justice of my lord's remarks though i own that this perfect understanding between horse and rider is not commonly found and for my own part i remember but one horse three parts arabian with which i ever arrived at a complete understanding even with him the understanding was onesided and ended in his always going whithersoever he pleased the adversary's colours were white and green pretty colours though bad for the complexion of women so that i was glad will's were suited to the roses of our cheeks they began by riding up and down for a quarter of an hour will looking mighty important stroking his horse patting his neck talking to him checking him when he broke into a canter or a gallop the other man he in white and green had trouble to keep his horse from fairly bolting with him which he did for a little distance more than once then the starters took their places and the judge his in front of the winning post and the horses started white and green led for a quarter of a mile but will was close behind it was pretty to see the eagerness of the horses how they pressed forward with straining necks will is holding back cried harry with flashing eyes wait till they are over the hill i feel like pindar cried mr stallabras would that mr levett was hiero of syracuse o will exclaimed nancy as if he could hear spur up your horse if you lose the race i will never forgive you we all stood with parted lips and beating hearts yes we understood the joy of horse racing the uncertainty of the struggle the ambition of the noble creatures the eagerness of the riders their skill their coolness the shouts of the people ah the race is over just before the finish say two hundred yards the other side of the winning post will rose in his saddle plied whip and cried to his horse it answered with a rush as if struck by a sudden determination to be first the other horse a little tired perhaps bounded onward as well but will took the lead and kept it in a moment the race was finished and will rode gallantly past us ahead by a whole length amid the cheers and applause of the people when the race was finished the visitors ran backward and forwards congratulating or condoling with each other many a long face was pulled as the bets were paid many a jolly face broadened and became more jolly as the money went into pocket and then i saw what is meant by the old saying about money made over the devil's back for those who lost lost outright which cannot be denied but those who won immediately took their friends to the booths where beer and wine and rum were sold and straightway got rid of a portion of their winnings no doubt the rest went in the course of the day in debauchery so that the money won upon the race benefited no one except the people who sold drink and they to my mind are the last persons whom one would wish to benefit considering what a dreadful thing in this country is the curse of drink if will looked a gallant rider on horseback he cut but a sorry figure among the gentlemen when he came forth from the paddock having taken off his jacket and put on again his wig coat and waistcoat for he walked heavily rolling in his gait as a ploughboy not a sailor and his clothes were muddy and disordered while his wig was awry lady levett beckoned to him and he came towards us sheepishly bold as is the way with rustic gentlemen so will shouted his father heartily thou hast won the match well rode my boy well rode cried all well rode he received our congratulations with a grin of satisfaction saluting the company with a grin and his knuckles to his forehead like a jockey on recovering he examined us all leisurely ay he said there you are harry talking to the women about books and poetry and stuff what good is that when a race is on might as well have stayed at cambridge well nancy oh i warrant you so fine as no one in the country would know you fine feathers make fine birds and here he saw me and stared hard with his mouth open gad so it's kitty hoop hollo upon this he put both hands to his mouth and raised such a shout that we all stopped our ears and the dogs barked and ran about furiously as if in search of a fox found again kitty i am right glad to see thee did i ride well were you proud to see me coming in by a neck thinks i 'i don't care who's looking on but i'll show them will levett knows how to ride' if i'd known it was you i would have landed the stakes by three clear lengths i would let me look at thee kitty now gentlemen by your leave he shoved aside lord chudleigh and harry and pushed between them let me look at thee well ay more fine feathers but here he swore great oaths there never was anything beneath them but the finest of birds ever hatched thank you will for the compliment i began why if any one should compliment you kitty who but i i thought of the broken sixpence and trembled a most pretty speech indeed said peggy baker another of miss pleydell's swains i suppose my brother said nancy has been kitty's swain since he was old enough to walk that is about the time when kitty was born he is as old a swain as mr temple here i don't know naught about swains said will but i'm kitty's sweetheart and if any man says nay to that why let him step to the front and we'll have that business settled on the grass and no time wasted brother cried nancy greatly incensed by a remark of such low breeding remember that you are here among gentlemen who do not fight with cudgels and fists for the favours of ladies nay dear miss levett said peggy laughing i find mr william vastly amusing no doubt we might have a contest a tournament after the manner of the ancients with miss pleydell as the queen of beauty to give her favours to the conquering knight i believe we can often witness a battle with swords and pistols if we get up early enough in hyde park but a duel with fists and cudgels would be much more entertaining thank you miss said will i should like to see the man who would stand up against me i think lord chudleigh interposed that as no one is likely to gratify this gentleman's strange invitation we may return to the town miss pleydell we wait your orders will was about to say something rude when his sister seized him by the arm and whispered in his ear o lord a lord he cried i beg your lordship's pardon there that is just like you nancy not to tell me at the beginning well kitty i am going to look after the horse then i will come to see thee your admirer is a bucolic of an order not often found among the sons of such country gentlemen as sir robert levett said lord chudleigh presently he is addicted to horses and dogs and he seems to consider that he may claim or show some sort of equal attachment to me i answered then i told him the story of the broken sixpence and how i became engaged without knowing it to both harry temple and will levett on the same day my lord laughed and then became grave i do not wonder he said that all classes of men have fallen in love with the sweetest and most charming of her sex that does not surprise me still though we have disposed of mr temple who is i am bound to say a gentleman open to reason there may be more trouble with this headstrong country lad who is evidently in sober earnest as i saw from his eyes what shall we do kitty my lord i whispered let me advise for your safety withdraw yourself for a while from epsom give up durdans and go to london i could not bear to see you embroiled with this rude and boisterous clown oh how could such a woman as lady levett have such a son leave me to deal with him as best i can but he laughed at this to be sure fear had no part in the composition of this noble this incomparable man should i run away because a rustic says he loves my kitty but then his forehead clouded again yet alas for my folly and my crime i may not call her my kitty oh yes my lord call me always thine indeed i am all thine own if only i could think myself worthy we were walking together the others a little distance behind us and he could do no more than touch my fingers with his own alas the very touch of his fingers caused a delightful tremor to run through my veins so helplessly so deeply was i in love with him thus we walked not hand in hand yet from time to time our hands met and thus we talked not as betrothed lovers yet as lovers thus my lord spoke to me confiding to me his most secret affairs his projects and his ambitions as no man can tell them save to a woman he loves truly it was a sweet and delicious time i fondly turn to it now after so many years not heaven knows with regret any more than september rich in golden harvest and laden orchards regrets the sweet and tender april when all the gardens were white and pink with the blossoms of plum and pear and apple and the fields were green with the springing barley oats and wheat yet a dear delightful time only spoiled by that skeleton in the cupboard that consciousness that the only person who stood between my lord and his happiness was the woman he loved heard man ever so strange so pitiful a case at the foot of the hill lord chudleigh left us and turned in the direction of durdans where he remained all that day coming not to the assembly in the evening mrs esther and i went home together to dinner and i know not who was the better pleased with the sport and the gaiety of the morning my kind madam or cicely the maid who had been upon the downs and had her fortune told by the gipsies and it was a good one but my dear said mrs esther it is strange indeed that so loutish and countrified a bumpkin should be the son of parents so well bred as sir robert and lady levett yet i said the loutish bumpkin would have me marry him dear lady would you wish your kitty to be the wife of a man who loves the stable first the kennel next and his wife after his horses and his dogs after dinner as i expected will levett called in person he had been drinking strong ale with his dinner and his speech was thick your servant madam he said to mrs esther i want speech if i may have it with miss kitty alone by herself for all she sits with her finger in her mouth yonder as if she was not jumping with joy to see me again sir i cried oh i know your ways and tricks no use pretending with me yet i like them to be skittish it is their nature to for all your fine frocks you're none of you any better than molly the blacksmith's girl or sukey at the mill never mind my girl be as fresh and frolic as you please i like you the better for it before we are married kitty dear cried mrs esther in alarm what does this gentleman mean i do not know dear madam pray will if you can explain what you mean explain explain why here he swore again but i will not write down his profane and wicked language suffice it to say that he called heaven and earth to witness his astonishment why you mean to look me in the face and tell me you don't know we are old friends will i said and i should like for nancy's sake and because lady levett has been almost a mother to me out of her extreme kindness that we should remain friends but when a gentleman salutes me before a company of gentlemen and ladies as his sweetheart when he talks of fighting other gentlemen like a rustic on a village green wouldst have me fight with swords and likely as not get killed then he asked when he assumes these rights over me i can ask i think for an explanation certainly said mrs esther we are grieved sir to have even a moment's disagreement with the son of so honourable a gentleman and so gracious a lady as your respected father and worthy mother but you will acknowledge that your behaviour on the downs was startling to a young woman of such strict propriety as my dear kitty he looked from one to the other as if in a dream then he put his hand into his pocket and dragged out the half sixpence what's that he asked me furiously a broken sixpence will i replied where is the other half perhaps where it was left on the table in the parlour of the vicarage what he cried do you mean to say that you didn't break the sixpence with me do you mean to say will that i did as for you breaking it i do not deny that i remember that you snapped it between your fingers without asking me anything about it but to say that i broke it or assented to your breaking it or carried away the other half fie will fie this wench he said is enough to drive a man mad yet for all your fine clothes and your paint and powder mistress kitty i've promised to marry you and marry you i will put that in your pipe now marry me against my consent will that can hardly be is it possible cried mrs esther seriously displeased that we have in this rude and discourteous person a son of sir robert levett i never was crossed by woman or man or puppy yet cried will doggedly and taking no notice whatever of mrs esther's rebuke and i never will be why for a whole year and more i've been making preparations for it i've broke in the colt out of rosamund by samson and called him kit for you to ride i've told the people round so as anybody knows there's no pride in me that i'm going to marry a parson's girl without a farden thof a baronet to be will easily dropped into rustic language where i do not always follow him oh thank you will that is kind indeed but i would rather see you show the pride due to your rank and birth you ought to refuse to marry a parson's girl or if you are resolved to cast away your pride there's many a farmer's girl there's jenny of the mill or the blacksmith's sue more proper persons for you i am sure and more congenial to your tastes than the parson's girl i don't mind your sneering not a whit i don't he replied wait till we're married and i warrant you shall see who's got the upper hand there'll be mighty little sneering then i promise you this brutal and barbarous speech made me angry now will i said get up and go away we have had enough of your rustic insolence why sir it is a disgrace that a gentleman should be such a clown go away from epsom leave a company for which your rudeness and ill temper do not fit you go back to your mug house your pipe your stables and your kennels if you think of marrying wed with one of your own rank do you hear sir one of your own rank gentle born though you are clown and churl is your nature as for me i was never promised to you and if i had been the spectacle of this amazing insolence would break a thousand promises he answered by an oath but his eyes were full of dogged determination which i knew of old and i was terrified wondering what he would do i remember when you were a boy your self will and heedlessness of your sister and myself but we are grown up now sir as well as yourself and you shall find that we are no longer your servants what am i to marry this clown you shall pay for this said will wait a bit you shall pay am i to obey the command of this rude barbarian and become his wife not to cross him but to obey him in all his moods because he wills it are you pray the great bashaw mr levett said mrs esther i think you had better go the kitty you knew was a young and tender child she is now a grown woman with i am happy to say a resolution of her own nor is she the penniless girl that you suppose but my heiress though not a pimpernel by blood yet a member of as good and honourable a house as yourself he swore again in his clumsy country fashion that he never yet was baulked by woman and would yet have his way whereas so far as he was a prophet i am translating his rustic language into polite english those who attempted to say him nay would in the long run find reason to repent with bitterness their own mistaken action all his friends he said knew will levett no white handed slobbering tea drinking hanger on to petticoats was he not so he was very well known to entertain that contempt for women which is due to a man who values his self respect and scorns lies finery and make believe fine speeches and it was also very well known to all the country side that give him but a fleer and a flout he was ready with a cuff side o' the head and if more was wanted with a yard of tough ash or a fist that weighed more than most as for drink he could toss it off with the best and carry as much as for racing we had seen what he could do and how gallant a rider he was and for hunting shooting badger baiting bull baiting dog fighting and cocking there was not he was ready to assure us his match in all the country why then should a man of whom his country was proud no mealy mouthed frenchified fine gentleman of whom he would fight a dozen at once so great was his courage be sent about his business by a couple of women he would let us know he pitied our want of discernment and was sorry for the sufferings which it would bring upon one of us meaning kitty of which sufferings he was himself to be the instrument when he had finished this harangue he banged out of the room furiously and we heard him swearing on the stairs and in the passage insomuch that cicely and her mother came up from the kitchen and the former threatened to bring up her mop if he did not instantly withdraw or cease from terrifying the ladies by such dreadful words my dear said mrs esther we have heard alas so many oaths that we do not greatly fear them yet this young man is violent and i will to lady levett there to complain about her son she put on her hat and instantly walked to sir robert's lodgings when before the baronet lady levett and nancy she laid her tale i know not said lady levett weeping what hath made our son so self willed and so rustical from a child he has chosen the kennel rather than the hall and stable boys for companions rather than gentlemen will is rough said his father but i cannot believe that he would do any hurt to kitty whom he hath known and perhaps in his way loved for so long will is obstinate said nancy and he is proud and revengeful he has told all his friends that he was about to marry kitty when he goes home again he will have to confess that he has been sent away yet it would be a great match for kitty said will's mother no madam with submission said mrs esther the disparity of rank is not so great as your ladyship will own and kitty will have all my money the real disparity is incompatibility of sentiment father said nancy you must talk to will and mrs pimpernel take care that kitty be well guarded sir robert remonstrated with his son he pointed out in plain terms that the language he had used and the threats he had made were such as to show him to be entirely unfitted to be the husband of any gentlewoman that kitty was he had reason to believe promised to another man that it was absurd of him to suppose that a claim could be founded on words addressed to a child overcome with grief at the death of her father he spoke gravely and seriously but he might have preached to the pigs for all the good he did will replied that he meant to marry kitty and he would marry her that he would brain any man who stood in his way that he never yet was crossed by a woman and he never would with more to the same effect forgetting the respect due to his father sir robert not losing his patience as he would have been perfectly justified in doing went on to remonstrate with his son upon the position which he was born to illustrate and the duties which that involved foremost among these he said were respect and deference to the weaker sex savages and barbarous men he reminded him use women with as little consideration as they use slaves indeed because women are weak they are among wild tribes slaves by birth but he said for a gentleman in this age of politeness to speak of forcing a lady to marry him against her will is a thing unheard of why lad he continued when i was at thy years i would have scorned to think of a woman whose affections were otherwise bestowed it would have been a thing due to my own dignity if not to the laws of society to leave her and look elsewhere and what hath poor kitty done i pray mistaken an offer of marriage being then a mere child and chit of sixteen for an offer of friendship will will turn thy heart to a better mood will said that it was no use talking because his mind was made up that he was a true kentishman and a british bull dog holdfast was his name when he made up his mind that he was going to get anything that thing he would have that as for kitty he could no more show himself back upon the village green or in the village inn or at any cock fighting bull baiting badger drawing or horse race in the country side unless he had brought home kitty as his wife wherefore he wanted no more ado but let the girl come to her right mind and follow to heel when she would find him give him his own way and no cursed contrariness the best husband in the world but if not then sir robert spoke to other purpose if he told his son he molested kitty in any way whatever he would in his capacity as justice of the peace have him instantly turned out of the town if he offered her any insult or showed the least violence to her friends he promised him upon his honour to disinherit him you may drink and smoke tobacco with your grooms and stable boys at home he said i have long been resigned to that but if you disgrace your name in this place as sure as you bear that name you shall no longer be heir to aught but a barren title will answered not but walked away with dogged looks chapter xx how will would not be crossed i know not what will proposed to himself when his father at first admonished him perhaps one knows not he even tried to set before himself the reasonableness of his father's rebuke perhaps as the sequel seems to show he kept silence resolving to have his own way somehow however that might be will ceased to molest me for the time and i was even in hopes that he had seen the hopelessness of his desires our days went on without any other visits from him and he did not seek me out upon the terrace or in the assembly rooms poor nancy's predictions were however entirely fulfilled for will could not by any persuasion of hers be induced at first to abstain from showing himself in public to be sure he did not run an indian muck among the dancers but he became the terror of the whole company for a rough boorishness which was certainly unknown before in any polite assembly he did not try to be even decently polite he was boorish not like a boor but like a czar of russia with a proud sense of his own position he behaved as if he were at epsom wells the young squire among the villagers who looked up to him as their hero and natural king if he walked upon the terrace he pushed and elbowed the men he jolted the ladies he stepped upon trains pushed aside dangling canes and deranged wigs as if nobody was to be considered when he was present sometimes he went into the card room and took a hand then if he was tempted to give his antagonist the lie direct he gave it or if he lost he said rude things about honesty and he was so strong and carried so big a cudgel that for a time nobody dared to check him because you see by nash's orders the gentlemen wore no swords now although it is possible to challenge a man and run him through what are you to do with one who perhaps would refuse a challenge yet would on provocation being horribly strong cudgel his adversary on the spot of course this kind of thing could not last it went on just as long as the forbearance of the gentlemen allowed and then was brought to an end as for will during the first few days he had not the least consideration for any one all was to give way to his caprice i have already remarked upon the very singular love which young men of all ranks seem to have for chucking under the chin young women of the lower classes it was very well known at epsom wells that many gentlemen rose early in the morning in order to enjoy this pastime upon the chins of the higglers who brought the fruit eggs fowls and vegetables from the farmhouses from six to nine chin chucking not actually upon the parade and the terrace but close by among the trees on the steps of houses beside the pond was an amusement in full flow many of the higglers were comely red cheeked damsels who thought it fine thus to be noticed by the quality and i suppose no harm came of it all save a little pampering of the conceit and vanity of young girls so that they might dream of gentlemen instead of yeomen and aspire beyond their rank instead of remembering the words of the catechism to learn and labour to do their duty in their own station of life to attract the attention of a dozen young fellows to have them following one about even though one carried a basket full of eggs for sale to listen to their compliments to endure that chin chucking i suppose these things were to the taste of the girls because as cicely told me there was great competition among them who should carry the basket to the wells now master will was quite at home from his village experiences with this pastime and speedily fell in with it to the annoyance and discomfiture of the london beaux and fribbles for still acting upon the principles that epsom was his own parish the village where he was sultan great bashaw heyduc or grand seigneur he at once took upon himself the right of paying these attentions to any or all of the damsels without reference to previous preferences this which exasperated the fair higglers drove the beaux nearly mad yet because he was so strong and his cudgel was so thick none durst interfere i have since thought in reflecting over poor will's history that there are very few positions in life more dangerous to a young man than that of the only son of a country squire to have no tastes for learning and polite society and to live constantly on the estate for among the rough farmers and labourers there can be no opposition or public feeling upon the conduct however foolish and ungoverned of such a young man the rustics and clowns are his very humble servants nay almost his slaves they tremble at his frown if he lifts his stick they expect a cudgelling as for the women and girls of the village the poor things are simply honoured by a nod and a word the estate will be his the fields will be his the cottages his the hares rabbits partridges pheasants will be his even the very men and women will be his nay are his already wherever he goes he is saluted even in the church the people rise to do him reverence hats are doffed and reverence paid if he walks the fields or rides upon the roads every day supposing he is so unhappy as to remain always upon his own estate he is made to feel his greatness until he comes to believe like king louis xv himself that there is no one in the world but must bow to his order nothing that he desires but he must have and speaking with the respect due to my benefactors i think that sir robert a man himself of singular good feeling and high breeding was greatly to blame in not sending his son to travel or in some way to make him mix with his equals and superiors for such a character as will's is formed insensibly a man does not become selfish and boorish all at once therefore his parents did not notice until it was forced upon them what all the world deplored the self will and boorishness of their only son to the last i think that lady levett looked upon him as a young man of excellent heart though stubborn you shall marry me he had said therefore it was war to the death because as you all know i could not possibly marry him it was no secret at epsom that this young autocrat had said those words in fact he used them in public insulting harry temple upon the very terrace before all the company i warn you he said keep away from kitty she's going to be my wife i've told her so therefore hands off why will harry replied good naturedly what if she refuses she shan't refuse i've said she shall marry me and she shall he replied refuse it's only her whimsical tricks all fillies are alike hands off master harry why cried peggy baker what a pretty genteel speech to be sure oh mr levett happy is the woman who will be your wife such kindness of disposition such sweetness such gallantry such sensibility i know what you mean said will swearing a big oath and i don't value your words nor your opinion no not a brass farden no more than i value your powder and your paint and your patches you're all alike blacksmith's sue is worth a hundred of ye peggy burst out laughing and will strode away he did not like to be laughed at yet could not help being intolerably rude when i found that will although he made himself the laughing stock and the terror of the place ceased to molest me i was more easy in my mind certainly it would not have been pleasant to walk on the terrace or even to go to the assembly if one had feared to meet this rough and bearish inamorato who might have insulted one or a gentleman with one in the most intolerable manner however the evening was generally a safe time because then he loved to sit in a tavern playing all fours over a pipe and a tankard with any country parson or even any town tradesman who would share his beer and be complaisant with his moods this was worse than the case of harry temple because as i have said before i could not hope whatever i did to bring him to reason sometimes i thought but wildly of dr powlett's establishment suppose that the whole force of the house had succeeded in putting him into chains and a strait waistcoat which was certainly doubtful besides so wicked a thing could not be done twice what assurance had i of good behaviour on release he would promise will was always ready to promise having no more regard to truth than an ourang outang but when he was free with his cudgel in his hand what would he not do i have said that he was prodigiously strong besides being fierce and masterful of aspect this made men give way to him also he got a reputation for being stronger than perhaps he really was for when as continually happened booths were put on the downs for wrestling singlestick quarterstaff boxing and other trials of skill and strength will would always go sit out the whole games and then challenge the victor whom he always conquered coming off the hero of the day to be sure it was whispered that the contest was generally arranged by promise of half a crown to be decided in favour of will it seems strange but i suppose there are men who for half a crown will not only sell a fight on which bets have been made but also take a sound drubbing as well and if he had a dispute with a gentleman it was impossible for him to exchange two words without causing a dispute he would immediately propose to settle the affair with cudgels or fists now a gentleman should be ready to fight a street bully or a light porter in london with any weapons if necessary but what sort of society would that be in which the gentlemen would take off coat and wig and engage with fists or clubs on the smallest quarrel he was so rude and overbearing that the company began to be positively afraid of going to the terrace or the assembly rooms and indeed i think he would have driven the whole of the visitors away in a body but for the timely interference of lord chudleigh and sir miles lackington it was the day after his open insult to harry temple who could not call out the son of his former guardian and his old playfellow therefore these two resolved that there should be an end of this behaviour it was bruited abroad that some steps of a serious nature were going to be taken there had been found a man it was said to bell the cat it was even whispered that a prize fighter of stupendous strength dexterity and resolution had been brought down expressly from london in order to insult will levett receive a challenge for singlestick or fists or quarterstaff instantly accept it and thereupon give the village bantam cock so mighty a drubbing that he would not dare again to show his face among the company indeed i think that was the best thing which could have been done and i sincerely wish they had done it but lord chudleigh and sir miles would not treat a gentleman even so great a cub and clown with other than the treatment due to a gentleman therefore they resolved upon an open and public expostulation and admonition and mindful of the big cudgel they broke the laws of the wells and put on their swords before they came together on the terrace looking grave and stern as becomes those who have duties of a disagreeable kind to perform but to see the excitement of the company they expected i believe nothing short of a battle between lord chudleigh and sir miles on the one hand armed with swords and will on the other grasping his trusty cudgel the cudgel in his hands against any two combatants would have been a mighty awkward weapon but fortunately gentlemen of will's kind entertain a healthy repugnance to cold steel it was about twelve o'clock in the forenoon when will the masterful forcing his way shoulders first among the crowd found himself brought up short by these two gentlemen round them were gathered a circle of bystanders which increased rapidly till it was twenty or thirty deep now then he cried what is the meaning of this let's pass will ye lord or no lord as lord chudleigh made no reply will growling that a freeborn englishman was as good as a lord or a baronet in the public way tried to pass through them then he was seized by the coat collar by sir miles whose arm was as strong as his own hark ye said the baronet we want a few words with you young cub will lifted his head in amazement here was a man quite as strong as himself who dared to address him as a cub we find that you go about the wells continued the baronet which is a place of entertainment for ladies and gentlemen insulting pushing and behaving with no more courtesy than if you were in your own stableyard now sirrah were it not for the respect we have for your father we should make short work of you make short work of me cried will red in the face and brandishing his cudgel make short work of me certainly do not think we shall fight you with sticks and if you make the least gesture with that club of yours i shall have the pleasure of running you through with my sword contrary to the rules of the wells both gentlemen as i have said wore their swords on this occasion and here sir miles touched his sword hilt and now sir take a word of advice try to behave like a gentleman or upon my word of honour you shall be driven out of the wells with a horsewhip by the hands of the common grooms of the place your proper companions will swore prodigiously but he refrained from using his cudgel indeed the prospect of cold steel mightily cooled his courage and a word from me sir said lord chudleigh speaking low you have dared to make public use of a certain young lady's name i assure you upon the honour of a peer that if you presume to repeat this offence or if you in any way assert a claim to that lady's favour i will make you meet me as one gentleman should meet another will looked from one to the other both men showed that they meant what they promised sir miles with a careless smile had in his eye a look of determination lord chudleigh with grave face and set lip seemed a man quite certain to carry out his promise will had nothing to say he was like one dumbfounded therefore he swore this is the common refuge of many men for all kinds of difficulties doubts and dangers some rogues go swearing to the gallows men call them insensible and callous whereas i believe that these wretches are simply incapable of expressing emotion in any other way swearing with them stands for every emotion the divine gift of speech by which it was designed that men should express their thoughts and so continually lead upwards their fellow creatures become in their case a vehicle for profane ejaculation so that they are little better than the monkeys on the branches will therefore swore vehemently this made no impression upon his assailants he therefore swore again he then asked what sort of treatment this was for a gentleman to receive sir miles reminded him that he had offended against the good manners expected of gentlemen at a watering place and that he could no longer fairly be treated as belonging to the polite class indeed he explained we have gravely considered the matter my lord and myself and have come to the conclusion that although for the sake of your most worthy father we were ready to admonish as a gentleman though in this open and public manner as the offence required yet we cannot consider your case to be deserving of any better treatment than that of a common unruly porter carter or labouring man who must be brought to his senses by reason of blows cuffs and kicks know then that although this terrace is open to all who comport themselves with civility decency and consideration for others it is no place for brawlers strikers and disturbers of the peace wherefore four stout men or if that is not enough six will be told off to drive you from the terrace whenever you appear again upon it armed with that great stick or upon the least offer to fight any gentleman of the company i believe sir that you are no fool and that you perfectly understand what we mean and that we do mean it wherefore be advised in time and if you do not retreat altogether from the wells be persuaded to study the customs of polite society this was a long speech for sir miles but it was delivered with an authority and dignity which made me regret that such good abilities should have been thrown away at the gaming table will swore again at this then observing that many of the bystanders were laughing he brandished his cudgel and talked of knocking out brains breaking of necks and so forth until he was again reminded by sir miles who significantly tapped the hilt of his sword that signor stick was not to be allowed to reign at the wells then he hung his head and swore again it will be best sir said lord chudleigh that you come no more to the terrace or the assembly rooms with or without your cudgel the downs are wide and open there you will doubtless find room for walking and an audience in the birds for these profane oaths to which our ladies are by no means accustomed let me go then he said sulkily od rot it get out of my way some of you he walked straight down the terrace the people making way for him on either hand with furious looks and angry gestures he went straight to his stable where he thrashed a groom for some imaginary offence thence he went to the king's head where he called for a tankard and offered to fight the best man in the company or for ten miles round for fifty pounds a side with quarterstaff singlestick or fists then he drank more beer sat down and called for a pipe smoked tobacco all the afternoon and got drunk early in the evening but he came no more to the terrace and now said peggy baker i hope that we shall see miss nancy back again doubtless my lord the return of that lady and the more frequent appearance of miss pleydell with her will bring your lordship oftener from durdans i have already mentioned our poets at epsom and their biting epigrams here is another which was sent to me at this time kitty a nymph who fain would climb but yet may tumble down her charms she tries with voice and eyes first on a rustic clown but bumpkin squire won't serve her turn when gentle harry woos her so farewell will for kitty still will laugh although you lose her yet higher still than hal or will her thoughts ambitious soar'd 'go will and hal my promise shall be transferred to my lord' i suppose the verses were written at the request of peggy baker but after all they did me very little harm and indeed nothing could do me either good or harm at epsom any more because my visit was brought to a sudden close by an event which as will be seen might have been most disastrous for us all the selfishness and boorish behaviour of will levett not only kept us from walking on the terrace in the afternoon but also kept poor nancy at home altogether she would either come to our lodgings and sit with me lamenting over her bumpkin brother or she would sit at home when sir robert was testy and her ladyship querulous throwing the blame of her son's rudeness sometimes upon her husband who she said had never whipped the boy as he ought to have been whipped in accordance with expressed scripture orders strictly laid down or upon nancy whose pert tongue and saucy ways had driven him from the hall to the kennel or upon myself who was so ungrateful after all that had been done for me as to refuse her son in spite of all his protestations of affection it was hard upon poor nancy the ordinary butt and victim of her brother's ill temper that she should be taunted with being the cause of it and one could not but think that had madam been more severe with her son at the beginning things might have gone better when a mother allows her son from the very beginning to have all his own way it is weak in the father to suffer it but she must not then turn round when the mischief is done and reproach her daughter who took no part in the first mischief with being the cause of it nor should she call a girl ungrateful for refusing to marry a man whose vices are so prominent and conspicuous that they actually prevent his virtues from being discerned beneath that smock frock so to speak that village rusticity behind that blunt speech and rough manner there may have been the sound kind heart of a gentleman but the girl could not take that for granted the sequel proved indeed that she was right in refusing even had she been free for will died as he lived a profligate and a drunkard of the village kind so that even his poor mother was at last fain to acknowledge that he was a bad and wicked man and but for some hope derived from his deathbed would have gone in sorrow to her dying day i must say kitty said lady levett to me that i think a little kindness from you might work wonders with our will and he a boy of such a good heart he wants so much of me madam i replied with all respect i cannot give him what he asks because i cannot love him he says child that you promised him indeed madam i did not i was in sorrow and lamentation over my fathers death and my departure from kind friends when first harry and then will came and one after the other said words of which i took no heed yet when i saw them again they both declared that i was promised to them now madam could a girl promise to two men within half an hour i know not girls will do anything said lady levett bitterly yet it passes my understanding to know how the two boys could be so mistaken and yet you will take neither what would nothing serve you short of a coronet i made no reply tell me then girl will lord chudleigh marry thee it is a great condescension of him and a great thing for a penniless young woman he will marry me madam i replied blushing and thinking of what i had first to tell him she sighed well i would he had cast his eyes on nancy yet i say not kitty that a coronet will be too heavy for thy head to wear some women are born to be great ladies my nancy must content herself with some simple gentleman go my dear i must try to persuade this headstrong boy to reason persuade him if you can madam i said to leave epsom and go home he will come to harm in this place two or three of the gentlemen have declared that they will follow the example of lord chudleigh and sir miles lackington and wear swords although that is against the rules of the wells in order to punish him for his rudeness should he venture again to shake his cudgel in the faces of the visitors which he has done already to their great discomfiture i know not if his mother tried to persuade him but i do know that he did not leave epsom and that the evil thing which i had prophesied not knowing how true my words might be did actually fall upon him this shows how careful one should be in foretelling disasters even if they seem imminent and indeed having before one the experiences of maturity it seems as if it would be well did a new order of prophets and prophetesses arise with a message of joy and comfort instead of disaster and misery such as the message which poor cassandra had to deliver now when my lord had given poor will the warning of which i have told he retired ashamed and angry but impenitent to those obscure haunts where tobacco is continually offered as incense to the gods of rusticity here he continued to sit smoked pipes drank beer and cudgelled stable boys to his heart's content while we being happily quit of him came forth again without fear nancy however assured me that something would happen before her brother whose stubbornness and masterful disposition were well known to her relinquished his pursuit and persecution of the woman on whom he had set his heart my dear she said i know will as you do of old was there ever a single thing which he desired that he did not obtain why when he was a child and cried for the moon they brought him a piece of green cheese which they told him was cut from the moon on purpose for him to eat was he ever crossed in anything has there ever been a single occasion on which he gave up any enjoyment or desire out of consideration for another person rather when he has gone among his equals has he not become an object of scorn and hatred he made no friends at school nor any at cambridge from which place of learning he was as you know disgracefully expelled the gentlemen of the county will not associate with him except on the hunting field you know all this kitty think then since he has made up his mind to marry a girl since he has bragged about his condescension as he considers it since he has promised his pot companions to bring home a wife how great must be his rage and disappointment he will do something kitty he is desperate what however could he do he came not near our lodgings he made no sign of any evil intention but he did not go away he is desperate repeated nancy he cares little about you but he thinks of his own reputation and my dear do not think because will poor boy is a sot and a clown that he does not think of his reputation his hobby is to be thought a man who can and will have his own way he has openly bragged about the country and even among his boozing companions at epsom that he will marry you therefore oh my dear be careful go not forth alone or without a gentleman or two after dark for i believe that will would do anything anything for the sake of what he calls his honour for kitty to be laughed at would be the death blow to his vanity he knows that he is ignorant and boorish but he consoles himself with the thought that he is strong what i repeated being uneasy more than a little could he do at first i thought of asking harry temple quietly to watch over will and bring me news if anything was in the wind but that would not do either because one could not ask harry to act the part of a spy next i thought that i had only to ask for a bodyguard of the young men at the wells to get a troop for my protection but what a presumption would this be finally i spoke my fears to sir robert begging him not to tell madam what i had said courage kitty said sir robert levett will is a clown for which we have to thank our own indulgence better had it been to break a thousand good ash saplings over his back than to see him as he is well the wise man says 'the father of a fool hath no joy' yet will is of gentle blood and i cannot doubt that he will presently yield and go away patiently have you asked him sir child i ask him daily for his mother's sake and for nancy's to go away and leave us in peace but i have no control over him he doth but swear and call for more ale his mother also daily visits him and gets small comfort thereby his heart is hard and against us all then sir if mrs esther will consent one cause of his discontent shall be removed for we will go away to london where he will not be able to find us yes kitty he replied that will be best yet who would ever have thought i could wish our sweet tall kitty to go away from us the sweet tall kitty could not but burst out crying at such tenderness from her old friend and protector forgive me sir i said while he kissed me and patted my cheek as if i was a child again forgive me sir that i cannot marry will as he would wish child he exclaimed starting to his feet in a paroxysm of passion god forgive me for saying so but i would rather see a girl i loved in her grave than married to my son we then held a consultation lord chudleigh being of the party and it was resolved that we should return to london without delay and without acquainting any at the wells with our intention which was to be carried into effect as soon as we could get our things put together in fact in two days' time so secret were our preparations that we did not even tell nancy and were most careful to let no suspicion enter the head of cicely crump a town crier of the busiest and loudest who was besides continually beset by the young gallants seeking through her to convey letters poems and little gifts to me yet so faithful was the girl as i afterwards found out and so fond of me that i might safely have trusted her with any secret soon after the event which i am now to relate i took cicely into my service as still room maid she remained with me for four years being ever the same merry faithful and talkative wench she then by my advice married the curate of the parish to whom she made as good a wife as she had been a servant and brought up eleven children four of them being twins in the fear of god and the love of duty we were to depart on friday the evening being chosen so that master will should not be able to see us go lord chudleigh and sir miles promised to ride with our coach all the way to london for protection i have often remembered since that friday is ever an unlucky day to begin upon had we made the day thursday for instance we should have gotten safely away without the thing which happened on thursday afternoon we repaired to the terrace as usual i rather sad at thinking that my reign as queen of the wells would soon be over and wondering whether the future could have any days in store for me so happy as those which a kind providence had already bestowed upon me there was to be a dance at six and a tea at five about four o'clock nancy and i accompanied only by mr stallabras sauntered away from the terrace and took the road leading to the downs nancy afterwards told me that she had noticed a carriage with four horses waiting under the trees between the terrace and the king's head which on our leaving the crowd slowly followed us along the road but she thought nothing of this at the time mr stallabras with gallant and consequential air ambled beside us his hat under his arm his snuff box in his left hand and his cane dangling from his right wrist he was as usual occupied with his own poetry which indeed through the interest of the brewers widow whom he subsequently married seemed about to become the fashion i thought then that it was splendid poetry but i fear now that it must have been what dr johnson once called a certain man's writing terrible skimble skamble stuff in other words poor solomon stallabras had the power of imitation and would run you off rhymes as glibly as monkey can peel cocoa nuts according to the reports of travellers quite in the style of pope yet the curious might look in vain for any thought above the common or any image which had not been used again and again such poets though they hand down the lamp do not i suppose greatly increase the poetic reputation of their country it seems a pity mr stallabras i was saying that you who are so fond of singing about the purling stream and the turtles cooing in the grove do not know more about the familiar objects of the country here is this little flower only a humble crane's bill yet a beautiful flower you do not i engage know its name he did not observe again the spreading leaves of yonder great tree you do not i suppose know its name he did not a common beech it was yet as stately as any of those which may be seen near farnham royal or in windsor forest and listen there is a bird whose note i dare swear you do not know he did not would you believe that it was actually the voice of the very turtle dove of which he was so fond the poet he explained not at all abashed by the display of so much ignorance the poet should not fetter his mind with the little details of nature he dwells in his thought remote from their consideration a flower is to him a flower which is associated with the grove and the purling stream a shepherd gathers a posy of flowers for his nymph a tree is a tree which stands beside the stream to shelter the swain and his goddess the song of one bird is as good as the song of another provided it melodiously echoes the sighs of the shepherd as for here we were interrupted the post chaise drove rapidly up the road and overtook us as we turned to look it stopped and two men jumped out of it armed with cudgels nancy seized my arm kitty will is in the carriage i will do solomon stallabras justice he showed himself though small of stature and puny of limb as courageous as a lion he was armed with nothing but his cane but with this he flew upon the ruffians who rushed to seize me and beat struck clung and kicked in my defence nancy threw herself upon me and shrieked crying that if they carried me away they should drag her too while we struggled i saw the evil face of will looking out of the carriage it was distorted by every evil passion he cried to the men to murder solomon he threatened his sister to kill her unless she let go he called to me that it would be the worse for me unless i came quiet then he sprang from the carriage himself having originally purposed i suppose to take no part in the fray and with his cudgel dealt solomon such a blow upon his head that he fell senseless in the road after this he seized nancy his own sister dragged her from me swore at the men for being cowardly lubbers and while they threw me into the carriage he hurled his sister shrieking and crying on the prostrate form of the poor poet and sprang into the carriage after me run he cried to the two men off with you both different ways if you get caught it will be the worse for you we were half way up the hill which leads from the town to the downs in fact we were not very far above the doctor's house but there was a wind in the road so that had his men been looking out of his doors they could not have seen what was being done though they might have heard almost on the terrace the cries the dreadful imprecations and the shrieks of nancy and myself they had thrown me upon the seat with such violence that i was breathless for a few moments as well as sick and giddy with the dreadful scene it lasted but half a minute which i had witnessed yet as will leaped in after me and gave the word to drive on i saw lying in the dust of the road the prostrate and insensible form of poor solomon and my faithful tender nancy who had so fought and wrestled with the villains not with any hope that she could beat them off but in order to gain time lying half over the body of the poet half on the open road alas the road at this time was generally deserted there was no one to rescue though beyond the tall elms upon the right lay the gardens and park of durdans where my lord was walking at that moment perhaps meditating upon his wretched kitty as for my companion his face resembled that of some angry devil moved by every evil passion at once if i were asked to depict the worst face i ever saw i should try to draw the visage of this poor boy he could not speak for passion he was in such a rage that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth he could not even swear he could only splutter for a while he sat beside me ejaculating at intervals disjointed words while his angry eyes glared about the coach and his red cheeks flamed with wrath the downs were quite deserted not even a shepherd was in sight we drove along a road which i knew well a mere track across the grass the smooth turf was easy for the horses and we were travelling at such a pace that it seemed impossible for any one to overtake us my heart sank yet i bade myself keep up courage with this wild beast at my side it behoved me to show no sign of terror every woman has got two weapons one provided by nature the other by art the first is the one which king solomon had ever in his mind when he wrote the book of proverbs which should be the guide and companion of every young man certainly he had so many wives that he had more opportunities than fall to the lot of most husbands who have only the experience of one of knowing the power of a woman's tongue he says he would rather dwell in the wilderness than with an angry woman in the corner of the house top than with a brawling woman yet the last chapter of the book is in praise of the wise woman i had therefore my tongue next i had a pair of scissors so that if my fine gentleman attempted the least liberty i could and would give him such a stab with the sharp points as would admonish him to good purpose but mostly i relied upon my tongue knowing of old that with this weapon will was easily discomfited presently the cool air of the downs blowing upon his cheeks will became somewhat soothed and his ejaculations became less like angry words used as interjections i sat silent taking no notice of what he said and answering nothing to any of his wild speeches but be sure that i kept one eye upon the window ready to shriek if any passer by appeared the angry interjections settled down into sentences and will at last became able to put some of his thoughts into words he began a strange wild rambling speech during which i felt somewhat sorry for him it was such a speech as an indian savage might have made when roused to wrath by the loss of his squaw he bade me remember that he had known me from infancy that he had always been brought up with me i had therefore a first duty to perform in the shape of gratitude to him for being a child with him in the same village next he informed me that having made up his mind to marry me nothing should stop him because nothing ever did stop him in anything he proposed to do and if any one tried to stop him he always knocked down that man first and when he had left him for dead he then went and did the thing this he said was well known very well then did i dare then he asked knowing as i did full well this character of his for resolution to fly in the face of that knowledge and throw him over what made the matter he argued a case of the blackest ingratitude was that i had thrown him over for a lord a poor chicken hearted painted lord whom he for his own part could knock down at a single blow he would now therefore show me what my new friends were worth here i was boxed up in the carriage with him safe and sound not a soul within hail being driven merrily across country to a place he knew of where i should find a house a parson and a prayer book with these before me i might if i pleased yelp and cry for my lord and his precious friend sir miles lackington they would be far enough away with their swords and their mincing ways when i was married they might come and what was i laughing at i laughed in fact because i remembered another weapon as a last resource i could proclaim to the clergyman that i was already a wife the wife of lord chudleigh i knew enough of the clergy to be certain that although a man might be here and there found among them capable of marrying a woman against her will just as men are found among them who to please their patrons will drink with them go cock fighting with them and in every other way forget the sacred duties of their calling yet not one among them all however bad would dare to marry again a woman already married therefore i laughed a london profligate would perhaps have got a man to personate a clergyman but this wickedness i was sure would not enter into the head of simple will levett it was as much as he could devise and that was surely a good deal to bribe some wretched country curate to be waiting for us at our journey's end to marry us on the spot when i understood this i laughed again thinking what a fool will would look when he was thwarted again zounds madam i see no cause for laughing i laugh will i said because you are such a fool as for you unless you order your horses' heads to be turned round and drive me instantly back to epsom you will not laugh but cry to this he made no reply but whistled now to whistle when a person gives you serious advice is in kent considered a contemptuous reply ah he went on sly as you were i have been too many for you it was you who set the two bullies your great lord and your baronet on me with their swords made all the people laugh at me you shall pay for it all it was you set nancy crying and scolding upon me enough to give a man a fit it was you i know set my father on to me says if he cannot cut me off with a shilling he will sell the timber ruin the estate and let me starve so long as he lives let 'un let 'un let 'un i say all of you do your worst honest will levett will do what he likes and have what he likes bull dog will holdfast will tear 'em will by the lord there isn't a man in the country can get the better of him oh i know your ways wait till i've married you then butter wont melt in your mouth then it will be 'dear will kind will sweet will best of husbands and of men' oh i know what you are well enough why after all what is one woman that she should set herself above other women take off your powder and your patches and your hoops how are you better than blacksmith's sue answer me that and why do i take all this trouble about you to anger my father and spite my mother when blacksmith's sue would make as good a wife ay a thousand times better because she can bake and brew and shoe a horse and mend a cracked crown and fight a game cock and teach a ferret and train a terrier or a bull pup whereas you what are you good for but to sit about and look grand and come over the fellows with your make pretence false lying whimsy flimsy ways your smilin' looks when a lord is at your heels and your 'oh fie will' if it's only an old friend why i say because i've told my friends that i'm going to bring you home my wife and my honour's at stake because i am one as will have his will spite of 'em all because i don't love you not one bit since i found you out for what you are a false jiltin' jade and i value the little finger of sue more than your whole body tall as you are and fine as you think yourself oh by the lord i am sorry i cannot give the whole of his speech which was too coarse and profane to be written down for polite eyes to read suffice it to say that it included every form of wicked word or speech known to the rustics of kent and that he threatened me in the course of it with every kind of cruelty that he could think of counting as nothing a horsewhipping every day until i became cheerful now to horsewhip your wife every day in order to make her cheerful seems like starving your horse in order to make him more spirited or to flog an ignorant boy in order to make him learned or to kick your dog in order to make him love you perhaps he did not mean quite all that he said but one cannot tell because his friends were chiefly in that rank of life where it is considered a right and honourable thing to beat a wife cuff a son and kick a daughter and even the coarsest boor of a village will have obedience from the wretched woman at his beck and call i think that will would have belaboured his wife with the greatest contentment and as a pious duty in order to make her satisfied with her lot cheerful over her duties and merry at heart at the contemplation of so good a husband a wife a dog and a walnut tree the harder you flog them the better they be there are plenty of solomon's proverbs in favour of flogging a child but none that i know of which recommend the flogging of a wife blacksmith sam will said in his own village the father of the incomparable sue used this method to tame his wife with satisfactory results and pharaoh his own keeper was at that very time engaged upon a similar course of discipline with his partner what he explained is good for such as those women is good for all beat 'em and thrash 'em till they follow to heel like a well bred retriever keep the stick over 'em till such times as they become as meek as an old cow and as obedient as a sheep dog while he was still pouring forth these maxims for my information and encouragement my heart began to beat violently because i heard distantly at first the hoofs of horses behind us will went on hearing and suspecting nothing growing louder and louder in his denunciation of women and the proper treatment of them the hoofs drew nearer presently they came alongside i looked out one on each side of our carriage there rode lord chudleigh and sir miles lackington but i laughed no longer for i saw before me the advent of some terrible thing and a dreadful trembling seized me my lord's face was stern and sir miles for the first time in my recollection was grave and serious as one who hath a hard duty to perform so mad was poor headstrong will that he neither heard them nor for a while saw them but continued his swearing and raving they called aloud to the postillions to stop the horses this it was that roused will and he sprang to his feet with a yell of rage and thrusting his head out of the window bawled to the boys to drive faster faster they whipped and spurred their horses my lord said nothing but rode on keeping up with the carriage stop cried sir miles go on cried will sir miles drew a pistol and deliberately cocked it if you will not stop he cried holding his pistol to the post boy's head i will fire go on cried will go on he dares not fire the fellow i knew him for a stable boy whose life at the hall had been one long series of kicks cuffs abuse and horsewhippings at the hands of his young master ducked his head between his shoulders and put up his elbows as if that which had so often protected him when will was enforcing discipline by the help of father stick would avail him against a pistol shot but he obeyed his master mostly from force of habit and spurred his horse sir miles changed the direction of the pistol and leaning forward discharged the contents in the head of the horse which the boy was riding the poor creature bounded forward and fell dead there was a moment of confusion the flying horses stumbled and fell the boys were thrown from their saddles the carriage was stopped suddenly then what followed happened all in a moment yet it is a moment which to me is longer than any day of my life because the terror of it has never left me and because in dreams it often comes back to me ah what a prophetess was nancy when she said that some dreadful thing would happen before all was over unless will went away sir miles and my lord sprang to their feet will with a terrible oath leaped forth from the carriage for a moment he stood glaring from one to the other like a wild beast brought to bay he was a wild beast then he raised his great cudgel and rushed at my lord you he cried you are the cause of it i will beat out your brains lord chudleigh leaped lightly aside and avoided the blow which would have killed him had it struck his head then i saw the bright blade in his hand glisten for a moment in the sunlight and then will fell backwards with a cry and lay lifeless on the green turf while my lord stood above him drops of red blood trickling down his sword i fear my lord said sir miles that you have killed him fortunately i am witness that it was in self defence you have killed him you have killed my master cried the stable boy whose left arm which was broken by his fall from the horse hung helpless at his side you have killed the best master in all the world lord or no lord you shall hang he rushed with his one hand to seize the slayer of his master this poor faithful slave whose affections had only grown firmer with every beating sir miles caught him by the coat collar and dragged him back quiet fool attend to your master he is not dead yet he looked dead the rage was gone out of his eyes which were closed and the blood had left the cheeks which were pallid poor will never looked so handsome as when he lay to all seeming dead lord chudleigh looked on his prostrate form with a kind of stern sadness the taking of life even in such a cause and in self defence is a dreadful thing like lamech who also might have been defending his own life he had slain a man to his wounding and a young man to his hurt kitty he said in a low voice taking my hand this is a grievous day's work yet i regret it not since i have saved your honour my lord i replied i had the saving of that in my own hands but you have rescued me from a wild beast whose end i grieve over because i knew him when he was yet an innocent boy come said sir miles we must take measures here fellows come lift your master the two boys with his help lifted will who as they moved him groaned heavily into the carriage now said sir miles one of you get inside lift his head if but that is impossible you come across water pour a little into his mouth the other mount and drive home as quickly as you can i bethought me of my friend the mad doctor and bade them take their master to his house which was as i have said on the road between the town and the downs so that he might be carried there quietly without causing an immediate scandal in the town the fellows were now quite obedient and subdued sir miles who seemed to know what was to be done made some sort of splint with a piece of poor will's cudgel for the broken arm which he tied up roughly and bade the boy be careful to get attended to as soon as his master was served in that class of life as is well known wounds broken bones and even the most cruel surgical operations are often endured with patience which would equal the most heroic courage if it were not due to a stupid insensibility the most sensitive of men are often the most courageous because they know what it is they are about to suffer however they did as they were told and presently drove back the third horse following with a rope then we were left alone with the blood upon the grass and the dead horse lying beside us sir miles took my lord's sword from him wiped it on the turf and restored it to him come he said we must consider what to do there is nothing to do said lord chudleigh except to take miss pleydell home again pardon me my lord sir miles interposed if ever i saw mischief written on any man's face it was written on the face of that boy a brave lad too and would have driven to the death at his master's command how can he do harm i asked why sir miles you are witness you saw will levett with his cudgel rush upon his lordship who but drew in self defence i am another witness i hope the simple words of such as you and i would be believed before the oath of a stable lad i suppose they would he replied meantime there is the fact known to all the company at the wells that both you and i lord chudleigh had publicly informed this unhappy young man that under certain circumstances we would run him through the circumstances have happened and we have run him through this complication may be unfortunate as regards the minds of that pig headed institution a coroner's inquest sir cried my lord do you suppose would you have me believe that this affair might be construed into anything but an act of self defence i do indeed he replied gravely and so deeply do i feel it that i would counsel a retreat into some place where we shall not be suspected for such a time as may be necessary if the worst happens and the man dies your lordship may surrender yourself but in london not to a country bench if the man recovers well and good you can go abroad again at first my lord would hear nothing of such a plan why should he run away was it becoming for a man to fly from the laws of his country then i put in a word pointing out that it was one thing for a case to be tried before a jury of ignorant prejudiced men upon an inquest and another thing altogether for the case to be tried by a dispassionate and unprejudiced jury i said too that away from this place the circumstances of the case the brutal assault upon solomon stallabras whose ribs it appeared were broken as well as his collar bone the ferocious treatment of nancy by her own brother and my forcible abduction in open daylight would certainly be considered provocation enough for anything and a justification combined with the other circumstances of the homicide if unhappily will should die this moved my lord somewhat where he asked could he go so as to lie perdu for a few days or a few weeks if necessary i have thought upon that replied sir miles looking at me with a meaning eye but i blushed and turned pale and reddened again i have just now thought of a plan your lordship has been there once already i mean the rules of the fleet here will i find you lodgings where no one will look for you where if you please to lie hidden for awhile you may do so in perfect safety where you may have any society you please from a baronet out at elbows to a baker in rags or no society at all if you please to lie quiet i like not the place said his lordship i have been there it is true once and it was once too often find me another place i know no other sir miles replied you must be in london you must be in some place where no one will suspect you as for me i will stay near you but not with you there will be some noise over this affair it will be well for us to be separated yet not so far but that i can work for you come my lord be reasonable the place is dirty and noisy but what signify dirt and noise when safety is concerned he wavered the recollection of the place was odious to him yet the case was pressing he gave way have it he said your own way kitty he took my hand hopeless as is my case desperate as is my condition i am happy in having rescued you no matter at what cost your lordship's case is not so hopeless as mine said sir miles yet i too am happy in having helped to rescue this the noblest creature in the world the tears were in my eyes as these two men spoke of me in such terms how could i deserve this worship by what act or thought or prayer could i raise myself to the level where my lord's imagination had planted me o love divine since it makes men and women long to be angels i mean sir miles continued bluntly that since your lordship has found favour in her eyes your case cannot be hopeless lord chudleigh raised my hand to his lips with a sadness in his eyes of which i alone could discern the cause gentlemen i cried we waste the time in idle compliments mount and ride off as quickly as you may as for me it is but three miles across the downs i have no fear i shall meet no one mount i say and ride to london without more ado they obeyed they left me standing alone as my eyes turned from following them they lighted on the pool of blood will's blood which reddened the turf and upon the poor dead horse then i hastened back across the downs it was a clear bright evening the sun yet pretty high the time was about half past five before long the minuets would be beginning in the assembly rooms yet lady levett would know i hoped that she already knew the dreadful wickedness of her son would not indeed all the company know it would not the assault on mr stallabras and on nancy be noised abroad indeed the news had already sped abroad long before i reached the edge of the downs i became aware of a crowd of people they consisted of the whole company all the visitors at epsom who came forth leaving the public tea and the dance to meet the girl who had been thus carried away by force harry temple came forward as soon as i was in sight to meet me he was very grave kitty he said this is a bad day's work how is will you have seen will i fear he is already dead the doctor to whom you sent him declares that he is dying fast his mother is with him o harry i sighed i gave him no encouragement there was not the least encouragement to believe that i would marry him no one thinks you did kitty not even his mother yet others have been carried away by admiration of your charms to think oh my charms my charms harry with poor will at death's door let us at least be spared the language of compliment by this time we had reached the stream of people among them i am happy to say was not peggy baker she at least did not come out to gaze upon her unhappy rival for whose sake one gallant gentleman lay bleeding to death and two others were riding away to hide themselves until the first storm should be blown over the rest parted right and left and made a lane through which we passed in silence as i went through i heard voices whispering where is lord chudleigh where is sir miles how pale she looks and so forth comments of the crowd which has no heart no pity no sympathy it came out to day to look upon a woman to whom a great insult had been offered with as little pity as to morrow it would go to see a criminal flogged from newgate to tyburn or a woman whipped at bridewell or a wretched thief beaten before the alderman or a batch of rogues hanged they came to be amused amusement to most people is the contemplation of other folks' sufferings if tortures were to be introduced again if as happened we are told in the time of nero christians could be wrapped in pitch and then set fire to thus becoming living candles i verily believe the crowd would rush to see and would enjoy the spectacle the more the longer the sufferings of the poor creatures were prolonged solomon stallabras harry told me was comfortably put into bed his ribs being set and his collar bone properly put in place there was no doubt that he would do well nancy too was in bed sick with the fright she had received but not otherwise much hurt mrs esther was wringing her hands and crying at home with cicely to look after her sir robert and lady levett were at the doctor's it was i have said the same doctor who had undertaken the temporary charge of harry temple as we drew near the house i observed that most of the people remained behind upon the downs in hopes of seeing the return of lord chudleigh in which hope they were disappointed harry became silent come harry i said reading his thoughts you must forgive me for saving your life or from preventing you from killing lord chudleigh be reasonable dear harry he smiled i have forgiven you long since he replied you acted like a woman that is you did just what you thought best at the moment but i cannot and will not forgive the man with his impudent smile and his buckets of water nay harry i said he acted according to his profession come with me to the house i cannot even go to mrs esther until i have seen or heard about poor will the doctor was coming from the sick man's chamber when we came to the house they had placed will in one of the private rooms away from the dreadful gallery where the madmen were chained to the wall with him were lady levett and sir robert the doctor coughed in his most important manner your obedient servant miss pleydell sir your most obedient humble servant you are come no doubt to inquire after the victim of this most unhappy affair poor mr william levett i grieve to say is in a most precarious condition can nothing save him o doctor nothing can save him young lady he replied but a miracle that miracle i call it nothing short is sometimes granted by beneficent providence to youth and strength only when i say only when their possession is aided by the very highest medical skill that the country can produce i say the very highest no mere pretender will avail indeed doctor we have that skill i doubt not in yourself i say nothing he bowed and spread his hands i say nothing it is not for me to speak and sir said harry you are doubtless aware that sir robert is a gentleman of a considerable estate and that in fact you may expect sir robert he replied with a smile which speedily in spite of all his efforts broadened into a grin of satisfaction has already promised that no expense shall be spared no honorarium be considered too large if i give him back his son yet we can but do our best science is strong but a poke of cold steel in the inwards is if you please stronger still will you let me see sir robert i asked the doctor stole back to the room and presently sir robert came forth he kissed me on the forehead while his tears fell upon my head my dear he said i ask your pardon in the name of my headstrong son we have held an honourable name for five hundred years and more in all that time no deed so dastardly has been attempted by any one of our house yet the poor wretch hath paid dearly for his wickedness oh sir i cried there is no reason why you should speak of forgiveness who have ever been so kind to me poor will will repent and be very good when he recovers i think said his father sadly that he will not recover go child ask not to see the boy's mother because women are unreasonable in their grief and she might perchance say things of which she would afterwards be ashamed go to mrs pimpernel and tell her of thy safety this was indeed all that could be done yet after allaying the terrors and soothing the agitated spirits of mrs esther whose imagination had conjured up already the fate of clarissa and who saw in headstrong will another lovelace without to be sure the graces and attractions of that dreadful monster i went to inquire after my gallant little poet he was lying on his bed with orders not to move and wrapped up like a baby i thanked him for his brave defence which i said would have been certainly efficacious had it not been for the cowardly blow on the back of his head i further added that no man in the world could have behaved more resolutely or with greater courage this day he said has been the reward for a poet's devotion in those bowers miss kitty when first we met the bower was the fleet market beside that stream the fleet ditch where the woodland choir was held the clack of the poultry about to be killed and the playful lambs frisked on their way to the butchers of newgate street i dared to love a goddess who was as much too high for me as ever beatrice was for her italian worshipper i refer not to the disparity of birth because though brought up in a hosier's shop the muse you have acknowledged confers nobility an attorney is by right of his calling styled a gentleman but a poet by right of his genius is equal of ay even of lord chudleigh surely dear sir i replied no one can refuse the highest title of distinction to a gentleman of merit and genius but i think he went on of that disparity which consists in virtue and goodness that can never be removed how happy therefore ought i to be in feeling that i have helped to preserve an angel from the hands of those barbarous monsters who would have violated such a sanctuary what are these wounds a broken rib a cracked collar bone a bump on the back of the head i wish they had been broken legs and arms in your service i laughed but this devotion more than half of it being real touched my heart the little poet conceited vain sometimes foolish was ennobled not by his genius of which he thought so much but by his great belief in goodness and virtue women should be humble when they remember that if a good man loves them it is not in very truth the woman who is a poor creature full of imperfections that they love but the soul the noble pure exalted soul as high as their own grandest conception of goodness and piety which they believe to be in her how can we rise to so great a height how can we without abasement pretend to such virtue how can we be so wicked and so cruel as after marriage to betray to our husbands the real littleness of our souls as my lord believed me to be so might i then i prayed rise to heaven in very truth and even soar to higher flights now when i reached home a happy thought came to me i knew the name of solomon's latest patron the brewer's widow i sat down and wrote her a letter i said that i thought it my simple duty to inform her although i had not the honour of her friendship that the poet whom she had distinguished with her special favour and patronage was not in a position to pay her his respects either by letter or by verse or in person being at that time ill in bed with ribs and other bones broken in defence of a lady and to this i added so that she might not grow jealous which one must always guard against in dealing with women that he was walking with two ladies not one and that the gallantry he showed in defence of her who was attacked was so great that not even a lover could have displayed more courage for his mistress than he did for this lady myself who was promised to another gentleman nor was it i added until he was laid senseless on the field that the ravishers were able to carry off the lady who was immediately afterwards rescued by two friends of the poet lord chudleigh and sir miles lackington this crafty letter which was all true and yet designedly exaggerated as when i called my lord solomon's friend produced more than the effect which i desired for the widow who was in london came down to epsom the next day in a carriage and four to see the hero now she was still young and comely as well as rich therefore when she declared to him that no woman could resist such a combination of genius and heroic courage solomon could only reply that he would rush into her arms with all a lover's rapture as soon as his ribs permitted an embrace in short within a month they were married at epsom church and solomon though he wrote less poetry in after years than his friends desired lived in great comfort and happiness having a wife of sweet temper who thought him the noblest and most richly endowed of men and a brewery whose vats produced him an income far beyond his wants though these expanded as time went on as for nancy she was little hurt save for the fright and the shame of it yet her brother the cause of all was lying dangerously wounded and she could not for very pity speak her mind upon his wickedness the company i learned from cicely were greatly moved about it the public tea had been broken up in confusion while all sallied forth to the scene of the outrage nor was the assembly resumed when it was discovered that will levett had been run through the body by lord chudleigh and was now lying at the point of death in the morning cicely went early to inquire at the doctor's alas will was in a high fever lady levett had been sitting with him all night it was not thought that he would live through the day i put on my hood and went to see nancy oh my dear dear kitty she cried sure we shall all go distracted you have heard what they say poor will is in a bad way indeed the fever is so high that the doctor declares his life to be in hourly danger he is delirious and in his dreams he knows not what he says so that you would fancy him among his dogs or in his stables where indeed it hath been his chief delight to dwell or with the rustics with whom he would drink it is terrible my father says that one so near his end who must shortly appear before his maker should thus blaspheme and swear such horrid oaths if we could only ensure him half an hour of sense even with pain so that the clergyman might exhort him alas our will hath led so shocking a life my dear i know more of his ways than he thinks that i doubt his conscience and his heart are hardened o kitty to think that yesterday we were happy and that this evil thing had not befallen us and now i can never go abroad again without thinking that the folk are saying 'there goes the sister of the man who was killed while trying to carry off the beautiful miss pleydell' no comfort can be found for one who sits expectant of a brothers death i bade poor nancy keep up her heart and hope for the best the fever increased during the day we heard and the delirium we stirred not out of the house save for morning prayers sending cicely from time to time to ask the news and all the company gathered together on the terrace not to talk scandal or tell idle stories of each other but to whisper that will levett was certainly dying and that it would go hard with lord chudleigh who would without doubt be tried for murder the two grooms protesting stoutly that their master had not struck a blow in the evening sir robert levett came to our lodging he was heavily afflicted with the prospect of losing his only son albeit not a son of whom a parent could be proud yet a child cannot be replaced and the line of the levetts would be extinguished my dear he said i come to say a thing which has been greatly on my mind my son was run through by lord chudleigh tell me first what there is between you and my lord doth he propose to marry you dear sir i replied lord chudleigh has offered me his hand and you have taken it unworthy as i am dear sir i have promised should certain obstacles be removed to marry him his sword has caused my will's death yet the act was done in defence of the woman he loved the woman whom will designed to ruin and in self defence as well had he not drawn will would have beaten out his brains tell him from will's father my dear that i forgive him let not such a homicide dwell upon his conscience where is he he has gone away with sir miles lackington to await the finding of an inquest if tell him that i will not sanction any proceedings and if there is to be an inquest my evidence shall be though it bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave that my lord is innocent and drew his sword to defend his own life he left me poor man to return to the sick bedside he had been gone but a short time when a post boy rode to the door blowing a horn it was a special messenger who had ridden from temple bar with a letter from sir miles sweet kitty wrote the baronet i write this to tell thee that we have taken up quarters in london i have bestowed my lord in certain lodgings which you know above the room where once i lay heavens my lord was in my own old lodging beside the fleet market he is downhearted thinking of the life he has taken i tell him that he should think no more of running through such a madman in defence of his own life than of killing a pig pig and worse than pig was the creature who dared to carry off the lovely kitty to think that such a rustic clown should be brother of pretty nancy i have sent to my lord's lodging an agreeable dinner and a bottle of good wine with which i hope my lord will comfort his heart meantime they know not in the house the rank and quality of their guest i suppose the fellow is dead by this time if there is an inquest i shall attend to give my evidence and the verdict can be none other than justifiable homicide or even felo de se for if ever man rushed upon his death it was will levett i have also sent him paper and pens with which to write to you and some books and a pack of cards here is enough to make a lonely man happy if he wants more he can look out of the window and see the porters and fishwives of the market fight which was a spectacle daily delighted me for two years and more the doctor is well i have informed him privately of the circumstances of the case and lord chudleigh's arrival he seemed pleased but i took the liberty of warning him against betraying to my lord a relationship the knowledge of which might be prejudicial to your interests prejudicial to my interests sir miles was in league with me to hide this thing from a man who believed like solomon stallabras that i was all truth and goodness i had borne so much from this wicked concealment that i was resolved to bear it no longer i said to myself almost in the words of the prayer book i will arise and go unto my lord i will say forgive me for thus and thus have i done and so am i guilty oh my noble lord oh great heart and true what am i wicked and deceitful woman that i should hope to keep thy love let it go tell me that you can never love again one who has played this wicked part let hatred and loathing take the place of love let all go and leave me a despairing wretch so that i have confessed my sin and humbled myself even to the ground before him whom i have so deeply wronged chapter xxi how kitty went to london oppressed with this determination which left no room for any other thought i urged upon mrs esther the necessity of going to london at once as we had resolved to do before the accident i pointed out to her that after the dreadful calamity which had befallen us for which most certainly no one could blame us we could take no more pleasure in the gaieties of epsom that we could enjoy no longer the light talk the music and the dancing that the shadow of death had fallen over the place so far as we were concerned that we could not laugh while nancy was weeping and that in short my lord was in london and i must needs go too there are a hundred good reasons said mrs esther why we should go away at once and you have named the very best of all but dear child i would not seem to be pursuing his lordship indeed i replied there will be no pursuing of him oh dear madam i should be and here i burst into tears the happiest of women if i were not the most anxious she thought i meant that i was anxious about will's recovery but this was no longer the foremost thing in my thoughts much as i hoped that he would get better which seemed now hopeless let us go dear madam and at once let us leave this place which will always be remembered by me as the scene of so much delight as well as so much pain i must see my lord as soon as i can for oh there are obstacles in the way which i must try to remove or be a wretched woman for ever child said mrs esther severely we must not stake all our happiness on one thing but i have so staked it i replied dear madam you do not understand if i get not lord chudleigh for my husband i will never have any man if i cannot be his slave then will i be no man's queen for oh i love the ground he walks upon the place where he lodges is my palace his kind looks are my paradise i want no heaven unless i can hold his hand in mine i refrain from setting down all i said because i think i was like a mad thing having in my mind at once my overweening love my repentance and shame and my terror in thinking of what my lord would say when he heard the truth had my case been that of more happy women who have nothing to conceal or to confess such a fit of passion would have been without excuse but i set it down here though with some shame yet no self reproach because the events of the last day or two had been more than i could bear and i must needs weep and cry even though my tears and lamentations went to the heart of my gentle lady who could not bear to see me suffer for consider the son of my kindest friends to be lying like to die run through the body by my lover i could not be suffered to see his mother who had been almost my own mother i could never more bear to meet my pretty nancy without thinking how unwittingly i had enchanted this poor boy and so lured him to his death that merry saucy girl would be merry no more all our ways of kindly mirth and innocent happiness were gone never to return even if will recovered how could there any more be friendship between him and me for the memory of his villainous attempt could never be effaced there are some things which we forgive because we forget but this thing though i might forgive none of us would ever forget and at the back of all this trouble was my secret which i was now in some words i knew not what to confess to my lord poor mrs esther gave way to all i wanted she would leave epsom on monday indeed her boxes should be packed in a couple of hours she kissed and soothed me while i wept and exclaimed in terms which she could not understand upon woman's perfidy and man's fond trust when i was recovered from this fit which surely deserved no other name in which passion got the better of reason and reason and modesty were abandoned for the time if solomon stallabras had seen me then how would he have been ashamed for his blind infatuation we were able calmly to begin our preparation first we told cicely to go order us a post chaise for monday morning for we must go to london without delay then i folded and packed away mrs esther's things while she laid her down to rest awhile for her spirits had been greatly agitated by my unreasonable behaviour then cicely came to my room to help me and presently i saw her tears falling upon the linen which she folded and laid in the trunk foolish cicely i said thinking of my own foolishness why do you cry o miss kitty she sobbed who would not cry to see you going away never to come back again for i know you never never could come here any more after that dreadful carrying away enough to frighten a maid into her grave and besides they say that epsom is going to be given up and the assembly rooms pulled down and we should not have had this gay season unless it had been for my lord and his party at the durdans and what we shall do mother and me i can't even think why here was another trouble miss kitty this silly girl threw herself on her knees to me and caught my hand take me into your service when you marry my lord how do you know i am to marry my lord cicely there are many things which may happen to prevent it oh i know you will because you are so beautiful and so good i snatched my hand away i haven't offended you miss kitty have i all the world cries out that you are as good as you are beautiful and haven't i seen you for near two months always considerate and never out of temper with anybody not even with me or your hairdresser or your dressmaker whereas miss peggy baker slaps her maid and sticks pins into her milliner that is enough cicely i said i have no power to take anybody into my service being as penniless as yourself but if if that event should happen which you hope for why then i do not say it will happen oh i know that it will happen i have dreamed of it three times running and always before midnight i threw a piece of apple peel yesterday and called it to name your husband it first made a g which is geoffrey and then a c which is chudleigh and mother says that everything in the house points to a wedding as true as she can read the signs o miss kitty may i be in your service i laughed and cried i know not which for the tears were very near my eyes all that time but oh that thing did happen which she prophesied and i longed for i will quickly tell you how and as i have said before i took cicely into my service and a good and faithful maid she proved and married the curate i forgot to say that when young lord eardesley heard the story of her father's elopement with jenny medlicott he laughed because his mother jenny's friend and far off cousin had taken her away to virginia with her where after i hope the death of joshua crump she had married again jenny it appeared was the daughter of the same alderman whose fall in ruined my poor ladies and it was for this reason that his lordship afterwards when cicely had a houseful of babies took a fancy to them and would have them when they were big enough out to virginia here he made them overseers and in course of time settled them on estates of their own where some of them prospered and some as happens in all large families wasted their substance and fell into poverty the next day being sunday we spent chiefly over our devotions it was moving to hear the congregation invited to pray for one in grievous danger meaning poor will who would have been better at this moment had he sometimes prayed for himself nancy sat beside me in our pew and caught my hand at the words one could not choose but weep poor child for there was no improvement in will's fever all night long the doctor had sat beside his bed while the lad in his delirium fancied himself riding races wrestling boxing and drinking with his boon companions a pitiful contrast the pleasures of the world in his mind and eternity in prospect yet for a man in delirium allowance must be made the fever was now in fact at its height and four men were necessary to hold him down in his ravings we spent a gloomy sunday indeed mrs esther being so saddened by the anxieties of our friends that she resumed her reading of drelincourt on death a book she had laid aside since we left the rules and we observed a fast not so much from religious motives as because in the words of mrs esther roast veal and stuffing is certain to disagree when a heart of sensibility is moved by the woes of those we love in the evening we had it cold when nancy came to sit with us her eyes red with her weeping and we were fain to own that we were hungry after crying together all day long hot meat said mrs esther at such a juncture would have choked us nancy said that after what had happened it would certainly be impossible for us to stay longer at epsom and that for herself all she hoped and expected now was shame and disgrace for the rest of her life she wished that there were convents in the country to which she could repair for the rest of her days go with her hair cut short get up in the middle of the night for service and eat nothing but bread and water for she said i shall never cease to think that my own brother tried to do such a wicked thing nancy as a nun made us all laugh and so with spirits raised a little we kissed and said farewell nancy promised to let me know every other day by post whatever the letter should cost how things went it seemed to me indeed as if seeing that will had not died in the first twenty four hours the chance was somewhat in favour of his recovery and he was so strong a man and so young i sent a message of duty and respect to sir robert i dared not ask to have my name so much as mentioned to will's mother and left nancy in her trouble full of mine own before we started next morning cicely went for news but there was no improvement the stable boy she told me was going about the town his arm bandaged up saying that if ever a man was murdered in cold blood it was his master because he had never a sword and only a stick to defend himself with also it was reported that among the lower classes the servants grooms footmen and such the feeling was strong that the poor gentleman had met with foul play asked whether they understood rightly what mr will levett was doing cicely replied that they knew very well and that they considered he was doing a fine and gallant thing one which would confer as much honour upon the lady as upon himself which shows that in this world there is no opinion too monstrous to be held by rough and uneducated people wherefore we ought the more carefully to guard the constitution and prevent the rabble from having any share in public business or the control of affairs our carriage took us to london in three hours the road being tolerably good and so well frequented after the first three miles that there was little fear of highway robbers or footpads and so we came back to our lodgings in red lion street after such a two months as i believe never before fell to the lot of any girl remember that i was a wife yet a maiden married to a man whom i had never seen except for a brief quarter of an hour who knew not my name and had never seen me at all making allowance for the state of drunkenness in which he was married that i knew this man's name but he knew not mine that i met him at epsom and that he had fallen in love with me and i god help me with him yet that there was no way out of it no escape but that before he could marry me again i must needs confess the deceit of which i had been guilty no heaven say the roman catholics without purgatory yet suppose after going through purgatory one were to miss one's heaven how could i best go to my lord and tell him he was in hiding in the rules of the fleet and in our old lodging looking over the fleet market by one window and over fleet lane by the other a pleasant lodging for so great a lord could i go down to him in hoops and satin to tell him in that squalid place the whole truth yet go i must now while we drove rapidly along the road which is smooth and even between epsom or at least between streatham and london a thought came into my mind which wanted after a little nothing but the consent of mrs esther a dozen times was i upon the point of telling her all and as many times did i refrain because i reflected that although she knew all about the carrying away of girls from the romances which she read a secret marriage in the fleet although she had lived so long in the rules and even knew my uncle and thought him the greatest of men was a thing outside her experience and would therefore only terrify her and confuse her therefore i resolved to tell her no more than i was obliged but then my plans made it necessary that i should leave her for a while two or three days perhaps or even more so soon therefore as we had unpacked our trunks and mrs esther was seated in an arm chair to rest after the fatigues of the rapid journey i began upon the subject of getting away from her hypocritically pleading my duty towards the doctor my uncle i said that i thought i ought to pay him a visit and that after my return to london he would certainly take it unkindly if i did not that considering the character of the place in which he unhappily resided it was not to be thought that a person of mrs esther's sensibility could be exposed to its rudeness and that with her permission i would the next day take a coach and unless the doctor detained me i would return in the afternoon we had so firmly maintained our resolution to forget the past that mrs esther only smiled when i spoke of the rudeness of the market and said that no doubt it was desirable for a gentlewoman to keep away from rude and unpolished people so that the elevation of her mind might not be disturbed by unpleasant or harassing scenes at the same time she added there were reasons doubtless why i should from time to time seek out that great and good man now in misfortune to whom we all owed a debt of gratitude which never could be repaid she therefore gave me permission to go there it being understood that i was to be conveyed thither and back again in a coach in the morning after breakfast i dressed myself for the journey and because i thought it likely that i might remain for one night at least and perhaps more i took with me a bag containing my oldest and poorest clothes those namely in which i was dressed while in the market then i wrapped myself in a hood which i could pull if necessary over my face and so disguised i stole down the stairs london streets are safe for a young woman in the morning when the throng of people to and fro keeps rogues honest i walked through fetter lane remembering that here solomon stallabras was born indeed i passed a little shop over which the name was painted on a swinging sign of the silver garter so that one of his relatives still carried on the business then i walked along fleet street crowded with chairs carriages waggons and porters the templars were lounging about the gates of their inns the windows of the many vintners' houses were wide open and within them were gentlemen drinking wine early as it was the coffee houses were full of tradesmen who would have been better at home behind their counters ladies were crowding into the shops having things turned over for them 'prentices jostled each other behind the posts grave gentlemen walked slowly along carrying their canes before them like wands of office swaggering young fellows took the wall of every one except of each other the street was full of the shouting noise and quarrelling which i remembered so well at the end was the bridge with its quacks bawling their wares which they warranted to cure everything and its women selling hot furmety oysters and fish beyond the bridge rose before me the old gate of lud which has since been pulled down and on the left was the fleet market at sight of which as of an old friend i could have burst into tears the touters and runners for the fleet parsons were driving their trade as merrily as ever among them i recognised my old friend roger who did not see me by the blackness of one eye and the brown paper sticking to his forehead one could guess that competition among the brethren of his craft had been more than usually severe of late prosperity i thought to myself works speedy changes with us was it really possible that i had spent six long months and more in this stinking noisy and intolerable place why could i have had one moment of happiness when not only was i surrounded by infamy in every shape but i had no hope or prospect of being rescued in eight short months these things had grown to seem impossible death itself i thought would be preferable to living among such people and in the midst of such scenes i recognised them all it gave me pain to feel how familiar they were the mean scowling faces stamped with the seal of wicked lives and wicked thoughts such faces must those souls wear who are lost beyond redemption and the deformed men and boys who seemed to select this market as their favourite haunt there are many more deformed among the poor than with the better sort by reason of the accidents which befall their neglected children and maim them for life that would account for the presence of many of these monsters but not of all i suppose some of them come to the market because the labour of handling and carrying the fruit and vegetables is light though poorly paid there were hunchbacks in great plenty those whose feet were clubbed whose legs were knock kneed whose feet were turned inward whose eyes squinted i looked about me for but did not see a certain dreadful woman whom i remembered who sold shell fish at a stall and had fingers webbed like a duck but there was the other dreadful woman still in her place whose upper lip was horrid to look at for hair there was the cobbler who refused to shave because he said it was unscriptural and so sat like one of the ancients with a long white beard there were alas the little children pale hungry looking with eager sharp eyes in training for the whip the gallows or the plantation they ran about among the baskets they sat or stood among the stalls waiting for odd jobs messages and parcels to carry they prowled about looking for a chance to steal it was all as i remembered it yet had forgotten so quickly on the right the long wall of the fleet prison beyond that the doctor's house his name painted on the door i pulled my hood closer over my face and passed it by because before paying my respects to my uncle i was going to make inquiries about the man i loved he was as i knew in our old lodgings he slept unconscious in my room he sat where i had so often sat the place ought to have reminded him of me but he knew nothing the name of kitty pleydell was not yet associated in his mind with the rules of the fleet when we went away one of those who bade us god speed and shed tears over our departure was mrs dunquerque who as i have told lived above us with her husband captain dunquerque and her two little girls the captain who was not a good man or a kind man drank and gambled when he got any money and left his poor wife and children to starve it was to her that i meant to go she was a kind hearted woman and fond of me for certain favours i had been able to show her little girls i was sure to find her in the same lodgings because in the rules no one ever changes i came to the house i pulled the hood so close about my face that had my lord met me he would not have known me the door was standing wide open as usual i entered and mounted the stairs the door of the room our old room on the first floor was half open within oh my heart i saw my lord sitting at the table with paper before him pen in hand i dared not wait lest he might discover me but hastened upstairs to mrs dunquerque's room i was fortunate enough to find her at home the captain was gone abroad and had taken the children with him for a morning's walk she sat at home as usual darning mending and making but oh the cry of pleasure and surprise when she saw me and the kisses she gave me and the praise at my appearance and the questions after mrs esther i told her of all including sir miles lackington and solomon stallabras's good fortune then she began to tell me of herself they were as poor as when we went away but their circumstances had improved in one important particular for though the captain was no more considerate as i guessed from a word she dropped and drank and gambled whenever he could they had a friend who sent them without fail what was more useful to them than money food and clothes for the children and their mother she did not know who the friend was but the supplies never failed being as regular as those brought by the prophet's ravens i did not need to be told the name of this friend for in truth i had myself begged the doctor to extend his charity to this poor family and asked him to send them beef and pudding which the children could eat rather than money which the captain would drink this he promised to do truly charity in his case ought to have covered a multitude of sins for he had a hand ever open to give and a heart to pity moreover he gave in secret and never did his right hand know what his left hand was doing then i opened my business to mrs dunquerque but only partially i told her that on the first floor in the rooms formerly occupied by ourselves there was a young gentleman well known to sir miles lackington who had reason to be out of sight for a short time that he was also known to myself here i blushed and my friend nodded and laughed being interested as all women are in the discovery of a love secret that i was anxious for his welfare that i had made the excuse of paying a visit to the doctor in order to be near him that in fact i would be about him wait upon him and watch over him without his knowledge of my presence but he will most certainly know thee child she cried tell me my dear is he in love with thee he says so i replied perhaps he tells the truth and you o kitty to think of you only a year ago there is no doubt about me i said for oh dear mrs dunquerque i am head over ears in love with him yet i will so contrive that he shall not know me if you will help and what can i do make his acquaintance go and see him tell him that he must want some one to do for him offer to send him your maid phoebe yes phoebe then i will go and if he speaks to me which is not likely i will answer in a feigned voice go now mrs dunquerque i will dress for phoebe she laughed and went away my lord lifted his head as she knocked at the door i ask your pardon sir she said for this intrusion i live above you upon the second floor with my husband and children i suppose sir that like the rest of us in this place you come here because you cannot help it and a pity it is to find so young a gentleman thus early shipwrecked i thank you madam said my lord bowing for this goodwill the will is nothing sir because people in misfortune ought to help each other when they can therefore sir and because i perceive that your room is not what a gentleman's should be being inch thick with dust i will with your permission send down my maid when you go out who may make you clean and tidy i shall not go out replied my lord but i thank you for the offer of the girl i dare say the place might be cleaner she is a girl sir replied mrs dunquerque who will not disturb you by any idle chatter phoebe here she stepped out upon the stairs phoebe come downstairs this minute and bring a duster when phoebe came she was a girl whose hair was pulled over her eyes and she had the corner of her apron in her mouth she wore a brown stuff frock not down to her ankles her hands where whiter than is generally found in a servant her apron was of the kind which servant maids use to protect their frocks and she wore a great cap tied under the chin and awry as happens to maids in the course of their work in one respect beside her hands phoebe was different from the ordinary run of maidservants her shoes and stockings were so fine that she feared his lordship would notice them but he noticed her not at all neither shoes nor hands nor cap nor apron which though it was foolish made this servant girl feel a little pained phoebe said mrs dunquerque you will wait upon this gentleman and fetch him what he wants and now do but look at the dust everywhere saw one ever such untidiness quick girl with the duster and make things clean dear me to think of this poor gentleman sitting up to his eyes as one may say in a peck of dust she stood in the room with her work in her hand rattling on about the furniture and the fineness of the day and the brightness of the room which had two windows and the noise of the market which she said the young gentleman would mind more than nothing at all after a while as for the dreadful language of the porters and fishwives that she said was not pleasant at first but after a little one got so to say used to it and you no more expected that one of these wretches should speak without breaking the third commandment and shocking ears used to words of purity and piety than you would expect his grace the archbishop of canterbury himself to use the language of the market she advised the young gentleman further for his own good not to sit alone and mope but to go abroad and ruffle it with the rest to keep a stout heart to remember that fortune frowns one day and smiles the next being a deity quite capricious and untrustworthy therefore that it behoved a young man to have hope and she exhorted him in this end to seek out cheerful company such as that of the great doctor shovel the only chaplain of the fleet as learned as a bishop and as merry as a monk or even to repair to the prison and play tennis and racquets with the gentlemen therein confined but above all not to sit alone and brood why had he never a sweetheart to whom he could write and send sweet words of love whereby the heart of the poor thing would be lightened and her affections fixed so she rattled on while i nothing loth plied duster and cleaned up furniture with a zeal surpassing that of any housemaid yet because men never observe what is under their eyes he observed nothing of all this activity if i had crawled as slowly as possible over the work it would have been all one to him presently i came to the table at which he was sitting this too was covered with dust it had been our table formerly and had grown old in the service of the pimpernel ladies i brushed away the dust with great care and in so doing i saw that he had a letter before him just begun it commenced with these enchanting words love of my soul my goddess kitty oh that i could have fallen at his feet then and there and told him all but i could not i was afraid he had as yet written nothing more but on a piece of paper beside the letter he had traced the outlines of a woman's head whose head should it be i ask you but kitty's i was amazed at the sight my colour came and went phoebe cried mrs dunquerque warningly be careful how you touch the papers there sir we have your room straight for you it looks a little cleaner than it did awhile since surely he replied without looking around yes i am truly obliged to you madam as for this girl still he would not look at me perhaps he placed a whole crown piece in my hand a crown piece for such a simple piece of work enough to make the best of housemaids grasping this is how men spoil servants can i get you anything sir i asked in a feigned voice nothing child nothing stay yes one must eat a little sometimes get me some dinner by and by this was all for that time we went away and we spent the rest of the morning in making him such a little dinner as we thought must please him first we got from the market a breast of veal which we roasted with a little stuffing and dished with a slice or two of bacon nicely broiled some melted butter made with care and a lemon this to my mind forms a dish fit for a prince we added to this some haricot beans with butter and sweet herbs and a dish of young potatoes then we made a little fruit pudding and a custard nicely browned and at two o'clock put all upon a tray and i carried it downstairs still with my hair over my eyes my cap still awry and the corner of the apron still in my teeth i set the food before him and waited to serve him but he would not let me ah had he known how i longed to do something for him and what a happiness it was simply to make his dinner to prepare his vegetables for him and to boil his pudding but how should he guess i found sir miles's bottle of wine untouched in the cupboard and placed it on the table then i left him to his meal when i returned i found he had eaten next to nothing one could have cried with vexation lord sir i said still in my feigned voice if you do not eat you will be ill is there never a body that loves you he started but hardly looked at me a trick of voice he said yet it reminded me is there anybody who loves me child i think there is to be sure there is some one whom i love then sir you ought to eat if only to please her by keeping well and strong well well i dare say i shall be hungry to morrow you can take away the things phoebe if that is what they call you i could say no more but was fain to obey then as i could do no more for him i took up the tray and resolved to go and see the doctor with whom i had much to say therefore i put off my servant's garb with the apron and cap and drew the hood over my face again the doctor's busy time was in the morning in the afternoon after dinner he mostly slept in his arm chair over a pipe of tobacco i found him alone thus enjoying himself i know not whether he slept or meditated for the tobacco was still burning though his eyes were closed there is this peculiarity about noise in london that people who live in it and sleep in it do not notice it thus while there was a horrible altercation outside his very windows a thing which happened every day and all day long the doctor regarded it not at all yet he heard me open and shut the door and was awake instantly kitty he cried why child what dost thou here i hope sir i said that i find you in good health and spirits reasonable good kitty a man of my years be he never so temperate and regular in his habits finds the slow tooth of time gnawing upon him let me look at thy face humph one would say that the air of epsom is good for young maids' cheeks but why in fleet market child partly sir i came to see you and partly to see some one else of whose lodging in the rules i have been told by sir miles lackington tell me the young man whom he wounded is he dead nay sir not dead but grievously wounded and in a high fever so a man in early manhood who has been wounded by a sword running through his vitals who four days after the event is still living though in a high fever that man methinks is likely to recover unless his physician as is generally the case is an ass for my dear there are as many incompetent physicians as there are incapable preachers their name is legion well kitty you came about lord chudleigh have you seen him yes but sir he does not know that i am here i saw him here i blushed again in disguise as a housemaid ho ho ho laughed the doctor why girl thou hast more spirit than i gave thee credit for thou deservest him and shalt have him too the time is come he rose and folded his gown about him and put on his wig which for coolness' sake he had laid aside i will go to him and say 'my lord the person to whom you were married is no other than ' oh no sir i pray you do not speak to him in such fashion pray hear me first well well let us hear this little baggage the doctor was in very good spirits and eager to unfold this tale he sat down again however and took up his pipe go on then kitty go on i am listening this was indeed a very critical moment of my life for on this moment depended i foresaw all my happiness i therefore hesitated a little thinking what to say and how to say it then i began i reminded my uncle that when i first came under his protection i was a young girl fresh from the country who knew but little evil suspected none and in all things had been taught to respect and fear my betters i then reminded him how while in this discipline of mind i was one morning called away by him and ordered to go through a certain form which granting that i well knew it to be the english form of marriage service i could not really believe to mean that i was married and though my uncle assured me afterwards that such was the case i so little comprehended that it could be possible that i had almost forgotten the whole event then i said we had gone away from the rules of the fleet and found ourselves under happier circumstances where new duties made me still more forget this strange thing presently we went to epsom whither in the strangest way repaired the very man i had married after this i told him the most wonderful thing in the world happened to me for not only did my lord fall in love with me his legal wife but he gave me to understand that the only obstacle to his marrying me was that business in the fleet of which he informed me at length very good said the doctor things could not go better if the man has fallen in love with the girl he ought to be pleased that she is his wife nay that would not do either for here another thing of which the doctor had no experience being a man for when a woman falls in love with a man she must needs make herself as virtuous and pure in mind as she is brave in her dress in order the more to please him and fix his affection and what sort of love would that be where a woman should glory as it were in deception why his love would be changed if not into loathing then into a lower kind of love in which admiration of a woman's beauty forms the whole part now if beauty is everything even helen of troy would be a miserable woman a month after marriage when her husband would grow tired of her alas i cried i love him if you tell him as he must now be told that i was the woman who took a part in that shameful business yes sir even to your face i must needs call it shameful you may tell him at once that i release him so far as i can i will not acknowledge the marriage i will go into no court of law nor will i give any evidence to establish my rights whom god hath joined the doctor began oh i know i know and you are a clergyman of the church with power and authority by laying on of hands yet i cannot think i cannot feel that any blessing of heaven could rest upon a union performed in such a place is this room nightly desecrated by revellers a church is your profligate wretch roger a clerk where were the banns put up what bells were rung banns are no longer fashionable he replied but let me think he was not angry with my plainness of speech but rather the contrary let me think he went to his cupboard took out his great register and turned over the leaves ay here it is having a page to itself geoffrey lord chudleigh to catherine pleydell your ladyship is as truly lady chudleigh as his mother was before him but if you will give up that title and dignity here he smiled and tore out the page but carefully i will not baulk thee child here is the register and here the certificate of the wedding he put both together and laid them carefully aside come to me to morrow and i will then go with you to his lordship and give him these papers to deal with as he pleases chapter the last how lord chudleigh received his freedom i returned to my lodging there to await the event of the next morning my lord would learn that he was free so far good but with his freedom would come the news that the woman who restored it to him was the same who had taken it away and the same whom he had professed to love alas poor kitty now was i like unto a man sentenced to death yet allowed to choose the form of his execution whether he would be hanged poisoned beheaded stabbed shot drowned or pushed violently and suddenly out of life in some other manner which he might prefer as the time approaches his anxiety grows the greater until the fatal moment arrives when he must choose at once then in trouble and confusion he very likely chooses that very method which is most painful in the contemplation and the endurance so with me i might choose the manner of telling my lover all but tell him i must pray heaven i said to direct me into the best way in the afternoon i became once more phoebe phoebe carried a dish of tea would the gentleman choose to taste it he took it from phoebe's hand drank it and returned to his writing which was i believe a continuation of that letter the commencement of which i had seen in the evening sir miles paid him a visit of consolation he drank up what was left of the bottle and after staying an hour or so went away noisily promising himself a jovial night with the doctor at eight o'clock phoebe brought a tray with cold meat upon it but my lord would take none only bidding her to set it down and leave him can i do nothing more for you sir asked the maid he started again your voice child he said although i had disguised my voice reminds of one whose voice la sir she asked is it the voice of your sweetheart he only sighed and sat down again phoebe lingered as long as she could and then she went away then we all went to bed captain dunquerque had by this time brought home the little girls and gone to the doctor's where with sir miles and the rest he was making a night of it it was a hot night the window was open the noise of the brawling and fighting below was intolerable the smell from the market was worse than anything i remembered and the bed was a strange one added to all this my cares were so great that i could not sleep presently i arose and looked out just as i had done a year before when first i came to my uncle for protection everything was the same there was light enough to see the groups of those who talked and the forms of those who slept i remembered the old and the young as i had seen them in the bright light of a july dawn poor wretches destined from their birth to be soldiers of the devil elected for disgrace and shame born for newgate and bridewell brought into the world for the whipping post the cart tail and the gallows just the same and i alone changed for beneath me all unconscious was one whom i might call my husband then my thoughts went wholly out to him then i could neither sit nor rest nor stand still with thinking of the next day and what i had to say and how to say it oh my love my dear could i bear to give him up could i bear to see him turn away those eyes which had never looked upon me save with kindness and affection could i endure to think that his love was gone from me altogether death was better if death would come then crazed i think with trouble i crept slowly from the room and went down the stair till i reached the door of the room where my lord was lying and here i went on like a mad thing having just enough sense to keep silence yet weeping without restraint wringing my hands praying offering to heaven the sacrifice of my life if only my lover would not harden his heart to me and kissing the while the very senseless wood of the door within the room he was sleeping unconscious without i was silently crying and weeping full of shame and anxiety not daring to hope yet knowing full well his noble heart why had i weeks before dared to tell him all forgiveness would have been mine i knew it well yet now in such a place when he was reminded of the companions or at least the creatures who had surrounded her would he not harden his heart and refuse to believe that any virtue any purity could survive all this was of no avail when i was calmed a little i returned to my own room and sat upon the bed wondering whether any woman was so miserable in her shame as myself the long minutes crept on slowly the daylight was dawning the night had passed away captain dunquerque had rolled up the stairs noisily singing a drunken song the revellers below were quiet but the morning carts had begun when i fell asleep for weariness and when i awoke the sun was high so i arose dressed and hastened downstairs hoping to see the doctor before he sallied forth there had been roger told me with a smile a great night he meant that the doctor's guests had been many and their calls for punch numerous sir miles had been carried away to some place in the neighbourhood the doctor was still abed while we talked he appeared no whit the worse for his night's potations yet i thought his face was of a deeper purple than of old and his neck thicker that was very likely an idle fancy because a few months could make but little difference in a man of his fixed habits well kitty he was in good humour and apparently satisfied with the position of things i have thought over thy discourse of yesterday which i confess greatly moved me first because i did not know thee to be a girl of such spirit courage and dignity and second because i now perceive that the marriage performed in thy interest was perhaps as things have now turned out which is surely providential a mistake yet was it done for the best and i repent me not come then to my lord and let me talk to him first sir i begged tell him not my name he promised this though as he said the name was on the register and it was agreed between us that we should speak to my lord privately and then that he was to call me when i should play my part as best i could the doctor led the way when he entered the room i ran upstairs and with trembling hands made myself as fine as i could that is i was but in morning dishabille but i dressed my hair and put those little touches to my frock and ribbons which every woman understands and then i put on my hood which i pulled quite over my face and waited my lord rose angrily when he saw the doctor sir he said this visit is an intrusion i have no business with you i do not desire to see you leave the room immediately first said doctor shovel i have business with your lordship i can have no business with you replied lord chudleigh i have already had too much business with you go sir your intrusion is an insult dear dear the doctor replied this it is to be young and hot headed and to jump at conclusions whereas did the young gentleman know the things i have to say he would welcome me with open arms you come i suppose to remind me of a thing of which you ought to be truly ashamed so wicked was it nay nay not so wicked as your lordship thinks the doctor would not be put out of temper what a benefactor is he who makes young people happy with the blessing of the church i cannot i suppose use violence to this man said the other he is a clergyman and for the sake of his cloth must be tolerated would you kindly sir proceed at once to the business you have in hand and then begone if you come to laugh over the misfortune caused by yourself laugh and go your way if you come for money for the wretched accomplice in your conspiracy ask it and go in any case sir make haste my lord the doctor replied i am a messenger from one who conceives that she hath done you grievous wrong is very sorry for the past which she alone can undo and begs your forgiveness who is that person then his curiosity was roused and he waited in patience to hear what the doctor might have to say it is my lord the lady who may if she chooses call herself your wife my lord stood confused does she wish to see me she wishes to place in your hands here the doctor's voice became deeper and more musical like the low notes of a great organ the proofs of her marriage with you does your lordship comprehend she will stand before you bringing with her the only papers which exist to prove the fact she will put them in your own hands if you wish she will destroy them before your eyes if you wish and she will then retire from your presence and you shall never know unless you wish it the name of the woman you married but this is wonderful how shall i know that the papers are the only proof of the ceremony your lordship has my word my word of a christian priest i break the laws of god and of man daily i am however a sinner who still guards those rags and tatters of a conscience which most sinners hasten to throw away wherefore must my repentance be some day greater yet my lord my word i never brake nor ever looked to hear it questioned you shall have all the proofs you shall be free if you please from this moment you shall never be molested reproached threatened or reminded of the past free my lord repeated looking the doctor in the face i cannot but believe sir what you solemnly aver to be the truth yet what am i to think of this generosity how interpret it by what acts have i deserved it what am i to do in return is there any pitfall or snare for me in return you will grant her your forgiveness that is a pitfall if you please you will also expect a surprise strange said lord chudleigh kitty asked me too to forgive this woman my forgiveness does she ask for no money my lord you are utterly deceived in your belief as to this woman and her conduct by your leave i will tell you the exact truth you know because i told you that the wrong inflicted upon me by your father was my justification from a worldly point of view for the advantage which i took of your condition you think i suppose that some miserable drab was brought in from the market to play the part of dummy wife and threaten you and persecute you for money you are wrong there was living in this place at the time with a lady of ruined fortunes a young woman of gentle birth by her father's side though penniless she was beautiful exceedingly well educated a god fearing damsel and a good girl by her mother's side she was my niece that branch of her family being of obscure origin on the death of her father she became for a time my ward which was the reason why she lived here no fit place for a girl of good reputation i own though at the time i could do no better for her she was not only all that i have described her in appearance carriage and virtues but she was as well very much afraid of me her guardian she had been brought up to obey without questioning her spiritual pastors and masters and all who might be placed in authority over her this girl it was whom you married the doctor paused to let his words have due effect when i designed the treachery you being then sound asleep it first seemed to me that the fitting person for such a revenge as i at first proposed to myself would be one of those women who are confined to the fleet for life unless by hook or crook they can get them a husband such a one i sent for i did not disclose the name of the man i proposed because i found her only too eager to marry any one upon whom she could saddle her debts and so make him either pay them or change places with her but while i talked with the woman i thought how cruel a thing it would be for your lordship to be mated with such a wife and i resolved if i did give you a wife against your knowledge that she should be worthy to bear your name accordingly i despatched this person who is still i suppose languishing in the prison hard by and sent for the young lady she came unsuspiciously i told her with a frown which made her tremble that she was to obey me in all that i ordered her to do and i bade her then take her place at the table and repeat such words as i should command she obeyed your lordship knows the rest but she knew she must have known that she was actually married she could not understand she had seen marriages performed but then it was in a church with regular forms she did not know until i told her besides i ordered her and had my command been to throw herself from a high tower she would have obeyed she was not yet seventeen she was country bred and she was innocence itself poor child said my lord she has left the rules of the fleet for some time she knows that at any time she might claim the name and the honours of your wife but she has refrained though she has had hundreds of opportunities now however she declares that she will be no longer a party to the conspiracy and she is desirous of restoring into your own hands the papers of the marriage will your lordship first forgive her tell her said my lord that i forgive her freely where is she she waits without then he called me but not by name my knees trembled and shook beneath me as i rose pulled the hood tighter over my face and followed the doctor into the room in my hand i held the papers this said the doctor is the young gentlewoman of whom we spoke the papers are in her hands child give his lordship the papers i held them out and he took them all this time he never ceased gazing at me but he could see nothing not even my eyes are we playing a comedy he asked doctor shovel are we dreaming all of us everything my lord is real you hold in your hands the certificate of marriage and the register not copies the actual documents before you read the papers and learn the lady's name tell her in my hearing that you forgive her she bids me tell you for her that since she learned the thing that she had done what it meant and whose happiness it threatened she has had no happy day forgiveness said my lord in a voice strangely moved while his eyes softened forgiveness madam is a poor word to express what i feel in return for this most generous deed it is a thing for which i can find no word sufficient to let you know how great is my gratitude learn madam that my heart is bestowed upon a woman whose perfections to my mind are such that no man is worthy of her but she hath graciously been pleased to accept and even to return my affection now by this act because i cannot think that we are bound together in the eyes of the church by that form of marriage service it is a question said the doctor which it would task the learning of the whole country to decide by ecclesiastical law but let us leave this question unconsidered nothing need ever be said about the matter your lordship is free then he still held the papers in his hand and seemed in no way anxious to satisfy his curiosity as to the name of the woman who had caused so much anxiety before we part perhaps never to meet again may i ask to be allowed to see the face of the lady who has performed this wonderful act of generosity i trembled but made no answer stay a moment he said remember that you have given up a goodly estate with a large fortune and an ancient name things which all women rightly prize these things you have given away do you repent i shook my head then let me never know he tore the papers into a thousand fragments let me never know the name of the woman to whom i owe this gift let me think of her as of an angel the doctor took me by the arm as if to lead me away since you do not want to know her name my lord i do not see any reason why you should let us go child may i only see her face he asked come child urged the doctor come away there is no need my lord but those words about myself his nobleness had touched me to the heart i could deceive him no longer i threw back the hood put up my hands to my face and fell at his feet crying and sobbing it is i my lord it was kitty pleydell herself the woman whom you thought so good oh forgive me forgive me have pity now i seem to have no words to tell how he raised me in his strong arms how he held me by the waist and kissed me crying that indeed there was nothing in his heart towards me but love and tenderness would it not be a sin to write down those words of love and endearment with which when the doctor left us alone he consoled and soothed me i hid nothing from him i told him how i had well nigh forgotten the dreadful thing i had done until i saw him again at the assembly how from day to day my conscience smote me more and more and yet i dared not tell him all for fear of losing his respect let us pass this over the story of kitty is nearly told we forgot all about poor will and the reason why my lord should for a while lie close we agreed that we would be married quietly in due form and of course at church as soon as arrangements could be made and then nothing would do but my lord must carry me to mrs esther and formally ask her permission to the engagement you may think how happy was i to step into the coach which brought me back to my dear lady with such a companion he led me into her presence with a stately bow madam he said i have the honour to ask your permission to take the hand of your ward miss kitty who hath been pleased to lend a favourable ear to my proposals be assured dear madam that we have seriously weighed and considered the gravity of the step which we propose to take and the inclination of our hearts and i beg you madam to believe that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to making this dear girl as happy as it is in the power of one human creature to make another mrs esther was perfectly equal to the proper ceremonies demanded for the occasion although as she confessed she was a great deal surprised at the suddenness of the thing which notwithstanding that she had expected it for many weeks came upon her with a shock she said that his lordship's proposal was one which the world would no doubt consider a great condescension seeing that her dear kitty though of good family had no other prospects than the inheritance of the few hundreds which made her own income but for her own part knowing this child as she did and here she spoke in terms of unmerited praise of beauty and goodness and such qualities as i could lay but small claim to possess yet resolved to aim at them finally she held out her own hand to his lordship saying therefore my lord as i consider kitty my daughter so henceforth will i consider you my son and may god keep and bless you both and give you all that the heart of a good man may desire with children good and dutiful long and peaceful lives and in the end to sit together for ever in happy heaven whereupon she wept falling on my neck now while we were thus weeping and crying came sir miles who immediately guessed the cause and wished my lord joy shaking him by the hand then he must needs kiss my hand the doctor he explained told me where i should most likely find you the doctor's knowledge of the human heart is most extensive i would i had the doctor's head for punch my lord this is a lucky day will levett is out of his fever and hath signed a written confession that your sword was drawn in self defence and that had he not been run through his cudgel would have beaten out your brains therefore there is no more to keep us in hiding and we may go about joyfully in the open as gentlemen should and as for will he may die or live as seemeth him best nay sir miles i said pray that the poor lad live and lead a better life this is the story of kitty pleydell how she came to london and lived in the rules of the fleet how she was made to go through the form of a marriage how she left the dreadful noisy wicked place how she went to epsom how lord chudleigh fell in love with her to her unspeakable happiness and how she told him her great secret the rest which is the history of a great and noble man married to a wife whose weakness was guided and led by him in the paths of virtue discretion and godliness cannot be told i have told what befell some of the actors in this story solomon stallabras i have explained married the brewer's widow will levett recovered and did not repent but lived a worse life after his narrow escape than before as for the rest mrs esther remained with us either at chudleigh court or our town house harry temple was wise enough to give up pining after what he could not get and married nancy so that she too had her heart's desire sir miles went on alternately gaming and drinking till he died of an apoplexy at forty there remains to be told the fate of the chaplain of the fleet when they passed the marriage act of the fleet weddings were suddenly stopped they had been a scandal to the town for more than forty years so that it was high time they should be ended but when the end actually came the doctor who had saved no money was penniless nor could he earn money in any way whatever nor had he any friends although there were hundreds of grateful hearts among the poor creatures around him who could contribute to his support except ourselves mrs esther on learning his sad condition instantly wrote to offer him half her income my husband for his part sent a lawyer among his creditors found out for what sum he could effect a release paid this money which was no great amount and sent him his discharge then because the doctor would have been unhappy out of london he made him a weekly allowance of five guineas reckoning that he would live on one guinea drink two guineas and give away two he lived to enjoy this allowance for ten years more going every night to a coffee house where he met his friends drank punch told stories sang songs and was the oracle of the company he took great pride in the position which he had once occupied in the rules of the fleet and was never tired of boasting how many couples he had made into man and wife i know that his life was disreputable and his pleasures coarse yet when i think of the doctor and of his many acts of kindness and charity i remember certain texts and i think we have reasonable ground for a christian's hope as regards his deathbed repentance which was as sincere as it was edifying transcriber's note spelling punctuation hyphenation etc have been made consistent though not modernised
