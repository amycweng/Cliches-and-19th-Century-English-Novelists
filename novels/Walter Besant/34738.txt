dering in a rare interval of work occupied himself with looking into his bank book those humble persons whom the city estimating the moral and spiritual worth of a man by his income calls small frequently and anxiously examine their bank books add up the columns and check the entries mr dering who was not a small man but a big man or rather from a city point of view a biggish man very seldom looked at his bank book first because like other solicitors in large practice he had clerks and accountants to do that kind of work for him next because like many solicitors while he managed the affairs of other people with unceasing watchfulness he was apt to neglect his own affairs happily when one has an income of some thousands private affairs from time to time force themselves upon their owner in the most agreeable manner possible they obtrude themselves upon him they insist upon being noticed they compel him to look after them respectfully to remove them from the dulness of the bank and to make them comfortable in investments mr dering opened the book therefore having for the moment nothing else to do looked at the balance was satisfied with its appearance and began working backwards that is to say upwards to read the entries presently he came to one at which he stopped holding his forefinger on the name it was on the righthand side the side which to small men is so terrifying because it always does its best to annihilate the cash balance and seems bent upon transforming addition into multiplication so amazing are the results the name which mr dering read was edmund gray the amount placed in the same line opposite to that name was l therefore he had drawn a cheque to the order of edmund gray for the sum of l now a man may be in very great practice indeed but if like mr dering he knows the details of every case that is brought into the house he would certainly remember drawing a cheque for l and the reason why it was drawn and the person for whom it was drawn especially if the cheque was only three weeks old seven hundred and twenty pounds it is a sum in return for which many and very substantial services must be rendered edmund gray he murmured strange i cannot remember the name of edmund gray who is edmund gray why did i give him l the strange fact that he should forget so large a sum amused him at first beside him lay a book which was his private diary he opened it and looked back for three months he could find no mention anywhere of edmund gray to repeat he knew all the details of every case that came into the house he signed all the cheques his memory was as tenacious and as searching as the east wind in april yet this matter of edmund gray and his cheque for l he could not recall to his mind by any effort there is a certain stage in brain fatigue when one cannot remember names it is the sure and certain symptom of overwork the wise man recognises the symptom as a merciful warning and obeys it mr dering knew this symptom i must take a holiday he said at sixtyseven one cannot afford to neglect the least loss of memory edmund gray to forget edmund gray and l i must run down to the seaside for a fortnights rest he shut up the bank book and tried to go back to his work but this name came back to him edmund gray he murmurededmund gray who on earth is this edmund gray why did he get a cheque for l the thing ceased to amuse him it began to irritate him in two minutes it began to torture him he leaned back in his chair he drummed with his fingers on the table he took up the book and looked at the entry again he got up and walked about the rooma long lean figure in a tight frockcoat to walk about the room and to swing your arms often stimulates the memory in this case however no good effect followed the nomme edmund gray remained a name and nothing morethe shadow of a name mr dering rapped the table with his paperknife as if to conjure up that shadow futile superstition no shadow appeared but how could the shadow of a namean unknown namecarry off golden sovereigns i feel as if i am going mad he murmured seven hundred and twenty pounds paid by myself in a single lump only three weeks ago and i remember nothing about it i have no client named edmund gray the money must therefore have been paid by me for some client to this unknown person yet it was paid by my cheque and i dont remember it strange i never forgot such a thing before there was an office bell on the table he touched it a clerkan elderly clerkan ancient clerkobeyed the call he was the clerk who sat in the room outside mr derings office the clerk who wrote the cheques for the chief to sign brought back the letters when they had been copied directed the letters for the post received visitors and passed in cards in fact the private secretary stagemanagerwe all want a stagemanager in every professionor confidential clerk as befits a man of responsibility he was dressed all in black his office coat being as shiny as a mirror on the arms and on the shoulders by long habit it hung in certain folds or curves which never unbent his face was quite shaven and shorn all that was left of his white hair was cut short his eyes were keen and even foxy his lips were thin his general expression was one of watchfulness when he watched his master it was with the attention of a servant when he watched anybody else it was as one who watches a rogue and would outwit him if he could at his own roguery in certain commercial walks of the lower kind where honour and morality consist in the success of attempts to cheat each other this kind of expression is not uncommon whether his expression was good or bad he was an excellent clerk he was always at his post at nine in the morning he never left the office before seven and because mr dering was a whale for work he sometimes stayed without a grumble until eight or even nine man and boy checkley had been in the office of dering son for fiftyfive years entering as an errandboy at twelve checkley said his master look at this bank book credit side fourth entry have you got it edmund gray l the clerk read yes what is that cheque for who is edmund gray the clerk looked surprised i dont know he said why did i pay that money the clerk shook his head did you look at the book when you laid it on the table the clerk nodded wellwhat did you think of it i didnt think of it at all it wasnt one of the cheques you told me to draw about that time ago if i had thought i should have supposed it was your private business i was not aware checkley that i have any private affairs that you do not know wellbut you might have true i might have just so as i haventwho i ask you againwho is this edmund gray i dont know have you ever heard of any edmund gray never to my knowledge this is the first time you have heard that name the lawyer persisted the very first time consider is there any edmund gray in connection with any of my clients not to my knowledge not to your knowledge has any edmund gray ever been employed about the office nocertainly not we have recently been painted and papered and whitewashed and new carpeted at great expense and inconvenience did edmund gray conduct any of those operations no has the name of edmund gray ever been mentioned in any letters that have come here it was notorious in the office that checkley read all the letters that came and that he never forgot the contents of any if you named any letter he would at once tell you what was written in it even if it were twenty years old i have never even heard the name of edmund gray in any letter or in any connection whatever the clerk replied firmly i put all these questions checkley because i was pretty certain myself from the beginning but i wanted to make myself quite certain i thought it might be a trick of failing memory now look at the name carefullythe clerk screwed up his eyes tightly in order to get a good grip of the name you see i have given him a cheque for l only three weeks ago i am not the kind of man to give away l for nothing yet i have actually forgotten the whole business certainly he did not look the kind of man to forget such a simple thing as the giving away of l quite the contrary his grave face his irongrey hair his firm lips his keen steady eyes apart from the methodical regularity with which his papers were arranged before him all proclaimed that he was very far from being that kind of man very much the reverse indeed you dont mean to say sir checkley began with a change in his face from watchfulness to terroryou cant mean i mean this checkley i know of no edmund gray and unless the bank has made a mistake there has been committedawhat do they call it in the lawcourts the clerk held the bank book in his hand staring at his master with open eyes what he repeated what do they call it good lord they call it forgeryand for l and on you of all people in the world and in this office in our officeour office what a dreadful thing to be sure oh what a dreadful thing to happen in our officehere the clerk seemed unable to express his astonishment first of all get me the returned cheques the cheques always came back in the pocket of the bank book checkley was accustomed to take them out and to file them in their proper place again mr dering neither drew his cheques nor wrote his letters with his own hand he only signed them one clerk wrote the letters another drew the cheques by his instruction and dictation checkley went back to his own room and returned with a bundle of returned drafts he then looked in the safea great fireproof safethat stood open in one corner of the room and took out the current cheque book here it is he said check drawn by you yourself in your own handwriting and properly signed payable to ordernot crossedand duly endorsed now you understand why i know nothing about it edmund gray esquire or order seven hundred and twenty pounds signed dering son your own handwriting and your own signature let me look mr dering took the paper and examined it his eyes hardened as he looked you call this my handwriting checkley iii did think it was the clerk stammered let me look again and i think so still he added more firmly then youre a fool look again when did i ever sign like that mr derings handwriting was one of those which are impossible to be read by any except his own clerks and then only when they know what to expect thus when he drew up instructions in lawyer language he expressed the important words by an initial a medial or a final consonant and made scratches for all the words between his clerks however understood him very well if he had written a love letter or a farce or a ballade or a story no one either clerks or friends or compositors would have understood anything but a word here and a word there for his signature however that was different it was the signature of the firm it was a signature a hundred and twenty years old it was an eighteenthcentury signature bold large and clear every letter fully formed with dots and flourishes the last letter concluding with a fantasia of penmanship belonging to a time when men knew how to write belonging to the decorative time of penmanship two of the dots are out of place said checkley and the flourish isnt quite what it should be but the cheque itself looks like your hand he added stoutly i ought to have seen that there was something wrong about the signature though it isnt much i own to that but the writing is like yours and i would swear to it still it isnt my handwriting at all then where is the counterfoil checkley turned over the counterfoils what is the date he asked march the th i cant find it here are cheques for the rd and for the th but none at all for the th let me look strange there was no counterfoil and the numbers did not agree with that on the cheque you havent got another cheque book have you no i certainly have not mr dering sat with the cheque in his hand looking at it then he compared it with a blank cheque why he said this cheque is drawn from an old booktwo years oldone of the books before the bank amalgamated and changed its title and the form of the chequesnot much of a change it is truebuthow could we be such fools checkley as not to see the difference then somebody or other must have got hold of an old cheque book shameful to have cheque books lying about for every common rogue to go and steal mr dering reflected then he looked up and said look again in the safe in the lefthand compartment over the drawer i think you will find an old cheque book it belonged to a separate accounta trust that has been closed the book should be thereah there it isi wonder now the lawyer went on how i came to remember that book it is more than two years since i last used it or even thought of it another trick of memory we forget nothing in fact nothing at all give it to me strange that i should remember so slight a thing nowhere are the cheques you seecolour the samelettering the samesize the samethe only difference being the style and title of the company the fellow must have got hold of an old book left about as you say carelessly ah his colour changed heres the very counterfoil we wanted look the number corresponds the cheque was actually taken from this very book a book in my own safe in this very office checkley what does this mean checkley took the book from his master with a trembling hand and read feebly the writing of the counterfoil march th edmund gray l lord knows what it means he said i never came across such a thing in my life before most extraordinary it is two years since i have given a thought to the existence of that book yet i remembered it the moment when it became useful well checkley what have you got to say cant you speak nothingnothing o lord what should i have to say if you didnt draw that cheque with your own hand i did not draw that cheque with my own hand thenthen it must have been drawn by somebody elses hand exactly perhaps you dictated it dont be a fool checkley keep your wits together though this is a new kind of case for you criminal law is not exactly in your line do you think i should dictate my own handwriting as well as my own words no but i could sweari could indeedthat it is your writing let us have no more questions and answers it is a forgery it is a forgery it is not a common forgery it has been committed in my own office who can have done it let me thinkhe placed the cheque and the old cheque book before him this book has been in my safe for two years i had forgotten its very existence the safe is only used for my private papers i open it every morning myself at ten oclock i shut it when i go upstairs to lunch i open it again when i return i close it when i go away i have not departed from this custom for thirty years i could no more sit in this room with the safe shuti could no more go away with the safe openthan i could walk the streets in my shirt sleeves therefore not only has the forgery been committed by some one who has had access to my safe but by some one who has stolen the cheque in my very presence and before my eyes this consideration should narrow the field he looked at the cheque again it is dated march the th the date may mean nothing but it was presented on the th who came to my room on the th or the days preceding go and find out checkley retired and brought back his journal you saw on the th he read the list of callers that doesnt help said mr dering on the st d d and th you had mr arundel working with you here every day from ten till twelve mr arundel yes i remember anybody else nobody else you forget yourself checkley mr dering said you were as usual in and out at different times o lord sir i hope you dont think the old clerk stammered turning pale i think nothing i want to find out go to the bank see the manager let him tell you if he can find out by whom the cheque was cashed if in notesit must have been in noteslet those notes be instantly stopped it is not crossed so that we must not expect anything so simple as the clearing house go at once and find out exactly what happened this happened at about halfpast ten the bank was no more than five minutes walk yet it was twelve oclock when the clerk returned well what have you found out asked the master i have found out a great deal checkley began eagerly first i saw the manager and i saw the pay clerk the cheque was handed in by a commissionaire everybody trusts a commissionaire the pay clerk knows your signature and thought it was all right i showed the cheque to the manager he knows your handwriting and he says he would swear that the cheque was drawn by you yourself so i am not such a fool as you think go on the commissionaire told the pay clerk that he was ordered to take it all in tenpound notes he took them put them in his pouch and walked away he was a onearmed man and took a long time over the job and didnt seem a bit in a hurry about the notes the manager will stop them at once but he says that if the thing was done by an old hand there must be confederates in it and there will be trouble however the notes are stopped thats done then i went on to the commissionaires barracks in the strand the sergeant very soon found the man and i had a talk with him he was employed by an old gentleman he says staying at the cecil hotel strand the old gentleman sent him to the bank with instructions to get the money in tenpound notes and very particular he was with him about not losing any of them on the way he didnt seem a bit in a hurry either took the notes from the man and laid them in a pocketbook it was in the coffeeroom and half a dozen other gentlemen were there at the same time but this gentleman seemed alone humph a pretty cool business upon my word no hurry about it plenty of time that was because they knew that the old cheque book would not be found and examined why did they write the cheque on the counterfoil why did they put the cheque book back againafter they had taken it out i dont know the workings of a forgers brain are not within the compass of my experiences go on checkley the commissionaire says that he is certain he would know the gentleman again very good indeed if we can only find the gentleman i then went on to the cecil hotel and saw the head waiter of the coffeeroom he remembered the commissionaire being sent for he saw the bundle of banknotes brought back from the bank and he remembers the old gentleman very well says he should certainly know him again did he describe him there didnt seem anything particular to describe he was of average height so to speak dressed in grey trousers and a black frockcoat and was greyhaired much as if i was to describe you oh the notes are stopped yet in three weeks there has been ample time to get them all changed every note may have been changed into gold in three weeks an elderly gentleman grey hair average height that tells us nothing checkley the thing has been done by some one who had or still has access to my safe perhaps in some way or other keys have been procured in that case he stepped over to the safe and opened a drawer see checkley this drawer is untouched it is full of jewellery and things which belonged to my mother nothing touched here is a bag of spade guineas againnothing taken what do you say to that if the forger had possessed keys he would first of all have cleared out the things which he could turn into money without any difficulty and very little risk nothing taken except that cheque and the cheque book replaced what do you say to that eh i dont know what to say im struck stupid i never heard of such a thing before nor i why it must have been done in this room while the safe was open while i was actually present that is the only solution possible again who has been in this room all the callersi read their names to youyour clients they all sit in that chair they never leave that chair so long as they are with me he indicated the chair which stood at the corner of the lawyers great table at his left hand now the safe was in the far corner on the other side of the room they could not possibly checkley the only two who could possibly have access to that safe in office hours are yourself and mr arundel good heavens siryou cant believeyou cant actually think i believe nothing i told you so before i think nothing i want the facts the room was long rather than square lit by two large windows overlooking the gardens of new square lincolns inn the lawyer sat with his back to the fire protected by a canescreen before a large table on his left hand at the corner of the table stood the clients chair on his right hand between the two windows was a small table with a couple of drawers in it and in the corner to the left of any one writing at the small table and on the right hand of the lawyer was the open safe already mentioned there were two doors one communicating with the clerks room the other opening directly on the stairs the latter was locked on the inside call mr arundel said the chief while checkley was gone he walked to the window and observed that any one sitting at the table could by merely reaching out take anything from the safe and put it back again unobserved if he himself happened to be occupied or looking another way his grave face became dark he returned to his own chair and sat thinking while his face grew darker and his eyes harder until mr arundel appeared athelstan arundel was at this time a recently admitted member of the respectable but too numerous family of solicitors he was between two and three and twenty years of age a tall and handsome young fellow of a good manly type he was an exarticled clerk of the house and he had just been appointed a managing clerk until something could be found for him the arundels were a city family of some importance perhaps something in a city firm might presently be achieved by the united influence of family and money meantime here he was at work earning a salary and gaining experience checkleyfor his part who was as jealous of his master as only an old servant or a young mistress has the right to behad imagined symptoms or indications of a growing preference or favour toward this young gentleman on the part of mr dering certainly he had mr arundel in his own office a good deal and gave him work of a most confidential character besides mr dering was executor and trustee for young arundels mother and he had been an old friend and schoolfellow of his father and had known the young man and his two sisters from infancy mr arundel the lawyer began at his own house he addressed his ward by his christian name in the office as managing clerk he prefixed the courtesy title an extremely disagreeable thing has happened here nothing short of a forgerydont interrupt me if you pleasefor the young man looked as if he was about to practise his interjectionsit is a most surprising thing i admit you neednt say so however that wastes time a forgery on the fifth of this month three weeks ago a cheque apparently in my handwriting and with my signature so skilfully executed as to deceive even checkley and the manager of the bank was presented at my bank and duly cashed the amount islargeland the sum was paid across the counter in tenpound notes which are now stoppedif there are any left he kept his eyes fixed on the young man whose face betrayed no other emotion than that of natural surprise we shall doubtless trace these notes and through them of course the forger we have already ascertained who presented the cheque you follow certainly there has been a forgery the forged cheque has been cashed the notes are stopped have you any clue to the forgeryany suspicions as yet none we are only beginning to collect the facts the lawyer spoke in the coldest and most austere manner i am laying them one by one before you young arundel bowed observe then that the forged cheque belongs to a cheque book which has been lying forgotten by me in this safe for two years here is the book turn to the last counterfoil here is the cheque the forged cheque which corresponds you see perfectly the book has been in the safe for two years it has been taken out by someonepresumably the forgerthe cheque has been forged the counterfoil filled up and the book replaced why was all this trouble taken if the man had got the cheque why did he fill up the counterfoil why did he return the book i beg your pardon your questions are pertinent i come to the next point the safe is never opened but by myself it is open so long as i am in the room and at no other time certainly i know that very well the man who took out this cheque book forged the cheque and replaced the book must have done it in my very presence oh could not someonesomehowhave got a key i thought of that it is possible but the drawers are full of valuables jewellerycuriosall kinds of things which could easily be turned into money and they were not touched now had the safe been opened by a key these things would certainly have vanished so it would seem these are the main facts mr arundel oh one more we have found the messenger who cashed the cheque perhaps there are one or two other points of more or less importance there is only one more point i wish to bring before you of coursei make no chargei insinuate none but this must be rememberedthere are only two persons who have had access to this safe in such a manner as to make it possible for them to take anything out of it checkley nonono cried the old man and you yourself at the time of the robbery you were working at that table with the safe open and within reach of your left hand this is a fact mindone of the facts of the casenot a charge what cried the young man his cheek aflameyou mean i mean nothingnothing at all i want youand checkleywho alone have used this room not counting callers who sat in that chairto know the facts the factsyesof coursethe facts wellhe spoke rapidly and a little incoherentlyit is true that i worked herebutoh it is absurd i know nothing of any cheque book lying in your safe i was working at this tablehe went to the tablesitting in this chair how could i get up and search about in a safe for an unknown and unsuspected cheque book before your very eyes i do not know it seems impossible i only desire you to consider with me the facts had mr dering spoken just a little less coldly with just a little less dryness in his manner what followed would perhaps have been different yesthe facts repeated the young man welllet us get at the facts the chief fact is that whoever took that cheque and filled it up must have known the existence of that cheque book more than two years old it would seem so who could know about that old cheque book only one who had been about your office more than two years or one who had had opportunities of examining the safe now you sat therei sat herehe seated himself only turning the chair round how is it possible for a man sitting here to take anything out of that safe without your seeing him how is it possible for him without your knowledge to examine slowly and carefully the contents of the safe everything is possible said mr dering still coldly let us not argue on possibilities we have certain facts before us by the help of these i shall hope to find out others at five oclock every day i put the work in the drawer of this table and i go away he opened the drawer as if to illustrate this unimportant fact he saw in it two or three pieces of paper with writing on them he took them out good heavens he cried they are imitations of your handwriting checkley crossed the room swiftly snatched them from him and laid them before his master imitations of your handwriting he said imitationsexercises in forgerypractice makes perfect found in the drawer now mr dering looked at the papers and laid them beside the forged cheque an additional fact he said these are certainly imitations the probable conclusion is that they were made by the same hand that forged this cheque found in the drawer said checkley used by mr arundel never by me ah the only two are we these imitations will prove that im not in it the fact that these imitations are found in the drawer said mr dering is a fact which may or may not be important what cried the young man flaring up you think that i made those imitations i do not permit myselfyetto make any conclusions at all everything however is possible then this foolish young man lost his temper and his head you have known me all my life he cried you have known me and all my people yet at the first moment you are ready to believe that i have committed a most abominable forgery youmy fathers oldest friendmy mothers trustee my own guardian you pardon me there are certain facts in this case i have laid them before you i have shown to suspect me arundel repeated and all the time another manthat manyour clerkwho knows everything ever done in this office is in and about the place all day long the imitations said checkley quietly were found in his own drawerby himself who put them there who made them youvillain and scoundrel stop stop said mr dering coldly we go too fast let us first prove our facts we will then proceed to conclusions well sir you clearly believe that i forged your name and robbed you of all this money i have not got ten pounds in the world but that is not i suppose a fact which bears on the case you think i have seven hundred pounds somewhere very good think so if you please meanwhile i am not going to stay in the service of a man who is capable of thinking such a thing i leave your serviceat once get some one else to serve yousomebody who likes being charged with forgery and theft he flung himself out of the room and banged the door behind him he has run away said checkley actually run away at the very outset what do you think now i do not think we shall i daresay find out the truth in due course meantime these documents will remain in my keeping only i hope sir the clerk began that after what youve just seen and heard after such insolence and running away and all dont be an ass checkley so far as appearances go no one could get at the safe except you and arundel so far as the ascertained facts go there is nothing to connect either of you with the thing he is a foolish young man and if he is innocent which we must i suppose believebut his look did not convey the idea of robust faithhe will come back when he has cooled down the imitations of your handwriting in his drawer the man who forged the cheque said mr dering whoever he was could easily have written those imitations i shall see that hotheaded boys mother and bring him to reasonnow checkley we will resume work and not a word of this business if you please outside you have yourself to think of as well remember you as well as that boy have access to the safe enoughenough athelstan arundel walked home all the way foaming and raging no omnibus cab or conveyance ever built could contain a young man in such a rage his mother lived at pembridge square which is four good measured miles from lincolns inn he walked the whole way walking through crowds and under the noses of drayhorses carriagehorses and carthorses without taking the least notice of them when he reached home he dashed into the drawingroom where he found his two sistershilda and elsieone of them a girl of eighteen the other of thirteen with flaming cheeks and fiery eyes he delivered himself of his story he hurled it at their heads he called upon them to share his indignation and to join with him in scorn and contempt of the mantheir supposed best friend trustee guardian advisertheir fathers best friendwho had done this thingwho had accused him on the bare evidence of two or three circumstantial facts of such a crime there is something magnetic in all great emotions one proof of their reality is that they are magnetic it is only an actor who can endow an assumed emotion with magnetism elsie the younger girl fell into a corresponding sympathy of wrath she was equal to the occasion passion for passion she joined him and fed the flame butfor all persons are not magneticthe elder sister remained cold from time to time she wanted to know exactly what mr dering had said this her brother was too angry to remember she was pained and puzzled she neither soothed him nor sympathised with him then the mother returned and the whole story was told again elsie assisting now mrs arundel was a woman of great sense a practical woman a woman of keen judgment she prided herself upon the possession of these qualities which are not supposed to be especially feminine she heard the story with disturbed face and knitted brow surely she said what you tell me athelstan is beyond belief mr dering of all men to accuse youyouof such a thing it is impossible i wish it was impossible he accuses me of forging that cheque for l he says that while i was working in his office for him a fortnight ago i took a certain cheque book out of the safe forged his writing on a cheque and returned the cheque book this is what he says do you call that accusing or dont you certainly if he says that but how can hemr deringthe most exact and careful of men i will drive to lincolns inn at once and find out my dear boy pray calm yourself there isthere must besome terrible mistake she went immediately and she had a long interview with the solicitor mr dering was evidently much disturbed by what had happened he did not receive her as he usually received his clients sitting in his armchair he pushed back the chair and stood up leaning a hand on the back of it a tall thin erect figure grayhaired austere of face there was little to reassure the mother in that face the very trouble of it made her heart sink i certainly have not accused athelstan he said it is however quite true that there has been a robbery here and that of a large sum of moneyno less than l but what has that to do with my boy we have made a few preliminary inquiries i will do for you mrs arundel what i did for your son and you shall yourself understand what connection those inquiries have with him he proceeded coldly and without comment to set forth the case so far as he had got at the facts as he went on the mothers heart became as heavy as lead before he finished she was certain there is you see a way of presenting a case without comment which is more efficacious than any amount of talk and mrs arundel plainly perceivedwhich was indeed the casethat the lawyer had by this time little doubt in his own mind that her son had done this thing i thought it right he continued to lay before him these facts at the outset if he is innocent i thought he will be the better able to prove his innocence and perhaps to find the guilty person if he is guilty he may be led to confession or restitution the facts about the cheque book and the safe are very clear i am certain that the safe has not been opened by any other key the only persons who have had access to it are checkley and your son athelstan as for checkleyhe couldnt do it he could not possibly do it the thing is quite beyond him mrs arundel groaned this is terrible she said meantime the notes are numbered they may be traced they are stopped we shall certainly find the criminal by means of those notes mr deringmrs arundel rose and laid her hand on hisyou are our very old friend tell meif this wretched boy goes awayif he gives back the money that remainsif i find the restwill there beany furtherinvestigation to compound a felony is a crime it is however one of those crimes which men sometimes commit without repentance or shame my dear lady if he will confess and restorewe shall see mrs arundel drove home again she came away fully persuaded in her own mind that her sonher only sonand none other must be that guilty person she knew mr derings room well she had sat there hundreds of times she knew the safe she knew old checkley she perceived the enormous improbability of this ancient clerks doing such a thing she knew again what temptations assail a young man in london she saw what her trustee thought of it and she jumped to the conclusion that her sonand none otherwas the guilty person she even saw how he must have done it she saw the quick look while mr derings back was turned the snatching of the cheque book the quick replacing it her very keenness of judgment helped her to the conviction women less clever would have been slower to believe shameful miserable termination of all her hopes for her boys career but that she could think of afterwards for the moment the only thing was to get the boy awayto induce him to confessand to get him away he was calmer when she got home but he was still talking about the thing he would wait till the right man was discovered then he would have old dering on his knees the thing would be set right in a few days he had no fear of any delay he was quite certain that it was checkleythat old villain oh he couldnt do it by himself of coursenobody could believe that of him he had accomplicesconfederatesbehind him checkleys part of the job was to steal the cheque book and give it to his confederates and share the swag well mother he asked his mother sat down she looked pale and wretched mother cried hilda the elder sister quick what has happened what does mr dering say he accuses nobody she replied in a hard dry voice but but what asked hilda he told me everythingeverythingandandoh she burst into sobs and crying though she despised women who cry it is terrible it is terrible it is incredible yet what can i think what can any one think leave us hilda leave us elsie the two girls went out unwillingly oh my sonhow can i believe it and yeton the one hand a boy of twoandtwenty exposed to all the temptations of town on the other an old clerk of fifty years service and integrity and when the facts are laid before you bothcalmly and coldlyyou fly into a rage and run away while checkley calmly remains to await the inquiry mrs arundel had been accustomed all her life to consider mr dering as the wisest of men she felt instinctively that he regarded her son with suspicion she heard all the facts she jumped to the conclusion that he was a prodigal and a profligate that he had fallen into evil ways and spent money in riotous living she concluded that he had committed these crimes in order to get more money for more skittles and oranges athelstan she laid her hand upon his arm but did not dare to lift her eyes and behold that guilty faceathelstanconfessmake reparation so far as you canconfessoh my sonmy son you will be caught and tried and found guilty andoh i cannot say itthrough the notes which you have changed they are all known and stopped the boys wrath was now changed to madness you he cried you my own mother you believe it no oh we are all going mad together what then i am turned out of this house as i am turned out of my place i go theni go andhere he swore a mighty oath as strong as anybody out of spain can make themi will nevernevernever come home again till you come yourself to beg forgivenessyoumy own mother outside in the hall his sisters stood waiting and trembling athelstan cried the elder what in the name of heaven have you done go ask my mother she will tell you she knows it seems better than i know myself i am driven away by my own mother she says that i am guilty ofofof forgery if she says so athelstan his sister replied coldly she must have her reasons she would not drive you out of the house for nothing dont glare like that prove your innocence what you too oh i am driven away by my sisters as well no athelstanno cried elsie catching his hand not both your sisters my poor child he stooped and kissed her they will make you believe what they believe good heavens they make haste to believe it they are glad to believe it nono dont go athelstan elsie threw her arms about him stay and show that they are wrong oh you are innocent i will nevernevernever believe it he kissed her again and tore himself away the street door slammed behind him they heard his footsteps as he strode away he had gone then elsie fell into loud weeping and wailing but hilda went to comfort her mother mother she said did he really really and truly do it what else can i believe either he did it or that old clerk where is he he is gone he says he will come back when his innocence is proved mother if he is innocent why does he run away its foolish to say that it is because we believe it ive said nothing except that you couldnt believe it without reasons innocent young men dont run away when they are charged with robbery they stay and fight it out athelstan should have stayed later on when they were both a little recovered hilda tried to consider the subject more calmly she had not her mothers cleverness but she was not without parts the following remarksmade by a girl of eighteenprove so much mother she said perhaps it is better so long as this suspicion rests upon him that he should be away we shall certainly know where he is he will want money and will write for it if it should prove that somebody else did the thing we can easily bring him back as a martyrfor my own part i should be so glad that i would willingly beg his pardon on my kneesand of course we could easily get him replaced in the office if it is proved that he did do itand that you think they will be certain to find outmr dering for your sake will be ready to hush it upperhaps we may get the notes backhe cant have used them all in any case it will be a great comfort to feel that he is out of the way a brother convictedtried in open courtsentencedoh she shuddered we should never get over it never never it would be a most dreadful thing for elsie and me as for his going away if people ask why he is gone and where we must invent somethingwe can easily make up a storyhint that he has been wildthere is no disgrace happily about a young man being wildthat is the only thing that reconciles one to the horrid selfishness of wild young menand if by going away in a pretended rage athelstan has really enabled us to escape a horrid scandalwhy mother in that casewe may confess that the blow has been by providence most mercifully softened for usmost mercifully we ought to consider that mother yes dear yes but he is gone athelstan is gone and his future seems ruined there is no hope for him i can see no hope whatever my dear he was so promising i thought that all the family influence would be hiswe havent got a single city solicitor in the whole family i thought that he was so clever and so ambitious and so eager to get on and make money and be a credit to the family solicitors do sometimesespecially city solicitorsbecome so very very rich and now it is all gone and doneand nothing left to hope but the miserable wish that there should be no scandal it is indeed dreadful but stillconsiderno scandal mother i think we should find out if we can something about his private lifehow he has been living he has been out a good deal of evenings lately if there is anyany personon whom he has been tempted to spend moneyif he has been gamblingor betting or any of the things that i read ofthis young lady thanks to the beneficent assistance of certain works of fiction was tolerably acquainted with the ways of young men and their temptationsit would be a satisfaction to know it at least the ladies of a family where there is a wild young man do not generally find it easy to get at the facts of his wildness these remain locked up in the bosoms of his companions no details could be learned about any wildnessquite the contrary he seemed so far as could be learned to have led a very quiet and regular life but then said the philosopher of eighteen quoting from a novel men shelter each other they are all bad together butno scandal everybody knows that kind of brother or sister by whom all family events are considered with a view to the scandal likely to be caused and the personal injury resulting to himself or the envy that will follow and the personal advantage accruing from that event that her brother was perhaps a shameful criminal might be considered by hilda arundel later on at first she was only capable of perceiving that this horrid fact unless it could be hidden away and kept secret might very materially injure herself almost naturally she folded her hands sweetly and laid her comely head a little on one sideit is an attitude of resignation which may be observed in certain pictures of saints and holy women hilda knew many little attitudes also quite naturally she glanced at a mirror on the wall and observed that her pose was one of sorrow borne with christian resignation we must blame neither hilda nor her mother the case as put by mr dering in the form of plain fact without any comment did seem very black indeed against athelstan in every family the first feeling in such a caseit is the instinct of selfpreservationis to hush up the thing if possibleto avoid a scandal such a scandal as the prosecution of a brother for forgerywith a verdict of guiltyis a most truly horrible deplorable fatal thing it takes the respectability out of a family perhaps at a critical moment when the family is just assuming the robes of respectability it ruins the chances of the girls it blights the prospects of the boys it drives away friends it is a black spot which all the soaps ever advertised could never wash off therefore while the mother hoped first of all that the boy would escape the clutch of the law hilda was first of all grateful that there would be no scandal mr dering would not talk about it the thing would not interfere with her own prospects it was sad it was miserable but yetno scandal with what a deep deep sigh of satisfaction did the young lady repeat that there would probably be no scandal as for elsie that child went about for many days with tearful eyes red cheeks and a swollen nose she was rebellious and sharp with her mother and to her sister she refused to speak the days went on they became weeks months years otherwise they would not have been days nothing at all was heard of athelstan he sent no letters to any one he did not even write for money they knew not where he was or what he was doing he disappeared it was understood that there had been wildness nowwhich was very remarkablethough the forger had had a clear run of three weeks it could not be discovered that any of the notes had been presented perhaps they were sent abroad yet foreign and colonial banks would know the numbers of stopped notes and towards the discovery of the forger no further step had been taken the commissionaire who took the cheque had been as you have seen easily found he said he should know the old gentleman who gave him the forged draft to cash he said being again interrogated that checkley was not in the least like that old gentleman what could be thought then athelstan must have made up as an old man he was fond of private theatricals he could make up very well of course he had made up and then this point being settled they left off talking about the business other things happenedimportant thingswhich made the memory of the prodigal son to wax dim first of all came hildas case she was a graceful young person with features of great regularity her expression was cold her eyes were hard and her lips were a little thin but these things at nineteen are hardly perceived she was that sort of a girl who seems created for the express purpose first of wearing and beautifying costly raiment and next of sitting in a splendid vehicle the finer the dress the more beautiful she looked the grander the carriage the more queenly she seemed in rags her coldness would be arctic her hardness would be granitic in silk and velvet she became a goddess it was therefore most fitting that she should marry a rich man now to be rich in these days one must be old it is the price that one has to pay for wealth sometimes one pays the price and gets old and yet does not get what one has paid for that seems hardly fair there was a certain rich man mr derings younger brother sir samuel dering knight one of the most substantial city men a man who had a house in kensington palace gardens a yacht a country place in sussex and piles of papers in a safe meaning investments he was a widower without encumbrance he was fiftyseven years of age not yet decayed he wanted a wife to be the mistress of his house and to look well at his dinnerparties of course when one does want a wife at any age one wants her young hilda arundel his brothers ward looked as if she would discharge the duties required of the position admirably he suggested the arrangement to his brother who spoke about it there was a good deal of taking about it mrs arundel showed that she knew the value of her daughter but there was no doubt about the conclusion of the matter there was a grand wedding at which all the richer arundels were present and none of the poor relations mr dering the young ladys guardian gave her away hilda became lady dering and has been perfectly happy ever since elsie remained with her mother her brother was never spoken of between them but she remembered him and she was firm in her conviction that his innocence would be some day established after five years nothing at all having been heard of the notes mr dering made application to the bank of england and received from them the sum of l in new crisp notes in the place of those of which he had been robbed so that the actual loss at per cent compound interest amounted to no more than l s d which is more than one likes to lose yet is not actually embarrassing to a man whose income is about ten thousand a year he ceased to think about the business altogether except as a disagreeable episode of his office then athelstan arundel became completely forgotten his old friends the young men with whom he had played and sported only remembered him from time to time as a fellow who had come to some unknown grief and had gone away there is always some young fellow in every set of young fellows who gets into some scrape and so leaves the circle and is no more seen or heard of we go on just the same without him very seldom is such a man remembered long it is the way of the world we cannot stop to lament over the fallen we must push on others fall close up the ranks push on time drives the memory of the fallen swiftly waxes dim fours years or so after the mysterious business of edmund gray mr dering received a letter with an american stamp marked private and confidential he laid this aside until he had got through the business letters then he opened it he turned first to the signature ha he said athelstan arundel at last now we shall see we shall see he expected a full confession of the crime we should never expect says the sage what we desire because we never obtain what we expect it would have made mr dering more comfortable in his mind had the letter contained a confession of course athelstan had done it nobody else could have done it yet when he thought about the business at all there always arose in his mind an uneasy feeling that perhaps the boy had been treated unwisely it might have been more prudent to have kept the facts from him although they pointed so strongly in his direction until proof positive was obtained it might again have been better had the facts been put before him with a few words of confidence even though that confidence did not exist time only strengthened mr derings suspicions against the young man the thing must have been done by checkley or by him now checkley was not able if he had wished to imitate any handwriting no it was done by athelstan why he did it what he got by it seeing that those notes had never been presented no one could explain but he did ithe did it that was certain mr dering therefore began to read the letter with interest its commencement was without any opening words of respect or friendliness and it was not by any means the letter of a wicked man turning away from his wickedness not a word of repentance from beginning to end four years ago mr dering read you drove me from your place and changed my whole life by a suspicionamounting to a chargeof the gravest kind you assumed without explanation or examination that because certain facts seemed to point in a certain direction i had been guilty of an enormous crime that i had robbed my fathers oldest friend my mothers trustee my own guardian my employer of a great sum of money you never asked yourself if this suspicion was justified by any conduct of mineyou jumped at it quite wrong wilfully wrong said mr dering i laid the facts before him nothing but the facts i brought no charge i daresay that by this time the criminal has been long since detected had i remained i would have brought the thing home to him for of course it could be none other than your clerk i have thought over the case thousands of times the man who forged the cheque must have been one of twoeither your clerkthe man checkleyor myself it did not take you long i apprehend to learn the truth you would discover it through the presentation of the notesthis is a very crafty letter said mr dering when he never presented any of the notes very crafty he resumed the letterenough said about that i daresay however that i shall some day or otherbefore you are dead i hopereturn in order to receive some expression of sorrow from you if you can feel shamecertainly not said mr dering with decisionmeantime there is a service which i must ask of you for the sake of my people there is no one else whom i can ask it is the reason of my writing this letter i came away with ten poundsall i had in the worldin my pocket not seven hundred and twenty pounds as you imagined or suspected ten pounds with that slender capital i got across the atlantic i have now made twelve thousand pounds i made it in a very short time by extraordinary good luck mr dering laid down the letter and considered twelve thousand pounds might be madeperhapsby great good luckwith a start of seven hundred and twenty but hardly with ten pounds a silver reefor more likely a gambling table or a second crime or a series of crimes it will be observed that his opinion of the young man was now very bad indeed otherwise he would have reflected that as none of those notes had been presented none of them had been used even if an english tenpound note is converted into american dollars the note comes home before ten years extraordinary good luck he read the words again and shook his head now i want you to take charge of this money to say nothing at all about it to keep the matter a profound secret to invest it or put it in some place of safety where confidential clerks with a taste for forgery cannot get at it and to give it on her twentyfirst birthday to my sister elsie do not tell her or anybody from whom the money comes do not tell anybody that you have heard from me when i came away she was the only one of all my friends and people who declared that she believed in me i now strip myself of my whole possessions in order to show this mark of my love and gratitude towards her in sending you this money i go back to the ten pounds with which i started mr dering laid the letter down the words somehow seemed to ring true could the boyafter all he shook his head and went on you will give elsie this money on her twentyfirst birthday to be settled on her for herself athelstan arundel the letter was dated but no address was given the postmark was idaho which as we all know belongs to a western state he looked into the envelope there fell out a paper which was a draft on a wellknown london firm payable to his order for twelve thousand and fifty pounds this is very unbusinesslike said mr dering he puts all this money into my hands and vanishes these are the ways he learns in america i suppose puts the money blindly in my hands without giving me the means of communicating with him then he vanishes how could he prove that it was a trust well if i could only thinkbut i cannotthe circumstantial evidence is too strongthat the boy was innocenti should be very sorry for him as for elsieshe must be eighteen nowabout eighteenshe will get this windfall in three years or so it will be a wonderful lift for her perhaps it may make all the difference in her future if i could only think that the boy was innocenta clever lad toowhich makes his guilt more probable but i cantnoi cant either checkley or that boyand checkley couldnt do it he couldnt if he were to try what did the boy do it for and what did he do with the notes chapter i up the river can you not be content george asked the girl sitting in the stern i think that i want nothing more than this if we could only go on always and always and always just like this she had taken off her righthand glove and she was dipping her fingers into the cool waters of the river as the boat slowly drifted down stream always like this she repeated softly with you close to meso that i could touch you if i wanted toso that i could feel safe you knowthe sun behind us warm and splendid such a sweet and fragrant air about us trees and gardens and fields and lanes on either sideand both of us always young george andand nice to look at and all the world before us she for one was not only young and nice to look upon but fairvery fair to look upon even young persons of her own sex critics and specialists in the art and science of beautyrivals as wellhad to confess that elsie was rather pretty i believe that few such critics ever go farther she was to begin with of sufficient stature in a time when dumpy women are not considered and when height is a first necessity of comeliness she paid next such obedience to the laws of figure as becomes the age of twenty and is with stature rigorously demanded at this end of the century her chief points perhaps lay in her eyes which were of a darker shade of blue than is common they were soft yet not languid they were full of light they were large and yet they could be quick her face was subject to sudden changes that made it like a springtime sky of shower rainbow sunshine and surprise her hair was of a very common brown neither dark nor light she was attired this evening in a simple gray frock of nuns cloth with a bunch of white roses on her left shoulder when one says that her companion was a young man nearly all is said because the young men of the present day are surprisingly alike thousands of young men can be found like george austin they are all excellent fellows of much higher principles on some subjects than their fathers before them not remarkably intellectual to judge by their school record yet with intelligence and application enough to get through their examinations moderately for the most part they do pass them with moderate success they are not ambitious of obtaining any of the great prizeswhich indeed they know to be out of their reachbut they always set before themselves and keep always well in sight the ideal suburban villa and the wife they always work steadily if not feverishly with the view of securing these two blessings they always hope to secure an income that will enable them to maintain that wifewith a possible following of babiesin silk attire for sundays in ease as to household allowance and in such freedom of general expenditure as may enable her to stand up among her neighbours in church without a blush the world is quite full of such men they form the rank and file the legionaries their opinion on the subject of labour is purely scripturalnamely that it is a curse they do not particularly love any kind of work they would prefer if they had the choice to do nothing at all when they get their summer holiday they do nothing all day long with zeal they give no more thought to their work than is sufficient for the breadwinning whether they are professional men or trading men their view of professional work is solely that it brings in the money if such a young man becomes a clerk he never tries to learn any more after he has left school he accepts the position a clerk and a servant he is a clerk and a servant he will remain if he is engaged in trade he gives just so much attention to his business as will keep his connection together that and no more others may soar others may become universal providers for his part he is contented with his shop and his sunday feast if he becomes a professional man he learns no more of his science than is wanted every day the lawyer passes his exam and puts away his lawbooks he knows enough for professional purposes the doctor reads no more he knows enough for the ordinary needs of the g p the schoolmaster lays aside his books scholarship and science interest him no longer he has learned enough to teach his boys the curate makes no farther research into the history and foundations of his church he has learned enough in a word the average young man is without ambition he is inclined to be lazy he loves the present far more than the futureindeed all his elders unite in letting him know that his own is quite the most enviable time of life he likes to enjoy whatever he can afford so that he very often eats up all his wages he does not read too much he does not think too much he does not vex his soul too much with the problems of lifegreater problems or lesser problemshe accepts the teaching of his newspaper and agrees with the words and the wisdom of yesterdays leading article he accepts religion politics morals social systems constitutions things present past and future as ifwhich is perfectly truehe had nothing to do with them and could not help it whatever was to happen he never wants to alter anything he believes that all british institutions are built on the solid rock and fashioned out of the hardest granite any exceptions to this rule he thinks have come straight down from heaven observe if you please that this kind of young man confers the greatest possible benefits upon the country he ought to be made a baronet at least if honours meant anything his apparent sluggishness keeps us from the constant changes which trouble some nations his apparent lack of ambition makes it easy for the restless spirits to rise were the country full of aspiring young men we should be for ever having civil wars revolutions social upsydowns new experiments new religions new governments new divisions of property every year again it is this young man who by his steady attention to business his readiness to work as much as is wanted but no more his disregard of theories and speculations his tenacity his honesty his loyalty his courage and his stout heart has built up the british name so that there has never been any name like unto it nor ever will be again for these solid and substantial virtues being then just a young man of the time george austin was naturally like most young men in dress in appearance in language and in manners and had it not been for the strange experience which he was to undergo he would have remained to this day just like other young men he was better looking than most having a good figure a wellshaped head and regular features with eyes rather fuller of possibilities than falls to the lot of most young men in short a goodlooking fellow showing a capability for something or other in his firm mouth ample cheek strong chin and resolute carriage he would have made a fine soldier but perhaps an unsuccessful general for want of that quality which in poets is called genius in the same way he would in a lower walk keep a business together but would fail to achieve a great fortune for lack of the same quality as for his age he was sevenandtwenty always like this the girl went on always floating down the stream under a summer sky always sweet looks and love and youth it seems as if we could never be unhappy never be worried never want anything on such an evening as this she turned and looked up the stream on which lay the glory of the sinking sunshe sighed it is good to come out on such an evening only to have a brief dream of what might be when will the world give up their foolish quarrels and join together to make the lives of all happy they had been talking among other things of socialism all out of yesterdays leading article when george replied there is enough of good things to go round when we invent a way to make all men ready to do their share as well as to devour it when we find out how to make everybody contented with his share elsie shook her head which was filled with vague ideasthe ideas of a restless and a doubting time then she went back to her original proposition always like this georgeand never to get tired of it time to stand stillnothing to change never to get tired of it never to want anything else that is heaven i suppose we are on earth elsie said her lover and on earth everything changes if we were to go on drifting down the stream we should get into trouble over the weir to capsize would be a pretty interruption to your heaven wouldnt it and the sun will soon be setting and the river will get misty and the banks will grow ugly but the chief thing is that we shall both grow old and there is such a lot that we have got to do before we grow old everything has to be done said elsie i suppose we have done nothing yet we have got to get married for the first thing before we grow old couldnt you love an old woman george not so well elsie her lover replied truthfully at least i think notand oh elsie whenever i do think of the future my heart goes down into my boots for the prospect grows darker and darker elsie sighed she knew already too well what was in his mind plenty of girls in these days know the familiar tale darker every day he repeated they keep on crowding into the profession by multitudes as if there was room for any number they dont understand that what with the decay of the landed interest and of the country towns and the cutting down of the costs and the work that goes to accountants there isnt half the business to do that there was there dont seem any partnerships to be had for love or money because the few people who have got a good thing have got no more than enough for themselves it is no use for the young fellows to start by themselves so they have got to take whatever they can get and they are glad to get even a hundred a year to begin withand i am sevenandtwenty elsie and im drawing two hundred pounds a year patience george something will turn up you will find a partnership somewhere my child you might as well tell robinson crusoe that a boiled leg of mutton with caper sauce was going to turn up on his desert island we must not hope for the impossible i ought to be grateful i suppose considering what other men are doing i am planted in a good solid house it wont run away so long as the old man lives and after that well mr dering is seventyfive but he will not die yet not for a long time to come he is made of granite he is never ill he never takes a holiday he works harder than any of his people and he keeps longer hours to be sure if he were to die without taking a partnerwellin that case there would be an end of everything i supposeelsie heres the position she knew it already too wellbut it pleased them both to parade the facts as if they were something quite novel let us face itthey were always facing it i am managing clerk to dering soni get two hundred pounds a yeari have no prospect of anything better i am bound all my life to be a servant elsie it is not a brilliant prospect i found out at school that it was best not to be too ambitious buta servant all my lifei confess that did not enter into my head if i knew any other trade i would cut the whole business if there was any mortal thing in the whole world by which i could keep myself i would try it but theres nothing i have but one trade i cant write novels or leading articles i cant play on any instrument i cant paint or act or sing or anythingi am only a solicitorthats all only a solicitor who cant get ona clerk elsie no wonder her ladyship turns up her nosea clerk he leaned his chin upon his hands and laughed the conventional laugh of the young man down on his luck poor george she sighed in such a case there are only two words of consolation one may say poor george or one may say patience there is nothing else to say elsie first tried one method and then the other as a doctor tries first one remedy and then another when nature sulks and refuses to get well and he went on piling up the misery i am in love with the sweetest girl in the whole worldand she is in love with me poor george she repeated with a smile that is indeed a dreadful misfortune i am wasting your youth elsie as well as my own if it is wasted for your sake george it is well spent some day perhaps nononot some dayimmediatelyat once the young man changed colour and his eyes sparkled it was not the first time that he had advanced this revolutionary proposal let prudence go to the not there georgeoh not there to the winds perhaps or to that famous city of palestine but not there why we might never get her back againpoor prudence and we shall be sure to want her all our livesvery badly we will if you please ask her to go for a short voyage for the benefit of her health we will give her six months leave of absence but we shall want her services again after her holidayif you think we can do without her for so long for a whole twelvemonth elsie let us brave everything get married at once live in a garret and have a splendid timefor a whole twelvemonthon my two hundred pounds and am i to give up my painting well dear you know you have not yet had a commission from anybody how can you say so george i have painted youand my sisterand my motherand your sisters i am sure that no studio even of an ra could make a braver show of work welli will give it upuntil prudence returns is it to be a garret a real garret with sloping walls where you can only stand upright in the middle we call it a garret it will take the form i suppose of a tiny house in a cheap quarter it will have six rooms a garden in front and a garden behind the rent will be thirty pounds for a whole twelvemonth it will be a real slice of eden elsie and you shall be eve elsie laughed it will be great fun we will make the eden last longer than a twelvemonth i daresay i shall like it of course i shall have to do everything for myself to clean the doorstep will be equivalent to taking exercise in the fresh air to sweep the floors will be a kind of afternoon dance or a game of lawntennis to wash up the cups and saucers will be only a change of amusementthere is one thing georgeone thingshe became very seriousi suppose you neverdid you ever witness the scouring of a fryingpan i dont think i could do that and did you ever see beefsteaks before they are cooked they suggest the animal in the most terrible way i dont really think i could handle those bleeding lumps you shant touch a fryingpan and we will have nothing roasted or fried we will live on cold australian beef eaten out of its native tin the potatoes shall be boiled in their skins and perhapsi dont knowwith two hundred pounds a year we could afford a servanta very little onejust a girl warranted not to eat too much what shall we do when our clothes are worn out the little maid will make some more for you i suppose we certainly shall not be able to buy new thingsnot nice things that isand you must have nice things mustnt you i do like things to be nice she replied smoothing her dainty skirts with her dainty hand george where shall we find this houseformerly eves own country villa before sheresigned her tenancy you know there are places in london where whole streets are filled with families living on a hundred and fifty pounds a year checkleythe chiefs private clerklives in such a place he told me so himself he says there is nobody in his parish who has got a bigger income than himself hes a little king among them because he gets four hundred pounds a year besides what he has savedwhich is enormous piles elsie my dear we must give up our present surroundings and take up with gentility in its cheapest form can we not go on living among our own friends george shook his head wisely impossible friendship means equality of income you cant live with people unless you do as they do people of the same means naturally live together next door to lady dering is another rich madam not a clerks wife for my own part i shall sell my dress clothes for what they will fetchyou can exchange your evening things for morning things that wont matter much who cares where we live or how we live so that we live together what do you say elsie dear the garret i dont mindnor the doorstepsand since you see your way out of the difficulty of the fryingpan you will be of age next week when you can please yourself hilda gives me no peace nor rest she says that there can be no happiness without money she has persuaded my mother that i am going to certain starvation she promises the most splendid establishment if i will only be guided by her and marry a man fifty years older than yourself with one foot already well in she says she has always been perfectly happywell george you know all that next wednesday which is my birthday i am to have a grand talk with my guardian my mother hopes that he will bring me to my senses hilda says that she trusts entirely to mr derings good sense i shall arm myself with all my obstinacy perhaps georgewho knowsi may persuade him to advance your salary no elsie not even you would persuade mr dering to give a managing clerk more than two hundred pounds a year but arm yourself with all you have gotdont forget any piece of that armour child the breastplatethere was a poor damsel once who forgot that and was caught by an appeal to her heartnor the helmetanother poor damsel was once caught by an appeal to her reason after forgetting the helmet the shield of course you will not forgetand for weapons my dear take your sweet eyes and your lovely face and your winning voiceand i swear that you will subdue even mr dering himselfthat hardened old parchment this was the kind of talk which these lovers held together whenever they met george was poorthe son of a clergyman whose power of advancing him ceased when he had paid the fees for admission he was only a clerk and he saw no chance of being anything else but a clerk elsie could bring nothing to the family nest unless her mother made her an allowance of this there could be no hope the engagement was considered deplorable marriage under the circumstances simple madness and hilda had done so well for herself and could do so much for a sister so pretty so bright as elsie oh she was throwing away all her chances did one ever hear of anything so lamentable no regard for the family no ambition no sense of what a girl owes to herself no recognition nor gratitude for the gift of good looksas if beauty was given for the mere purpose of pleasing a penniless lover and to go and throw herself away upon a twopenny lawyers clerk george she said seriously i have thought it all out if you really mean itif you really can face povertymindit is hardermuchfor a man than a woman i can face everythingwith you elsie replied the lover would he have been a lover worth having if he had not made that answer and indeed he meant it as every lover should thengeorgewhat in the whole world is there for me unless i can make my dear boy happy i will marry you as soon as you please rich or poor for better for worsewhatever they may say at homewill that do for you george since man is so constituted that his happiness wholly depends upon the devotion of a woman i believe that no dear boy ever had a better chance of happiness than george austinonly a managing clerkwith his elsie and so this history begins where many end with an engagement chapter ii in the office ill take in your ladyships name there is no one with him at this momentoh yes my lady checkley smiled superior we are always busy we have been busy in this office for fifty years and morebut i am sure hell see you take a chair my lady allow me checkley the old clerk had other and younger clerks with him but he kept in his own hands the duty or the privilege of going to the private room of the chief he was sixtyseven when last we saw him therefore he was now seventyfive a little more bent in the shoulders a little more feeble otherwise unaltered in age we either shrivel or we swell those live the longest who shrivel and those who shrivel presently reach a point when they cease to shrink any more till they reach the ninetieth year checkley was bowed and bent and lean his face was lined multitudinously his cheeks were shrunken but not more so than eight years before he wrote down the name of the callerlady deringon a square piece of paper and opened the door with an affectation of extreme care not to disturb the chiefs nerves by a sharp turn of the handle stepped in as if it was most important that no one should be able to peep into the room and closed the door softly behind him immediately he reappeared and held the door wide open inviting the lady to step in she was young of good stature and figure extremely handsome in face of what is called the classical type and very richly dressed her carriage might have been seen on looking out of the window waiting in the square lady dering sir said checkley then he swiftly vanished closing the door softly behind him i am glad to see you hilda the old lawyer rose tall and commanding and bowed offering his hand with a stately and oldfashioned courtesy which made ladies condone his unmarried condition why have you called this morning you are not come on any business i trust business with ladies who have wealthy husbands generally means trouble of some kind you are not for instance in debt with your dressmaker nono sir samuel does not allow of any difficulties or awkwardness of that kind it is not about myself that i am here but about my sister elsie yes what about her sit down and let me hear well you know elsie has always been a trouble to us on account of her headstrong and wilful ways she will not look on things from a reasonable point of view you know that my mother is not rich as i have learnt to consider rich though of course she has enough for a simple life and a manservant and a onehorse brougham do you know she added pensively i have often found it difficult not to repine at a providence which removes a father when he was beginning so well and actually on the highroad to a great fortune it is certainly difficult to understand the wisdom of these disappointments and disasters we must accept hilda what we cannot escape or explain yesand my mother had nothing but a poor thousand a yearthough i am sure that she has greatly bettered her circumstances by her transactions in the city welli have done all i can by precept and by example to turn my sisters mind into the right direction mr deringby long habit hilda still called her guardian now her brotherinlaw by his surnameyou would hardly believe the folly that elsie talks about money perhaps because she has none those who have no property do not understand it young people do not know what it means or what it commands and whether they have it or not young people do not know what the acquisition of property meansthe industry the watchfulness the carefulness the selfdenial so elsie talks folly about moneywell wellhe smiled indulgentlywe shall see it is not only that she talks but she acts mr dering we are in despair about her you know the rodings roding brothers everybody knows roding brothers algy roding the eldest son of the senior partnerenormously richis gonequite gonefoolish about elsie he has been at me a dozen times about her he has called at the house to see her he cares nothing at all about her having no money she refuses even to hear his name mentioned between ourselves he has not been i believe a very steady young man but of course he would settle down we could entirely trust to a wifes influence in that respect the past could easily be forgottenin fact elsie need never know it and the position would be splendid even mine would not compare with it why does she object to the man says he is an ugly little snob there is a becoming spirit for a girl to receive so rich a lover but that is not all she might have him if she chose snob or not but she prefers one of your clerksactually mr dering one of your clerks i have learned something of this from your mother she is engaged i am told to young austin one of my managing clerks whose income is two hundred pounds a year oh think of it she refuses a man with ten thousand a year at the very least and wants to marry a man with two hundred i suppose they do not propose to marry on thisthis pittancethis two hundred a year they are engaged she refuses to break it off he has no money to buy a partnership he must therefore continue a clerk on two hundred managing clerks get more sometimes but to be sure the position is not good and the income must always be small my mother will not allow the man in the house elsie goes out to meet him oh it is most irregular i should be ashamed for sir samuel to know it she actually goes out of the house every evening and they walk about the square garden or in the park till dark it is exactly like a housemaid going out to meet her young man it does seem an unusual course but i am no judge of what is becoming to a young lady wellshe neednt go on like a housemaid said her sister of course the position of things at home is strained and i dont know what may happen at any moment elsie says that she shall be twentyone next week and that she means to act on her own judgment she even talks of setting up a studio somewhere and painting portraits for money that is a pleasant thing for me to contemplate my own sister earning her own living by painting how do you think i can interfere in the matter lovers quarrels or lovers difficulties are not made or settled in this room mr dering there is no one in the world of whom she is afraid except yourself there is no one of whose opinion she thinks so much will you see her will you talk with her will you admonish her why hilda it so happens that i have already invited her to call upon me on her birthday when she ceases to be my ward i will talk to her if you please perhaps you may be satisfied with the result of my conversation i shalli am sure i shall let me understand you desire that your sister shall marry a man who if he is not already rich should be at least on the high road to wealth you cannot force her to accept even the richest young man in london unless she likes him can you no certainly not and we can hardly expect her to marry as i did myself a man whose wealth is already established unless she would take algy roding very good but he must have a certain income so as to ensure the means of an establishment conducted at a certain level yes she need not live in palace gardens but she ought to be able to livesay in pembridge square quite so i suppose with an income of fifteen hundred or so to begin with if i make her understand so much you will be satisfied perfectlymy dear mr dering i really believe you have got the very young man up your sleeve but how will you persuade her to give up the present intruder i promise nothing hildai promise nothing i will do my best however hilda rose and swept back her dress i feel an immense sense of relief she said the dear childs happiness is all i desire perhaps if you were to dismiss the young man immediately with ignominy and were to refuse him a written character on the ground of trying to win the affections of a girl infinitely above him in station it might produce a good effect on elsieshowing what you think of itas well as an excellent lesson for himself and his friends there is no romance about a castoff clerk will you think of this mr dering the mere threat of such a thing might make him ready to give her up and it might make her inclined for his own sake to send him about his business i will think of it hildaby the way will you and my brother dine with me on monday unless you are engaged we can talk over this little affair then at leisure with pleasure we are only engaged for the evening now i wont keep you any longergoodbye she walked away smiling graciously on the clerks in the outer office and descended the stairs to the carriage which waited below mr dering returned to his papers he was not changed in the eight years since the stormy interview with this young ladys brother his small whiskers were a little whiter his irongray hair was unchanged his lips were as firm and his nostrils as sharp his eyes as keen as then the room looked out pleasantly upon the garden of new square where the sunshine lay warm upon the trees with their early summer leaves sunshine or rain all the year round the solicitor sat in his highbacked chair before his great table he sat there this morning working steadily until he had got through what he was about then he looked at his watch it was past two oclock he touched a bell on the table and his old clerk came in though he was the same age as his master checkley looked a great deal older he was bald save for a small white patch over each ear he was bent and his hands trembled his expression was sharp foxy and suspicious he stood in the unmistakable attitude of a servant hands hanging in readiness head a little bent the clerks are all gone i suppose said mr dering all gone all they think about when they come in the morning is how soon they will get away as for any pride in their work they havent got it let them gocheckley i have wanted to speak to you for some time anything the matter the old clerk spoke with the familiarity of long service which permits the expression of opinions the time has come checkley when we must make a change a change whyi do my work as well as ever i didbetter than any of the younger men a change the change will not affect you it must be for you then surely youre never going to retire noi mean to hold on as long as i can that will only be for a year or two at most i am seventyfive checkley what of that so am i you dont find me grumbling about my work do you besides you eat hearty your health is good yes my health is good but i am troubled of late checkleyi am troubled about my memory so is many a younger man returned the clerk stoutly sometimes i cannot remember in the morning what i was doing the evening before thats nothing nothing at all yesterday i looked at my watch and found that i had been unconscious for three hours you were asleep i came in and saw you sound asleep it was not true but the clerks intentions were good to go asleep in the morning argues a certain decay of strength yet i believe that i get through the work as well as ever the clients do not drop off checkley there are no signs of mistrusteh no suspicion of failing powers they think more of you than ever i believe they do checkley everybody says you are the top of the profession i believe i am checkleyi believe i am certainly i am the oldest nevertheless seventyfive is a great age to be continuing work things cant last much longer some men go on to eighty and even ninety a fewa few only the lawyer sighed one may hope but must not build upon the chance of such merciful prolongation the older i grow checkley the more i enjoy life especially the only thing that has ever made life happy for methis work i cling to ithe spread his hands over the papersi cling to it i cannot bear to think of leaving it thatand your savings echoed the clerk it seems as if i should be content to go on for a hundred years more at the work of which i am never tired and i must leave it before longin a yeartwo yearswho knows life is miserably shortone has no time for half the things one would like to do wellhe heaved a deep sighlet us work while we can however it is better to climb down than to be pulled down or shot down i am going to make preparations checkley for the end what preparations youre not going to send for a minister are you no not that kind of preparation nor for the doctor either nor for a lawyer to make my will all those things are duly attended to i have resolved checkley upon taking a partner you take a partner you at your time of life i am going to take a partner and you are the first person who has been told of my intention keep it a secret for the moment take a partner divide your beautiful income by two yes checkley i am going to give a share in that beautiful income to a young man what can a partner do for you that i cant do dont i know the whole of the office work is there any partner in the world who can draw up a conveyance better than me you are very useful checkley as you always have been but you are not a partner and you never can be i know that very well but whats the good of a partner at all if i have a partner he will have his own room and he wont interfere with you theres no occasion for you to be jealous as for jealouswellafter more than sixty years work in this office it would seem hard to be turned out by some newcomer but what i say iswhat is the good of a partner the chief good is that the house will be carried on it is a hundred and twenty years old i confess i do not like the thought of its coming to an end when i disappear that will be to me the most important advantage to be gained by taking a partner the next advantage will be that i can turn over to him a quantity of work and thirdly he will bring young blood and new connections my mind is quite made up checkley i am going to take a partner have you found one yet i have but i am not going to tell you who he is till the right time comes checkley grumbled inaudibly if i had been less busy mr dering went on i might have married and had sons of my own to put into the house but somehow being very much occupied always and never thinking about such things i let the time pass by i was never even as a young man greatly attracted to love or to young women their charms such as they are seem to me to depend upon nothing but a single garment take away their frocks said checkley and what are they all alikeall alike ive been married myselfwomen are expensive frauds wellthings being as they are checkley i am going to take a partner youll do as you like said his servant mark my words however youve got ten years more of work in you yetand all through these ten years youll regret having a partner out of every hundred pounds his share will have to come think of that it is eight years i remember mr dering went on since first i thought of taking a partner eight yearsand for much the same reason as now i found my memory going there were gaps in itdays or bits of days which i could not recollect i was greatly terrified the man whom i first thought of for a partner was that young arundel now who forged your name lucky you didnt have him who ran away in a rage because certain circumstances seemed to connect him with the crime seemed did connect him then the symptoms disappeared now they have returned as i told you i have always regretted the loss of young arundel he was clever and a quick worker he was a forger said the clerk stoutlyis there anything more i can do for you nothing thank you then ill go on saturday afternoon i collect my little rents not muchin your way of thinking a good deal to me i hope youll like your partner when you do get him i hope i shant live to see him the master here and you knuckling under i hope i shant see him driving away the clients i hope you will not see any of these distressing consequences checkleygoodday the old clerk went away shutting the outer door after him then the lawyer was the sole occupant of the rooms he was also the sole occupant of the whole house and perhaps of the whole square it was three oclock he sat leaning back in his chair looking through the open window upon the trees in the square garden presently there fell upon his face a curious change it was as if the whole of the intelligence was taken out of it his eyes gazed steadily into space with no expression whatever in them the lips slightly parted his head fell back the soul and spirit of the man had gone out of him leaving a machine which breathed the watch in his pocket ticked audibly there was no other sound in the roomthe old man sat quite motionless four oclock struck from the clock tower in the high court of justice from st clements church from westminster from halfadozen clocks which could be heard in the quiet of the saturday afternoon but mr dering heard nothing still he sat in his place with idle hands and a face like a mask for lack of thought the clocks struck five he neither moved nor spoke the clocks struck sixseveneight the shades of evening began to gather in the corners of the room as the sun sank lower towards his setting at twilight in the summer there is never anybody to fearman woman or catin the chambers and at that hour the mice come out they do not eat parchment or foolscap or red tape but they eat the luncheon crumbs mr checkley for instance always brought his dinner in a paper parcel in his coattail pocket and ate it when so disposed sprinkling crumbs lavishlythe only lavishment of which he was ever guiltyon the floor junior clerks brought buns and biscuits or even apples which they devoured furtively mr dering himself took his luncheon in his own room leaving crumbs there was plenty for a small colony of mice they came out therefore as usual they stopped at sight of a man an unwonted man in a chair but he moved not he was asleep he was dead they ran without fear all about the rooms it was past nine when the chambers were as dark as at this season of the year they ever are that mr dering returned to consciousness he sat up staring about him the room was dark he looked at his watch halfpast nine what is this he asked have i been asleep for seven hours seven hours i was not asleep when checkley went away why did i fall asleep i feel as if i had been somewheredoing something what i cannot remember this strange sensation comes oftener it is time that i should take a partner before something worse happens i am oldi am old he rose and walked across the room erect and with firm step i am old and worn out and spent time to give up the keysold and spent chapter iii the select circle at halfpast nine on this saturday evening the parlour of the salutation inn high holborn contained most of its customary visitors they came every evening at eight and they sat till eleven drinking and talking in former days every tavern of repute kept such a room for its own select circle a club or society of habitues who met every evening for a pipe and a cheerful glass in this way all respectable burgesses down to fifty years ago spent their evenings strangers might enter the room but they were made to feel that they were there on sufferance they were received with distance and suspicion most of the regular visitors knew each other when thy did not it was tavern politeness not to ask a case is on record of four cronies who used the cock in meet street for thirty years not one knowing either the name or the trade of the other three yet when one died the other three pined away this good old custom is now decayed the respectable burgess stays at home which is much more monotonous yet there may still be found a parlour here and there with a society meeting every evening all the year round the parlour of the salutation was a goodsized room wainscoted and provided with a sanded floor it was furnished with a dozen wooden chairs and three small round tables the chairs disposed in a circle so as to prevent corners or cliques in conversation sacred is the fraternity liberty and equality of the parlour the room was low and in the evenings always hot with its two flaming unprotected gas jets the window was never opened except in the morning and there was always present a rich perfume of tobacco beer and spirits both that anciently generated and that of the days creation among the frequenterswho were it must be confessed a somewhat faded or decayed companywas to put him first because he was the richest the great mr robert hellyer of barnards inn usurer or moneylender nobody quite likes the professionone knows not why great fortunes have been made in it the same fortunes have been dissipated by the moneylenders heirs such fortunes do not stick somehow mr hellyer for instance was reputed wealthy beyond the dreams of the wildest desire it was also said of him under breath and in whispers and envious murmurs that should a man borrow a fivepound note of him that borrower would count himself lucky if he escaped with the loss of seventyfive pounds and might generally expect to lose the whole of his household furniture and the half of his income for the rest of his natural life to be sure he sometimes had losses as he said himself with a groan as when an unscrupulous client jumped off the embankment when he had not paid more than fifty pounds on the original five or when a wicked man sold off his furniture secretly in contempt of the bill of sale and got clean out of the country with his wife and children but on the whole he did pretty well it was further said by old clients that his heart was a simple piece of round granite for which he had no use and that he made money out of it by letting it out at so much an hour for a paving mallet mr robert hellyer was not a genial man or a cheerful or a pleasant man to look upon he neither loved nor comprehended a jest he never smiled he kept his mind always employed on the conduct of his business every nightforgive the solitary weaknesshe drank as much as he could carry in appearance he was redfaced thicknecked and stout his voice was thick even in the morning when he was under no compulsion to thickness it was believed by his friends that his education had been imperfect perhaps because he never gave anybody reason to suppose that he had ever received any education at all to such men as mr hellyer who every night take much strong drink and on no occasion whatever take any exercise sixty is the grand climacteric he was a year ago just fiftynine alas he has not even reached his grand climacteric already he is gone he was cut off by pneumonia or apoplexy last christmas those who saw the melancholy cortege filing out of the narrow gates of barnards inn mournfully remarked that none of his money was taken with him and asked what happiness he could possibly find in the next world which he would begin with nothingnothing at allnot even creditan absolute pauper mr robert hellyer sat on one side of the empty fireplace on the opposite side a great contrast to his coarse and vulgar race sat an elderly man tall thin dressed in a coat whose sleeves were worn to shininess his face was dejected his features were still fine he was evidently a gentleman this person was a barrister decayed and unsuccessful he lived in a garret in grays inn there are a good many wrecks at the bar but few quite so forlorn as this poor old man he still professed to practise and picked up a guinea now and then by defending criminals on these casual fees he managed to live his clothes were threadbare it was many years since he had had a greatcoat on rainy and cold days he had a thin cape which he wore over his shoulders heaven knows how he dined and breakfasted every evening except in the hot days of summer he came to this place for light and warmth unless he was very poor indeed he called for a pint of old and mild and read the days paper sometimes he talked but not often sometimes one or other of the company would offer him a more costly drink which he always accepted with all that was left to him of courtesy outside he had no friends they had all forgotten him or diedit is very easy for a poor man to be forgotten he had no relations they had all died emigrated and dispersed the relations of the unsuccessful are easily lost when he talked he sometimes became animated and would tell anecdotes of the bar and of the time when he was called nearly fifty years agone by the benchers of grays inn what had become of the hopes and ambitions with which that young man entered upon the profession which was to lead him to the parlour of the salutation and the company that gathered thereand to the bare and miserable garret of grays inn forgotten and alone another man also elderly who sat next to the barrister was a gentleman who sold an excellent business and retired in order to betake himself more completely to toping he drank in three taverns during the day one was in fleet street where he took his chop at three one was near drury lane theatre where he dallied with a little whisky from five to nine and this was the third he was a quiet happy selfrespecting dignified old man in the evening he spoke not at allfor sufficient reasons but he benevolently inclined his head if he was addressed next to him sat a younger man a solicitor whose practice consisted in defending prisoners in the police courts he had with him two friends and he had a confident swagger which passed for ability next to him and his friends was a house agent who had been a member for an irish borough and there was a gentleman whose wife sang in music halls so that this fortunate person couldand didsit about in taverns all day long his appearance was that of a deboshed city clerk as he was not to mention other members of the company checkley was there occupying a chair next to the moneylender here he was called mr checkley he came every evening at nine oclock sundays included like the moneylender he wanted his little distractions and took them in this way here too he was among those who respected him not so much on account of his public and private virtues or for his eminence in the law as his money it is not often that a solicitors clerk becomes a warm man but then it is not often that one of the calling deliberately proposes to himself early in life to save money and lives till seventyfive steadily carrying out his object if you are good at figures you will understand how mr checkley succeeded between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive he had an income which averaged about seventyfive pounds he lived upon fifty pounds a year from twentyfive to thirtyfive he made an average of one hundred and fifty pounds he still lived upon fifty pounds a year at thirtyfive he was induced by prudential considerations to marry the lady considerably his senior had a thousand pounds she was even more miserly than himself and in a year or so after marriage she fell into a decline owing to insufficient nourishment and presently expired on the whole he calculated that he was the better man for the marriage by a thousand pounds from thirtyfive to fortyfive his income rose to two hundred pounds it then for twentyfive years stood at three hundred pounds a year at the age of seventy mr dering gave him four hundred pounds therefore to sum up he had put by out of his pay the sum of land this without counting the compound interest always mounting up from his investments which were all of a careful kind such as he understood tenement houses of which he had a good number shares in building societies money lent on bills of sale or on mortgage at homemr checkley lived on the ground floor of one of his own houseshe grew more miserly as he grew older the standard of luxury is not high when fifty pounds a year covers all but of late he had been trying to keep below even that humble amount he conducted his affairs in the evening between his office hours and nine at his own house or among the people where his property lay it was in the district visited by few lying east of grays inn road his own house was in a certain small square a good half of the houses in which belonged to him at nine oclock he arrived at the tavern here his drinks cost him nothing a custom had grown up in the course of years for the moneylender to consult him on the many difficult points which arise in the practice of his profession he was one of those who like to have one foot over the wall erected by the law but not both in other words he was always trying to find out how far the law would allow him to go and where it called upon him to stop with this view he schemed perpetually to make his clients sign bonds under the delusion that they meant a hundredth part of what they really did mean and as like all ignorant men he had the most profound belief in the power and the knowledge and the chicanery of lawyers he was pleased to obtain checkleys advice in return for checkleys drinks it was a full gathering the old clerk arrived late he was gratified at hearing the exmp whispering to his friends that the new arrival was worth his twenty thousand pounds if a penny he swelled with honourable pride yes twenty thousand pounds and moremore who would have thought when he began as an office boy that he could ever achieve so much the moneylender bursting with a new case real or supposed took his pipe out of his mouth and communicated it in a hoarse whisper suppose it began thencheckley replied when the case was finishedyou would lay yourself open to a criminal prosecution dont you go so much as to think of it there was a case twentyfive years ago exactly like it the remarks of the judge were most severe and the sentence was heavy ah the usurers red face grew redder then it cant be thought of pity too theres a houseful of furniture and a shopful of stuff and a young man as it would do good to him just to start fair again pityput a name to it mr checkley rum hot with lemon replied the sage you get more taste in your mouth more upliftin for your heart as they say more strengthenin for the stomach better value all round for your money out of rum than any other drink that i know at this point and before the waiter could execute the order voices and steps were heard outside the room the voices of two men that of one loud eager noisy that of the other quiet measured and calm checkley sat upright suddenly and listened that is young cambridge said the old barrister i thought he would be heresaturday night and all he smiled as if expectant of something and drank off the rest of his beer at a draught most distinguished cambridge man whispered the exmp to his friends wanst a fellow of cambridge college great scholar ornament to any circle dhrinks likes an oyster son of a bishop tooson of an irish bishoptalks greek like english hell come in directly hes taking something outside hes always half dhrunk to begin and quite dhrunk to finish but he only talks the betterbeing oirish most remarkable man the voice of this distinguished person checkley knew but the other voice that he knew as well and he could not remember whose voice it was very well indeed he remembered the sound of it some men never forget a face some men never forget a shape or figure some men never forget a voice some men never forget a handwriting a voice is the simplest thing after all to remember and the most unchanging from eighteen till eighty a mans voice changes not save that in volume it decreases during the last decade the distinguishing quality of the voice remains the same to the end have a drink my dear fellow that was the voice of the pride of cambridge thanks i dont want a drink whose voice was it checkley sat up eager for the door to be opened and that doubt to be resolved it was opened the two men came in first the cambridge man leading the way he was a goodlooking smoothfaced man of thirtytwo or so with bright blue eyestoo brighta fine face full of delicacy and mobility a high narrow forehead and quick sensitive lips a man who was obviously in want of some one to take him in hand and control him one of those men who have no will of their own and fall naturally before any temptation which assails them the chief temptation which assailed freddy carstoneit seems to stamp the man that his friends all called him freddya freddy is amiable weak beloved and given to err slip fall and give waywas the temptation to drink he was really as the exmp told his friends a very fine scholar he had been a fellow of his college but never received any appointment or office of lecturer there on account of this weakness of his which was notorious when his fellowship expired he came to london lived in grays inn and took pupils he had the reputation of being an excellent coach if he could be caught sober he was generally sober in the morning often a little elevated in the afternoon and always cheerfullynot stupidlydrunk at night you must have a drink freddy repeated not want a drink hang it old man it isnt what you want its what you like if i only took what i wanted i should bewhat

you intellectual conversation carried on nightly romantic scenery from the back window finest parlour in london come in and sample the scotchnot want a drink who ever saw a man who didnt want a drink the other man followed reluctantlyand at sight of him checkley jumped in his chair then he snatched the paper from the hands of the ancient barrister and buried his head in it the action was most remarkable and unmistakable he hid himself behind the paper for the man whom the cambridge scholar was dragging into the room was none other than athelstan arundelthe very man of whom mr dering had been speaking that very afternoon the very man whose loss he had been regretting the man accused by himself of forgery so great was his terror at the sight of this man that he was fain to hide behind the paper yes the same man well dressed apparently and prosperousin a velvet jacket and a white waistcoat with a big brown beardstill carrying himself with that old insolent pride as if he had never forged anything looking not a day older in spite of the eight years that had elapsed what was he doing here come in man said freddy again you shall have one drink at least and as many more as you

time lord chancellor chief justice judge or master of the rolls or queens counsel at least so far he is still a junior but we hope for his speedy advancementsir i entreat the honour of offering you a goblet of more generous drinkrobert irish whisky and a lemon for this gentlemantherehe pointed to the exmp who again nudged his friends and grinnedis our legislator and statesman the pride of his constituents the darling of ballynacuddery till they turned him outtherehe pointed to the deboshed clerkis a member of a great modern profession a gentleman with whom it is indeed a pride to sit down he is monsieur le mari monsieur le mari complaisant et content i dont know what you mean said the gentleman indicated if you want to talk greek talk it outside i cannot stay said athelstan looking about the room with scant respect i will call upon you at your chambers dodo my dear fellow athelstan shook hands and walked away now theres a man gentlemen who might have done anythinganything he might have done rowed stroke to his boat threw up everything eight years ago and went awaynobody knew why sad to see so much promise wasted sadsad he hasnt even touched his drink then i mustmyself and he did observe that there is no such lamentation over the failure of a promising young man as from one who has also failed for by a merciful arrangement the failure seldom suspects himself of having failed now mr checkley said the barrister hes gone away and you neednt hide yourself any longerand you can let me have my paper again mr checkley spoke no more that evening he drank up his rumandwater and he went away mightily perturbed that athelstan arundel had come back portended that something would happen and like king coles prophet he could not foretell the nature of the event chapter iv a rebellious child elsie left her lover at the door most accepted suitors accompany their sweethearts into the very bosom of the familythe gynaeceumthe parlour as it used to be called not so george austin since the engagementthe deplorable engagementit was understood that he was not to presume upon entering the house romeo might as well have sent in his card to juliets mamma in fact that lady could not possibly regard the pretensions of romeo more unfavourably than mrs arundel did those of george austin this not on account of any family inequality for his people were no more decidedly of the middle class than her own that is to say they numbered as many members who were presentable and quite as many who were not our great middle class is pretty well alike in this respect in every household there are things which may be paraded and things tacenda members unsuccessful members disgraceful all the world knows all the things which must be concealed we all know that all the world knows them but still we pretend that there are no such things and so we maintain the family dignity nor could the widow object to george on account of his religious opinions in which he dutifully followed his forefathers or of his abilities manners morals culture accomplishments or outward appearance in all of which he was everything that could be expected of a young man who had his own fortune to make a rich young man has no need of manners morals abilities or accomplishments a thing too often forgotten by satirists when they depict the children of sir midas georgias and his tribe the ladys objection was simply and most naturally that the young man had nothing and would probably never have anything that he was a managing clerk without money to buy a partnership in a highly congested profession to aggravate this objection he stood in the way of two most desirable suitors who were supposed to be ready should elsie give them any encouragement they were a rich old man whose morals could no longer be questioned and a rich young man whose morals would doubtless improve with marriageif that is they wanted improvement for on this delicate subject ladies find it difficult to get reliable information and again the exalted position of the elder sister should have been an example and a beacon which of you mesdames would look on with patience at such a sacrificea young and lovely daughter thrown away with all her charms and all her chances upon a man with two hundred pounds a year and no chance of anything much better think of ittwo hundred pounds a yearfor a gentlewoman there are some familiesmany familieswith whom the worship of wealth is hereditary the arundels have been city people married with other city peoplein tradefor two hundred years and more they are all members of city companies there have been lord mayors and sheriffs among them some of themfor they are now a clanare rich some are very rich one or two are very very rich those who fail and go bankrupt quickly drop out of sight all their traditions are of moneygetting they estimate success and worth and respect by the amount a man leaves behindit is the good old tradition they talk of money they are not vulgar or loud or noisy or disagreeable in any way but they openly and without disguise worship the great god plutus and believe that he and none other is the god of the christians they have as much culture as other people at least to outward show they furnish their houses as artistically as other people they buy pictures and books but ideas do not touch them if they read new ideas they are not affected by them however skilfully they may be put they go to church and hear the parable about dives and they wonder how dives could have been so hardhearted then they go home and talk about money elsies father a younger son of the richest branch of this family started with a comfortable little fortune and a junior partnership he was getting on very well indeed he had begun to show the stuff of which he was made a good stout tenacious kind of stuff likely to last and to hold out he was beginning to increase his fortune he looked forward to a successful career and he hoped to leave behind him after many many years perhaps threequarters of a million he was only thirtyfive years of age yet he was struck down and had to go his widow received little more than her husbands original fortune it was small compared with what she might fairly have expected when she married but it was large enough for her to live with her three children in pembridge gardens what happened to the son you know he went away in a royal rage and had never been heard of since the elder daughter hilda when about twoandtwenty as you also know had the good fortune to attract the admiration of a widower of very considerable wealth the brother of her guardian he was forty years older than herself but he was richnay very rich indeed jute i believe on an extensive scale was the cause of his great fortune he was knighted on a certain great occasion when warden of his company so that he offered his bride a title and precedence as well as a great income a mansion in palace gardens a handsome settlement carriages and horses and everything else that the feminine heart can desire the widow soon after her husband died found the time extremely dull without the daily excitement of the city talk to which she had been accustomed there was no one with whom she could discuss the money market now all her life she had been accustomed to talk of shares and stocks and investments and fluctuations and operations and buying in and selling out she began therefore to watch the market on her own account then she began to operate then she gave her whole time and all her thoughts to the business of studying watching reading and forecasting of course then she lost her money and fell into difficulties nothing of the kind she made money there is always plenty of virtuous indignation ready for those foolish persons who dabble in stocks they are gamblers they always lose in the long run we all know that the copybooks tell us so if two persons play heads and tails for sovereigns do they both lose in the long run if so who wins where does the money go even a gambler need not always lose in the long run as all gamblers know la veuve arundel was not in any sense a gambler nor was she a dabbler she was a serious and calculating operator she took up one branch of the great money market and confined her attentions to that branch which she studied with so much care and assiduity that she became a professional that is to say she threw into the study all her energies all her thoughts and all her intellect when a young man does this on the stock exchange he may expect to win mrs arundel was not an ordinary young man she was a sharp and clever woman by hard work she had learned all that can be learned and had acquired some of that prescience which comes of knowledgethe prophet of the future is after all he who knows and can discuss the forces and the facts of the present the sibyl at the present day would be a journalist she was clearheaded quick to see and ready to act she was of a quick temper as well as a quick perception and she was resolute such qualities in most women make them absolute sovereigns in the household mrs arundel was not an absolute sovereignpartly because she thought little of her household and partly because her children were distinguished by much the same qualities and their subjection would have proved difficult if not impossible this was the last house in london where one might have expected to find a girl who was ready to despise wealth and to find her happiness in a condition of poverty elsie was completely out of harmony with all her own people there is a good deal of opinion going about in favour of the simple life many girls have become socialists in so far as they think the amassing of wealth neither desirable nor worthy of respect many would rather marry a man of limited means who has a profession than a rich man who has a business many girls hold that art is a much finer thing than wealth elsie learned these pernicious sentiments at school they attracted her at first because they were so fresh she found all the best literature full of these sentiments she developed in due course a certain natural ability for art she attended an art school she set up an easel she painted in pastel she called her room a studio she gave her friends the greatest uneasiness by her opinions she ended as you have seen by becoming engaged to a young man with nothing how could such a girl be born of such parents when she got home on saturday evening she found her mother playing a game of double vingt un with a certain cousin one sydney arundel the game is very good for the rapid interchange of coins you should make it a time game to end in half an hourone hourtwo hours and at the end you will find that you have had a very pretty little gamble mrs arundel liked nothing better than a game of cardsprovided the stakes were high enough to give it excitement to play cards for love is indeed insipid it is like a dinner of cold boiled mutton or like sandwiches of veal the lady would play anything piquet ecarte double dummyand her daughter elsie hated the sight of cards as for the cousin he was on the stock exchange he came often to dinner and to talk business after dinner he was a kind of musical box or barrel organ in conversation because he could only play one tune his business as well as his pleasure was in the money market so you have come home elsie said mrs arundel coldly yes i have come home elsie seated herself at the window and waited now sydneyher mother took up the cards my dealwill you take any more she was a goodlooking woman still though past fifty her abundant hair had gone pleasantly gray her features were fine her brown eyes were quick and bright her lips were firm and her chin straight she was tall and of good figure she was clad in black silk with a large gold chain about her neck and good lace upon her shoulders she wore many rings and a bracelet she liked in fact the appearance of wealth as well as the possession of it she therefore always appeared in costly raiment her house was furnished with a costly solidity everything even the bindings of her books was good to look at her one manservant looked like the responsible butler of a millionaire and her onehorse carriage looked as if it belonged to a dozen the game went on presently the clock struck ten time said the lady we must stop now then let us seei make it seventythree shillingsthank you three pounds thirteenan evening not altogether wastedand now sydney light your cigar you know i like it you shall have your whisky and sodaand we will talk business there are halfadozen things that i want to consult you about heavens why cannot i be admitted to the exchange a few women among youclever women like myself sydneywould wake you up they talked business for an hour the lady making notes in a little book asking questions and making suggestions at last the cousin got upit was eleven oclockand went away then her mother turned to elsie it is a great pity she said that you take no interest in these things i dislike them very much as you know said elsie yesyou dislike them because they are of real importance wellnever mindyou have been out with the young man i suppose yeswe have been on the river together i supposed it was something of the kind so the housemaid keeps company with the potboy without consulting her own people it is nothing unusual for me to spend an evening with george why not you will not suffer me to bring him here no said her mother with firmness that young man shall never under any circumstances enter this house with my knowledge for the rest she added do as you please this was the kind of amiable conversation that had been going on day after day since elsies engagementprotestations of ceasing to interfere and continual interference there are many ways of considering the subject of injudicious and unequal marriages you may ridicule you may cajole you may argue you may scold you may coax you may represent the naked truth as it is or you may clothe its limbs with liesthe lies are of woven stuff strong and homemade when you have an obdurate obstinate contumacious headstrong wilful selfcontained maiden to deal with you will waste your breath whatever you do the mother treated elsie with scorn and scorn alone it was her only weapon her elder sister tried other weapons she laughed at the makeshifts of poverty she cajoled with soft flattery and golden promises she argued with logic pitiless she scolded like a fishwife she coaxed with tears and kisses she painted the loveliness of men who are rich and the power of women who are beautiful and all in vain nothing moved this obdurate obstinate contumacious headstrong wilful elsie she would stick to her promise she would wed her lover even if she had to entertain poverty as well all her life are you so infatuated the mother went on that you cannot see that he cares nothing for your happiness he thinks about nobody but himself if he thought of you he would see that he was too poor to make you happy and he would break it off as it is all he wants is to marry you that is indeed all he has never disguised the fact he offers you the half of a bare crust by halving the crust we shall double it oh i have no patience but there is an end you know my opinion and you disregard it i cannot lock you up or beat you for your foolishness i almost wish i could i will neither reason with you any more nor try to dissuade you go your own way if you would only understand we are going to live very simply we shall put all unhappiness outside the luxuries of life and we shall get on if we never get rich i wish i could make you understand our point of view it makes me very unhappy that you will take such a distorted view i am glad that you can still feel unhappiness at such a cause as my displeasure well mother tonight we have come to a final decision am i to learn it yes i wish to tell you at once we have been engaged for two years the engagement has brought me nothing but wretchedness at home but i should be still more wretchedi should be wretched all my lifeif i were to break it off i shall be of age in a day or two and free to act on my own judgment you are acting on your own judgment already i have promised george that i will marry him when he pleasesthat is about the middle of august when he gets his holiday oh the misery of poverty will begin so soon i am sorry to hear it as i said above i have nothing to say against itno persuasion or dissuasionyou will do as you please george has his profession and he has a good name already he will get on meantime a little plain living will hurt neither of us cant you think that we may begin in a humble way and yet get on moneymoneymoney oh must we think of nothing else what is there to think of but money look round you silly child what gives me this housethis furnitureeverything money what feeds you and clothes you money what gives position consideration power dignity money rank without money is contemptible life without money is miserable wretched intolerable who would care to live when the smallest luxurythe least comforthas to be denied for want of money even the art of which you talk so much only becomes respectable when it commands money you cannot keep off disease without money you cannot educate your children without money it will be your worst punishment in the future that your children will sink and become servants child she cried passionately we must be masters or servantsnaylords or slaves you leave the rank of lord and marry the rank of slave it is money that makes the differencemoneymoneymoneythat you pretend to despise it is money that has done everything for you your grandfather made ityour father made iti am making it go on in your madness and your folly in the end when it is too late you will long for money pray for money be ready to do anything for moneyfor your husband and your children we shall have i hope enough we shall work for enoughno more well child her mother returned quietly i said that i would say nothing i have been carried away let there be no more said do as you please you know my mindyour sisters mindyour cousins i do not wish to be guided by my cousins very well you will stay here until your wedding day when you marry you will leave this houseand me and your sister and all your people do not expect any help from me do not look forward to any inheritance from me my money is all my own to deal with as i please if you wish to be poor you shall be poor hilda tells me that you are to see your guardian on monday perhaps he may bring you to your senses as for mei shall say no more with these final words the lady left the room and went to bed how many times had she declared that she would say no more the next day being sunday the bells began to ring in the morning and the two ladies sallied forth to attend divine service as usual they walked side by side in silence that sweet and gracious nymph the lady charity was not with them in their pew the elder lady externally cold was full of resentment and bitterness the younger was more than usually troubled by the outbreak of the evening yet she was no nearer surrender the sermon by a curious coincidence turned upon the perishable nature of earthly treasures and the vanity of the objects desired by that unreasoning person whom they used to call the worldling the name has perished but the creature still exists and is found in countless herds in every great town the parsons are always trying to shoot him down but they never succeed there was just a fiery passage or two directed against the species elsie hoped that the words would go home not at all they fell upon her mothers heart like seed upon the rock she heard them but heard them not the worldling you see never understands that he is a worldling nor does dives believe himself to be anything more than lazarus such is his modesty the service over they went home in silence they took their early dinner in silence waited on by the solemn manservant after dinner elsie sought the solitude of her studio and herenobody looking onshe obeyed the first law of her sex and had a good cry even the most resolute of maidens cannot carry through a great scheme against great opposition without the consolation of a cry on the table lay a note from mr dering my dear wardi am reminded that you come of age on monday i am also reminded by hilda that you propose to take a very important step against the wish of your mother will you come and see me at ten oclock to talk this overyour affectionate guardian not much hope to be got out of that letter a dry note from a dry man very little doubt as to the line which he would take yet not an unkind letter she put it back in her desk and sighed another long discussion no she would not discussshe would listen and then state her intention she would listen again and once more state her intention on the easel stood an almost finished portrait in pastel executed from a photograph it was the portrait of her guardian she had caughtit was not difficult with a face so markedthe set expression the closed lips the keen eyes and the habitual look of caution and watchfulness which become the characteristics of a solicitor in good practice so far it was a good likeness but it was an austere face elsie with a few touches of her thumb and the chalk which formed her material softened the lines of the mouth communicated to the eyes a more genial light and to the face an expression of benevolence which certainly had never before been seen upon it there she said if you would only look like that tomorrow instead of like your photograph i should have no fear at all of what you would say i would flatter you and coax you and cajole you till you had doubled georges salary and promised to get round my mother you dear old man you kind old man you sweet old man i could kiss you for your kindness chapter v something happens so far a truly enjoyable sunday to sit in church beside her angry mother both going through the forms of repentance charity and forgiveness and to dine together going through the ordinary forms of kindliness while one at least was devoured with wrath waste of good roast lamb and gooseberry tart elsie spent the afternoon in her studio where she sat undisturbed people called but her mother received them now that the last resolution had been taken now that she had promised her lover to brave everything and to live the simplest possible life for loves sweet sake she felt that sinking which falls upon the most courageous when the boats are burned thus love makes loving hearts to suffer the evening however made amends for then like the housemaid who mounted the area stair as elsie went down the frontdoor steps she went forth to meet her lover and in his company forgot all her fears they went to church together there they sat side by side this church not having adopted the barbarous custom of separating the sexesa custom which belongs to the time when women were monkishly considered unclean creatures and the cause to most men of everlasting suffering which they themselves would most justly share this couple sat hand in hand the service was full of praise and hope and trust the psalms were exultant triumphant jubilant the sermon was a ten minutes ejaculation of joy and thanks there was a procession with banners to cheer up the hearts of the faithfulwhat is faith without a procession comfort stole back to elsies troubled heart she felt less like an outcast she came out of the church with renewed confidence it was still daylight they walked round and round the nearest square jane the housemaid and her young man were doing the same thing they talked with confidence and joy of the future before them presently the rain began to fall and elsies spirits fell too george she said are we selfish each of us is it right for me to drag and keep you down you will not you will raise me and keep me up never doubt that elsie i am the selfish one because i make you sacrifice so much oh nono it is no sacrifice for me you must make me brave george because i am told every day by hilda and my mother the most terrible things i have been miserable all day long i suppose it is the battle i had with my mother yesterday your mother will be all right again as soon as the thing is done and hilda will come round too she will want to show you her new carriage and her newest dress nobody admires and envies the rich relation so much as the poor relation that is the reason why the poor relation is so much courted and petted in every rich family we shall be the poor relations you know elsie i suppose so we must accept the part and play it properly she spoke gaily but with an effort she will give you some of her old dresses and she will ask us to some of her crushes but we wont go oh hilda will come round as for your mother he repressed what he was about to say as for your mother elsie there is no obstinacy so desperate that it cannot be softened by something or other the constant dropping you know give her time if she refuses to changewhythenagain he changed the words in timedear child we must make our own happiness for ourselves without our own folk to help us yes we will at the same time george though i am so valiant in talk i confess that i feel as low as a schoolboy who is going to be punished my dear elsie said george with a little exasperation if they will not come round let them stay flat or square or sulky or anything i can hardly be expected to feel very anxious for a change of temper in people who have said so many hard things of me tomorrow dear you shall get through your talk with mr dering hes as hard as nails but hes a just man and he is sensible in the evening i will call for you at nine and you shall tell me what he said in six weeks we can be married i will see about the banns we will find a lodging somewhere pack up our things get married and move in we cant afford a honeymoon i am afraid that shall come afterwards when the ship comes home yes when i am with you i fear nothing it is when you are gone when i sit by myself in my own room and know that in the next room my mother is brooding over her wrath and keeping it warmthat i feel so guilty tonight it is not that i feel guilty at all it is quite the contrary but i feel as if something was going to happen something is going to happen dear i am going to put a wedding ring round this pretty finger when one says something in the language of superstition one means something bad something dreadful something that shall stand between us and force us apart something unexpected my child said her lover all the powers of all the devils shall not force us apart a daring and comprehensive boast she laughed a little lightened by words so brave here we are dear she said as they arrived at the house i think the rain means to come down in earnest you had better make haste home tomorrow evening at nine i will expect you she ran lightly up the steps and rang the bell the door was opened she turned her head laughed waved her hand to her lover and ran in there was standing on the kerb beneath the street lamp a man apparently engaged in lighting a cigar when the girl turned the light of the lamp fell full upon her face the man stared at her forgetting his cigarlight which fell burning from his hand into the gutter when the door shut upon her he stared at george who for his part his mistress having vanished stared at the door all this staring occupied a period of at least half a minute then george turned and walked away the man struck another light lit his cigar and strode away too but in the same direction presently he caught up george and laid a hand upon his shoulder here you sir he said gruffly i want a word with you before we go any further george turned upon him savagely nobody likes a heavy hand laid upon the shoulder in the old days it generally meant a writ and whitecross street and other unpleasant things who the devil are you he asked that is the question i was going he stopped and laughednoi see now i dont want to ask it you are george austin are you not that is my name but who are youand what do you want with me the man was a stranger to him he was dressed in a velvet coat and a white waistcoat he wore a soft felt hat and with the velvet jacket the felt hat and a full beard he looked like an artist of some kind at the end of june it is still light at halfpast nine george saw that the man was a gentleman his features strongly marked and clear cut reminded him of somethingbut vaguely they gave him the common feeling of having been seen or known at some remote period the man looked about thirty the time when the physical man is at his best he was of good height well set up and robust something no doubt in the art world or something that desired to appear as if belonging to the art world because you see the artists themselves are not so picturesque as those who would be artists if they could the unsuccessful artist certainly is sometimes a most picturesque creature so is the model the rags and duds and threadbarity too often enter largely into the picturesque so with the ploughboys dinner under the hedge or the cotters saturday night and the village beershop may make a very fine picture but the artist himself does not partake in those simple joys well sir who are you george repeated as the other man made no reply do you not remember me i am waiting to give you a chance nocertainly not consider that house into which you have just taken mya young ladydoes it not connect itself with me no why should it then i suppose that i am completely forgotten it is very strange i seem to recall your voice i will tell you who i am by another question george austin what in thunder are you doing with my sister your sister george jumped up and stared your sister are youare you athelstan come home again really and trulyathelstan i am really and truly athelstan i have been back in england about a fortnight you are athelstan george looked at him curiously when the reputed blacksheep comes home again it is generally in rags with a long story of fortunes persecutions this man was not in the least ragged on the contrary he looked prosperous what had he been doing for although elsie continued passionate in her belief in her brothers innocence everybody else believed that he had run away to escape consequences and george among the number had accepted that belief your beard alters you greatly i should not have known you to be sure it is eight years since i saw you last and i was only just beginning my articles when youleft us he was on the point of saying when you ran away there is a good deal to talk about will you come with me to my rooms i am putting up in half moon street athelstan hailed a passing hansom and they drove off you have been a fortnight in london said george and yet you have not been to see your own people i have been eight years away and yet i have not written a single letter to my own people george asked no more questions arrived at the lodging they went in and sat down athelstan produced soda and whisky and cigars why have i not called upon my own people athelstan took up the question again because when i left home i swore that i would never return until they came to beg forgiveness that is why every evening i have been walking outside the house in the hope of seeing some of them without their seeing me for you see i should like to go home again but i will not go as i went away under a shameful cloud that has got to be lifted first presently i shall know whether it is lifted then i shall know how to act tonight i was rewarded by the sight of my sister elsie walking home with you i knew her at once she is taller than i thought she would become when i went away her face hasnt changed much though she always had the gift of sweet looks which isnt quite the same thing as beauty my sister hilda for instance was always called a handsome girl but she never had elsies sweet looks she has the sweetest looks in the world what are you doing with her george austin i ask again we are engaged to be married married elsie married whysheswelli suppose she must be grown up by this time elsie is very nearly oneandtwenty she will be twentyone tomorrow elsie going to be married it seems absurd oneandtwenty tomorrow ah he sat up eagerly tell me is she any richer has she had any legacies or things no how should she her dot is her sweet self which is enough for any man and you austin i remember you were an articled clerk of eighteen or nineteen when i went awayare you rich austin blushed no he said i am not i am a managing clerk at your old office i get two hundred a year and we are going to marry on that athelstan nodded a bold thing to do howevertwentyone tomorrowwe shall see and i am sorry to say there is the greatest oppositionon the part of your mother and your other sister i am not allowed in the house and elsie is treated as a rebel oh well if you see your way my boy get married and have a happy life and leave them to come round at their leisure elsie has a heart of gold she can believe in a man she is the only one of my people who stood up for me when they accused me without a shadow of proof of the only onethe only one it is impossible for me to forget thatand difficult he added to forgive the other thingis my sister hilda still at home no she is married to sir samuel brother of your mr dering he is a great deal older than his wife but he is very rich ohand my mother i believe she continues in good health i am not allowed the privilege of calling upon her and my old chief he also continues well and now since we have cleared the ground so far let us come to business how about that robbery what robbery the old business had taken place when george was a lad just entering upon his articles he had ceased to think of it what robbery man aliveathelstan sprang to his feetthere is only one robbery to me in the whole history of the world since men and robberies began what robbery look here master george austin when a man is murdered there is for that man only one murder in the whole history of the world all the other murders even that of abel himself are of no concern at allnot one bit he isnt interested in them they dont matter to him a red cent thats my case the robbery of eight years ago which took a few hundred pounds from a rich man changed my whole life it drove me out into the world it forced me for a time to live among the prodigals and the swine and the husks it handed me over to a thousand devils and you ask me what robbery i am very sorry it is now a forgotten thing nobody remembers it any more i doubt whether mr dering himself ever thinks of it well what was discovered after all who did it nothing at all has been discovered no one knows to this day who did it nothing at alli am disappointed hasnt old checkley done time for it nothing found out nothing the notes were stopped in time and were never presented after five or six years the bank of england gave mr dering notes in the place of those stolen and that is all there is to tell nothing discovered and the notes never presented what good did the fellow get by it then i dont know but nothing was discovered nothing discovered athelstan repeated why i took it for granted that the truth had come out long since i was making up my mind to call upon old dering i dont think i shall go nowand my sister hilda will not be coming here to express her contrition i am disappointed you can see elsie if you like yesi can see her he repeatedgeorgehe returned to the old subjectdo you know the exact particulars of that robbery there was a forged cheque and the bank paid it across the counter the cheque athelstan explained was made payable to the order of a certain unknown person named edmund gray it was endorsed by that name to prove that forgery they should have got the cheque and examined the endorsement that was the first thing certainly i wonder how they began i do not know it was while i was in my articles and all we heard was a vague report you ought not to have gone away you should have stayed to fight it out i was right to give up my berth after what the chief said how could i remain drawing his pay and doing his work when he had calmly given me to understand that the forgery lay between two hands and that he strongly suspected mine did mr dering really say so did he go so far as that so i walked out of the place i should have stayed at home and waited for the clearing up of the thing but for my own peoplewhowellyou know so i went away in a rage and have you come backas you wentin a rage wellyou see that is the kind of fire that keeps alight of its own accord i believe that some sort of a search was made for this edmund gray but i do not know how long it lasted or who was employed detectives are no good perhaps the chief didnt care to press the business perhaps he learned enough to be satisfied that checkley was the man perhaps he was unwilling to lose an old servant perhaps the villain confessed the thing it all comes back to me fresh and clear though for eight long years i have not talked with a soul about it tell me said george a little out of sympathy with this dead and buried forgerytell me where you have beenwhat you have doneand what you are doing now presentlypresently he replied with impatience i am sure now that i was wrong i should not have left the country i should have taken a lodging openly and waited and looked on yes that would have been better then i should have seen that old villain checkley in the dock perhaps it is not yet too late stilleight years who can expect a commissionaire to remember a single message after eight years welland now tell me george asked again what you have been doing the blacksheep always turns up doesnt he you learn at home that he has got a berth in the rocky mountains but he jacks it up and goes to melbourne where he falls on his feet but gets tired and moves on to new zealand and so home again its a regular round you are apparently the blacksheep whose wool is dyed white there are threads of gold in it you look prosperous a few years ago i was actually in the possession of money then i became poor again after a good many adventures i became a journalist the profession is in america the refuge of the educated unsuccessful and the hope of the uneducated unsuccessful i am doing as well as journalists in america generally do i am over here as the representative of a francisco paper and i expect to stay for some timeso long as i can be of service to my people thats all wellit might be a great deal worse and wont you come to pembridge crescent with me when the cloud is lifted not before andgeorgenot a word about me dont tellyeteven elsie chapter vi something more happens checkley held the door of the office wide open and invited elsie to enter the aspect of the room solid of furniture severe in its fittings with its vast table covered with papers struck her with a kind of terror at the table sat her guardian austere of countenance all the way along she had been imagining a dialogue he would begin with certain words she would reply firmly but respectfully with certain other words he would go on she would again reply and so on everybody knows the consolations of imagination in framing dialogues at times of trouble they never come off the beginning is never what is expected and the sequel therefore has to be changed on the spot the conditions of the interview had not been realised by elsie also the beginning was not what she expected for her guardian instead of frowning with a brow of corrugated iron and holding up a finger of warning received her more pleasantly than she had imagined it possible for him bade her sit down and leaned back looking at her kindly and so he said you are twentyonetwentyonetoday i am no longer your guardian you are twentyone everything that is past seems to have happened yesterday so that it is needless to say that you were a baby only yesterday yes i am really twentyone i congratulate you to be twentyone is i believe for a young lady at least a pleasant time of life for my own part i have almost forgotten the memory of youth perhaps i never had the time to be young certainly i have never understood why some men regret their youth so passionately as for your sex elsie i know very little of it except in the way of business in that way which does not admit of romance i must say that i have sometimes found ladies importunate tenacious exacting persistent and even revengeful oh said elsie with a little winning smile of conciliation this was only a beginninga preludebefore the unpleasantness that elsie is my unfortunate experience of womenalways in the way of business which of course may bring out the worst qualities in society of which i have little experience they are doubtlesscharmingcharming he repeated the word as if he had found an adjective of whose meaning he was not quite clear an old bachelor is not expected at the age of seventyfive to know much about such a subject the point before us is that you have this day arrived at the mature age of twentyone that is the first thing and i congratulate you the first thing i wonder thought elsie timidly when he will begin upon the next thingthe real thing there lay upon the table before him a paper with notes upon it he took it up looked at it and laid it down again then he turned to elsie and smiledhe actually smiledhe unmistakably smiled at twentyone he said some young ladies who are heiresses come into their property those who are heiresses unhappily i am not come into their propertytheir property it must be a beautiful thing for a girl to come into property unexpectedly at twentyone for a man a temptation to do nothing and to make no more money bad bad but for a girl already engaged a girl who wants money a girl who is engagedehto a penniless young solicitor elsie turned crimson this was the thing she expected under such circumstances i say such a stroke of fortune would be providential and wonderful would it not she blushed and turned pale and blushed again she also felt a strong disposition to crybut repressed that disposition in your case for instance such a windfall would be most welcome your case is rather a singular case you do not belong to a family which has generally disregarded moneyquite the reverseyou should inherit the love of moneyyet you propose to throw away what i believe are very good prospects and my only prospect is to marry george austin so you think i have heard from your mother and i have seen your sister hilda they object very strongly to the engagement i know of course what they would say therefore i need not repeat it replied mr dering drily i learn then that you are not only engaged to this young gentleman but that you are also proposing to marry upon the small income which he now possesses yeswe are prepared to begin the world upon that income your mother asked me what chance he had in his profession in this office he can never rise to a considerable salary as managing clerk if he had money he might buy a partnership but he has none and his friends have none and the profession is congested he may remain all his life in a position not much better than he now occupies the prospect elsie is not brilliant nowe are fully aware of that and yet allow me my dear child you are yourselfwe will say for the momentwithout any means of your own i have nothing or any expectations except from your mother who is not yet sixty i could not count upon my mothers death besides she says that if i persist she will not leave me anything at all so much i understand from herself her present intention is to remove your name from her will in case you go on with this proposed marriage my mother will do what she pleases with her property said elsie if she thinks that i will give way to a threat of this kind she does not know me do not let us speak of threats i am laying before you facts here they are plainly young austin has a very small income he has very little prospect of getting a substantial income you so far as you know have nothing and also so far as you know you have no prospect of anything these are the facts are they not yesi suppose these are the facts we shall be quite poorvery likely quite poor always the tears rose to her eyes but this was not a place for crying i want you to understand these facts very clearly mr dering insisted believe me i do not wish to give you pain all this said elsie with the beginnings of the family obstinacy in her eyes i clearly understand i have had them put before me too often i also learn from your sister lady dering that if you abandon this marriage she is ready to do anything for you that she can her house her carriage her servantsyou can command them all if you please this you know have you considered the meaning of what you propose can you consider it calmly i believe we have on the one side povertynot what is called a small income many people live very well on what is called a small incomebut grinding hard poverty which exacts real privations and burdens you with unexpected loads my dear young lady you have been brought up to a certain amount of plenty and ease if not to luxury do you think you can get along without plenty and ease if george can i can can you become a servantcook housemaid ladysmaidas well as a wifea nurse as well as a mother if george is made happier by my becoming anythinganything it will only make me happier mr dering i am sure you wish me wellyou are my fathers old friendyou have always advised my mother in her troublesmy brother was articled to youbut she paused remembering that he had not been her brothers best friend i mean the best possible for you meantime you are quite fixed in your own mind you are set upon this thing that is clear there is one other way of looking at it you yourself seem chiefly desirous i think to make the man you love happy so much the better for himare you quite satisfied that the other party to the agreement your lover will remain happy while he sees you slaving for him while he feels his own helplessness and while he gets no relief from the grinding poverty of his householdwhilelastlyhe sees his sons taking their place on a lower level and his daughters taking a place below the rank of gentlewoman i reply by another questionyou have had george in your office as articled clerk and managing clerk for eight years is he or is he not steadfast clearheaded one who knows his own mind and one who can be trusted in all things perhaps said mr dering inclining his head how does that advance him then if you trust him why should not i trust him i trust george altogetheraltogether if he does not get on it will be through no fault of his we shall bear our burden bravely believe me mr dering you will not hear himor mecomplain besides i am full of hope oh it can never be in this country that a man who is a good workman should not be able to get on then i can paint a littlenot very well perhaps but i have thoughtyou will not laugh at methat i might paint portraits and get a little money that way it is quite possible that he may succeed and that you may increase the family income everything is possible but remember you are building on possibilities and i on facts plans very beautiful and easy at the outset often prove most difficult in the carrying out my experience of marriages is learned by fifty years of work not imaginative but practical i have learned that without adequate means no marriage can be happy that is to say i have never come across any case of wedded poverty where the husband or the wife or both did not regret the day when they faced poverty together instead of separately that i say is my experience of such marriages it is so easy to say that hand in hand evils may be met and endured which would be intolerable if one was alone it isnt only hand in hand elsie the hands are wanted for the baby and the evils will fall on the children yet unborn elsie hung her head then she replied timidly i have thought even of that it only means that we go lower down in the social scale only yet that is everything people who are well up the ladder too often deride those who are fighting and struggling to get up higher it is great folly or great ignorance to laugh social position in such a country as ours means independence selfrespect dignity all kinds of valuable things you will throw these all awayyet your grandfathers won them for you by hard work you are yourself a gentlewomanwhy because they made their way up in the world and placed their sons also in the way to climb that is how families are madeby three generations at least of steady work uphill elsie shook her head sadly we can only hope she murmured one more word and i will say no more remember that love or no love resignation or not patience or not physical comfort is the beginning and the foundation of all happiness if you and your husband can satisfy the demands of physical comfort you may be happyor at least resigned if not well elsie that is all i should not have said so much had i not promised your mother and your sister i am touched i confess by your courage and your resolution we mean never to regret never to look back and always to work and hope said elsie you will remain our friend mr dering surely surelyand now nowelsie rosei will not keep you any longer you have said what you wished to say very kindly and i thank you nosit down again i havent done with you yet child sit down again no more about that young villaingeorge austin he spoke so goodhumouredly that elsie complied wondering but no longer afraid nothing more about your engagement now listen carefully because this is most important three or four years ago a person wrote to me that person informed me that hefor convenience we will call the person a manwished to place a certain sum of money in my hands in trustfor you for me do you meanin trust what is trust he gave me this sum of money to be given to you on your twentyfirst birthday oh elsie sat up with open eyes a sum of moneyand to me with a condition or two the first condition was that the interest should be invested as it came in the next that i was on no accountmind on no account at allto tell you or any one of the existence of the gift or the name of the donor you are now twentyone i have been careful not to afford you the least suspicion of this happy windfall until the time should arrive neither your mother nor your sister nor your lover knows or suspects anything about it oh elsie said once more an interjection may be defined as a prolonged monosyllable generally a vowel uttered when no words can do justice to the subject and here my dear young ladyelsie cried oh once more becausethe most curious thing in the worldmr derings grave face suddenly relaxed and the lines assumed the very benevolence which she had the day before imparted to his portrait and wished to see upon his facehere my dear young ladyhe laid his hand upon a paperis the list of the investments which i have made of that money you have in fact money in corporation bondsnewcastle nottingham wolverhampton you have water sharesyou have gas sharesall good investments yielding at the price of purchase an average of nearly three and twothirds per cent investments whyhow much money was it then i was thinking when you spoke of a sum of money of ten pounds perhaps no elsie not ten pounds the money placed in my hands for your use was over twelve thousand pounds with accumulations there is now a little under thirteen thousand oh cried elsie for the third time and for the same reason no words could express her astonishment yes it will produce about four hundred and eighty pounds a year perhaps as some of the stock has gone up it might be sold out and placed to better advantage we may get it up to five hundred pounds do you mean mr dering that i have actually got five hundred pounds a yearall my own that is certainly my meaning you have nearly five hundred pounds a year all your ownentirely your own without any conditions whateveryour own oh she sat in silence her hands locked then the tears came into her eyes oh george she murmured you will not be so very poor after all that is all i have to say to you at present elsie said mr dering now you may run away and leave me come to dinner this evening your mother and your sister are coming i shall ask austin as well we may perhaps remove some of those objections dinner at seven sharp elsieand now you can leave me i said last night said elsie clasping her hands with feminine superstition that something was going to happen but i thought it was something horrid oh mr dering if you only knew how happy you have made me i dont know what to say i feel stunned five hundred pounds a year oh it is wonderful what shall i say what shall i say you will say nothing go away now come to dinner this eveninggo away my young heiress go and make plans how to live on your enlarged income it will not prove too much elsie rose then she turned again oh i had actually forgotten wont you tell the manor the womanwho gave you that money for me that i thank him from my very heart it isnt that i think so much about money but oh the dreadful trouble that there has been at home because george has noneand this will do something to reconcile my mother dont you think it will make all the difference i hope that before the evening you will find that all opposition has been removed said her guardian cautiously she walked away in a dream she found herself in lincolns inn fields she walked all round that great square also in a dream the spectre of poverty had vanished she was rich she was rich she had five hundred pounds a year between them they would have seven hundred pounds a year it seemed enormous seven hundred pounds a year sevensevenseven hundred pounds a year she got out into the street called holborn and she took the modest omnibus this heiress of untold wealth how much was it thirteen millions or thirteen thousand one seemed as much as the other twelve thousand with accumulations with accumulationsationsations the wheels of the vehicle groaned out these musical words all the way it was in the morning when the bayswater omnibus is full of girls going home to lunch after shopping or looking at the shops elsie looked at these girls as they sat along the narrow benches my dears she longed to say but did not i hope you have every one got a brave lover and that you have all got twelve thousand pounds apiecewith accumulations twelve thousand poundswith accumulationsationsationsrealising four hundred and eighty pounds a year and perhaps a little more with accumulationsationsationsaccumulations she ran into the house and up the stairs singing at the sound of her voice her mother engaged in calculations of the greatest difficulty paused wondering when she understood that it was the voice of her child and not an organgrinder she became angry what right had the girl to run about singing was it insolent bravado elsie opened the door of the drawingroom and ran in her mothers cold face repelled her she was going to tell the joyful newsbut she stopped you have seen mr dering asked her mother yes i have seen him if he has brought you to reason oh he hashe has i am entirely reasonable mrs arundel was astonished the girl was flushed of face and bright of eye her breath was thick her lips were parted she looked entirely happy my dear mother she went on i am to dine with him tonight hilda is to dine with him tonight you are to dine with him tonight it is to be a family party he will bring us all to reasonto a bag full of reasons elsie this seems to me to be mirth misplaced nonoin its right placereasons all in a row and on three shelves labelled and arranged and classified you talk in enigmas my dear motheryet that morning the dear mother would not speak to the dear daughteri talk in enigmas and i sing in conundrums i feel like an oracle or a delphic old woman for dark sayings she ran away slamming the door after her her mother heard her singing in her studio all to herself can she be in her right mind she asked anxiously to marry a pauperto receive the admonition of her guardianand such a guardianand to come home singing twould be better to lock her up than let her marry chapter vii something else happens mr dering lay back in his chair gazing at the doorthe unromantic office doorthrough which elsie had just passed i suppose that even the driest of old bachelors and lawyers may be touched by the sight of a young girl made suddenly and unexpectedly happy perhaps the mere apparition of a lovely girl dainty and delicate and sweet daintily and delicately apparelled so as to look like a goddess or a woodnymph rather than a creature of clay may have awakened old and longforgotten thoughts before the instincts of youth were stifled by piles of parchment it is the peculiar and undisputed privilege of the historian to read thoughts but it is not always necessary to write them down he sat up and sighed i have not told her all he murmured she shall be happier still he touched his handbell checkley he said ask mr austin kindly to step this waya day of surpriseof joyful surprisefor both it was indeed to be a day of good fortune as you shall see he opened a drawer and took out a document rolled and tied which he laid upon the table before him george obeyed the summons not without misgiving for elsie he knew must by this time have had the dreaded interview and the call might have some reference to his own share in the great contumacy to incur the displeasure of his employer in connection with that event might lead to serious consequences astonishing thing mr dering received him with a countenance that seemed transformed he smiled benevolently upon him he even laughed he smiled when george opened the door he laughed when in obedience to a gesture of invitation george took a chair he actually laughed not weakly or foolishly but as a strong man laughs i want ten minutes with you george austinhe actually used the christian nameten minutes or a quarter of an hour or perhaps half an hour he laughed again now thenhis face assumed its usual judicial expression but his lips broke into unaccustomed smilesnow then sir i have just seen my wardmy former ward for she is now of ageand have heardwelleverything there was to hear i have no doubt sir that what you heard from elsie was the exact truth i believe so the questions which i put to her i also put to you how do you propose to live on your salary you have been engaged to my late ward without asking the permission of her guardiansthat is her mother and myself that is not quite the case we found that her mother opposed the engagement and therefore it was not necessary to ask your permission we agreed to let the matter rest until she should be of age meanwhile we openly corresponded and saw each other it is a distinction without a difference perhaps what you would call a legal distinction you now propose to marry elsie arundel is no longer my ward but as a friend i venture to ask you how you propose to live a wife and a house cost money shall you keep house and wife on your salary alone have you any other resources there are several ways of putting these awkward questions there is especially the way of accusation by which you charge the guilty young man of being by his own fault one of a very huge familyof having no money and no expectationsnothing at all unless he can make it for himself it is the manner generally adopted by parents and guardians mr dering however when he put the question smiled genially and rubbed his handsa thing so unusual as to be terrifying in itselfas if he was uttering a jokea thing he never had done in his life the question however even when put in this the kindest way is one most awkward for any young man and especially to a young man in either branch of the law and most especially to a young man beginning the ascent of the lower branch consider of all the professions crowded as they are there is none so crowded as this branch of the law what asks anxious quiverful pere shall i do with this boy of mine i will spend a thousand pounds upon him and make him a solicitor once he has passed the way is clear for him how asks the ambitious man of trade shall i advance my son i will make him a lawyer once passed he will open an office and get a practice and become rich he will be a gentleman and his children will be born gentlemen very good a most laudable custom it is in this realm of great britain for the young men still to be pressing upwards though those who are already high up would fain forget the days of climbing and sneer at those who are making their way but applied to this profession climbing seems no longer practicable this way of advance will have to be abandoned consider again every profession gets rich out of its own mine there is the mine ecclesiastic the mine medical the mine artistic the mine legal the lastnamed contains leases covenants agreements wills bonds mortgages actions partnerships transfers conveyances county courts and other treasures all to be had for the digging butand this is too often forgottenthere is only a limited quantity to be taken out of the mine every year and there is not enough to go round except in very minute portions and since until we become socialists at heart we shall all of us continue to desire for our share that which is called the mess of benjamin and since all cannot get that messwhich mr dering had enjoyed for the whole of his lifeor anything like that desirable portion most young solicitors go in great heaviness of spirithang their heads corrugate their foreheads write despairing letters to the girls they left behind them and with grumbling gratitude take the hundred or two hundred a year which is offered for their services as managing clerks again the legal mine seems of late years not to yield anything like so much as formerly there has been a cruel shrinkage all over the country and especially in country towns the boom of building seems to have come to an end the agricultural depression has dragged down with it an immense number of people who formerly flourished with the lawyers and by means of their savings investments leases and partnerships and quarrels made many a solicitor fat and happy that is all gone it used to be easy if one had a little money to buy a partnership now it is no longer possible or at least no longer easy nobody has a business greater than he himself can manage everybody has got a son coming in these considerations show why the question was difficult to answer said george in reply but with some confusion we are prepared to live on little we are not in the least extravagant elsie will rough it besides she has her art out of which she makes at present nothing a year but she will get onand i may hope may reasonably hope some time to make an income larger than my present one you may hopeyou may hope but the position is not hopeful in fact george austin you must marry on ten times your present income or not at all but i assure you sir our ideas are truly modest and we have made up our minds how we can live and pay our way you think you have that is to say you have prepared a table of expenses showing how with twopence to spare you can live very well on two hundred pounds a year of course you put down nothing for the thousand and one little unexpected things which everybody of your education and habits pays for every day we have provided as far as we can see well it wont do of course i cant forbid the girl to marry you she is of age i cant forbid youbut i can make it impossibleimpossible for you master austinimpossible he rapped the table the words were stern but the voice was kindly and he smiled again as he spoke you thought you would do without me did you wellyou shall seeyou shall see george received this threat without words but with a red face and with rising indignation still when one is a servant one must endure the reproofs of the master he said nothing therefore but waited i have considered for some time mr dering continued how to meet this case in a satisfactory manner at last i made up my mind and if you will read this document young gentleman you will find that i have made your foolish proposal to marry on love and nothing else quite impossiblequite impossible sir he slapped the table with the paper and tossed it over to george george took the paper and began to read it suddenly he jumped out of his chair he sprang to his feet what he cried go ongo on said mr dering benevolently partnership partnership george gasped what does it mean it is as you say a deed of partnership between myself and yourself the conditions of the partnership are duly set forthi hope you will see your way to accepting thema deed of partnership i do not know within a few hundreds what your share may be but i believe you may reckon on at least two thousand for the first year and moremuch morebefore long more than a thousand you have not read the deed through call yourself a lawyer sit down and read it word for word george obeyed reading it as if it was a paper submitted to him for consideration a paper belonging to some one else well you have read it yes i have read it through observe that the partnership may be dissolved by death bankruptcy or mutual consent i receive twothirds of the proceeds for life thatalaswill not be for longwell young man do you accept this offer accept oh accept what can i do what can i saybut accept he walked to the window and looked out i suppose he was admiring the trees in the square which were certainly very beautiful in early july then he returned his eyes humid aha mr dering chuckled i told you that i would make it impossible for you to marry on two hundred pounds a year i waited till elsies birthday well you will now be able to revise that little estimate of living on two hundred a year eh mr dering said george with breaking voice i cannot believe it i cannot understand it i have not deserved it shake hands my partner the two men shook hands now sit down and let us talk a bit said mr dering i am old i am past seventy i have tried to persuade myself that i am still as fit for work as ever but i have had warnings i now perceive that they must be taken as warnings sometimes it is a little confusion of memoryi am not able to account for little thingsi forget what i did yesterday afternoon i suppose all old men get these reminders of coming decay it means that i must reduce work and responsibility i might give up business altogether and retire i have money enough and to spare but this is the third generation of a successful house and i could not bear to close the doors and to think that the firm would altogether vanish so i thought i would take a partner and i began to look about me wellin brief i came to the conclusion that i should find no young man better qualified than yourself for ability and for power of work and for all the qualities necessary for the successful conduct of such a house as this especially i considered the essential of good manners i was early taught by my father that the greatest aid to success is good breeding i trust that in this respect i have done justice to the teaching of one who was the most courtly of his time you belong to an age of less ceremony and less respect to rank but we are not always in a barrack or in a club we are not all comrades or equals there are those below to consider as well as those above there are women there are old men you my partner have shown me that you can give to each the consideration the deference the recognition that he deserves true breeding is the recognition of the individual you are careful of the small things which smooth the asperities of business in no profession not even that of medicine is a good manner more useful than in ours and this you possessit also pleases me he added after a pause to think that in making you my partner i am also promoting the happiness of a young lady i have known all her life george murmured something he looked more like a guilty schoolboy than a man just raised to a position most enviable his cheeks were flushed and his hands trembled mr dering touched his bell checkley he said when that faithful retainer appeared i have already told you of my intention to take a partner this is my new partner checkley changed colour his old eyesor was george wrongflashed with a light of malignity as he raised them it made him feel uncomfortablebut only for a moment my partner checkley repeated mr dering oh his voice was dry and grating since we couldnt go on as before well i hope you wont repent it you shall witness the signing of the deed checkley call in a clerk sothere we have it drawn signed and witnessed once more my partner shake hands elsie retired to her own room after the snub administered to her rising spirits she soon began to sing again being much too happy to be affected by anything so small she went on with her portrait preserving some but not all of the softness and benevolence which she had put into it and thereby producing what is allowed to be an excellent portrait but somewhat flattering she herself knows very well that it is not flattering at all but even lower than the truth only the other people have never seen the lawyer in an expansive moment now while she was thus engaged her mind going back every other minute to her newlyacquired inheritance a cab drove up to the housethe door flew open and her loverher georgeflew into her arms you heregeorge actually in the house oh but you know i knowi know but i could not possibly wait till this evening my dear child the most wonderfulthe most wonderful thingthe most extraordinary thingin the whole world has happeneda thing we could never hope and never ask mr dering has told you then what do you know mr dering told me this morningoh george isnt it wonderful wonderful it is like the last chapter of a novel this he said speaking as a fool because the only last chapter in life is that in which azrael crosses the threshold oh georgei have been walking in the airi have been flyingi have been singing and dancing i feel as if i had never before known what it was to be happy mr dering said something about having it settledmindits all yours georgeyours as well as mine yes said george a little puzzled i suppose in the eyes of the law it is mine but then it is yours as well all that is mine is yours oh mr dering said it was mine in the eyes of the law what does it matter george what the stupid old law says nothing my dearnothing at all it will be worth five hundred pounds a year very nearly that with your two hundred pounds a year will make us actually comfortable after all our anxieties five hundred a year it will be worth four times that i hope four times oh nothat is impossible but mr dering told me that he could hardly get so much as four per cent and i have made a sum and worked it out rule for simple interest multiply the principal by the rate per cent and again by the time and divide by a hundred it is quite simple and what makes the sum simpler you need only take one year what principal elsie by what interest you are running your little head against rules of arithmetic here there is no principal and no interest it is a case of proceeds and then division we will call it proceeds if you like george but he called it interest anyhow it comes to five hundred a year very nearly and with your two hundred i dont know what you mean by your five hundred a year as for my two hundred unless i am very much mistaken that will very soon be two thousand your two hundred will become george we are talking across each other yes what money of yours do you mean i mean the twelve thousand pounds that mr dering holds for mewith accumulationsaccumulationsshe began to sing the rhyme of the omnibus wheelsaccumulationsationsations twelve thousand pounds is this fairyland twelve thousand i reeli fainti sinki melt away take my handsboth my hands elsiekiss me kindlyits better than brandykindly kiss me twelve thousand pounds with accumulations ationsationsations she sung never before george have i understood the loveliness and the power of money they were given to mr dering by an anonymous person to be held for mesecretly no one knowsnot even yet my mother oh it is altogether too muchtoo much once there was a poor but loving couple and fortune turned her wheel and you dont knowyou most unsuspecting ignorant thingyou cant guess oh elsie i am a partnermr derings partner they caught hands againthen they let gothen they sat down and gazed upon each other elsie said george george said elsie we can now marry like everybody elsebut much better we shall have furniture now all the furniture we shall want and a house where we please no contriving nowno pinching no selfdenying for each other my dear thats a pity isnt itbut george dont repine the advantages may counterbalance the drawbacks i think i see the cottage where we were going to live it is in islington or near itbarnsbury perhaps there is a little garden in front and one at the back there is always washing hung out to dry i dont like the smell of suds for dinner one has cold australian tinned meat for economy not for choice the rooms are very small and the furniture is shabby because it was cheap and bad to begin with and when you come homeoh georgeshe stuck her forefinger in her chalk and drew two or three lines on his faceyou look like that so discontented so grumpy so gloomy oh my dear the advantagesthey do so greatly outbalance the drawbacks and georgeyou will love your wife all the morei am sure you willbecause she can always dress properly and look nice and give you a dinner that will help to rest you from the work of the day once more this foolish couple fell into each others arms and kissed again with tears and smiles and laughter who asked mrs arundel ringing the bell upstairs who is with miss elsie below on hearing that it was mr george austin whose presence in the house was forbidden mrs arundel rose solemnly and awfully and walked down the stairs she had a clear duty before her when she threw open the door the lovers were hand in hand dancing round the room laughingbut the tears were running down elsies cheeks elsie said her mother standing at the open door perhaps you can explain this permit me to explain said george this gentleman elsie has been forbidden the house one moment he began go sir she pointed majestically to the window oh cried elsie tell her georgetell her i cannot she fell to laughing and crying together but still held her lover by the hand i will have no communication whatever with one who robs me of a daughter said this roman matron will you once more leave the house sir motheryou must hear him nothing said mrs arundel will ever induce me to speak to himnothing mother dont be silly elsie cried you dont know what has happened you must not say such things you will only be sorry for them afterwards nevernever one may forgive such a man but one can never speak to him neverwhatever happensnever the lady looked almost heroic as she waved her right hand in the direction of the man i will go said george but not till you have heard me i am richelsie is richwe shall not marry into poverty the whole situation is entirely changed changed elsie repeated taking georges arm my dear george said mrs arundel when she had heard the whole storyand by cross examination persuaded herself that it was trueyou know on what a just basis my objections were founded otherwise i should have been delighted at the outsetkiss me elsieyou have my full consent children these remarkable events are providentialon mr derings death or retirement you will step into an enormous practice follow his example take no partner till old age compels you keep all the profits for yourselfallmy dear george you should be a very happy man not so rich perhaps as my soninlaw sir samuel but above the ordinary run of common happiness as for the past we will now go down to lunchthere is the bell these emotions are fatiguing chapter viii in honour of the event may one dwell upon so simple a thing as a small family dinnerparty it is generally undramatic and uneventful it is not generally marked even by a new dish or a bottle of rare wine yet there lingers in the mind of every man the recollection of pleasant dinners i should like to write a book of dinnersnot a book for the gourmet but a book of memories it might be a most delightful volume there would be in it the schoolboys dinner i remember a certain dinner at eighteenpence a head at richmond before we had the row in the boat when we quarrelled and broke the oars over each others heads and very nearly capsized a certain undergraduates dinner in which four menthree of whom are now ghostsjoined the ramblers dinner of lamb chops and bottled ale and mirth and merriment the twobytwo dinner in the private room a dainty dinner of sweet lamb sweet bread sweet peas sweet looks sweet moselle and sweet words is it really true that one nevernevergets young again some people do i am sure but they are under promise to say nothing about it i shalland then that dinner may perhapsone cannot sayone never knowsand i supposeif one was young againthat they would be found just as pretty as they ever were there is the official dinner stately and cold the city dinner which generally comes to a man when his digestion is no longer what it was the family dinner in which the intellect plays so small a part because no one wastes his fine things on his brothers and sisters the dinner at which one has to make a speech indeed this book of dinners promises to be a most charming volume i should attempt it however with trembling because to do it really well one should be first of all a scholar if only to appreciate things said and spoken and in order to connect the illustrious past with food and drink next he ought to be still young he certainly must have a proper feeling for wine and must certainly understand when and why one should be grateful to good master cook he should be a past or present master in the art of love and a squire of dames he should be good at conversation he must in the old language be a worshipper of bacchus venus phoebus apollo the muses nine and the graces three he must be no poor weakling unable to enjoy the good creatures of flesh fowl fish and wine no boor and no log insensible to loveliness dinner which should be a science has long been treated as one of the fine arts now every fine art as we all know has its fashions and its caprices those who are old enough to remember the dinners of twenty thirty or forty years ago can remember many of their fashions and caprices in the thirties for instance everything was carved upon the table it required a man with a strong wrist to give a dinnerparty fortunately a dinner then consisted of few dishes they drank sherry with dinner and port afterwards the champagne if there was any was sweet the guests were bidden for halfpast six they sat down to dinner before seven at eight the ladies went upstairs at halfpast ten the men joined them their faces were flushed their shoulders were inclined to lurch and their speech was the least bit thick wonderful to relate brandyandwater used to be served to these topers in the drawingroom itself mr dering had altered little in his dinner customs they mostly belonged to the sixties with a survival of some belonging to the thirties things were carved upon the sideboard this was in deference to modern custom champagne formed an integral part of the meal but the dinner itself was solid the cloth after dinner was removed leaving the dark polished mahogany after the old fashion the furniture of the room was also in the old style the chairs were heavy and solid the walls were hung with a dark crimson paper of velvety texture the curtains and the carpets were red there were pictures of game and fruit the sideboard was as solid as the table checkley the clerk who was invited as a faithful servant of the house to the celebration of the new partnership was the first to arrive dressed in a hired suit he looked like an undertakers assistant the gloom upon his face heightened the resemblance why the partnership caused this appearance of gloom i know not certainly he could never expect to be made a partner himself it was perhaps a species of jealousy which filled his soul he would no longer know so much of the business george came with the motherinlaw elect and the fiancee forgiveness peace amnesty and charity sat all together upon the brow of the elder lady she was magnificent in a dark crimson velvet and she had a good deal of gold about her arms and neck jewish ladies are said to show by the magnificence of their attire the prosperity of the business why not it is a form of enjoying success there are many forms one man buys books let him buy books another collects pictures why not one woman wears crimson velvet why not in this way she enjoys her wealth and proclaims it again why not it seems to the philosopher a fond and vain thing to deck the person at all times and especially fond when the person is middleaged and no longer beautiful we are not all philosophers there are many middleaged men who are extremely happy to put on their uniform and their medals and their glittering helmets mrs arundel wore her velvet as if she enjoyed the colour of it the richness of it the light and shade that lay in its folds and the soft feel of it she wore it too as an outward sign that this was a great occasion her daughter lady dering came also arrayed in a queenly dress of amber silk with an aigrette of feathers in her hair to be sure she was going on somewhere after the dinner elsie for her part came in a creamy white almost like a bride but she looked much happier than most brides hildas husband sir samuel who was some six or seven years younger than his brother was in appearance a typical man of wealth the rich man can no longer as in the days of good old sir thomas gresham illustrate his riches by costly furs embroidered doublets and heavy chains he has to wear broadcloth and black yet there is an air a carriage which belongs to the rich man in appearance sir samuel was tall like his brother but not thin like him he was corpulent his face was red he was bald and he wore large whiskers dyed black the late dissensions were completely forgotten hilda embraced her sister fondly my dear she whispered we have heard all everythingeverything is changed by these fortunate events they do you the greatest creditgeorgeshe took his hand and held it tenderlyi cannot tell you how happy this news has made us all you will be rich in the course of years sir samuel was only saying as we came along i was saying young gentleman the knight interrupted that the most beautiful thing about money is the way it develops character we do not ask for many virtuesonly honesty and diligencefrom the poor when a man acquires wealth we look for his better qualities yes indeed hilda murmured his better qualities begin to showelsie dear that is a very pretty frock i dont think i have seen it before how do you like my dress george accepted this sudden turn in opinion with smiles he laughed at it afterwards for the moment it made him feel almost as if he was being rewarded for some virtuous action dinner was announced at sevensuch were the oldfashioned manners of this old gentleman he led in mrs arundel and placed elsie on his left at first the dinner promised to be a silent feast the two lovers were not disposed to talk muchthey had not yet recovered from the overwhelming and astonishing events of the day sir samuel never talked at the beginning of dinnerbesides there was turtle soup and red mullet and whitebaitit is sinful to divert your attention from these good creatures his wife never talked at dinner or at any other time more than she could help your statuesque beauty seldom does talking much involves smiling and even laughing which distorts the face a woman must encourage men to talk this she can do without saying much herself presently mr dering roused himself and began to talk with a visible effort first to mrs arundel of things casual then to elsie and then to his brother but always with an effort as if he was thinking of other things and a constraint fell upon the party when the cloth was removed and the wine and fruit placed upon the dark and lustrous board he filled a glass and made a kind little speech my partnerhe said i drink to you may your connection with the house be prosperous it is a very great good fortune for me to have found such a partnerelsie i join you with my partner i wish you both every happiness he drained the bumper and sent round the decanters then he began to talk and his discourse was most strange had it been said his brother afterwards the idle fancies of some crackbrained writing fellow i could have understood it but from himfrom a steady old solicitora man who has never countenanced any kind of nonsenseto be sure he said it was only an illusion i hope it isnt a softening who ever heard of such a man as that having dreams and illusions certainly no one had ever before heard mr dering talk in this new manner as a rule he was silent and grave even at the head of his own table he spoke little and then gravely tonight his talk as well as his face was changed who would have thought that mr dering should confess to illusions and should relate dreams and should be visited by such dreams remember that the speaker was seventyfive years of age and that he had never before been known so much as to speak of benevolence then you will understand something of the bewilderment which fell upon the whole company he began by raising his head and smiling with a strange and new benignitybut elsie thought of her portrait we are all one family here he said and i may talk i want to tell you of a very remarkable thing that has recently happened to me it has been growing i now perceive for some years but it now holds me strongly and it is one reason why i am anxious to have the affairs of the house in the hands of a younger man for it may be a sign of the end at seventyfive anything uncommon may be a sign you look well mr dering and as strong as most men of sixty said mrs arundel perhaps i feel well and strong the fact is that i am troubledor pleasedor possessedby an illusion you with an illusion said his brother i myself an illusion possesses me it whispers me from time to time that my life is wholly spent in promoting the happiness of other people well said his brother since you are a firstclass solicitor and manage the affairs of many people very much to their advantage you certainly do promote their happiness yes yesi suppose so my illusion further is that it is done outside my businesswithout any bill afterwardscheckley looked up with eyes wide openi am made to believe that i am working and living for the good of others a curious illusion is it not the city man shook his head that any man can possibly live for the good of others is i take it always and under all circumstances an illusion in the present state of societyand a very admirable state it ishe rolled his bald head as he spoke and his voice had a rich roll in ita mans first dutyhis second dutyhis third dutyhis hundredth dutyis to himself in the city it is his business to amass wealthto roll it uproll it uphe expressed the words with feelingto invest it profitablyto watch it and to nurse it as it fructifiesfructifies afterwards when he is rich enough if ever a man can be rich enough he may exercise as much charity as he pleasesas he pleases charity seems to please some people as a glass of fine winehe illustrated the comparisonpleases the palatepleases the palate the lawyer listened politely and inclined his head there is at least some method in my illusion he went on you mentioned it the solicitor is always occupied with the conduct of other peoples affairs that must be admitted he is always engaged in considering how best to guide his fellowman through the labyrinthine world he receives his fellowman at his entrance into the world as a ward he receives him grown up as a client he advises him all his life at every step and in every emergency if the client goes into partnership or marries or buys a house or builds one or gets into trouble the solicitor assists and advises him when the client grows old the solicitor makes his will when the client dies the solicitor becomes his executor and his trustee and administers his estate for him it is thus a life as i said entirely spent for other people i know not of any other unless it be of medicine that so much can be said and think what terrors what anxieties what disappointments the solicitor witnesses and alleviates think of the family scandals he hushes up and keeps secret good heavens if a solicitor in large practice were to tell what he knows think of the terrible disclosures he knows every thing he knows more than a roman catholic priest because his penitents not only reveal their own sins but also those of their wives and sons and friends and partners and anxiety i may tell you makes a man better at confessing than penitence sometimes we bring actions at law and issue writs and so forth well now this part of our business which is disagreeable to us is actually the most beneficent of any because by means of the cases brought before the high court of justice we remind the world that it must be law abiding as well as law worthy the law in order to win respect must first win fear force comes before order the memory of force must be kept up the presence of force must be felt for instance i have a libel case just begun it is rather a bad libel my libeller will suffer he will bleed but he will bleed for the public good because thousands who are only anxious to libel and slander to calumniate and defame their neighbours will be deterred oh it will be a most beneficent casefar reachingstriking terror into the hearts of illdoerswellthis my friends is my illusion it is i suppose one of the many illusions with which we cheat old age and rob it of its terrors to everybody else i am a hardfisted lawyer exacting his pound of flesh from the unfortunate debtor and making myself rich at the expense of the creditor nonsense about how a man gets rich said the man of business he can only get rich if he is capable quite right let the weak go under let the careless and the lazy starve at the same time said elsie softly it is not all illusion there are others besides the careless and the lazy sometimes the old lawyer went on this illusion of mineoh i know it is only illusiontakes the form of a dreamso vivid that it comes back to me afterwards as a reality in this dream which is always the same i seem to have been engaged in some great scheme of practical benevolence practical what you engaged in practical benevolence the city man asked in profound astonishment the illusion was astonishing enough but to have his brother talk of practical benevolence was amazing indeed practical benevolence repeated mr dering his voice dropped his eyes looked out into space he seemed as one who narrates a story it is a curiously persistent dream it comes at irregular intervals it pleases me while it lastsoh in the evening after dinner while one takes a nap in the easy chair perhapsit is as i said quite vivid the action of this dream always takes place in the same rooma large room plainly furnished and looking out upon an open spacei should know it if i saw itand it fills me with pleasurein my dreamjust to feel that i amthere is no other word for itdiffusing happiness how i manage this diffusion i can never remember but there it isgood solid happiness such as in waking moments one feels to be impossible diffusing happinessyou said his brother a very beautiful dream said elsie but no one dared to look in each others face this strange dream of mine continued mr dering does not form part of that little illusion though it seems connected with it and as i said mostly it comes in the evening the other day however i had it in the afternoonwent to sleep in my office i supposedid you find me asleep checkley it was on friday no on friday afternoon you went out ah when i came back then i had forgotten that i went out did i go out strange never mind this continuous dream opens up a world of new ideas and things which are i perceive when i am awake quite unreal and illusory yet they please i see myself as i said diffusing happiness with open hands the world which is thus made happier consists entirely of poor people i move among them unseen i listen to them i see what they do and i hear what they say mindall this is as real and true to me as if it actually happened and it fills me with admiration of the blessed state of poverty in my dream i pity the rich with all my heart to get rich i thinkin this dreamthey must have practised so many deceptions brother brother sir samuel held up both hands in my dreamonly in my dream those who inherit riches are burdened with the weight of their wealth which will not suffer them to enter into the arena will not allow them to develop and to exercise their talents and afflicts them with the mental and bodily diseases that belong to indolence the poor on the other hand who live from day to day sometimes out of work for weeks together practise easily the simple virtues of brotherly love charity and mutual helpfulness they have learned to combine for the good of all rather than to fight one against another for selfish gain it is the only world where all are borrowing and lending giving and helping brother this dream of yours is like a socialistic tract it may be yet you see how strongly it takes hold of me that while i see the absurdity of the whole thing it is not unpleasing to recall the recollection of it welli do not know what set me talking about this dream the smiles left his face he became grave again he ceased to talk for the rest of the evening he was once more the old solicitor weighed down with the affairs of other people checkleyit was on the doorstep and sir samuel waited while his wife said a few fond things to her sisterwhat the devil came over my brother tonight i dont know indeed sir samuel i never heard him talk like that before doin good to em servin a writ upon em is more our line i think he must be upset somewhere in his inside and its gone to his head practical benevolence living for other people have you heard him complain of anything no sir samuel he never complains eats hearty walks upright and strong works like he always has workeddoin good and the blessedness of being pore seems most wonderful blessedness of being pore well sir samuel ive enjoyed that blessedness myself and i know what its like any ornary preachin chap might talk that nonsense but for your eminent brother sir samuel such a lawyer as himto be talking such stuffif i may humbly so speak of my learned masters wordsit issir samuelit really is amazing he said it was a dream remember but i agree with you checkleyit is amazing humph the blessedness of being pore and over such a glass of port too i thought i should ha rolled off my chairi did indeedheres your good lady sir samuel elsie said mrs arundel in the carriage i think it was high time that mr dering should take a partner he to dream of practical benevolence he to be diffusing happiness with open hands oh most lamentablei call it however the deeds are signed and we are all right in case of anything happening it is a comfort to think that georges position would be only improved chapter ix at the gates of paradise many women have advanced the doctrine that the happiest time of life is that of their engagement of course no man can possibly understand this theory but from a womans point of view it can be defended because it is for some girls the most delightful thing in the world to be wooed and until the church service is actually said and the ring is on the finger the bride is queen and mistress afterwardsnot always but the happiness of it depends upon its being a courtship without obstacles now in the case of the young couple whose fortunes we are following there was plenty of love with excellent wooing but the engagement had been opposed by the whole tribe of arundels so that every time she met her lover it was in open rebellion against her mother to go home from a walk with him only to find the silence of resentment at home was not pleasant again we have seen how they were looking forward to a life of povertyeven of privation dame penury with her pinching ways and shrewish tongue was going to be their constant lodger then the young man could not choose but ask himself whether he was not a selfish beast to take a girl out of plenty into privation and the girl could not choose but ask herself whether she was not selfish in laying this great burden upon the back of her lover no one can be indifferent to such a prospect no one can contemplate with pleasure the cheeseparings the savings the management of such a life no one can like having to make a penny do the work of sixpence no one can rejoice as one steps down down down the social ladder no one can anticipate with satisfaction the loss of gentlehood for the daughters and the loss of an adequate education for the sons you will make me happy said the lover at the cost of everything that makes life happy for yourself if i make you happy said the girl i ask for nothing more but oh i am laying a heavy burden upon you can you bear it will you never blame me if the burden is greater than you can bear and now all the trouble vanished like a cloud from the morning skyvanished so completely that there was not a trace of it left anywhere the accusing figure of her mother was changed into a smiling face of pleased and satisfied maternity reproaches were turned into words of endearment angry looks to presents and caresses and as for her sister you might have thought that all this good fortune was actually achieved and conquered by elsieotherwise how could one justify the praise and flattery that hilda now lavished upon her she gave a great dinner as a kind of official reception of the bridegroom into the family she also gave a dance at which she herself was the most beautiful womanshe stood in a conspicuous place all the evening magnificently dressed statuesque wonderful and elsie was the prettiest girl at the party but between the most beautiful woman and the prettiest girl was a difference there is nothing like good fortune to bring out a girls good qualities elsie had always had friends now she might have numbered them by hundreds good fortune breeds friends as the sunshine creates the flowers she was congratulated caressed and flattered enough to turn her head now girls are so constituted that they love admiration which is a kind of affection even when it takes the form of flattery and their heads may be easily turned but they are as easily turned back again and the housethe widows housewhich for so many years had been so dull and quiet a place was transformed into a place of entertainment it only wanted coloured lamps to make it another vauxhall it was crowded every night with the younger friends of bride and bridegroom george had many friends he was gregarious by nature he was a rowing man on the athletic side he had a healthy love and a light hand for things like billiards shooting and fishing they are tastes which assist in the creation of friendships these friendsyoung fellows of like mindcame to the house in multitudes to rally round the man about to desert their ranks young men are forgiving george would row no more among them he would be lost to the billiard table and to the club itself yet they forgave him and accepted his invitation and went to see the bride they found her with the friends of her own age heavens how the daring of one man in taking away a maiden from the band encourages others there are six love stories at least all rising out of these evenings and all of surpassing interest had one the time to write them they are both grave and gay there are tears in every one the course of true love in no case ran smooth except in the story of the two stupids loves enemies can never effect aught against a stupid and so these two stupids became engaged without opposition and were married with acclamations but they are too stupidperhapsto know their own happiness all this went on for three weeks it was arranged that the happy pair should be married in the middle of august they had resolved to spend their honeymoon in france staying a few days in paris and then going on to see the towns and the country along the loire with the old city of tours for their centre they proposed to live entirely upon fruit and wine and kisses no place in the world like touraine for those who are so young and so much in love and so perfectly satisfied with so simple a diet even for those who take a cutlet with the fruit and the wine there is no place equal to touraine meantime against the homecoming a desirable flat was secured not one of your little economical flats all drawingroom with two or three rabbithutches for bedrooms but a large and highly decorated flat with all the newest appliances large rooms and a lift and plenty of space for the dinnerparties and receptions which elsie would have to give the servants were engaged the furniture was ordered all in the advanced taste of the daycarpets curtains pictures overmantels cabinets screens elsie went every day to her new home and found something omitted and sat down in it to wonder what it would be likethis new life she was entering upon oh it was a busy timethen there was her trousseaueverybody knows the amount of thought and care required for a trousseau this was approaching completioneverybody knows the happiness peculiar and unlike any other kind of happiness with which a girl contemplates a heap of things all her own i suppose that it is only at her wedding that she can enjoy this happiness for afterwards the things are not her own but the things of the family the brides dress another thing of supreme importance had been tried on though as yet it was very very far from being finished the bridesmaids two of georges sisters had also already tried on their dresses they came every day two very sweet girls who have both to do with those six love stories which will never i fear be told to talk over the events and to see the presents these came in daily and were laid out in a room by themselves looking very splendid their splendour proved the wealth and the position of the pair because rich presents are only given to rich people in a word everybody was heartily loyally sympathetic as if to make up for the previous harshness and coldness for four weeks this happiness lasted it was on monday june that the golden shower descended upon them it was on monday july that the rain of gold ceased and another kind of cloud came up which speedily changed into a driving storm of rain and sleet and hail and ice and snow look at them on sunday before the storm there is generally a brief time of sunshine warm and fine after the storm the calm that follows is a time of dismay speechless and tearless sunday was the day before the storm it was a day of sunshine without and within the lovers spent the whole day together hand in hand they went to church together they sat side by side they warbled off the same hymn book the service proved as the preacher used to say a season of refreshment for never doth religion so uplift the soul as when it is entirely happy the voices of the choir chanting the psalms filled them with joy and would have done so even if they had been penitential minors and the lamentation of a sinner their hearts rose higher and higher as the preacher exhorted and would have flown upwards just as much whether he had brandished the terrors of the law or held out the gracious promise of the gospel for you see at such a time as this whatever was said or done only led this faithful pair farther and deeper into the shady glades and fragrant lawns and flowery dells of loves paradise every church at every service and especially in the evening contains many such lovers you may know them by certain infallible signs they sit very close together they sing off the same book their faces betray by the rigidity of their attitude which is that of pretended attention the faraway expression of their eyes and the absence of any external sign of emotion or sympathy with the preacher that their hands beneath some folds of the feminine gabardine are closely clasped it has sometimes pleased the philosopher and relieved the tedium of a dull sermon to look round the congregation and to pick out the lovershere a pair and there a pair even in the church you see love is conqueror and king these lovers therefore went to church in a frame of mind truly heavenly nobody in the whole congregation felt more deeply pious every response was an act of praise every prayer an act of gratitude every hymn a personal thankoffering but beneath those seemingly calm faces was flying and rushing a whirlwind of hopes memories plans projects and gratitudes he who looks back upon the days immediately before his weddingdaymost men no more remember their own emotions than a child remembers yesterdays earachewill wonder how he lived through that time of change when all that he prayed for was granted but on the condition of a turning upside down of all his habits customs and petted ways all round them sat the people no doubt with minds wholly attuned to the service of prayer and praise well the sheep in a flock to outward seeming are all alike yet every animal has his own desires and small ambitions for himself so i suppose with the congregation as every man shuts the street door behind him and trudges along the way to churchthe via sacrawith wife and children he carries in his waistcoat pocket close to his heart a little packet of business cares to think upon during the sermon and if all the thoughts of all the people could be collected after the sermon instead of the offertory they would make a salutary oblation indeed george said elsie as they came out let us go into the gardens and sit under a tree and talk let us get away from everybody for half an hour kensington gardens were filled with the customary throng of those who like themselves had been to church the carping philosopher says unkind things about church and gardens and fashion as if church would ever keep like from congregating with like there were shoals of beautiful girls dressed as well as they knew or could afford dozens of young fellows and with them the no longer quite so young the no longer young the no longer young at all the middleaged the elderly and the old not to speak of the children elsie looked up and down the walk we are never so much alone as in a crowd she said with the air that some girls assume of saying an original thing which no woman ever did say yet unless by accident they joined the stream presently george led the girl out of the road and across the grass to a place where two or three chairs were set under the trees they sat down then occurred the miracle wrought in these gardens every day and all day long out of the ground sprang a manfor such he seemed though doubtless a spiritmessengerwho demanded twopence this paid he vanished straightway after this ceremony they talked george said the girl every day now wherever i am even at church i feel as if i should like to jump up and sing and dance this morning i should have liked a service all to ourselvesyou to read and i to sing you to pray and i to praise i kept wondering if there was any girl in the place so happy as myselfor so unhappy as i was three short weeks ago elsie said georgea simple thing to say but it had a thousand meanings we have not deserved it indeed indeedwe have not why are we singled out for such joy we already had the greatest thing of allwe had love that is happiness enough for some women we only wanted a little more money and now we have all this great fortune it is wonderful elsie she laid her hand on his and spoke in her sweet low voice gazing upwards george i am so happy that i want everybody else to be happy as well the angels i am sure must lose some of their joy in wishing that all were with them i pity all those poor girls who have no lovers all those poor married people who are lying in poverty all those poor creatures who are trying for what they cannot get all those who are weeping outside the gates of heaven george it is a beautiful world and it should be such a happy world there should be nothing but joy all through life there is such an abundance of happiness possible in it sadness is only a passing cloud anxiety is only a touch of east wind evil and pain are only fleeting shadows she sighed and clasped her hands and the tears rose to her eyes we shall grow old together george she went on murmuring rather than speakingi omit her lovers interruptions and interjectionsyou will always love me long after my beautyyou know you will call it beauty georgeis past and gone even when i am a poor old crone doubled up in my armchair you will always love me my life will be fullfullfull of love perhaps here her face flushed and she stopped we shall have no trouble about money we shall go on always learning more and more growing wiser and wiser and wiser you will be a wise and good man thinking and working all your life for other people just as mr dering imaginedthree weeks ago everybody will love and respect you then you will grow greyheaded you poor dear boy and all the world will say how wise and strong you are and i shall be prouder of my old husband than even i was of my young lover the life that others have dreamed we shall live every day shall come laden with its own joy so that we would not if we could help it suffer it to go away she struck a deeper note and her voice trembled and sank and her eyes filled with tears life shall be all happiness as god intended for us even death will be little sorrow for the separation will be so short once more she laid her hand on his even to the most frivolous the prospect of the wedded life awakens grave and solemn thoughts for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear and brains to understand there is no prospect so charged with chances and possibilities where even life itself may become a death in life when george left her in the evening he drove to see athelstan so he said you have been courting all day i suppose you ought to have had enough of it sit down and have somethinga pipea cigarwellyou are going to be very jolly i suppose elsies little fortune will help a bit wont it i should think so indeed yesive been very glad ever since you told me that the child had had this stroke of luck i wonder who gave her the money to be sure there is plenty of money knocking about among the arundels most of us have had a sort of instinct for making money put us down anywhere among a lot of men in a city and we begin to transfer the contents of their pockets to our own meanwhile give up this old resentment come back to your own people come to our wedding i cannot possibly unless you will tell me who forged that cheque how could i go back to people who still believe me guilty when you are married i will go and see elsie which i can do with a light heart you have not told any one about my return certainly not no one suspects and no one talks or thinks about you athelstan laughed a little that is a doubtful piece of information am i to rejoice or to weep because i am completely forgotten and out of mind it is rather humiliating isnt it you are not forgotten at all that is a different thing only they do not speak of you well george never mind that now i am glad you came tonight because i have some news for you i have found the commissionaire who took the cheque to the bankactually found the man no after all these years i wrote out the particulars of the casebriefly yesterday i took the paper to the commissionaires barrack in the strand and offered a reward for the recovery of the man who had cashed the cheque that same evening the man presented himself and claimed the reward he remembered the thing very wellfor this reason the gentleman who employed him first sent him with a bag to a parcel delivery office he did not look at the address the gentleman was staying at the cecil hotel now the commissionaire was a onearmed man because he had only one arm the gentlemanwho was a pleasantspoken gentlemangave him ten shillings for his trouble which was nine shillings more than his proper pay the gentleman sent him to the bank with this cheque to cash and he returned with seven hundred and twenty pounds in tenpound notes then it was that the gentlemanwho seems to have been a freehanded gentlemangave him the ten shillings the man says that he would know that gentleman anywhere he was old and had grey hair he says that he should know him wherever he saw him what do you think of that wellit is something if you could find that old man why of course it was checkleygreyhaired checkley well catch that old fox yet beware of checkley hes a fox hes a worm hes a creeping centipede when the old man goes you must make checkley pack chapter x a mysterious discovery on monday morning the unexpected happened it came with more than common malignity in fact nothing more threatening to the persons chiefly concerned in the calamity could have happened though at first they were happily spared the comprehension of its full significance there is a widespread superstitionso wide that it must be truethat at those rare moments when one feels foolishly happy at peace with all the world at peace with ones own conscience all injuries forgiven the future stretched out before like a sunlit peaceful lake some disaster great or small is certainly imminent dont feel too happy says experience universal the gods resent the happiness of man affect a little anxiety assume a certain sadness restrain that dancing leg if you must shake it do so as if by accident or as if in terrorfor choice shake it over an open grave in the churchyard stop singing that song of joy try the lamentation of a sinner instead so will the gods be deceived above all never allow yourself to believe that the devil is dead he is not even asleep by carefully observing these precautions a great many misfortunes may be averted if for instance george had gone home soberly on sunday night instead of carrying on like a schoolboy in playtime obviously happy and so inviting calamity perhaps he would never have been connectedas he afterwards becamewith this disaster you have heard that mr dering was a man of method every morning he arrived at his office at a quarter before ten he hung up his coat and hat in a recess behind the door he then opened his safe with his own hand checkley had already laid out the table with a clean blottingpad pens and letterpaper he had also placed the letters of the day upon the pad the reading of the letters began the days work the lawyer read them made notes upon them rang for his shorthand clerk and dictated answers these dispatched he turned to the standing business this morning with the usual routine he was plodding through the letters of the day taking up one after the other and reading half mechanically presently he opened one and looked at the heading ellis northcote he said what do they want then he suddenly stopped short and started then he began the letter again and again he stopped short it was from his brokers in the city and it recommended a certain advantageous investment that was not in itself very extraordinary but it contained the following remarkable passage you have made such great transfers and so many sales during the last few months that you have probably more profitable uses for money in your own business but if you should have a few thousands available at the present moment it is a most favourable opportunity great transfers and many sales asked mr dering bewildered what transfers what sales does he mean he turned over the pages of his diary he could find no transactions of the kind at all then he reflected again i can remember no transfers he murmured is this another trick of memory finally he touched the bell upon his table checkley said mr dering on the appearance of the ancient clerk i have got a letter that i dont understand at all i told you that my memory was going now you see here is a letter about transfers and sales of stock what transfers i dont understand one word of it my memory is not only goingit is gone memory going nonsense the old man shook his head nono your memory is all right mine is as clear as a bell sos yours you eat hearty so do i you sleep well so do i were both as hale and hearty as ever nono my memory is not what it was ive told you so a dozen times i lose myself sometimes yesterday when the clock struck twelve i thought it was only ten i had lost two hours and sometimes when i walk home i lose recollection of the walk afterwards tut tut nobody of your age is such a young man as you why you walk like fiveandtwenty and you eat heartyyou eat very hearty his words were encouraging but he looked anxiously at his master truly there was no apparent decay in mr dering he sat as upright he looked as keen he spoke as clearly as ever wellabout this letter my friend ellis of ellis northcote writes to me about something or other and speaks of my effecting great transfers and sales of stock lately what does he mean you havent bought or sold any stock lately that i know of well you would have knownhave we had to make any investments for clients of late there was the daltonsmith estate that was eleven months ago i suppose he must mean thathe cant mean anything else yes that is it wellive got a partner now so that it matters less than it would have donehad my memory played me tricks with no other responsible man in the place you didnt want a partner said checkley jealously you had me he must mean that mr dering repeated he cant mean anything else howeverhas my bank book been made up lately here it is made up last friday nothing been in or out since mr dering had not looked at his book for three or four months he was well served his people took care of his bank book now he opened it and began to run his finger up and down the pages checkley he said what has happened to newcastle corporation stock the dividends were due some weeks ago they are not paid yet is the town gone bankrupt andeh where is wolverhampton andand he turned over the paper quickly checkley there is something wrong with the book not a single dividend of anything entered for the last four months there ought to have been about six hundred pounds in that time queer mistake said checkley ill take the book round to the bank and have it corrected a very gross and careless mistake i call it tell the manager i said so let it be set right at once checkleyat onceand while you wait and bring it back to me the bank was in chancery lane close to the office the old clerk went off on his errand a very careless mistake the lawyer repeated any clerk of mine who committed such a mistake should be dismissed at once in fact the certainty of full and speedy justice kept mr derings clerks always at a high level of efficiency he returned to the letters apparently with no further uneasiness after ten minutes checkley taking longer than he expected mr dering became aware that his attention was wandering great transfers and many sales he repeated after all he must mean the investment of that daltonsmith money yet that was only a single transaction what can he mean he must have made a mistake he must be thinking of another client its his memory not mine that is confused thats ithis memory the large open safe in the corner was filled with stacks of paper tied up and endorsed these papers contained among other things the securities for the whole of mr derings private fortune which was now very considerable even the greatest city magnate would feel for mr dering the respect due to wealth if he knew the amount represented by the contents of that safe there they were the leases agreements mortgages deeds bonds conveyances shares all the legal documents by which the wicked man is prevented from seizing and appropriating the rich mans savings formerly the rich man kept his money in a box with iron bands he locked up the box and put it in a recess in the cellar contrived in the stone wall if he was only a bourgeois it was but a little box and he put it in a secret place but everybody knew the secret at the head of his bed if he were a peasant he tied his money up in a clout and put it under the hearthstone in any case thieves broke in and stole those riches now grown wiser he has no box of treasures at all he lends it all in various directions and to various associations and companies every rich man is a moneylender he is either shylock the great or shylock the less according to the amount he lends thieves can steal nothing but paper which is no use to them as we grow wiser still we shall have nothing at all in any house that can be of any use to any thief because everything in the least valuable will have its papers without the production of which nothing of value will be bought or sold and all the gold and silver whether forks or mugs will be lodged in the bank then everybody will become honest and the eighth commandment will be forgotten among mr derings papers were share certificates bonds and scrip of various kinds amounting in all to a great many thousands of this money a sum of nearly thirteen thousand pounds belonged to elsie but was still in her guardians name this of course was the fortune which had fallen so unexpectedly into the girls hands the rest amounting to about twentyfive thousand pounds was his own money it represented of course only a part only a small part of his very respectable fortune mr dering whose memory if it was decaying was certainly clear on some points looked across the room at the open safe and began to think of the papers representing their investments he remembered perfectly all the different corporation stock all the water gas railway shares the indian stock and the colonial stock the debenture companies and the trading companies he was foolish he thought to be disturbed by a mere mistake of the broker his recent lapses of memory had made him nervous there could be nothing wrong but that clerk at the bank ought to be dismissed for carelessness there could be nothing wrong for the sake of assurance he would turn out the papers but there could be nothing wrong he knew very well where they were everything in his office had its place they were all tied up together in a bulky parcel bestowed upon a certain shelf or compartment of the safe he pushed back his chair got up and walked over to the safe strange the papers were not in their place again he felt the former irritation at having forgotten something it was always returning every day he seemed to be forgetting something but the certificates must be in the safe he stood irresolutely looking at the piles of papers trying to think how they could have been displaced while he was thus wondering and gazing checkley came back bankbook in hand there is something wrong he said no dividends at all have been paid to your account for the last three months there is no mistake at the bank ive seen the manager and hes looked into it and says there cant be any mistake about the entries no dividends what is the meaning of it checkley no dividends why theres thirtyeight thousand pounds worth of stock the certificates are kept here in the safe only for some reason or other i cant find them at the moment they must be in the safe somewhere just help me to find them will you he began to search among the papers at first a little anxiously then nervously then feverishly where are they he cried tossing over the bundles they must be here they must be here let us turn out the whole contents of the safe we must find them they have never been kept in any other place nobody has touched them or seen them except myself the old clerk pulled out all the papers in the safe and laid them in a great pile on the table when there was nothing left in the safe they began systematically to go through the whole when they had finished they looked at each other blankly everything was there except the certificates and scrip representing the investment of thirtyeight thousand pounds these alone could not be found they examined every packet they opened every bundle of papers they looked into every folded sheet of parchment or foolscap the certificates were not in the safe well said the clerk at last theyre not here you seenow then in the midst of their perplexity happened a thing almost as surprising and quite as unexpected as the loss of the certificates among the papers was a small round parcel tied up with red tape checkley opened it banknotes he said and laid it aside they were not at the moment looking for banknotes but for certificates when he was satisfied that these were not in the safe and had thrown so to speak the responsibility of finding out the cause of their absence upon his master he took up once more this bundle it was as he had said a bundle of banknotes rolled up and tied round he untied the knot and laid them flat turning up the corners and counting curious he said theyre all tenpound notesall tenpound notes there must be more than fifty of them and the outside one is covered with dust what are they how should i know said mr dering irritably give them to me banknotes there are no banknotes in my safe forgotten the clerk murmured clients money perhaps but the client would have asked for it five or six hundred pounds how can five hundred pounds be forgotten even a rothschild would remember five hundred pounds forgotten he glanced suspiciously at his master and shook his head fumbling among the papers mr dering snatched the bundle from his clerk truly they were banknotestenpound banknotes and they had been forgotten the clerk was right there is no firm in the world where a bundle worth five hundred pounds could be forgotten and no inquiry made after it mr dering stared blankly at them notes he criednotes tenpound notes what notescheckley how did these notes come here if you dont know the clerk replied nobody knows youve got the key of the safe good heavens if mr dering had been twenty years younger he would have jumped men of seventyfive are not allowed to jump the dignity of age does not allow of jumping this is most wonderful checkley this is most mysterious what is it these notesthe devil is in the safe today i do believe first the certificates are lost that is they cant be foundand next these notes turn up what notes are they then they are nothing else than the banknotes paid across the counter for that forged cheque of eight years ago oh there is no doubt of itnone whatever i remember the numbersthe consecutive numbersseventytwo of themseven hundred and twenty pounds how did they get here who put them in checkley i say how did these notes get here he held the notes in his hand and asked these questions in pure bewilderment and not in the expectation of receiving any reply the notes paid to that young gentleman when he forged the cheque said checkley must have been put back in the safe by him theres no other way to account for it he was afraid to present them he heard you say they were stopped and he put them back i think i see him doing it while he was flaring out he done itim sure i see him doing it mr dering received this suggestion without remark he laid down the notes and stared at his clerk the two old men stared blankly at each other perhaps checkleys countenance of the two expressed the greater astonishment how did those notes get into the safe the lawyer repeated this is even a more wonderful thing than the mislaying of the certificates you took them out show me exactly where they were lying they were behind these books see the outside note is covered with dust they must have been lying there all these years in my safe the very notes paid across the counter to the forgers messenger in my safe what does this mean i feel as if i was going mad i say what does all this mean checkley the clerk made answer slowly repeating his former suggestion since young arundel forged the cheque young arundel got the notes since young arundel got the notes young arundel must have put them back no one else could when young arundel put them back he done it because he was afraid of your finding out he put them back unseen by you that day when you charged him with the crime i did not charge him i have charged no one i charged him then and you did not contradict id charge him again if he was here any man may charge anything upon any other man there was no proof whatever and none has ever come to light youre always for proofs that will convict a man i only said that nobody else could do the thing as for putting the notes back again in the safe now i come to think of ithis face became cunning and malignanti do rememberyesoh yesi clearly rememberi quite clearly rememberi see it as plain as if it was before me he got sidling nearer and nearer the safe while we were talking he got quite closesohe chucked a bundle in when he thought i wasnt looking i thinki almost thinki could swear to it nonsense said the lawyer your memory is too clear tie up the notes checkley and put them back they may help perhaps some time to find out the man meantime let us go back to our search let us find these certificates they had now examined every packet in the safe they had looked at every paper they had opened every book and searched through all the leaves there was no doubt left the certificates were not there checkley began to tie up the bundles again his master sat down trying to remember somethingeverythingthat could account for their disappearance chapter xi a mysterious discovery the safe disposed of there remained a cupboard two tables full of drawers twenty or thirty tin boxes checkley examined every one of these receptacles in vain there was not anywhere any trace of the certificates yet said mr dering they must be somewhere we have been hunting all the morning and we have not found them they are not in this room yet they must be somewhere certificates and such things dont fly away they are of no use to any one people dont steal certificates i must have done something with them did you take them home with you why should i do that i have no safe or strongroom at home did you send them to the bank for greater safety to be sure they would be no more safe there than here go and ask see the manager ask him if he holds any certificates of mine the clerk turned to obey no mr dering stopped him whats the good if he held the things there would have been dividends yet what can i do for the first time in his life the lawyer felt the emotion that he had often observed in clients at times of real disaster he felt as if there was nothing certain not even property as if the law itself actually the lawwas of no use his brain reeled the ground was slipping under his feet and he was falling forward through the table and the floor and the foundationforward and downdowndown what can i do he repeated checkley go see the manager there may be something to find out i cant think properly go when the clerk left him he laid his head upon his hands and tried to put things quite clearly before himself where can the certificates be he asked himself repeating this question twenty times he was quite conscious that if he had been consulted on such a point by a client he would have replied with the greatest readiness suggesting the one really practical thing to do for himself he could advise nothing where can the certificates be nobody steals corporation stock and gas companies shares they are no good if you do steal them they cant be sold without the authority of the owner he has got to sign transfer papers if they were stolen the dividends would go on being paid to the owner just the same besides somewhere about this point he bethought him of the bankbook if the stock had been sold the money would appear to his credit he snatched the book and looked at it no there was no entry which could possibly represent the sale of stock he knew what every entry meant and when the amount was paid in his memory was perfectly clear upon this point checkleys suggestion occurred to him had he taken the certificates home with him he might have done for some reason which he had now forgotten yes that was the one possible explanation he must have done for a moment he breathed againonly for a moment because he immediately reflected that he could not possibly do such a thing as take those securities to a house where he never transacted any business at all then he returned to his former bewilderment and terror what had become of them why had he taken them out of the safe where had he bestowed them and why were there no dividends paid to him on these stocks why he turned white with terror when he realised that if he got no more dividends he could have no more stocks during a long professional career of fifty years mr dering had never made a mistakeat least he thought so if he had not always invested his money to the greatest profit he had invested it safely he did not get the interest that some city men expect but he made no losses he looked upon himself therefore as a man of great sagacity whereas in such matters he was only a man of great prudence also during this long period he was always in the enjoyment of a considerable income therefore he had never known the least anxiety about money yet all his life he had been counselling other people in their anxieties it was exactly as if a specialist in some mortal disease should be himself attacked by it or it was as if the bosun whose duty it is to superintend the flogging should be himself tied up nothing came to him no glimmer of light not the least recollection of anything then he thought desperately that perhaps if he were to imagine how it would be if somebody else not himself at all were to come to himself and lay the story before him as a solicitor for advice or how it would be if he himself were to go to himself as a solicitor and put the case when checkley came back he found his master leaning back in his chair his eyes wide open and staring at him as he opened the dooryet they saw nothing checkley stood under the gaze of those eyes which saw him not good lord he murmured is the time come is he going to die his face was white he seemed to be listening anxiously his lips were parted hes in a fit of some kind thought the old clerk he stood watching he ought perhaps to have called for assistance he did not think of it he stood and watched his face as pale as his masters was it the end if sowe all think of ourselves firstwhat about his berth and salary suddenly his masters eyes closed he dropped his head he heaved a deep sigh he moved his head and opened his eyes he was restored to himself the fit whatever it was had passed checkley he said ive been trying to put the thing to myself as if some other mana clientwas putting his case to me i began very well the other man camethat is i myself called upon myself i sat and heard my own story i forgot somehow what the story washe shook his head impatiently forgetforgeti always forget but i remember that it wasnt the story i wanted him to tell it was another story altogether he didnt tell me what i wanted to know that iswhat has become of the certificates im no nearer than i was he made out that i was actually selling the certificates myself youre wandering a bit said checkley anxiously watching him thats all youll be all right presently youve bin shook up a bit with the certificates and the notes and all if i were you id have a glass of something stiff nono i shall come round presently yesthats it im a good deal upset by this business somehow i dont seem able to think clearly about it let me seehe sighed heavilyi think you went somewheresomewhere for me beforebefore the other man came for lords sake dont talk about the other man theres no such person yesi did go for you i went to ask the manager of the bank whether he held any stock for you the manager of the bank true well and does he hold anything not a scrap never had any then checkleymr dering dropped his hands helplesslywhat is to be done i dont know im sure the clerk replied with equal helplessness i never heard of such a thing before in all my life thirtyeight thousand pounds it cant be nobody ever heard of such a thing before perhaps they are about the place somewhere lets have another search nono it is useless whyi have had no dividends the shares were all transferred and nothing has been paid for them the shares have been stolen checkley i cant think for the first time in my life i cant thinki want some one to advise me i must put the case in somebodys hands theres your young partnera chance for him to show that hes worth his pay why dont you consult him and then come back to the old plan of you and me were knocked a bit silly just at first but the case will come to us in the long run you would have a partnernothing would do but a partner the boys in his own room now i suppose with a crown upon his head and the clerks kneelin aroundas grand as you please send for him mr dering nodded the partner when he arrived a few minutes later found the chief walking about the room in uncontrollable agitation on the table lay piled the whole contents of the safe in front of it stood the ancient clerk trembling and shakinghead hands knees and shouldersfollowing the movements of his master with eyes full of anxiety and terror this strange fit this forgetfulness this rambling talk about another man this new restlessness frightened him you are come at last mr dering stopped and threw himself into his chair now my partner hear the case and resolve the difficulty for us if you cantell him checkleyorstay no i will tell it myself either i have lost my reason and my memory or i have been robbed george stood at the table and listened something of the utmost gravity had happened never before had he seen his chief in the least degree shaken out of his accustomed frigidity of calm now he was excited his eyes were restless he talked fast he talked badly he made half a dozen attempts to begin he marshalled his facts in a slovenly and disorderly manner quite unlike his usual clear arrangement for fifty years he had been marshalling facts and drawing up cases and at his own he broke down i think i understand the whole said george when his chief paused and checkley ceased to correct and to add you had certificates representing investments to the amount of l these are gone unaccountably gone no dividends have been paid for some months and your broker speaks of large transfers thats not all said checkley tell him about the notes yes the fact may have some bearing upon the case while we were looking for the certificates and in order i suppose to complicate things and to bewilder me the more we found in the safe the very notesgive me the bundle checkleythere they arethat were paid over the bank counter to the man who forged my name eight years ago what the case in which athelstan arundel was accused the same there they areyou hold them in your handthe very notes strange on the very day when i am threatened with another and a worse robbery yesyes the very notesthe very notes this is wonderful who put them there how can i know wellbut in any case one thing is certain athelstans name is cleared at last you will tell his mother that not at all said checkley why shouldnt he put em in himself i saw him edging up towards the safe saw him edgingstuff and nonsense his name is cleared this will be joyful news to his mother and sisters austin get me back my certificates said mr dering never mind those notes now never mind the joyful news never mind athelstans name that can wait the thought of him and the old forgery only bewilders my brain at this juncture i cannot act i cannot think i feel as if i was blinded and stupefied act for methink for mework for me be my solicitor george as well as my partner i will do my best it is difficult at first to understandfor what has happened you cannot findyou have mislaidcertain papers certain dividends which were due do not appear to have been paid and your brokers ellis northcote have used a phrase in a letter which you do not understand would it not be well to get them here or shall i go into the city and ask them exactly what they meant and what has been done if i could remember any transactions with them during the last six months but i cannot except a small purchase of corporation stock last montha few hundreds and here are the papers belonging to that which of the partners do you deal with the old man ellishes always acted for me he has been my friend for close on fifty years well i will send for him and tell him to come as soon as possible and to bring along with him all the letters and papers he has good good said mr dering more cheerfully that is practical i ought to have thought of that at the very outset now we shall get along the first thing is to arrive at the factsthen we can act if it was another mans case i should have known what to do but when it is your ownand to lose the certificates and when a sum of nearly forty thousand pounds is at stakeit looks like losing the money itselfand the feeling of uncertainty all taken together becomes rather overwhelming of course i should like to see the letterbook and we must run through the letters to see if they throw any light upon the business perhaps the papers themselves may be found among them the presence of this young man cheerful decided taking practical measures at once cheered up the lawyer and steadied his shattered nerves but checkley the clerk looked on gloomily he replaced the papers in the safe and stood beside it as if to guard it he followed the movements of the new partner with watchful suspicious eyes and he muttered sullenly between his teeth first george sent a telegram to the city for the broker then while the old clerk still stood beside the safe and mr dering continued to show signs of agitation uncontrollable sometimes walking about the room and sometimes sitting at his table sometimes looking into the empty shelves of the safe he began to look through the copied letters those that is which had gone out of mr derings office he searched for six months working backwards nothing for six months he saidcheckley give me the letters he went through these they were the letters received at the office all filed endorsed and dated there was not one during the letters of six months which he examined which had anything to do with the sales of stocks and shares if he said you had written to ellis northcote a copy of your letter would be here in this book if they had written to you these letters would be among these bundles very well since no such letters are here it is clear that no such letters were written therefore no sales then said mr dering where are my certificates where are my dividends that we shall see at present we are only getting at the facts then mr ellis senior partner of ellis northcote arrived bearing a small packet of papers everybody knew mr ellis of ellis northcote one of the most respectable stockbrokers in londoncitizen and lorimer he belonged eminently to the class called worthy an old gentleman carefully dressed of smooth and polished appearance pleasing manners and great integrity nobody could look more truly integer vitae than mr ellis nor did his private practice belie his reputation and his appearance his chin and lips looked as if they could not possibly endure the burden of beard or moustache his sentiments one observed at a glance would certainly be such as one expects from a citizen of his respectability here i am dear sir he said cheerfullyhere i am in immediate obedience to your summons i hope that there is nothing wrong though your request that i would bring with me certain papers certainly made me a little apprehensive there is i fear a good deal wrong said mr dering sit down my old friendgive mr ellis a chair checkleyaustin you will tell him what he wants to know you wrote to mr dering yesterday recommending a certain investment i certainly did a very favourable opportunity it is and a capital thing it will prove you mentioned in your letter certain transfers and sales which according to your letter he had recently effected certainly what sales were they mr ellis looked at his papers february lastsale of various stock all duly enumerated here to the value of l march last sale of various stock also all duly enumerated to the value of l odd april last sale of stock to the value of lmore or lessrealising you note the dates and amounts austin said mr dering certainly we will however get the dates and the amounts more exactly in a momentnow mr ellis of course you received instructions with the papers themselves were they in writing or by word of mouth in writing by letters written by mr dering himself have you got these letters with you everything is here and in proper order he laid his hand upon the papers here for instance is the first letter dated february relating to these transactionsyou will no doubt remember it mr dering he took up a letter and read it aloud my dear ellisi enclose a bundle of certificates and shares they amount to somewhere about l at current price will you have these transferred to the name of edmund gray gentleman of south square grays inn mr edmund gray is a client and i will have the amount paid to my account by him send me therefore the transfer papers and the account showing the amount due to me by him together with your commissionvery sincerely yours edward dering that is the letter the proceeding is not usual yet not irregular if for instance we had been instructed to buy stock for mr dering but of course you know pardon me said george i am not so much accustomed to buy stock as my partner will you go on we should have done so and sent our client the bill for the amount with our commission if we had been instructed to sell we should have paid in to mr derings bank the amount realised less our commission a transfer is another kind of work mr dering transferred this stock to edmund gray his client it was therefore for him to settle with his client the charges for the transfer and the value of the stock we therefore sent a bill for these charges it was sent by hand and a cheque was received by return of the messenger george received the letter from him examined it and laid it before his partner mr dering read the letter held it to the checkley if anybody knows my handwriting he said it ought to be you whose writing is that it looks like yours but there is a trembling in the letters it is not so firm as the most of your work i should call it yours but i see by your face that it is not no it is not my writing i did not write that letter this is the first i have heard of the contents of that letterlook at the signature checkley two clots are wanting after the word dering and the flourish after the last n is curtailed of half its usual dimensions did you ever know me to alter my signature by a single curve never checkley replied two clots wanting and half a flourishgo on sir ive just thought of something but go on you dont mean to say that this letter is a forgery asked mr ellis whythen oh it is impossible it must then be the beginning of a whole series of forgeries its quite impossible to credit it the letter came from this office the postmark shows it was posted in this district the answer was sent here the transfersconsiderthe transfers were posted to this office they came back duly signed and witnessedfrom this office i forwarded the certificate made out in the name of edmund grayto this office and i got an acknowledgmentfrom this office i sent the account of the transaction with my commission chargesto this office and got a cheque for the latterfrom this office how can such a complicated business as thisonly the first of these transactionsbe a forgery why you want a dozen confederates at least for such a job as this i do not quite understand yet said george inexperienced in the transfer of stocks and shares well i cannot sell stock without the owners authority he must sign a transfer but if i receive a commission from a lawyer to transfer his stock to a client it is not my business to ask whether he receives the money or not yesyes and is there nothing to show for the sale of this l worth of paper george asked mr dering nothing at all the letters and everything are a forgery and you mr ellis received a cheque for your commission certainly get me the old cheques and the chequebook said mr dering the cheque was drawn as the letter was written in mr derings handwriting but with the slight difference he had pointed out in the signature you are quite sure asked george that you did not sign that cheque i am perfectly certain that i did not then as for this edmund gray of south square grays innwhat do you know about him nothing at allabsolutely nothing i know something said checkley but go ongo on he may be a nonexistent person for what you know certainly i know nothing about any edmund gray wait a bit murmured checkley well butmr ellis went onthis was only a beginning in march you wrote to me again that is to say i received a letter purporting to be from you in this letterhere it isyou instructed me to transfer certain stockthe papers of which you enclosedamounting to about lto edmund gray aforesaid in the same way as before the transfer papers were sent to you for signature in the same way as before they were signed and returned and in the same way as before the commission was charged to you and paid by you it was exactly the same transaction as beforeonly for double the sum involved in the february business mr dering took the second letter and looked at it with a kind of patient resignation i know nothing about it he saidnothing at all there was a third and last transaction said the broker this time in april here is the letter written by you with instructions exactly the same as in the previous cases but dealing with the stock to the amount of l which we duly carried out and for which we received your chequefor commission every one of these lettersevery signature of mine to transfer papers and to chequeswas a forgery said mr dering slowly i have no client named edmund gray i know no one of the name i never received any money from the transfers these investments are stolen let me look at the letters again said george he examined them carefully comparing them with each other they are so wonderfully forged that they would deceive the most careful i should not hesitate myself to swear to the handwriting it has already been explained that mr derings handwriting was of a kind which is not uncommon with those who write a good deal the unimportant words were conveyed by a curve with or without a tail while the really important words were clearly written the signature however was large distinct and floridthe signature of the house which had been flourishing for a hundred years and more a signature which had never varied look at it said george again who would not swear to this writing i would for one said mr ellis and i have known it for forty years and moreif that is not your own writing dering it is the very finest imitation ever made i dont think my memory can be quite gonecheckley have we ever had a client named edmund gray nonever but youve forgotten one thing that forgery eight years agothe cheque of lwas payable to the order of edmund gray ah so it was this seems important most important said george the forger could not possibly by accident choose the same name this cannot be coincidence have you the forged cheque i have always kept it mr dering replied on the chance of using it to prove the crime and convict the criminal you will find it checkley in the righthand drawer of the safe thank you here it is pay to the order of edmund gray and here is his endorsement so we have his handwriting at any rate george took it strange he said i should without any hesitation swear to your handwriting here as well and lookthe signature to the cheque is exactly the same as that of these letters the two dots missing after the name and the flourish after the last n curtailed it was so the handwriting of the cheque and of the letters was the same the signatures were slightly but systematically altered in exactly the same way in both letters and cheque this again said george can hardly be coincidence it seems to me that the man who wrote that cheque also wrote those letters the endorsement was in a hand which might also be taken for mr derings own nothing to be got out of the endorsement but about the transfer papers said george they would have to be witnessed as well as signed they were witnessed said the broker by a clerk named lorry yes we have such a man in our officecheckley send for lorry lorry was a clerk employed in mr derings outer office being interrogated he said that he had no recollection of witnessing a signature for a transfer paper he had witnessed many signatures but was not informed what the papers were asked if he remembered especially witnessing any signature in february march or april he replied that he could not remember any but that he had witnessed a great many signatures that sometimes mr dering wanted him to witness his own signature sometimes those of clients if he were shown his signature he might remember lorry therefore was allowed to depart to his own place there can be no longer any doubt said george that an attempt has been made at a robbery on a very large scale an attempt only mr dering asked where are my certificates i say attempt because you cant really steal stock dividends are only paid to those who lawfully possess it this edmund gray we can find if he exists i take it however that he does not it is probably a name assumed by the forger and i suppose that he has made haste to sell his stock whether or no you will certainly recover your property people may as well steal a field as steal stocks and shares we can easily find out for you said mr ellis what has become of your paper if the thieves have kept it george went on all they could make would be the dividends for five months that however is only because the bankbook was not examined for so long they could not reckon upon such an unusual stroke of luck it seems almost certain that they must get rid of the stock as quickly as they could suppose that they have realised the whole amount it is an immense sum of money it would have to be paid by cheque into a bank the holder could only draw out the money gradually he might to be sure go to america and have the whole amount transferred but that would not help him much unless he could draw it out in small sums payable to confederates in fact the robbery seems to me hedged about with difficulties almost impossible it is the most extraordinary attempt at robbery that ever was said mr ellis thirtyeight thousand pounds in shares well i will find out for you if they have been sold and to whom meantime my old friend dont you be downhearted about it as mr austin says you will certainly get your property back again what we live in a civilised country we cannot have large sums like l stolen bodily property isnt kept any longer in bags of gold bank notes banks investments all tend to make great robberies impossible courage you will get back your property mr dering shook his head doubtfully there is another chance george suggested one has heard of robberies effected with the view of blackmail afterwards suppose we were to get a letter offering the whole to be returned for a certain sum nono it is now four months since the thing was done they have sold out the stock and disappearedgone to america as you suggested why the things may have been sold a dozen times over in the interval that is the danger suppose they have been sold a dozen times over consider here is a share in the great western i transfer it from a to b very good the share now belongs to b and stands in his name whether honestly come by or not b sends it to another broker who sells it to c he again to d every transaction is right and in form except the first you can trace the share from owner to owner b has vanished a says to c you bought that share of a thief c says very sorry how was i to know d has got it now d says that it is his and he will stick to it we go to law about the share what is going to happen upon my word i dont know wellbut this is only conjecture let me first find out what has become of the shares of course there is a record to which i have only to refer i will let you know by tomorrow morning if i can when mr ellis was gone george began to sum up for the clearing of his own mind the ascertained facts of the case so far as they had got first he said the letters to ellis and northcote were written on our headed paper clearly therefore the writer must have had access to the office next he knew and could copy your handwriting third he was able to intercept the delivery of letters and to prevent your getting any he wished to stop because the correspondence was conducted openly through the post that seems to be a very important point fourth the letters were all apparently in your handwriting very skilfully imitated instead of being dictated and then signed fifth he must at least have known of the last forgery or how did he arrive at the name of edmund gray and was it out of devilry and mockery because that forgery escaped detection that he used the name again sixth he must have had access to the safe where the chequebook as well as the certificates was kept seventh he must have known the office pretty well or how did he find out the names of your brokers eighth the handwriting appeared to be exactly the same as that of the former forgery it is the same as last time said checkley that forgery was done in the office if ever a thing was done here same with thissame with this welltime will show same with this he glared from under his great eyebrows at the young partner as if he suspected that the young gentleman could throw some light upon that mystery if he wished we have given time long enough to discover the author of the last business said mr dering but he has not chosen to do so as yet the loss of property he groanedthe loss of close on forty thousand pounds i dont believe it is lost said george it cant be lost it is a bit of a railwaypart of a reservoira corner of the gasworksyou cant lose these thingsunless indeed the difficulty suggested by mr ellis occurs here mr dering pushed back his chair and began again to walk about the room in restless agitation he was no longer the grave and serious lawyer he became one of his own clients lamenting as they had so often lamented in that room the greatness of his misfortune he uttered the actual commonplaces of men in distressthere is a dreadful sameness about the lamentations of ill luck we all know themthe hardness of the thing the injustice of it the impossibility of warding it off his own sagacity in taking every precaution the dreadfulness of being singled out of a whole generation for exceptional misfortune mr dering himself the grave calm reserved old lawyer who seemed made of granite broke down under the blow and became an ordinary human creature in the lower walks they weep checkley would have wept mr dering became eloquent wrathful sarcastic no retired general who has ruined himself by gambling in stocks could so bemoan his luck george listened saying nothing it was an experience no man so strong but has his weak point no man is completely armoured against the arrows of fate presently he grew a little more calm and sat down forgive me george he said gentlyforgive this outbreak there is more in the business than you know of i feel as if i know something about it but cant bring it out i am growing so forgetfuli forget whole daysi am filled with the feeling that i ought to know about it as for the loss what i have said is true you do not yet feel as i do about property you are too young you have not got any property yet wait a few yearsthen you will be able to agree with me that there is nothing in the world so hard as to lose your propertythe property that you have madeby your own exertionsfor yourself now you talk like yourself said checkley thats sense nothing so dreadful as to lose property its enough to kill people it has killed many people property means everything you understand that the more the older you get you do echoed checkley theres nothing in the world worth considering except property it meansrememberall the virtuesprudencecouragequick sightselfrestrainttenacityall the fighting qualities we do well to honour rich men i hoped to receive honour myself as a rich man when you have put together a few thousandsby the exercise of these finer qualities so that the thought of this gives you dignity ah cried checkley straightening himself to feel that they are gonegonegoneit is cruelgeorge you dont understand it you are young as yet you have no moneycheckley you have saved me oh a trifle a trifle but he covered his mouth with his hand to conceal the smile of satisfaction you are reputed rich nonono not rich my chances have been few i have not let them go but rich nono how would you regard the lossthe robbery of your propertycheckley the old clerk shook his head he had no words adequate to the question apart from the loss mr dering went on there is the sense of insecurity i felt it once before when the other forgery took place there seems no safety anywhere papers that i keep in my private safe to which no one has a key but myself which i never leave open if i leave the room even to go into another room are taken chequebooks which i keep there are taken out and cheques stolen finally things are put inthe bundle of notesfor instance i say that i feel a sense of helplessness as if everything might be taken from me and i should be powerless to resist let us first get back the certificates said george and we will find out and defeat this gang if it is a gang of confederates yesit is as you saythe ground itself seems sinking beneath ones feetwhen ones own investments are sold for nothing by a letter so like your own writing that it would deceive anybody done in the office checkley murmuredin the office same as last time wellwe shall find himwe shall find him he began to bundle the papers back into the safe murmuring same as last timedone in the officewe shall find himwe shall find him we found him before and well find him now chapter xii the first find yes said george thoughtfully a day or two ought to unravel this matter we must first however before going to the police find out as much as we can ourselves let me take up the case by myself for a bit nono checkley grumbled police first catch the man first put aside everything said the chief everything george forget everything until you have found out the mystery of the conspiracy it looks to me like a long firm george went ona long firm with a sham name and a respectable address of course there is no such person really as edmund gray it is not only the lossperhaps let us hopemr dering sighedonly a temporary loss if a real loss then a most terrible blownot only that but it is the sense of insecurity no one ever found out about that chequeand here are the notes in the safe all the time he put em in said checkley this is the second timeand the same name stilledmund gray it fills me with uneasinessi am terrified george i know not what may be the next blowwhat may be taken from memy mortgagesmy housesmy landeverything go i can do the work of the officeall the workby myself but this work i cannot do i am not able to think about it these thoughts overpower me and cloud my reason well said george i will do what i can i dont suppose there is any edmund gray at all but one must try to find out there can be no harm in paying a visit to grays inn if the thing had been done yesterday it would be necessary to strike at once with a warrant for the arrest of the said edmund gray as it is four months since the last robbery there can be small harm in the delay of a day or two i will go and inquire a little nothing easier than to inquire there was the mans address everybody knows grays inn everybody knows south square the place is only ten minutes walk from lincolns inn george took his hat walked over and proceeded straight to no expecting to find no such name on the doorposts on the contrary there it was nd floor mr edmund gray among the other occupants of the staircase he mounted the stairs on the second floor right was the name over the door mr edmund gray but the outer door was closed that is a sign that the tenant of the chambers is either not at home or not visible on the first floor were the offices of a firm of solicitors he sent in his card the name of dering and son commands the respectful attention of every solicitor in london one of the partners received him the firm of dering and son was anxious to see mr edmund gray who had the chambers overhead at what hours was mr edmund gray generally in his rooms nobody knew not either of the partners not any of the clerks he might have been met going up and down the stairs but nobody knew him by sight or anything about him this at first sight seemed suspicious afterwards george reflected that men may live for years on the same staircase and never know anything about each other men who live in grays inn do not visit each other there is little neighbourly spirit among men in chambers but rather an unspoken distrust but said the partner i can tell you who is his landlord he does not take the rooms of the inn direct but as we do from one who has several sets on a long lease and sublets the rooms they may know something about the man at the stewards office across the square if not the landlord will certainly know george asked if edmund gray was newly arrived no it appeared that he had been in the inn for a long time but then his informant added he may have been here a hundred years for all we know we never think of our neighbours in chambers opposite is a man whose name has been over the door as long as i can remember anything i dont know who he is or what is his business i dont even know him by sight so with mr edmund gray if i were to meet him on the stairs i should not be any the wiser you see i am only here in the daytime now the other man on the second floor i do know something about because he is a coach and was a fellow of my college and the man in the garrets i hear about occasionally because he is an old barrister who sometimes defends a prisoner at the stewards office george put the same question i am a solicitor he said here is my card i am most anxious to see mr edmund gray of no could you save me time by letting me know at what hour he is in his chambers they could tell him nothing mr gray was not a tenant of the inn very likely he was a residential tenant who came home in the evenings after business everything learned is a step gained whether edmund gray was a man or a long firm the name had been on the door for many years butmany yearscould a confederacy of swindlers go on for many years especially if they undertook such mighty schemes for plunder as this business next he went to the address of the landlord he was a house agent in bloomsbury and apparently a person of respectability if you could tell me george began with the same question at what hours i could find your tenant in his chambers or if you could give me his business address we should be very greatly obliged we want to find him at oncetoday if possible on very important business well i am sorry very sorrybutin fact i dont know anything about my tenants hours nor can i give you his place of business i believe he has no business oh but you took him as a tenant you must have had some references certainly and upon that i can satisfy you very shortly he opened a great book and turned over the pages here it isto no south square grays inn second floor north sideedmund gray gentleman rent l a year date of taking the rooms february at the halfquarter reference messrs dering and son solicitors new square lincolns inn whyyou mean that he referred to usto messrs dering and sonin the year that is so would you like to see the letter which we received on application wait a moment he rang the bell and a clerk appeared to whom he gave instructions i am bound to say the landlord went on that a more satisfactory tenant than mr gray does not exist he pays his rent regularly by postoffice order every quarter on the day before quarter day oh i wonder but he stopped because to begin wondering is always futile especially at so early a stage when there are already accumulated facts to go upon and not till then wondering becomes the putting together of the puzzle well here is the letter gentlementhe house agent read the letter received on application to the referencein reply to your letter of the th we beg to inform you that mr edmund gray is a client of ours a gentleman of independent means and that he is quite able to pay any reasonable rent for residence or chambersyour obedient servants dering and soni suppose he added that a man doesnt want a better reference than your own no certainly not george looked at the letter it presented as to handwriting exactly the same points of likeness and of difference as all the other letters in this strange case the body of the letter apparently written in the hand of mr dering that is so as to deceive everybody the signature with one or two small omissions certainly not he repeated with such a reference of course you did not hesitate did you ever see mr gray certainly i have seen him often first when he was getting his rooms furnished and afterwards on various occasions what kind of a man is he to look at elderly not exactly the kind of man youd expect to have chambers mostly theyre young ones who like the freedom an elderly gentleman pleasant in his manners smiling and affable grayhaired oh then there was a real edmund gray of ten years standing in the inn who lived or had chambers at the number stated in the forged letters i suppose said the house agent that my respectable tenant has not done anything bad nnonot to my knowledge his name occurs in rather a disagreeable case would you be so very kind as to let him know in case you should meet himbut of course we shall write to himthat we are most anxious to see him this the landlord readily promised there is another person he said who can tell you a great deal more than anybody else that is his laundress i dont know who looks after him but you can find out at the inn the policeman will know go and ask him in the game of battledore and shuttlecock the latter has no chance except to take the thing coolly without temper george was the shuttlecock he was hit back into grays innthis time into the arms of the policeman well sir said the guardian of the peace i do not know anything about the gentleman myself if he was one of the noisy ones i should know him but he isnt and therefore i have never heard of him but if he lives at no i can tell you who does his rooms and its old mrs cripps and she lives in leather lane this street which is now comparatively speaking purged and cleansed is not yet quite the ideal spot for one who would have pure air and cleanliness combined with godliness of conversation however individual liberty is nowhere more absolutely free and uncontrolled than in leather lane mrs cripps lived on the top floor nearest to heaven of which she ought to be thinking because she was now old and near her end she was so old that she was quite past her work and only kept on mr grays rooms because he never slept there and they gave her no trouble except to go to them in the morning with a duster and to drop asleep for an hour or so what her one gentleman gave her moreover was all she had to live upon though the morning was warm she was sitting over the fire watching a small pan in which she was stewing a savoury mess consisting of a block ornament with onions carrots and turnips perhaps she was thinkingthe poor old soulof the days gone bygone by for fifty yearswhen she was young and wore a feather in her hat old ladies of her class do not think much about vanished beauty but they think a good deal about vanished feathers and vanished hats they remember the old free carriage in the streets with the young friends and the careless laugh and the ready jest it is the ancient gentlewoman who remembers the vanished beauty and thinks of what she was fifty years ago mrs cripps heard a step on the narrow stair leading to her rooma manly step it mounted higher and more slowly because the stairs were dark as well as narrow then the visitors hat knocked against the door he opened it and stood there looking in a gentleman not a district visitor or a sister trying to persuade her to early churchnor yet the clergymana young gentleman you are mrs cripps he asked the policeman at grays inn directed me here you are laundress i believe to mr edmund gray of no suppose i am sir she replied suspiciously a laundress is like the hall porter of a club you must not ask her about any of her gentlemen i have called to see mr edmund gray on very important business i found his door shut will you kindly tell me at what hours he is generally in his chambers she shook her head but she held out her hand the young gentleman placed half a sovereign in her palm her fingers closed over the coin she clutched it and she hid it away in some secret fold of her ragged dress there is no woman so ragged so dropping to pieces with shreds and streamers and tatters but she can find a safe hidingplace somewhere in her rags for a coin or for anything else that is small or precious i never tell tales about my gentlemen she said especially when they are young and handsome like you a pore laundress has eyes and ears and hands but she hasnt got a tongue if she had there might be terrible terrible trouble oh dearyes but mr gray isnt a young gentleman hes old and it isnt the same thing then said george how and when can i find him i was coming to that you cant find him sometimes he comes and sometimes he doesnt come oh he doesnt live in the rooms then no he doesnt live in the rooms he uses the rooms sometimes what does he use them for how should i know all the gentlemen do things with pens and paper how should i know what they do they make their money with their pens and paper i dun know how they do it i suppose mr gray is making his money like the rest of them oh he goes to the chambers and writes sometimes its weeks and weeks and months and months before he comes at all but always my money regular and beforehand sent in an envelope and a postal order well what is his private address i suppose he lives in the country i dont know where he lives i know nothing about him i go there every morning and i do the room thats all i know there was no more information to be obtained sometimes he came to the inn sometimes he stayed away for weeks and weeks and for months and months i might ha told you more young gentleman murmured the old woman and i might ha told you less praps youll come again he went back to lincolns inn and set down his facts first there was a forgery in the year in which the name of edmund gray was used next in the series of forgeries just discovered not only was the name of edmund gray used throughout but the handwriting of the letters and cheques was exactly the same as that of the first cheque with the same peculiarities in the signature this could hardly be a coincidence the same man must have written the whole then who was edmund gray he was a real personagea living mannot a firmone known to the landlord of the chambers and to the laundress if to nobody else he did not live in the chambers but he used them for some business purposes he sometimes called there and wrote what did he write where was he and what was he doing when he was not at the chambers he might be oneleader or followerof some secret gang one has read of such gangs especially in french novels where the leaders are noble dukes of the first rank and princessesyoung lovely of the highest fashion why should there not be such a gang in london clever conspirators could go a very long way before they were even suspected in this civilisation of cheques and registered shares and official transfers property is so much defended that it is difficult to break through the armour but there must be weak places in that armour it must be possible for the wit of man to devise some plan by means of which property can be attacked successfully had he struck such a conspiracy thus a man calling himself edmund gray gets a lease of chambers by means of a forged letter in answer to a reference it is convenient for certain conspirators hereinafter called the company to have an address though it may never be used the conspiracy begins by forging a cheque to his order for l that was at the outset when the conspirators were young it was found dangerous and the notes were therefore replaced in the safe note that the company through one or other of its members has access to that safe this might perhaps be by means of a keyin the evening after office hours or by some one who was about the place all day very good the continued connection of some member of the firm with dering and son is proved by the subsequent proceedings after eight years the company having matured their machinery and perhaps worked out with success other enterprises return to their first quarry where they have the advantage of access to the letters and can look over their disposition they are thus enabled to conduct their successive coups each bigger than the one before and for four months the thing remains undiscovered having the certificates in their hands what was to prevent them from selling the whole and dividing the proceeds nothing yet in such a case they would disappear and here was edmund gray still fearlessly at large why had he not got clear away long before againall the correspondence concerning edmund gray was carried on between the office and the brokers there were no letters from edmund gray at all suppose it should be found impossible to connect edmund gray with the transactions carried on in his name suppose the real edmund gray were to deny any knowledge at all of the transactions suppose he were to say that ten years before he had brought a letter of introduction to mr dering and knew nothing more about him wellbut the certificates themselveswhat about them their possession would have to be accounted for so he turned the matter over and over and arrived at nothing not even the next step to take he went back to the chief and reported what he had discovered the existence of an edmund graythe letter of recommendation to the landlord another forgery groaned mr dering it is done in the office said george it is all done in the officeletterschequeseverything the office checkley repeated no doubt about it give up everything else george said mr dering eagerly everything else find outfind out employ detectives spend money as much as you please i am on a volcanoi know not what may be taken from me next only find out my partner my dear partnerfind out when george was gone checkley went after him and opened the door mysteriously to assure himself that no one was listening what are you going on like that for checkley asked his master irritably is it another forgery it rains forgeries nono look here dont trouble too much about it dont try to think how it was done dont talk about the other man look here youve sent that young gentleman to find out this business wellmark my words he wont he wont i say hell make a splash but he wont find anything who found out the last job you said you did but nothing was proved i found that out plenty of proof there was look herehis small eyes twinkled under his shaggy eyebrowsill find out this job as well see if i dont why he rubbed his hands ho ho i have found out dont ask medont put a single question butive got emoh ive got em ive got em for youas they sayon toast chapter xiii things more remarkable after such a prodigious event as the discovery of these unparalleled forgeries anything might happen without being regarded peoples minds are open at such times to see hear and accept everything after the earthquake ghosts walk solid things fly away of their own accord good men commit murder rich men go empty away and nobody is in the least surprised see what happened the very next day at the office in new square when george arrived in the morning he found that the senior partner had not yet appeared he was late for the first time for fifty years and more he was late he went to his place and the empty chair gave an air of bereavement to the room checkley was laying out the table that is he had done so a quarter of an hour before but he could not leave off doing it he was loth to leave the table before the master came he took up the blotting pad and laid it down again he arranged the pens he lingered over the job not come yet george cried astonished do you think that yesterdays shock has been too much for him i believe its killed him said the old clerkkilled him thats what it has done and he went on muttering and mumbling donthe cried when george took up the letters praps he isnt dead yetyou havent stepped into his shoes just yet let them letters alone not dead yet i hope not george began to open the letters regardless of the surly and disrespectful words one may forgive a good deal to fidelity he will go on for a good many years after we have got the money back for him after some of uscheckley corrected himhave got his money back for him he turned to go back to his own office then turned again and came back to the table he laid both hands upon it leaned forward shaking his head and said with trembling voice did you never think mr austin of the black ingratitood of the thing him that done it you knowhim that eat his bread and took his money when checkley was greatly moved his grammar went back to the early days before he was confidential clerk i daresay it was ungrateful i have been thinking hitherto of stronger adjectives wellweve agreedall of ushavent wethat it was done in this officesome one in the office done it with the help of some one out some one who knows his wayshe pointed to the empty chairsome one whod known all his ways for a long time ten years at least things certainly seem to point that wayand they point to you he would have added but refrained the old man shook his head again and went on theyve eaten his bread and done his work andanddont you call it mr austini ask you plaindont you call it black ingratitood i am sure it is i have no doubt whatever about the ingratitude but you see checkley that vice is not one which the courts recognise it is not one denounced in the decaloguethere is a good deal to consider in fact before we get to the ingratitude it is probably a criminal conspiracy it is a felony it is a thing to be punished by a long term of penal servitude when we have worried through all this and got our conspirators under lock and key we will proceed to consider their ingratitude there is also the bad form of it and the absence of proper feeling of it and the want of consideration of the trouble they give patience we shall have to consider the business from your point of view presently i wouldnt scoff and snigger at it mr austin if i were you scoffin and sniggerin might bring bad luck because you know theres others besides yourself determined to bring this thing to a right issue george put down his papers and looked at this importunate person what did he mean the old man shrunk and shrivelled and grew small he trembled all over but he remained standing with his hands on the tableleaning forward eight years ago he went on when that other business happenedwhen mr arundel cut his lucky i will have nothing said against mr arundel go to your own room one wordi will speak it if hes dead i shall not stay long here but i shall stay so long as hes alive though you are his partner only one word sir if mr arundel hadntrun awayhed a been a partner instead of you well well sirspose hed been found out after he was made a partner instead of before george pointed to the door the old man seemed off his headwas it with terror checkley obeyed but at the door he turned his head and grinned quite a theatrical grin it expressed malignity and the pleasure of anticipation what was the matter with the old man surely terror who in the office except himself had the control of the letters who drew that quarterly cheque surely terror it was not until halfpast eleven that mr dering arrived at the office he usually passed through the clerks office outside his own this morning he entered by his own private door which opened on the stairs no one had the key except himself he generally proceeded in an orderly and methodical manner to hang up his hat and coat take off his gloves place his umbrella in the stand throw open the safe sit down in his chair adjusted at a certain distance of three inches or so to put on his glasses and then without either haste or dawdling to begin the work of the day it is very certain that to approach work always in exactly the same way saves the nerves the unmethodical workman gets to his office at a varying hour travels by different routesnow on an omnibus now on foot does nothing today in the same way that he did it yesterday he breaks up early at sixty he talks of retiring at seventy he is past his work this morning mr dering did nothing in its proper order first he was nearly two hours late next he came in by his private door george rose to greet him but stopped becausea most wonderful thinghis partner made as if he did not observe his presence his eyes went through george in creepy and ghostly fashion the junior partner stood still silent in bewilderment saw one ever the like that a man should at noontide walk in his sleep his appearance too was strange his hat pushed a little back gave a touch of recklessnessactually recklessnessto the austere old lawyer his eyes glowed pleasantly and on his facethat grave and sober facethere was a pleased and satisfied smile he looked happy interested benevolent but notnonot mr edward dering again his coat always tightly buttoned was now hanging loose outside it had been swinging in the breeze to the wonder of lincolns inn and he wore no gloves a thing most remarkable he looked about the room nodded his head and shut the door behind him hes somnambulating george murmured or else i am invisible i must have eaten fernseed without knowing it mr dering still smiling pleasantly walked across the room to the safe and unlocked it he had in his hand a brownpaper parcel tied with red tapethis he deposited in the safe locked it up and dropped the keys in his pocket the window beside the safe was open he sat down looking out into the square at this moment checkley opened the door softly after his wont to bring in more letters he stopped short seeing his master thus seated head in hand at the window he recognised the symptoms of yesterdaythe rapt look the open eyes that saw nothing he crept on tiptoe across the room hush he whispered dont move dont speak he went like this yesterday dont make the least noise hell come round presently what is it kind of fit it is trouble done it yah ingratitood he would have hissed the word but it has no sibilant you cant hiss without the materials yesterdays trouble thats whats done it they stood watching in silence for about ten minutes the office was like the court of the sleeping princess then checkley sneezed mr dering probably mistook the sneeze for a kiss for he closed his eyes for a moment opened them again and arose once more himself grave and austere he nodded cheerfully took off his hat hung it on its peg buttoned his coat and threw open the safe evidently he remembered nothing of what had just passed you are early george he said you are before me which is unusual howeverthe early birdwe know before you for once are you quite well this morning none the worse for yesterdays trouble hes always well said checkley with cheerfulness assumed nobody ever sees him illhe get ill not him eats as hearty as fiveandtwenty and walks as upright i am perfectly well to the best of my knowledge yesterdays business upset me for the timebut it did not keep me awake yet it is certainly a very great trouble you have no news i suppose that brought you here earlier than usual nothing new since yesterday and you feel pretty confident i feel like a sleuthhound i understand the pleasures of the chase i long to be on the scent again as for edmund gray he is as good as in prison already good i was for the moment shaken out of myself i was bewildered i was unable to look at the facts of the case calmly for the first time in my life i wanted advice well i now understand what a great thing it is that our profession exists for the assistance of men in trouble how would the world get along at all without solicitors he took his usual place at the table and turned over his letters this morning he went on i feel more assured my mind is clear again i can talk about the case now then let us seeedmund gray is no shadow but a man he has made me recommend him to his landlord he is a clever man and a bold man dont be in a hurry about putting your hands upon him complete your case before you strike but make no delay there shall be none and you shall hear everything from day to day or from hour to hour left alone mr dering returned to his papers and his work at halfpast one checkley looked in not going to take lunch this morning lunch i have only just mr dering looked at his watch bless me most extraordinary this morning has slipped away i thought i had only just sat down it seems not more than half an hour since mr austin left me why i should have forgotten all about it and let the time go bynothing worse for a man of my years than irregular feeding its lucky youve got me said his clerk halfadozen partners wouldnt look after your mealtimesah as his master went upstairs to the room where he always had his luncheon laid out hes clean forgotten some of these days walking about wropped up in his thoughts hell be run overclean forgotten it he has sits down in a dream walks about in a dream some of these days hell do something in a dream then there will be trouble he closed the door and returned to his own desk where he was alone the juniors having gone out to dinner his own dinner was in his coat pocket it consisted of a saveloy cut in thin slices and laid in bread with butter and mustarda tasty meal he slowly devoured the whole to the last crumb then mr dering having by this time finished his lunch and descended again checkley went upstairs and finished the pint of claret of which his master had taken one glass its sour stuff he said it dont behave as wine in a mans inside ought to behave it dont make him a bit joyfuller but its pleasant too why they cant drink port winewhich is real winewhen they can afford it i dont know it was past three in the afternoon when george returned not quite so confident in his bearing yet full of news if you are quite ready to listen he said ive got a good deal to tell first of all i thought i would have another shot at grays inn i went to the chambers the outer door was open which looked as if the man was at home i knocked at the inner door which was opened by the laundress the old woman whom i saw yesterday well sir she said you are unlucky the master has been here this very morning and he hasnt been long gone youve only missed him by half an hour or so i asked her if he would return that day but she knew nothing then i asked her if she would let me write and leave a note for him to this she consented rather unwillingly i went in therefore and wrote my note at mr grays table i asked him to call here on important business and i marked the note urgent i think there can be no harm in that then i looked about the room it is one of those old wainscoted rooms furnished simply but everything solid and gooda long table nearly as large as this one of yours solid chairsa solid sofa three or four pictures on the wall and a bookcase full of books no signs of occupation no letters no flowers everything covered with dust although the old woman was there i could have wished to examine the papers on the table but the presence of the old woman forbade that dishonourable act i did however look at the books and i made a most curious discovery mr edmund gray is a socialist all his books are on socialism they are in french german and english all books of socialism and the pictures on the wall are portraits of distinguished socialists isnt that wonderful did one ever hear before of socialism and forgery going together not too fast we havent yet connected edmund gray with the forgery at present we only know that his name was used wait a bit i am coming to that after leaving the chambers i went into the city and saw mr ellis first of all none of the stock has been sold oh they have had three months and they have not disposed of it they must have met with unforeseen difficulties let me see mr dering was now thoroughly alert the weakness of the morning had completely passed away what difficulties upon my word i cannot understand that there could have been any they have got the papers from a respectable solicitor through a respectable broker nono their course was perfectly plain but rogues often break down through their inability to see the strength of their own case next mr ellis has ascertained that some of the dividends are received by your bank i therefore called on the manager now be prepared for another surprise another forgery yesanother forgery it is nine or ten years since you sent a letter to the manageri saw itintroducing your client edmund gray gentleman who was desirous of opening a private account he paid in a small sum of money which has been lying to his credit ever since and has not been touched in february last he received another letter from you and again in march and april forwarding certificates and requesting him to receive the dividends with your own hand you placed the papers in the bank i saw the letters i would swear to your handwriting these people are as clever as they are audacious at every point a letter from youa letter which the ablest expert would tell was your handwriting your name covers and vouches for everything did you tell the manager what has happened certainly i told him everything and this is in substance the line he takes your partner he says alleges that those papers have been procured by forgery he says that the letter of introduction is a forgery very good it may be so but i have opened this account for a customer who brought me an introduction from the best solicitor in london whose handwriting i know well and recognise in the letter such an allegation would not be enough in itself for me to take action until a civil or criminal action is broughtuntil it is concludedi could not refuse to treat the customer like all the rest at the same time i will take what steps i can to inquire into my customers antecedents quite right said mr dering i asked him next what he would do if the customer sent for the papers he said that if an action were brought he would probably be served with a sub poena duces tecum making him keep and produce these papers as forming part of the documents in the case certainly certainly the manager knows his law and he went on as regards cheques i shall pay them or receive them until restrained in other words he said what we expected for our own action now we might apply to a judge in chambers for an attachment or a garnishee order that must be pendente lite an interlocutory proceeding in the action as yet we have not brought an action at all my partnermr dering rubbed his hands cheerfullyi think we have done very well so far these are clumsy scoundrels after all they thought to divert suspicion by using my name they thought to cover themselves with my name but they should have sold and realised without the least delay very good we have now got our hands upon the papers it would have complicated matters horribly had the stock been sold and transferred so far we are safe because you see after what they have heard the bank would certainly not give them up without letting us know they would warn us they would put the man off they would ask him awkward questions about himself oh i think we are safequite safe mr dering drew a long breath i was thinking last night he continued of the trouble we might have if those certificates had changed hands they might have been bought and sold a dozen times in four months they might have been sold in separate small lots and an order of the court necessary for every transaction we have now nothing but the simple question before us how did the man edmund gray get possession of this property he sat in silence for a few minutes then he went on quietly to lose this money would be a heavy blow for menot all my fortune nor a quarter but a large sum i have plenty left i have no hungry and expectant heirs my people are all wealthy but yet a very heavy loss and thento be robbed i have always wondered why we left off hanging robbers they ought to be hanged every one he who invades the sacred right of property should be killedkilled without hope of mercy he spoke with the earnestness of sincerity to lose this property would not be ruin to me yet it would be terrible it would take so many years out of my past life every year means so much money saved forty thousand pounds means ten years of my pastnot taken away so that i should be ten years younger but ten years of work annihilated could i forgive the man who would so injure me never i understand said george fortunately we shall get the papers back the fact of their possession must connect the possessor with the fraud who is he can he be warned already yet who should tell him who knows that we have discovered the business youyour friend mr ellisthe manager of the bankno one else yesthere is also checkleycheckley he repeated he could notyetexpress his suspicions as to the old and faithful servant checkley also knows at this point checkley himself opened the door and brought in a cardthat of the bank manager i have called said the visitor hurriedly to tell you of something important that happened this morning i did not know it when we were talking over this business mr austin it happened at ten oclock as soon as the doors were open a letter was brought by hand from mr dering another forgery when will they stop asking for those certificates to be given to the bearermr edmund grays certificates this was done they are no longer at the bank oh then they have been warned cried george who was the messenger he was a boy looked like an office boy i will inquire directly if it was one of our boys go on that settles the difficulty as to our action in case the papers are wanted by you we no longer hold them as to the dividends we shall continue to receive them to the account of mr edmund gray until we get an order or an injunction the difficulty said george is to connect the case with mr edmund gray bodily at present we have nothing but the letters to go upon suppose the real edmund gray says that he knows nothing about it what are we to do you remember receiving the dividends for him has he drawn a cheque no we have never paid any cheque at all for him have you seen him no i have never seen him it is a most wonderful puzzle after all the withdrawal of the papers can only mean a resolution to sell them he must instruct somebody he must appear in the matter he may instruct somebody as he instructed mein the name of mr dering another forgery yes said george we must watch and find out this mysterious edmund gray after all it will not help us to say that a forged letter gave certain instructions to do certain things for a certain personsay the queenunless you can establish the complicity of that person and thatso farwe certainly have not done meantimewhat next obviously the next thing was to find out if any of the office boys had taken that letter to the bank no one had been sent on that errand chapter xiv checkleys case that evening mr checkley was not in his customary place at the salutation where his presence was greatly desired he arrived late when it wanted only a quarter to eleven the faded barrister was left alone in the room lingering over the days paper with his empty glass beside him mr checkley entered with an air of triumph and something like the elastic spring of a victor in his aged step he called robert and ordered at his own expense for himself a costly drinka compound of jamaica rum hot water sugar and lemon although it was an evening in july and for the time of year almost pleasantly warm nor did he stop here for with the manner of a man who just for onceto mark a joyful occasionplunges he rattled his money in his pocket and ordered another for the barrister for he said this evening i have done a good work and i will mark the day when the glasses were brought he lifted his and cried come let us drink to the confusion of all rogues great and small down with em your toast mr checkley replied the barrister would make my profession useless if there were no rogues there would be no law that however would injure me less than many of my brethren i drink therefore confusion to rogues great and small down with emthis is excellent grogdown with em so saying he finished his glass and departed to his garret where thanks to the grog he slept nobly and dreamed that he was a master in chancery the reason of this unaccustomed mirth was as follows checkley by this time had fully established in his own mind the conclusion that the prime mover in the deedthe actthe thingwas none other than the new partner the young upstart whom he hated with a hatred unextinguishable he was as certain about him as he had been certain about athelstan arundel and for much the same reasons very well as yet he had not dared to speak king pharaohs chief scribe would have had the same hesitation at proffering any theory concerning joseph tonight however but you shall hear everybody was out of the office at halfpast seven when he left it he walked round the empty rooms looking into unlocked drawersone knows not what he expected to find he looked into mr austins room and shook his fist and grinned at the empty chair ill have you yet he said oh fox fox ill have you if i wait for thirty years it adds an additional pang to old age when one feels that if the end comes prematurely when one is only ninety or so there may be a revenge unfinished i have always envied the dying hero who had no enemies to forgive because he had killed them all when checkley left the place he walked across the inn and so into chancery lane where he crossed over and entered grays inn by the holborn archway he lingered in south square he walked all round it twice he read the names on the doorposts keeping all the time an eye on no presently he was rewarded a figure which he knew tall and well proportioned head flung back walked into the inn and made straight for no it was none other than athelstan arundelthe old man crept into the entrance where he was partly hidden he could see across the square himself unseen athelstan walked into the house and up the stairs the place was quiet checkley could hear his steps on the wooden stairs he heard him knock at a doorhe heard the door open and the voices of men talking ah said checkley now weve got em wellbut this was not all for presently there came into the inn young austin himself oh said checkley finishing his sentenceon toast heres the other here they areboth in fact george too entered the house known as no and walked up the stairs checkley waited for no more he ran out of the inn and he called a cab if he had waited a little longer he would have seen the new partner come out of the house and walk away if he had followed him up the stairs he would have seen him knocking at the closed outer door of mr edmund gray if he had knocked at the door opposite he would have found mr athelstan arundel in the room with his own acquaintance mr freddy carstone the cambridge scholar and the ornament of their circle at the salutation but being in a hurry he jumped to a conclusion and called a cab he drove to palace gardens where sir samuel had his townhouse sir samuel was still at dinner he sat down in the hall meekly waiting after a while the service condescended to ask if he wished a message to be taken in to sir samuel from his brothersfrom mr derings office please tell him from his brothers officeon most important businessmost importantsay sir samuel received him kindly made him sit down and gave him a glass of wine now he said tell me what it all means my brother has had a robberypapers and certificates and thingsof course they are stopped he wont lose anything but it is a great nuisance this kind of thing he has already lost four months dividendsfour months sir on thirtyeight thousand pounds and do you really think that he will get back his papers certainlyor others they are after all only vouchers how is my brother well sir samuel better than youd think likely this morning to be sure he stopped being loth to tell how his master had lost consciousness well sir ive been thinking that the property was gone and from what i know of them as had to do with the job i thought there was mighty little chance of getting it back it kept me awake oh its an awful sum close upon forty thousand pounds he can stand that and double that and double that again said sir samuel i should hope so certainly sir but its a blow i can feel for him im only a clerk but ive saved a bit and put out a bit sir samuel cheeseparings youd say but ive enjoyed saving it upoh ive enjoyed it i dont think there is any pleasure in life like saving upwatching it growand grow and growit grows like a pretty flower doesnt itand adding to it ah he sighed and drank his glass of wine sir samuel if i was to lose my little savings it would break my heart im an old man and so is heit would break me up it would indeed ever since yesterday morning ive been thinking whether anything could happen to make me lose my money theres death in the thought sir samuelfor an old manand a small manlike metheres death in the thought dont tell anybody where your investments are and lock up the papers checkleynow what do you want me to do for you i want you to listen to me for half an hour sir samuel and to give me your advice for the business is too much for me go on then i am listening very well now sir i dont know if i shall be able to make my case clearbut i will try i havent been about mr dering for fifty years for nothing i hope the case is this nine years ago a man calling himself edmund gray took chambers in south square grays inn forty pounds a year he is represented as being an elderly man he has paid his rent regularly but he visits his chambers at irregular intervals eight years ago there was a forgery at your brothers the cheque was payable to the order of edmund gray mark that the money was paid i remember athelstan arundel was accused or suspected of the thing he was and he ran away to avoid being arrested remember that and hes never been heard of since well the series of forgeries by which the shares and stocks belonging to mr dering have been stolen are all written in the same handwriting as the first and are all carried on in the name and for the order of edmund gray that you would acknowledge in a moment if you saw the papers there are the same lines and curves of the letters which proves i should say that athelstan never did it wait a minute dont lets be in a hurry the forgers by themselves could do nothing they wanted some one in the office some one always about the place some one who could get at the safe some one who could get from the office what the man outside wanted some one to intercept the letters well that person sir samuel i have found sir samuel sat up you have found him i have and heres my difficulty because sir samuel he is your brothers new partner and unless we lodge him in the jug before many days he will be your own brotherinlaw sir samuel changed colour and got up to see that the door behind the screen was shut this is a very serious thing to say checkleya very serious thing oh i will make it quite plain first as to opportunities next as to motives third as to facts for opportunities then latterly for the last six months hes been working in the chiefs office nearly all day long there he sat at the little table between the windows just half turned round to catch the light with the open safe within easy reach of his hand when the chief wasnt looking or whenbecause he doesnt always touch the bellmr dering would bring papers into my office and leave him aloneah alonewith the safe thats for opportunities now for motives hes been engaged for two years i understand to a young lady to lady derings sister just so sir and i believe until the unexpected luck of his partnership against the wish of lady derings family that is true he had two hundred a year and he had nothing elseno prospects and no chances so i think you will acknowledge that theres sufficient motive here for him to try anything well if poverty is a motiveno doubt he had one poverty was the motive you couldnt have a stronger motive there isnt in the whole world a stronger motivethough i admit some young men who are pore may keep honest i did mr austin i take it is one of those that dont keep honest thats for motive now for facts mr austin had nothing to do with the forgery eight years ago he was only an articled clerk beginning but he knew young arundel who did the thing remember that cheque was written by young arundel who ran away the letters of this year are written by the same handby your brotherinlaw sir samuelby mr athelstan arundel but he is gone he has disappeared nobody knows where he is checkley laughed this was a moment of triumph he is back again sir samuel i have seen him where athelstan back again i will tell you all these forgeries use the name of edmund gray of south square grays inn i have told you that before when the thing is discovered young austin goes off and makes himself mighty busy tracking and following up hunting down doing detective work and so on oh who so busy as he found out that edmund gray was an old man if you please and this morning again so cheerful and lively that it does your heart goodgoing to settle it all in a day or two yah as if i couldnt see through his cunning why im seventyfive years old im up to every kind of dodge what will happen next unless you cut in first we shall hear that mr edmund gray has gone abroad or has vanished or something when hes quite out of the way we shall find out that he did the whole thinghim and nobody else and then if theres no more money to be made by keeping the papers they will all come backfrom edmund gray penitentoh i know but about athelstan arundel to be sure im an old man sir samuel and i talk too much well i go most nights to a parlour in holbornthe salutation it iswhere the company is select and the liquor good there i saw him a week ago he was brought in by one of the company i knew him at once and he wasnt in hiding used his own name but he didnt see me nono thinks i we wont give this away i hid my face behind a newspaper hes been staying in camberwell for the last eight years i believe all the time in camberwell why in camberwell in bad companyas i was given to understand in prodigal sons company you dont mean this checkley is it really true it is perfectly true sir samuel i have seen him he was dressed like a princevelvet jacket and crimson tie and white waistcoat and he walked in with just his old insolencenose up head back looking round as if we were not fit to be in the same room with himjust as he used to do by jove said sir samuel thrusting his hands into his pockets what will hilda sayi meanlady dering say when she hears it there is more to hear sir samuelnot much more but it drives the nail homea nail in their coffin i hope and trust go on let me hear all youve caught on have you to all i said about edmund gray of south squarehim as was mentioned eight years agoand about the handwriting being the same now as then yes so that the same hand which forged the cheque then has forged the letters now quite so i said thenand i say nowthat young arundel forged that cheque i say now that he is the forger of these letters and that austin stood in with him and was his confidant what do you think of this tonight after office i thought i would go and have a look at south square so i walked up and down on the other side my eyes are pretty good still i thought i should perhaps see something presently over the way so i did who should come into the square marching along as if the old place benchers and all belonged to him but mr athelstan arundel he pulled up at no no mindedmund grays numberhe walked upstairsi heard himto the second flooredmund grays floor good lord cried sir samuel this is suspicious with a vengeance oh but i havent done i stayed where i was wondering if he would come down and whether i should meet him and ask him what he was doing with edmund gray and theni was richly rewardedoh rich was the reward for who should come into the square but young austin himself he too went up the stairs of no and there i left them both and came awaycame to put the case into your hands what do you want me to do i want you to advise me what shall i do there is my case completei dont suppose you want a more complete casefor any court of justice well as for that im not a lawyer as a city man if a clerk of mine was in such a suspicious position as young austin i should ask him for full explanations youve got no actual proof you see that he or athelstan either did the thing i beg your pardon sir samuel im only a clerk and youre a great city knight but i dont know what better proof you want dont i see young austin pretending not to know who edmund gray is and then going up to his chambers to meet his pal athelstan arundel aint that proof dont i tell you that the same hand had been at work in both forgeries isnt that hand young arundels checkley i see that you are greatly interested in this matter i would giveahtwenty poundsyes twenty hardearned pounds to see those two young gentlemen in the dockwhere they shall bewhere they shall be he repeated his trembling voice cracked with old age seemed unequally wedded to the malignity of his words and his expression one of these young gentlemen said sir samuel is my brotherinlaw the other unless this business prevents will be my brotherinlaw before many days you will therefore understand that my endeavours will be to keep them both out of the dock the job will be only half complete without but stillto see young austin drove out of the placewith disgracesame as the other one waswhy that should be somethingsomething to think about afterwards checkley went away sir samuel sat thinking what was best to be done like everybody else he quite believed in athelstans guilt granted that fact he saw clearly that there was another very blacklooking case against him and against george austin what should be done he would consult his wife he did so what will elsie say she asked yet sooner or later she must be told i suppose that will be my task but she can wait a little do you go tomorrow morning to mr dering and tell him the sooner he knows the better you now understand why mr checkley was so joyous when he arrived at the salutation and why he proposed that toast in the morning sir samuel saw his brother and whispered in his ear the whole of the case as prepared and drawn up by checkley what do you say he asked when he had concluded i say nothing mr dering had heard all the points brought out one after the other without the least emotion there is nothing to be said but my dear brother the evidence there is no evidence it is all supposition if athelstan committed the first forgerythere is no evidence to show that he didif he has been living all these years a life of profligacy in englandi have evidence to the contrary in my own possessionif he was tempted by povertyif young austin was also tempted by povertyif the two togetheror either separatelycould undertake under temptation risks so terribleyou see the whole case is built upon an if yet it holds together at every point it is a perfect case who else could do it checkley certainly could not that old manthat old servant i agree with you checkley could not do it not because he is too oldage has nothing to do with crimenor because he is an old servant he could not do it because he is not clever enough this kind of thing wants grasp and vision checkley hasnt got either he might be a confederate he may have stopped the letters he is miserlyhe might be tempted by money yet i do not think it possible noi cannot believe that said sir samuel yet it is quite as difficult to believe such a thing of young austin oh i know everything is possible he belongs to a good family he has his own people to think of he is engagedhe has always led a blameless life yetyeteverything is possible i have known cases in the city where the blameless seeming was only a pretence and a cloakmost deplorable cases i assure youthe cloak to hide a profligate life i think if that were so i should not be deceived outward signs in such cases are not wanting i know the face of the profligate open or concealed young austin presents no sign of anything but a regular and blameless life for all these reasons i say we ought to believe him incapable of any dishonourable action but i have been in practice for fifty yearsfifty yearsduring this long period i know not how many caseswhat are called family caseshave been in my hands i have had in this room the trembling old profligate of seventy ready to pay any price rather than let the thing be known to his old wife who believes in him and his daughters who worship him i have had the middleaged man of standing in the city imploring me to buy back the paperat any pricewhich would stamp him with infamy i have had the young man on his knees begging me never to let his father know the forgery the theft the villainy the seductionwhat not and i have had women of every age sitting in that chair confessing their wickedness which they do for the most part with hard faces and cold eyes not like the men with shame and tears the men fall being tempted by want of money which means loss of pride and selfrespect and position and comfort there ought to have been a clause in the litany from want of money at all ages and on all occasions good lord deliver us truemost true said sir samuel from want of moneyi shall say this next time i go to churchfrom want of money at all ages and particularly when one is getting on in years and has a title to keep upgood lord deliver us very good indeed brother i shall quote this in the city tomorrow i have to make a speech at the helmet makers company i shall quote this very remarkable saying of yours mr dering smiled gravely a simple saying indeed the greatest temptation of any is the want of money why there is nothing that the average man will not do rather than be without money he is helpless he is a slave he is in contempt without moneyaustin you tell me was tempted by want of money i think not he was poor he had enough to keep him he was frugal he had simple wants he had never felt the want of money noi do not think that he was tempted by poverty everything is possiblethis is possiblebut brother silence if you speak about this you may injure the young man supposing him to be innocent if he is guilty you will put him on his guard and mind i shall show no foolish mercynonewhen we find the guilty parties all the more reason therefore for silence sir samuel promised but he had parted with the secrethe had given it into the keeping of a woman chapter xv who is edmund gray athelstan laughed on the first hearing of the thingit was on the tuesday evening the day after the discovery and george was dining with him he laughed both loud and long and with some of the old bitterness so the notes were in the safe all along were they who put them there i says old checkley with my pretty fingersi put them there as soon as this other business is over the chief must tell your mother athelstan it ought to come from him i shall say nothing to elsie just yet she shall learn that you are home again and that your name is clear again at the same moment i confess that i should be pleased to make them all confess that their suspicions were hasty and unfounded at the same time i did wrong to go away i ought to have stuck to my post as for this other business one thinks with something like satisfaction of the wise old lawyer losing forty thousand pounds it made him sit up did it for such a man to sit up indicates the presence of deep emotion lost forty thousand pounds and he who holds so strongly to the sanctity of property forty thousand pounds well but we shall recover the certificates or get new ones in their place i suppose so shares cant be lost or stolen reallycan they meantime there may be difficulty and you must try to find the forger has it yet occurred to you that checkley is the only man who has had control of the letters and access at all times to the office it has checkley is not exactly a fox he is a jackal therefore he does somebodys dirty work for him at a wage that is the way with the jackal you know eight years ago he tried to make a little pile by a little forgeryhe did not commit the forgery i am surebut he did the jackal only he forgot that notes are numbered so when he remembered that he put them back now his friend the forger who is no doubt a beggingletter writer has devised an elaborate scheme for getting hold of sharesignorant that they are of no value well he has drawn the dividends for four months that is something you see but he hoped to get hold of thirtyeight thousand pounds it is the same hand at work you infer from the writing you are quite sure of that there can be no doubt of it how could two different hands present exactly the same curious singularities and all the letters cheques and transfers for the same person what is his name one edmund gray resident at south square grays inn no oh that is where freddy carstone lives do you know anything about the nomme edmund gray i have been in search of information about him he is described by the landlord of the rooms and by his laundress as an elderly gentleman elderly checkley is elderly yes i thought of checkley of course but somehow the indications dont fit my informants speak of a gentleman nobody at his kindliest and most benevolent mood could possibly call checkley a gentleman the word gentleman said athelstan is elastic it stretches with the employer or the consumer of it it is like the word truth to a politician it varies from man to man you cannot lay down any definition of the word gentleman do you know nothing more about him a little he has held this set of chambers for nine years and he pays his rent regularly before the day it falls due also i called upon him the other day when his laundress was at work and wrote a note to him at his table the room is full of socialist books and pamphlets he is therefore presumably a socialist leader i know all their leaders said athelstan the journalist ive made the acquaintance of most for business purposes ive had to read up the socialist literature and to make the acquaintance of their chiefs there is no edmund gray among them staythere is a socialist letter in the times of todaysurely waiterthey were dining at the club where athelstan was a temporary memberlet me have the times of today yes i thought so here is a letter from the socialist point of view signed by edmund grayandand yeslook hereit is most curiouswith the same address south squarea long letter in small print and put in the supplement but its there see signed edmund gray what do you think of that for impudence in a forger george read the letter through carefully it was a whole column long and it was in advocacy of socialism pure and simple one was surprised that the editor had allowed it to appear probably he was influenced by the tone of it which was generous cheerful and optimistic there was not the slightest ring of bitterness about it we who look it said for the coming disappearance of property not by violence and revolution but by a rapid process of decay and wasting away regard the present position of the holders of property with the greatest satisfaction everywhere there are encouraging signs money which formerly obtained five per cent now yields no more than half that rate shares which were formerly paying ten twelve and twenty per cent are now falling steadily companies started every day in the despairing hope of the old great gains fail and are wound up land which the old wars forced up to an extraordinary value has now sunk so enormously that many landlords have lost threefourths and even more of their income all those enterprises which require the employment of many handsas docks railways printinghouses manufactories of all kindsare rapidly falling into the condition of being able to pay no dividend at all because the pay of the men and the maintenance of the plant absorb all when that point is reached the whole capitalthe millionsembarked in these enterprises will be lost for ever the stock cannot be sold because it produces nothing it has vanished in other words sir what i desire to point out to your readers is that while you are discussing or denouncing socialism the one condition which makes socialism possible and necessary is actually coming upon the worldnamely the destruction of capital why have not men in all ages combined to work for themselves because capital has prevented them when there is no capital left to employ them to bully them to make laws against their combinations or to bribe them they will then have to work with and for themselves or starve the thing will be forced upon them work will be a necessity for everybody there will be no more a privileged class all who work will be paid at equal rates for their work those who refuse to work will be suffered to starve the letter went on to give illustrations of the enormous losses in capital during the last fifteen years when the shrinkage began it concluded for my own part i confess that the prospect of the future fills me with satisfaction no more young men idle middleaged men pampered and old men looking back to a wasted life nobody trying to save because the future of the old the widows the children the decayed and the helpless will be a charge upon the strong and the youngthat is upon the juvenes the workers of the state no more robbery no more unproductive classes do not think that there will be no more men of science and of learning these too will be considered workers or no more poets dramatists artists novelists these too will be considered workers and do not fear the coming of that time it is stealing upon us as surely as certainly as the decay of the powers in old age doubt not that when it comes we shall have become well prepared for it those of us who are old may lament that we shall not live to see the day when the last shred of property is cast into the common hoard those of us who are young have all the more reason to rejoice in their youth because they may live to see the great day of humanity dawn at lastedmund gray south square grays inn you have read this asked george yes i read it this morning before i knew the significance of the signature letter of a dreamer he sees what might happen and thinks that it will happen capital is too strong yet is this the letter of a forger a conspiratora thief it does not strike me in that light yet many great thieves are most amiable in their private lives there is no reason why this dreamer of dreams should not be also a forger and a thief still the case would be remarkable i admit can there be two edmund graysfather and son can there be a clerk to edmund gray imprudently using his masters name and ready to open any letter that may come considerclerk is a friend of old checkley clerk invents the scheme checkley does his share however we can easily find out something more about the man because my old friend freddy carstone has chambers on the same floor we will walk over after dinner and if freddy happens to be soberhe is about this time pleasantly not stupidly drunk as a rulehe will tell us what he knows about his neighbour i ought to see elsie this evening but this is more important much more send her a telegram waiter we will take coffee here so you have got the conduct of the case in your own hands what has checkley got nothing i believe he is jealous of me i dont know why but it does not matter what an old man like that thinks even an old man can strike a match and light a fire checkley is a malignant old man he is quite capable of charging you with the job i wonder he hasnt done it by this time remember my case old man athelstans face darkened at the recollection dirt sticks sometimes look at me i am smirched all over his manner was very odd this morninginsolent and strange he began to talk mysteriously of the ingratitude of the forger why hes actually going to do it dont you seehe means that you are the forger oh does he very well athelstangeorge finished his coffee and got upthe sooner we find out this mystery of this edmund gray the better let us seek your tipsy scholar they walked from piccadilly to holborn turning the thing over and making a dozen surmises edmund gray twins edmund gray father and sonfather wanting to destroy property a socialist son wanting to steal property individualist edmund gray cousinsone the mild philosopher rejoicing in the decay of wealth the other a bandit robber and conspirator edmund gray father and daughterthe young lady of the advanced type who has not only thrown over her religion but her morals also edmund gray master and clerk edmund gray under domination of a villain there was in every situation a noble chance for the imagination george showed a capacity unsuspected he should have been a novelist the hypothesis was always beautiful and admirable but it wanted one thingvraisemblance one felt even while advancing and defending one that it was impossible they turned into the gateway of the inn and walked down the passage into the square look athelstan caught his companion by the wrist who is that checkley himself he is coming out of no yes out of what is he doing there eh what has he been doing there it was checkley the old man walking feebly with bent head came out from the entrance of no and turned northward into field court they waited watching him until he left the square what is he doing there asked george again come edmund gray must be at home let us go up they found the outer door shut they knocked with their sticks there was no answer what was he doing here asked athelstan the scholars door stood open the scholar himself was for once perfectly sober and welcomed them joyously and boisterously we are here on business freddy said athelstan you are here to sit and talk and drink whiskyandsoda till midnight till two oclock in the morning it is not until two in the morning that you can get the full flavour of the inn it is like a college then monastic shut off from the world peaceful business first then you know your neighbour mr edmund gray certainly we exchange the compliments of the season and the news of the weather when we meet on the stairs he has been in here but not often a man who drinks nothing is your true damper that believe me and no other was the veritable skeleton at the feast our business concerns your neighbour mr edmund gray we want you to tell us what you know about him go on then question and i will answer if i can does mr edmund gray live at these chambers no he may sometimes sleep in them but i should say not often he calls at irregular intervals sometimes in the afternoon sometimes in the morning sometimes not for several weeks together he is most uncertain do many people call upon him no one ever calls upon him does he keep clerks does he carry on an extensive correspondence i have never heard the postman knock at his door has he a son or a brother or a partner or anything i dont know he may have these hindrances but they are not apparent what is his occupation or trade he is a socialist he is athirst for the destruction of property meantime i believe he lives on his own perhaps his will be spared to the last he is an old gentleman of pleasant manners and of benevolent aspect the old women beg of him the children ask him the time the people who have lost their way apply to him he dreams all the time he lives in a world impossible oh quite impossible why in a world all socialist i myself should be impossible they wouldnt have me my old friend told me the other day that i should not be tolerated they would kill me all because i do no workor next to none george looked at athelstan we are farther off than ever he said mr edmund gray believes that the kingdom of heaven is a kind of hive where everybody has got to work with enormous zeal and where nobody owns anything also he thinks that it is close at hand which makes him a very happy old gentleman this cant be checkley said george it would seem not athelstan replied did you ever see another old man up herewe saw him coming out just nowone checkley a lawyers clerk no not up here there is an elderly persona partyof the name who uses the parlour of the salutation where i myself sometimesone must relaxporson loved a tavern so did johnsoni myself i say sometimes forget that i used to belong to the combination room and sit with checkley and his companions but i do not think he is a friend of mr gray as well call the verger the friend of the bishop mr gray is a gentleman and a scholar he is a man of generous instincts and culture he could not be a friend of the man checkley yet we saw checkley coming out of this very staircase they talked of other things they talked till midnight when they came away the scholar was at his best one more glasswhich he took after they leftwould have turned the best into the worst we are as far off as before said george nowe are so much the nearer that we know who edmund gray is not he is not checkley he has no clerks he has no visitors he comes seldom george this looks to me suspicious we met checkley stealing out of the door why does edmund gray keep these chambers no business done there no letters brought there no callers the man does not live there the socialism may bemust bea blind why does the man keep on these chambers meantime at the salutation the usual company was assembled i fear said the barrister that we shall not have our friend the scholar here this evening as i came down the stairs i saw him through his door receiving two gentlemenyoung gentlemen he will display his wonted hospitality upon them this evening instead he sighed and called for the glass of old and mild mixed which was all he could afford had the scholar been with them certainly there would have been a nobler and a costlier glass he took up the morning paper and began to read it the conversation went on slowly and with jerks a dull conversation a conversation of men without ideas a daybeforeyesterday conversation the slow exchange of short solid sentences taken from the paper or overheard and adopted we sometimes praise the old tavern life and we regret the tavern talk we need not it was dull gross ignorant and flat it was commonplace and conventional because it was so dull the men were fain to sing songs and to propose sentiments and to drink more than was good for them why and when do men drink more than is good for them first when and because things are desperately dull there is nothing to interest them give them animation thoughts amusements and they will not begin to drink when they have begun they will go on when they have arrived at a certain stage let them drink as fast as they can and so get out of the way because they will never mend and they only cumber the earth here is you see a complete solutiona short solutionof the whole drink question it will not be accepted because people like a long solutiona threecolumn solution the barrister lifted his head there is a letter here he said interrupting the exmp who was clearing the way for what he called an argument by an introduction in the usual form while on the one hand gentlemen he was saying i am free to confess there is a letter here he repeated in a louder voice the barrister was now old but he could still assume at times the masterful manner of counsel before the court which should be read it is a letter on socialism ugh said the moneylender socialism they want to destroy property socialism dont tell me sir it is a dream of what might bea noblea generous letter he looked round him in their dull and fishy eyes there was no gleam or sparkle of response i forgot he said you cannot be interested in such a letteri beg your pardon sir he bowed with great courtesy to the exmp i interrupted your valuable observations we shall listen i am sure withthegreatest he buried his head in the paper again the legislator began again as i was asaying gentlemen when i was interrupted on the subject of education and the ratepayers being a ratepayer myself as we all are and having our taxes to pay which is the only advantage we ever get from being a ratepayer while on the one hand i am free to confess why the barrister interrupted once again this letter is from a man on our staircase no checkley startedan acquaintance of mine if i can call him so and of our friend the scholar a very able man now somewhat in years by name edmund gray what said checkley edmund gray you know edmund gray certainly i have known him this nine years ever since he has been in the inn wwwhat sort of a man is he checkley stammered in his eagerness a very good sort of a man why do you ask i want to knowfor his advantageoh yesyesfor his own advantage yes the barrister retreated to his paper oh yes he added quite so for his great personal advantage checkley repeatedrobert i think the gentleman would take a tumbler if you will bring ithot robertstrongwith lemon and sugara large rummer robert the ancient barristers head behind the paper was observed to tremble robert returned with his rummer the glass spoon tinkling an invitation dinner had been but a sorry affair that daya stopgapinsufficient in bulk the tempted man felt a yearning that could not be resisted he stretched out his hand and took the glass and tasted it then turning to checkley you have purchased my speech sir you were asking me about mr edmund gray what do you wish to know everythinghis businesshis private lifeanything as for his business he has none he is a gentleman living on his meanslike myself but his means are larger than my own he has a residence elsewherei dont know where he uses his chambers but little he has a collection of books there and he keeps them for purposes of study does he call there every day no only at irregular times sometimes not for many weeks together has he got any friends i should say that he has no friends at allat least none that come to the inn i have never heard or seen anyone in his room a quiet man no slammer an excellent man to have on the staircase no trampler doesnt tramp up and down like an elephant isnt brought home drunk what does he look like he is a man advanced in yearsperhaps seventya goodlooking manvery cheerful countenance tall and well set up stillwears a long frock coat and that i believe is all i know about him thats all youve got to tell me is it that is all mr checkley except that he has written a very remarkable letter to the times of this morning well sir if that is all it isnt much for your rumandwater let me tell you the barrister rose and poured the halfglass that remained into the cinders then let me drink no more than my information was worth he said and at the sight of so much magnanimity the broad earth trembled and mr checkley sat aghast the exstatesman cleared his throat and began again after the third interruption gentlemen i may hope for a hearing while therefore on the one hand chapter xvi the voice of duty elsie in her studio was at work she was painting a fancy portrait you have seen how before her interview with mr dering she transformed him from a hard and matteroffact lawyer into a genial benevolent old gentleman she was now elaborating this transformation it is a delightful process known to every portraitpainter whereby a face faithfully represented becomes the face of another person or the face as it might be so that a hard and keen face such as mr derings may become a face ennobled with spiritual elevation benevolence charity and kindness of heart or on the other hand without the least change of feature this hard keen face may become by the curve of a line or the addition of a shadow the face of a cruel and pitiless inquisitor or again any face however blurred and marred by the life of its owner may by the cunning portraitpainter be restored to the face intended by its maker that is to say a sweet and serious face great indeed is the power marvellous is the mystery of the limners art now elsie murmured you look like some great philanthropista thoughtful philanthropist not a foolish person your high forehead and your sharp nostril proclaim that you are no impulsive gusher your kindly eyes beam with goodness of heart your lips are firm because you hate injustice oh my dear guardian how much i have improved you something like this you looked when you told me of my fortuneand like this when you spoke of your dream and your illusionssomething like this you looked she went on working at her fantasy crooning a simple ditty composed of many melodies running into one as girls use when they are quite happy the afternoon was hot outside elsies windows looked upon a nest of little london gardens where nasturtiums twisted round strings upon the walls hollyhocks and sunflowers which love the london smoke lifted their heads and virginia creepers climbed to the housetops the little london gardens do sometimes look gay and bright in the yellow glow of a july afternoon the window was open and the room was almost as hot as the street outside we get so few hot days that one here and there cannot be too hot on the table lay a photograph of her lover over the mantel hung her own drawing in pastel of that swain on her finger was his ring round her neck lay his chain all day long she was reminded of him if she should cease for a moment to think of him but there was no need of such reminder it was friday afternoon four days after the great discovery elsie had been informed of the event the news of which she received after the feminine manner with an ejaculation of surprise and an interjection of sympathy but one cannot expect a girl on the eve of her marriage to be greatly distressed because her guardian a rich man is annoyed by the temporary loss of certain shares and as to finding the criminal and getting back those sharesit was mans work all the troublesome and disagreeable part of the worlds work belongs to man it was nearly five oclock elsie was beginning to think that she had done enough and that after tea a walk in the gardens might be pleasant suddenly without any noise or warning of steps outside her door was opened and her sister hilda appeared now so swift is the feminine perception that elsie instantly understood that something had happenedsomething badsomething bad to herself for first the door was opened gently as in a house of mourning and next hilda had on a dresslavender with heliotrope costly becoming sympathetic and sorrowfula halfmourning dressand she stood for a moment at the door with folded hands her classical head inclined a little downward to the left and her eyes droopingan artistic attitude of sadness hilda not only said the right thing and held the proper sentiments but she liked to assume the right attitude and to personate the right emotion now it is given to woman and only to her when she is young tall and beautiful to express by attitude all or any of the emotions which transport or torture her fellowcreatures hilda you see was an artist come in dear said elsie i am sure that you have got something disagreeable to tell me hilda kissed her forehead my poor child she murmured if it could have been told you by anybody else welllet us hear it is it anything very disagreeable it is terrible i tremblei dare not tell you yet i must you ought to know if you would go on it is much more terrible to be kept in suspense it is about george oh said elsie flaming i have had so much trouble about george already that i did think my dear all opposition of the former kind is removed as you know this is something very different worse she added in a hollow voicefar worse for heavens sake get along he has told you about the dreadful robbery of course you have talked about nothing else since it happened i found my mother full of it yesgeorge is in charge of the case he says that everything must be recovered and that mr dering will in the end suffer no more injury than the trouble of it that may be so elsiei hardly dare to tell youthere is a clue checkley has got that clue and has told sir samuel everything he is following up the clue i shudder to think of it the man is as relentless as a bloodhound does that clue concern me her cheek became pale because she guessedshe knew not what sir samuel against his will is convinced that checkley has found the clue he has told me the whole he has consented to my telling the dreadful story to my mother and to youand now i am afraid yet i must elsie made a gesture of impatience go back elsie eight years if you can remember the wretched business of our unworthy brother i remember it not unworthy hilda our most unfortunate brother why they have found the very notes he was charged with stealing they were found in the safe on the very day when they made the other discovery have they not told you checkley told sir samuel he also remembers seeing athelstan place the packet in the safe oh does he dare to say that why hilda the robbery was proved to lie between himself and athelstan if he saw that why did he not say so he keeps silence for eight long years and then he speaks hilda shook her head sadly i fear she said that we cannot accept the innocence of our unfortunate brother however athelstan was accused of forging mr derings handwriting and signature in this new forgery the same handwriting is found againexactly the same the forger is the same clearly therefore it cannot be athelstan that settles it yesunfortunatelyit does settle it because you see athelstan is in london he is said to have been living in london all the timein some wretched place called camberwell inhabited i suppose by runaways and low company of every kind he has lately been seen in the neighbourhood of grays inn apparently passing under his own name checkley has seen him another person has seen him have you come to tell me that athelstan is charged with this new wickedness the forger must have had an accomplice in the office a man able to get at the safe able to intercept the post acquainted with mr derings ways such a man assaycheckleyorthe only other possiblegeorge hilda paused oh this is too absurd you are now hinting that georgemy george she said proudly was the confederate of athelstannoof a forger they have been seen together they have been seen together at the house from which the forger addresses his letters has george told you that he has known all alongfor eight yearsof athelstans residence in london observe how that simple remark made in the salutation parlour that athelstan must have been living in camberwell had by this time grown into a complete record of eight years hiding eight years disgraceful company on the part of one and eight years complicity and guilty knowledge on the part of the other hilda had not the least doubt it was quite enough for her that checkley said so half the contents of our newspapers are conducted on the same confiding principle if george has not told me elsie replied it must be for some good reason perhaps he was pledged to secrecy my dearhilda rose impressively with fateful facethe hand that forged the letters is the hand that forged the chequeyour brothers hand the hand that took the certificates from the safeshe laid her own upon elsies handthe hand of the confederate my poor sister isyour lovers hand i knew said the girl that you were coming to this i have felt it from the beginning remember the thing was done in the months of february march and april first of all athelstan was then as now desperately poor the life that he has led for the last eight yearsthe life of aacamberwell profligateshe spoke as if that respectable suburb was the modern alsatiahas certainly destroyed whatever was left of honour and of principle there comes a time i have read in the career of every wicked man when he hesitates no longer whatever means are offered him of making money athelstan it wasso they believewho devised this scheme which has been as successful as it is disgraceful my dear elsie this is the most terrible disgrace that has ever befallen my family the most dreadful and the most unexpected calamity for you elsie caught her sister by the wrist in the name of god hilda are you telling me what is proved and true or what is only suspected i am telling you what is as good as proved more than suspected as good as proved oh elsie drew a long breath as good as proved that is enough like athelstans guilt eight years ago she flared out suddenly springing up again and walking about the room oh it is wonderful she criedwonderful what a family we are we had a brother and we believed that he was an honourable gentleman as the son of his father must be then there was a charge a foolish charge based upon nothing but mayhavebeen and musthavebeen we believed the charge because we had no choice but to believe elsie her sister interrupted do you think we wanted to believe the charge we should have believed him innocent until the thing was proved we did not we cast him out from among us and now after eight yearshe has come back poor you say and sunk so low that he is ashamed to see his people and we are going to believe another charge based on may have been and must have been no hilda i will not believe iti will notand then there is george if i cease to believe in his honour and his truth i cease to believe in everything i cannot believe in heaven itself unless i believe in my lover why his heart is light about this business he is not concerned he laughs at that old mans ravings ravings if athelstan is right then his is the hand that has done it allhishildacheckley is the man concerned with both crimes hilda shook her head no elsie no the old man is above suspicion why should he be above suspicion more than george and you ask me on the first breath of accusation to treat george as you treated athelstan wellhilda i will not i make every allowance for you elsie it is a most dreadful businessa heartbreaking business you may misrepresent me as much as you please i will continue to make allowances for you meantime what will you do do what should i do nothing nothing nothing i shall go on as if this thing had never happened sir samuel ordered me to warn you most seriously if you consent to see him again consent consent why should i refuse in a fortnight he will be my husband and my master whom i must obey he calls me his mistress now but i am his servant consent to see him she sat down and burst into tears if you see him again her sister continued warn him to leave the country the thing is so certain that in a day or two the proofs will be complete and it will then be too late make him leave the country be firm elsie better still refuse to see him at all and leave him to his fate what a fate what madness we allowed athelstan to leave the country he ought to have stayed if i advise george at all i shall advise him to stick to his post and see the business through if he were to leave the country i would go with him you are infatuated elsie i can only hope that he may fly the country of his own accord meantime there is one other point what is it pray dont spare me hilda after what has gone before it must be a very little point you are bitter elsie and i dont deserve your bitterness but that is nothing at such a moment everything must be pardoned and permitted the point is about your wedding it is fixed for the th of next month less than three weeks from today you must be prepared to put it off indeed because you say that a thing impossible is as good as proved certainly not hilda i have come here today elsie by sir samuels express wish in order to soften the blow and to warn you whether you will tellthat unhappy young man or not is for you to decide perhaps if you do he may imitate our unworthy brother and run away if he does not the blow will fall tomorrowtodaythe day after tomorrowi know not when he will be arrested he will be taken before a magistrate he will be remanded he will be out on bail oh elsie think of marrying a man out on bail one might as well marry a man in convict dress oh horrible i would rather marry george in convict dress than any other man in fine raiment because once more the thing is impossible you carry your faith in your lover beyond bounds elsie of course a girl is right to believe in a mans honour it makes her much more comfortable and gives her a sense of security besides we always like to believe that we are loved by the best of men that makes us feel like the best of womenbut in this case when i tell you that sir samuela man who has always lived among moneyso to speakand knows how money is constantly assailedis firmly convinced of georges complicity i do think that you might allow something for human frailty in the case of athelstan what did mr dering say everything is possible so i say of george austin everything is possible not everything not that yes even thatwhat do you know of his private life why has he concealed the fact of athelstans residence in london why has he never told us of his friendship with that unfortunate outcast i dont know he has his reasons it is a most dreadful thing for you hilda went on and after getting to believe in the man andwellbecoming attached to himthough such attachments mean little and are soon forgottenand after going the length of fixing the day and ordering the dress and the weddingcake and putting up the banns oh it is a wretched businessa horrible misfortune the only thing to be said is that in such a case the fact being known to everybody no one can blame a girl and perhaps in the long run she will suffer no injury from it our circle for instance is so different from that of this young mans friends that the thing would not even be known among us i believe hilda you will drive me mad my dear one must look ahead and remember that i look ahead for you as for the young man i dissociate him henceforth from you what he does and where he goes i do not inquire or care about any more than i trouble myself about a disgraceful brother some acts cut a man off from his mistressfrom his sistersfrom the world do not talk any more said elsie let the blow as you call it fall when it pleases but as for me i shall not warn george that he is to be charged with dishonesty any more than i will believe him capable of dishonesty well my dear there is one comfort for us you may resolve on marrying him but a man charged with a crimeout on bailcannot marry any girl and he will be charged and the evidence is very strong no doubt as good as provedas good as proved poor george who never had ten pounds in the world until he was made a partner true and there we have the real motive seek the motive sir samuel says and we shall find the criminal here you have the reason of the secret partnership with athelstan poverty is the tempterathelstan is the suggested elsie shook her head impatiently mr dering was to give you away who will now athelstan how can wesir samuel and iassist at a wedding where the bridegroom lies under such a chargeby one so near to us as mr dering how can your mother be present oh elsie think elsie shook her head again with greater impatience think what a fate you may be dragging upon yourself think of possible children with such a brand upon them i think only of an honourable and an innocent man i have just come from my mother elsie she says positively that if the charge is brought the wedding must be put off until the man is cleared and for the moment she does not feel strong enough to meet him you can receive him here if you please and she desires that there may be no disputes or arguments about it it is truly wonderful elsie walked to the open window and gasped as if choking wonderful she repeated the same fatein the same mannerthreatens george that fell upon athelstan and it finds us as ready to believe in the charge and to cast him out now hilda go to my mother and tell her that though the whole world should call georgemy georgea villain i will marry him tell her that though i should have to take him from the prison door i will marry him because you see all things are not possible this thing is impossible we shall have trouble with elsie lady dering told her mother call her soft and yielding my dear no mule was ever more stubborn she will marry her convict she says even at the prison door chapter xvii was he in rags stubborn as a mule yesit is the way with some girls man is soft as wax compared with woman man concedes compromises gives way submits woman has her own waywhen that way is the right way she becomes a pearl above price elsie when the door was shut and her sister gone stood silent immovable a red spot burned in her cheeks her eyes were unnaturally bright her lips parted she was possessed by a mighty wrath and great determination she was the tigress who fights for her beloved meantime everything was changed the sunshine had gone out of the day the warmth out of the air her work that had pleased her so much an hour ago seemed a poor weak thing not worth thinking about everything was a trifle not worth thinking aboutthe details of her wedding her presents her honeymoon her pretty flatall became insignificant compared with this threatened charge against her lover how was it to be met if it was only a suspicion put into shape by sir samuel and old checkley it would be best to say nothing if it was really going to be brought against him would it not be best to warn him beforehand and about her brother she sat down and wrote out the facts to be doing this cleared her brain and seemed like working for her lover in march a cheque for l to the order of one edmund gray was cashed in tenpound notes by a commissionaire sent from an hotel in arundel street strand no one ever found out this edmund gray athelstan was suspected the notes themselves were never presented and were found the other day in mr derings safe covered with dust at the back of some books in february march and april by means of forged letters a great quantity of shares were transferred from the name of edward dering to that of edmund gray the writing of the letters was the same as that of the forged cheque these were the only facts the rest was all inference and presumption athelstan had been seen in london athelstan had been living all the time in london athelstan had been seen going into the house which was given as the residence of edmund gray wellathelstan must be seen the very first thing further than this point she could not get she rang the bell ordered tea to be brought to her own room and then put on her hat and went out to the gardens where she walked about under the trees disquieted and unhappy if a charge is going to be brought against him the most innocent man in the world must be disquieted until he knows the nature of the evidence against him once satisfied as to that he may be happy again what evidence could they bring against george she went home about eight going without dinner rather than sit down with her mother it is a miserable thing for a girl to be full of hardness against her mother elsie already had experience as you have seen for the present better not to meet at all therefore she did not go home for dinner but took a bun and a cup of coffeewomans substitute for dinnerat a confectioners when george called about nine oclock he was taken into the studio where he found elsie with the traces of tears in her eyes why elsie he cried what is the matter why are you crying my dear and why are you alone in this room i choke in this house george take me out of ittake me away let us walk about the squares and talk i have a good deal to say now dear what is itwhen they were outside what happened you are tremblingyou have been shaken tell me dear i dont think i can tell you just at presentnot all something thenthe rest afterwards tell me by instalments you are quite happy george nobody has said anything to make you angry at the office or anywhere else nobody we are going on just the same mr dering thinks and talks about nothing but the robbery so do i so does everybody else i suppose checkley has told for every clerk in the place knows about it and is talking about it why do you ask if anybody has made me angry my dear george hilda has been here this afternoon you know thatsometimeshilda does not always say the kindest things about people not always i remember when she wrote me a letter asking whether i thought that a lawyers clerk was a fit aspirant for the hand of her sister not always just the kindest things but i thought we were all on the most affectionate terms and that everything had been sponged out has she been saying more kind sisterly things about me what have i done now isnt the money difficulty solved i will tell you some other timenot nowwhat she said at the present moment i want to ask you a question if you have reasons for not answering say so and i shall be quite satisfied but answer me if you can this is the question hilda says that athelstan is secretly in london and that you know it and that you have been seen with him is that true wellelsiethe only reason for not telling you that athelstan is here is that he himself made me promise not to tell you athelstan is in london i see him often i shall see him this evening after leaving you he is in london walking about openly why not i know no reason for any concealment but he cannot go to see his mother or enter his mothers house until this charge against him has been acknowledged to be baseless as for you he will be the first person to visit youand will be your most frequent visitorwhen we are married he is always talking about you he is longing for the time when he can see you openly but nothing will persuade him to come here he is still bitter against his mother and against hilda elsie sighed it is very terribleand now but go on i have answered your question elsie oh no i have only just begun you say that athelstan is in london but you do not tell me what he is doing and how he fares he fares very well and he is prosperous hilda says that he has been living in some wretched quarter of london all these years that he has been frequenting low company and that he has been until the last few weeks in rags and penniless george laughed aloud where on earth did hilda get this precious information athelstan in a low quarter athelstan a prodigal athelstan in rags my dearest elsie if lady dering were not your sister i should say that she had gone mad with venomous hatred of the brother whom she made so much haste to believe guilty oh tell me quick george dont say anything against hilda please i am already tell me quick the whole truth well dear the whole truth is this athelstan is doing very well i suppose you might call him prosperous when he went away he had ten pounds to begin with people kindly credited him with the nice little sum of l obtained by a forgery we now know that this money has been lying in the safe all the timehow it got there the lord knowsperhaps checkley could tell he went to america by the cheapest way possible he had many adventures and many ups and downs all of which he will tell you before long once he had great good fortune on a silver mine or something he made thousands of pounds over it then he lost all his moneydropped it down a sink or into an open drainyou know in america these traps are plentiful and started again on his ten pounds he was a journalist all the time and he is a journalist still he is now over here as the london correspondent of a great paper of san franciscothat my dear elsie is briefly the record of your brother since he went away oh but are you quite sure georgequitequite sure because if this can be proved nothing is more easy to prove he brought letters to a london bank introducing him as the correspondent and empowering him to draw certain moneys how long has athelstan been at home she remembered the dates of the recent forgeries and the alleged fact that all were in the same handwriting you are so persistent elsie that i am certain you have got something serious on your mindwont you tell me no georgenot tonight buthow long has athelstan been in england i will tell you exactly how and when i met him do you remember three weeks ago that sunday evening when we were so happy and so miserableresolved on braving everythinggoing to live on love and a crust for the rest of our livesyou poor dear brave girl he touched her fingers i shall always be thankful for that prospect of poverty because it revealed my mistress to me in all her loveliness of love and trust and courage oh georgeyou spoil me but then i know myself better wellon that evening we went to church together and after church as i was not allowed in the house we walked round and round the square until the rain came on and we had to go home well you did not take any notice but as you stood on the steps waiting for the door to be opened a man was standing on the kerb under the lamp close by when the door was shut behind you i turned and walked away this man followed me and clapped me on the shoulder it was athelstan and i saw him and did not know him he has grown a big beard now and wore a felt hat he is a picturesque object to look at ought to have been one of drakes men i daresay he was in a former existence he had then been in england exactly a week and every day he had prowled about the place in the hope of seeing younot speaking to youhe trusted that you would not know him again oh poor athelstan that is nearly three weeks ago he has been in england four weeksa monthand threefourfive months agowhere was he i told you in california oh then he could notpossiblynot possiblyand it can be provedand oh georgegeorgei am so gladi am so glad she showed her joy by a light shower of tears why my dear he said soothing her why are you so troubled and yet so glad you dont quite understand george you dont know the things that are said all these forgeries are in the same handwriting certainly one man has written all these letters and cheques and thingsboth that of eight years ago and those of last march that is perfectly certain then dont you see athelstan was out of england when these newlydiscovered forgeries were done therefore he had no hand in them therefore again he could have had no hand in the earlier one whyyou establish his innocence perfectly now you see one of the reasons why i was so glad the other reasonthat this fact destroyed at one blow the whole of the splendid edifice constructed upon the alleged stay of athelstan in londonelsie concealed her heart it must be acknowledged was lightened you may have the most complete belief in the innocence of a person but it is well to have the belief strengthened by facts as for me said george i have been so long accustomed to regard him as one of the worst used of men that i never thought of that conclusion of course if the handwriting is the same and it certainly seems the samea very good imitation of mr derings handthere is nothing now to be said athelstan was in california in the spring that settles it and the notes were in the safe two clinchers but to some minds a suspicion is a charge and a charge is a fact george you must take me to athelstan give me his address he is in lodgings in half moon street i will ask him if he will meet you nono let me go to him it is more fitting you will see him presently will you tell him that i will call upon him tomorrow morning at eleven and tell him george that something has happenedsomething that makes it impossible for me to remain at homeeven for the short time before our wedding elsie this is very serious yes it is very serious tell him that i shall ask him to receive me until the wedding or until certain things have happenedbut in any caseoh they must happen sothey mustit is too absurd elsie my dear you grow interjectional yesyes i mean george that if things turn out as i hope they may i will go home again if not we will be married from athelstans lodgings and you will not tell me what this terrible business is not tonight george she repeated it is very serious and it makes me very unhappy that my mother and sister it is something to do with me elsie clearly never mind you will tell me when you please whatever you do is sure to be right i will see him this evening thank you george i think that what i propose is the wisest thing to do besides i want to be with you and athelstan tell him that as he left the house eight years ago i leave it now you why my dear child what forgeries have you been committing none and yet well george that is enough about me and my troubles tell me now about your search into this business how have you got on there is nothing new to report i told you that i left a note on edmund grays table no answer has come to that the bank has written to tell him that his letter of introduction was a forgery no answer the dividends are accumulating he draws no cheques he makes no sign in a word though this money is lying to his credit and the shares are transferred to his name and the letters give his address there is nothing whatever to convict the man himself we could not prove his signature and he has taken none of the money he might call any day and say that he knew nothing about it i wonder he hasnt done it when he does we shall just have to put everything straight again as for poor old checkley i really believe that he is going mad if i meet him he glares if he is in his masters room his eyes follow me about under his shaggy eyebrows with a malignity which i have never seen painted as for being described words couldnt do it i suppose he sees that the end is inevitable really elsie the man would murder me if he dared the man is dangerous george as well as malignant but i think he will do you no harm in the long run have you told athelstan what is going on certainly he follows the business with the greatest interest he agrees with me that the thing is done out of the office with the help of some one in it now the point is that the man in the office must have the control of the post all the letters must pass through his hands who is that man no one but checkley everything turns on that now here is a lucky accident an old friend of athelstans a man who coaches has chambers on the same stairs and on the same floor he knows this mr edmund gray we have been to his rooms to question him is it to see this old friend that athelstan visits no yes his name is carstonecommonly called freddy carstonea pleasing man with a little weakness which seems to endear him to his friends this is the way in which things get distorted in a malignant mind well what did this gentleman tell you about this mysterious edmund gray nothing definite that he is some kind of socialist we knew before that he has occupied the chambers for ten years or so we knew before also that he is an elderly gentleman of benevolent aspect and that he is irregular in his visits to his chambers we seem to get no further we see checkley coming out of the house that connects him to be sure but that is not much there is no connection established between edmund gray and the forgeries in his name nor between checkley and the forgeries one feels that if one could lay hold of this mysterious elderly gentleman a real step in advance would be taken you talked at first of arresting him on the charge wellthere is no evidence his name has been usedthat is all on that evidence no magistrate would issue a warrant sometimes ones head goes round with the bewilderment of it ive managed to learn something about checkley in the course of these inquiries he is quite a great man elsie a tavern oracle in the evening a landlord and householder and collector of his own rents at odd hours a capitalist and a miser but he is not as thought at firstedmund gray they had by this time got round to the house again go now george said elsie see athelstan this evening tell him that i must go to him i will tell him why tomorrow if he is not at his club i will go to his lodgings if he is not there i will wait till he comes home and before i go home i will drop a note for yougoodnight sweetheartgoodnight chapter xviii the prodigal at home in the morning elsie rose at seven and put together such things as she should want for the three weeks before her marriage if she was to spend that interval under her brothers care at eight oclock she received her lettersincluding one in a handwriting she did not know she opened it dear elsie it said come to me at once come early come to breakfast at nine i will wait for you till ten or any time your affectionate brother athelstan oh she murmured and i did not know his writing and to think that i am twentyone and he is thirtyone and that i have never had a letter from him before her boxes were packed she put on her jacket and hat and descended into the breakfastroom where her mother was already opening her letters and waiting breakfast you are going out elsie she asked coldly yes hilda told you i suppose what she came here for yesterday in fact you sent me a message i hope she delivered it correctly she said that you would not sanction my wedding while this charge or suspicion was hanging over georges head and that you would not see him until it was withdrawn or cleared away certainly in such a case it would be worse than hypocrisy to receive him with friendliness then like hilda you accept the conclusion i am unable to do anything else the conclusion seems to me inevitable if not let him explain i hope that no time will be lost in bringing the formal charge it is foolish kindnessreal crueltyto all concerned to keep such a thing hanging over our heads i say our heads not yours only elsie because you know your brother is implicatedperhaps the real contriverof the dreadful scheme would you believe me if i were to tell you that athelstan could not be implicated my dearbelieve you of course i would believe if i could unfortunately the evidence is too strong elsie sighed very well i will say nothing more you have driven out my lover as you drove out my brother for the selfsame cause and on the selfsame charge i follow my lover and my brother elsieher mother started do not i pray you do anything rash remembera scandala whisper evenmay be fatal to you hereafter sit down and wait all i ask you to do is to wait no i will not wait if those two are under any cloud of suspicion i too will sit under the cloud and wait until it lifts i am going to stay with my brother until my wedding that is to be on the th nonomy poor child there will be no wedding on the th before that time everything will be cleared up and i shall be married from this house so that i have left all my things my presentseverything her mother shook her head try not to think so cruelly of george and of athelstan mother you will be sorry afterwards try to believe that though a case may look strange there may be a way out i have told youher mother was perfectly cold and unmovedthat i have come to this conclusion on the evidence if the young man can explain things let him do so there will be no wedding on the th elsie you can come home as soon as you are convinced that your brother is an improper person for a young lady to live with and as soon as you have learned the truth about the other young man that is to say i will receive you under these distressing circumstances provided there has been no scandal connected with your name elsie turned and left the room the fifth commandment enjoins that under such circumstances as these the least said the soonest mended when a man learns that his sister his favourite sister from whom he has been parted for eight years the only member of his family who stood up for him when he was falsely accused of a disgraceful thing is about to take breakfast with him he naturally puts as much poetry into that usually simple meal as circumstances allow mostly athelstan took a cup of coffee and a london egg this morning he had flowers raspberries lying in a bed of leaves a few late strawberries various kinds of confitures in dainty dishes toast and cake with fish and cutletsquite a little feast and he had had the room cleared of the bundles of newspapers the pipes and cigarcases and all the circumstances of tobacco were hidden awayall but the smell which lingered one thinks a good deal about a sisters visit under such conditions at a quarter past nine elsie arrived athelstan hastened to open the door and to receive her with open arms and kisses strange and sweet then while the people of the house took in her luggage he led his sister into the room which was the front room on the groundfloor elsie he said taking both her hands in his eight years since we partedand you are a tall young lady whom i left a little girl to hold your handto kiss you seems strange after so long he kissed her again on the forehead she looked up at the tall handsome man with a kind of terror it was almost like casting herself upon the care of a strange man i remember your voice athelstan but not your face you have changed more than i even and i remember your voice elsiealways a soft and winning voice wasnt itto suit soft and winning ways there never was any child more winning and affectionate than younever oh you are grown very handsome athelstan see what a splendid beard and the brown velvet jacket and white waistcoatand the crimson tie you look like an artist i wish all men wore colours as they used to do i only heard yesterday that you were in london hilda told me was that the reason why you cannot stay at home part of the reason but you shall have breakfast first you can take me in without any trouble my dear child i am more than delighted to have you here there is a room at the back where you will be quiet we have only this one room for sittingroom and i think we shall find it best to go out every day to dinner that will not hurt us and george will come every eveningnow elsie you sit here and i will no i quite forgot you will pour out the tea yesi see i thought i was going to wait upon you altogethertherenow you will make a good breakfast andand dont cry dear child noathelstan she brushed away the tears it is nothing i shall be very happy with you but why are you not at home and why am i here oh it is too crueltoo perverse of them we had better have it out before breakfast thenstrawberries dont go well with tears do they nor jam with complainings come elsie why need you leave home because in two words they are treating george as they treated you i was younger then or i would have gone away with you treating george oh i understand they are pouring suspicion upon him well i saw that this was coming old checkley i swear is at the bottom of this yescheckley went to sir samuel with the case as he called it complete he has proved to their joint satisfaction that nobody could have done the thing except george assisted by you oh assisted by me yeswhile you were in california i suppose there is to be a warrant for your arrestyours and georgesin a few days they say hilda brought the news to my mother they both believe it and they want me to break off my engagement my mother refuses to see george so long as this charge as she calls it remains over him so i came away you did wisely wellany one may call up a cloud of suspicion and it is sometimes difficult to disperse such a cloud therefore we must do everything we can to find out who is the real criminalnow let us rest quite easy there can be no arrestor any chargeor anything but a fuss created by this old villain it is only troublesome to find ones own people so ready to believe why did you not tell me that you were home again pour out the coffee elsie and begin your breakfast i wanted to reserve the return of the prodigal until you came home after your honeymoon then i meant to call mysteriously about sunset before george was home i thought i would have a long cloak wrapped about me i should have begun madam you had once a brotheri hadthat is youon his deathbedmy brother deadthats youwith this packetoh we have lost a most beautiful little play how can i forgive you then they went on with breakfast talking and laughing until before the meal was finished they had lost their shyness and were brother and sister again after breakfast athelstan took a cigarette and an easychair now i am going to devote the whole day to you i have nothing to do for my paper which cannot wait till tomorrow all this morning we will talkthat is until we are tired we will have lunch somewhere and go to see the pictures george will come at about seven we will have dinner and go to some exhibition somewhere then we will get home and have another talk tomorrow i shall have to leave you to your own devices between ten and six or so i am very busy some days on others i can find time for anythingnow thats all cleared up i am to be your banker and everything not my banker athelstan oh you dont know i am a great heiress indeed how is that he asked a little twinkle in his eye mr dering told me when i was twentyone three weeks ago somebody has given me an immense sum of moneythirteen thousand pounds that is a very handsome sum who gave it to you that is a secret mr dering refuses to tell me i wish i knew i wouldnt wish if i were you gratitude is at all times a burden and a worry besides he might be a vulgar person without aspirates or aspirations much better not inquire after him thirteen thousand pounds at three and a half per cent means four hundred and fifty pounds a year a nice little addition to your income i congratulate you elsie and this evening we will drink the health of the unassuming benefactor the retiring and nameless recogniser of maidenly worth bless him and now athelstan begin your adventures tell me everything from the day you left us till now you cannot tell me too much or talk too long before you begin ask any questions about my mother and hilda that you want to ask then we can go on undisturbed i have no questions to ask about either i have already ascertained from george that both are in good health and that hilda has married a man with an immense fortune that is happiness enough for her i hopenow elsie i shall be tedious i am afraid but you shall hear everything he began it was such a narrative as thousands of young englishmen have been able to tell during the last fiveandtwenty years the story of the young man with a few pounds in his pocket no friends no recommendations and no trade athelstan landed at new york in this condition he looked about for employment and found none he hastened out of the crowded city he went west and got work in the business open to every sharp and clever manthat of journalism he worked for one paper after another getting gradually more and more west until he found himself in san francisco where he was taken on by a great paper which had now sent him over here as its london correspondent that was all the story but there were so many episodes in it so many adventures so many men whom he remembered so many anecdotes cropping up in this eight years history of a man with an eye a brain and a memory that it was long past luncheontime when athelstan stopped and said that he must carry on the next chapter at another time that pile of dollars that you made over the silver mine athelstanwhat became of them what became of them well you see elsie in some parts of the united states money vanishes as fast as it is made all these dollars dropped into a deep hole of the earth and were hopelessly lost she laughed you will tell me some daywhen you pleasehow you lost that fortune oh what a thing it is to be a man and to have all these adventuresnow athelstan considerif it had not been for your bad fortune you would never have had all this good fortune true yet the bad fortune came in such an ugly shape there has been a black side to my history how was i to tell people why i left my own country i could make no friends at the first appearance of friendship i had to become cold lest they should ask me where i came from and why i left home elsie was silent they carried out part of their programme they went to see the picturesit was eight years since athelstan had seen a pictureand after the pictures they walked in the park then they went home and waited for george who presently appeared then they went to one of the regent street restaurants and made a little feast after this elsie asked them to come home and spend a quiet evening talking about things by common consent they avoided one topic edmund gray was not so much as mentioned nor was the malignity of checkley alluded to they talked of old days when athelstan was a big boy and george a little boy and elsie a child they talked of the long engagement and the hopeless time when it seemed as if they were going to marry on two hundred pounds a year and of that day of miracle and marvel when mr dering gave to one of them a fortune and to the other a partnership they talked of their honeymoon and the tour they were going to make and the beautiful places they would see tours and blois chenonceaux and amboise angouleme and poitiers and la rochelle and of their return and the lovely flat where the friends would be made so welcome athelstan was a person of some sympathy elsie talked as freely to him as she could to george they talked till midnight then elsie got up whatever happens athelstan she said mindwhatever happens you shall give me away on the th now she has left us said george you may tell me why she refused to stay at home welli suppose you ought to know much for the same reason that i refused to stay at home they then chose to jump at the conclusion that at one step i had become from a man of honour a stupid and clumsy forger they now choosei am ashamed to saymy mother and sister chooseto believe that you and i together have devised and invented this elaborate scheme of forgery with this end in view it has been found necessary to contrive certain little fabricationsas that i have been living in london on my witsthat is to say by the exercise of cheateryfor the last eight years and that being in rags and penniless i persuaded you to join me in this neat little buccaneering job oh it is too absurd but i suspected something wellit is perfectly easy to put a stop to that yes it is easy at the same time it will be well to put a stop to it as soon as possible before the thing assumes serious proportions and becomes a horrid thing that may stick to you all your life you have got to do with a malignant manperhaps a desperate man he will spread abroad the suspicion as diligently as he can let us work therefore wellbut what can we do that we have not done how can we fix the thing upon checkley i dont know we must thinkwe must find out something somehow let us all three work together elsie will make the best detective in the world and let us work in secret i am very gladvery glad indeedthat elsie came chapter xix the whisper of calumny whispered words are ever more potent than words proclaimed aloud upon the housetop if the envious man from the housetop denounces a man of reputation as a thief a gambler a patricide a sororicide amicocide no man regardeth his voice though he call out with the voice of stentor people only stare these are the words of a madman or a malignant but whisper these charges in the ear of your neighbour whisper them with bated breath say that as yet the thing is a profound secret then that rumour swiftly flies abroad until every burgess in the town regards that man askance and when the time for voting comes he votes for another man and will not have him as beadle sexton verger schoolmaster turncock policeman parish doctor workhouse chaplain commoncouncilman alderman mayor or member of parliament and all for a whisper it was checkley who set going the whisper which at this moment was running up and down the office agitating all hearts occupying all minds the basis of all conversation king midass servant when he was irresistibly impelled to whisper dug a hole in the ground and placed his whisper at the bottom of that hole but the grasses grew up and sighed the words to the passing breeze so that the market women heard them on their way the kings ears are the ears of an assthe ears of an assthe ears of an ass the old and trusty servant of dering and son buried his secret in the leaves of his copyingbook here it was found by the boy who worked the copyingpress as he turned over the pages he became conscious of a sibilant malignant revengeful murmur who stole the bonds the new partnerwho forged the letters the new partnerwho robbed the safe the new partner here was a pretty thing for a pretty innocent office boy to hear naturally his very soul became aflame when the dinner hour arrived he told another boy as a profound secret what he had heard that boy told an older boy who told another still older who told another and so up the long official ladder until everybody in the place knew that the new partneractually the new partnerthe most fortunate of all young men that ever passed his examwho had stepped at a bound from two hundred to a thousand at leastthis young man of all young men in the world had forged his partners name robbed his partners safe made away with his partners property who after this can trust anybody but others there were who refused to believe this thing they pointed out that the new partner continuedapparentlyon the best of terms with the old partner they argued that when such things are done friendships are killed and partnerships are dissolved they even went so far though members of the great profession which believes in no mans goodness as to declare their belief that the new partner could not possibly by any temptation do such things and there were others who pointed to the fact that the whisper came from the boy of the copyingpress that he heard it whispered by the fluttering leaves and that it was imparted to those leaves by checkleyold checkleywhose hatred towards the new partner was notorious to all men not on account of any personal qualities or private injuries but out of the jealousy which made him regard the chief as his own property and because he had been deprived of his power in the officethe power of appointment and disappointment and the raising of screw which he had previously possessed checkley was dethroned therefore checkley spread this rumour others again said that if the rumour was really started by checkley which could not be proved seeing that like all whispers or rumours the origin was unknown and perhaps supernatural then checkley must have very strong grounds for starting such a thing thus divided in opinion the office looked on expectant expectancy is a thing which gets into the air it fills every room with whispers it makes a conspirator or a partisan or a confederate of every one it divides a peaceful office into camps it is the cause of inventions lies and exaggerations there were two parties in this officeone which whispered accusations and the other which whispered denials between these hovered the wobblers or mugwumps who whispered that while on the one handon the other handand that while they readily admittedso they were free to confesseverybody knows the wobbler he is really if he knew it the master of the situation but because he is a wobbler he cannot use his strength when he is called upon to act he falls into two pieces each of which begins to wobble and to fall into other two pieces of its own accord the whole process of a presidential electionexcept the final votingwas going on in that office of halfadozen rooms but in whispers without a single procession and not one german band and all unconscious of the tumult that raged about hima tumult in whispersa civil war in silencethe object of this was going on his way unconscious and undisturbed now however having learned that the old clerk was actually seeking to fix this charge upon him george perceived the whispering and understood the charge when he passed through the first or outer office in the morning he perceived that the clerks all looked at him curiously and that they pretended not to be looking at him and plied their pens with zeal on the stairs he met an articled clerk who blushed a rosy red with consciousness of the thing on his way to his own room through his own clerks room he felt them looking after him curiously as he passed and he felt them when his own door was closed whispering about him this made him extremely angry yet for a whisper one cannot suffer wrath to become visible that would only please the whisperers there is only one thing worse than to be suspected rightly it is to be suspected wrongly for the latter makes a man mad what that heeven hethe man of principle and rule should be suspected does nothing thenno amount of character no blamelessness of record avail is the world coming to an end george then shut his door and sat down to his table in a very wrathful and savage frame of mind and while he was just beginning to nurse and nourish this wrath coaxing it from a red glow to a roaring flame a card was brought to him i will see sir samuel at once he said it is as well that we do not hear the remarks of the clerks room and the servants hall the service in fact is a body of critics whose judgments would if we only heard them cause us to reconsider our selfrespect great philanthropist great statesman saintly preacherif you only knew what they say of youdown below the clerks as sir samuel deringhis face composed to the solemnity of a mutewalked into the new partners room whispered to each other hes going to finish him therell be a bolt tonighthe wont dare face it outhe have got a nervethe games up at lastthey wont prosecute you see if they do if it was one of us nowsir samuels come to warn himnow youll see with other exchanges and surmises sir samuel big and important coldly inclined his head and took a chair a few words he saida few serious words if you please sir pray go on george sat up and listened his upper lip stiffened he knew what was coming the thing which sir samuel proposed to say apparently became difficult he turned red and stammered in fact it is very difficult to inform a highly respectable young man in a highly respectable position that he is going to be charged with a crime of peculiar atrocity i am here he said after two or three false starts without my brothers knowledge this is a private and unofficial visit i come to advise my visit must be regarded as without prejudice is it not well to ask first of all if your advice is invited in such a case as this i venture to obtrude advice sir samuel replied with dignity there are occasions on which a man should speakhe is bound to speak you will remember that i was to have been your brotherinlaw you are to be my brotherinlaw well sir samuel go on i will hear what you have to say you are as no doubt you suspect and fear about to be charged in company with another with complicity in this long series of forgeries really i heard last night from elsie that there was some talk of such a charge now sir samuel a man of your experience must be aware that it is not enough for a foolish old clerk to suggest a charge but there must be some connection between the accused person and the crime connection good heavens there is a solid chain of evidence without a single weak point is there indeed well we will not ask for the production of your chain let us take it for granted go on to the next point i wish young gentleman i wish most sincerely for the credit of yourself and for the happiness of the unfortunate girl who has given you her heart that my chain was of glass to fly into a thousand fragments but it is not everything is complete the motive the tempter the conspiracy the working out the apparent successeverything complete the motivewant of money want of money well i was pretty badly off that cannot be denied go on you wanted moneyboth of youwanted money in ninety cases out of a hundred this is the causewanted money so you went and did it always the way in the citythey want moneyand so they go and do itgo and do it i see well we need not have the tempter and the rest of it they can wait let us go on to the advice just so what i came to say is this you are in a devil of a mess young gentleman the whole job is found out theres no use in trying to brazen it out best come down at once george nodded with as much good humour as he could assume under the circumstances down at once sir samuel repeated it is always best in the long run in your case there is every reason why a scandal should be avoided the thing hasnt got into the papers we are only yet in the first stage of finding out what has been actually stolen it has not been a case in which the police could help now my brother is not a vindictive man i for my own part dont want my wifes brother to say nothing of you convicted of forgery eh beastly thing to go down to the city in the morning and to hear them whispering thats his wifes brother in the papers today lagged for fifteen years fifteen years for certain it will be my fine fellow fifteen years for certain george repeated let me help you out of the mess dont make difficulties dont stick out your chin think of elsie george nearly lost his selfcontrolnot quite think of elsie he cried best not mention her name sir samuel if you please she would be heartbroken if it went so far if it stops short of that she will soon get over the little disappointment go on to the next point wellit is just this ill help you bothathelstan as well as youyesill help athelstan hang the fellow why couldnt he stay at camberwell who cares about him and his bad company if he keeps himself out of peoples way now then let me have back the money you havent drawn anything out of the bank give me the papers then ill square it with my brother i will advance you a hundred or two you shall go clear out of the country and never come back again and then though its compounding a felony well just put everything back again and say nothing more about it oh that is very good of you yes i know but i want to make things easy i dont want a beastly row and a scandal as for athelstan i shouldnt know the fellow if i ever saw him i hardly remember him but for you ive always had a liking until these little events happened very good indeed of you when the thing came out i said to lady dering my dear i said im very sorry for your sister because it will vex her more than a bit the engagement of course will be broken off but we must not have a scandal we cannot afford it we can nothe smiledwe are positively not rich enough only the very richest people can afford to have such a scandal i will try and get things squared i said for all our sakes that is what i said to lady dering now be persuaded do the right thing tell athelstan what i have told you the warrant for the arrest of the man edmund gray will be issued tomorrow i suppose or next day after that nothing can save you nothing can save me george repeated is that all you came to say sir samuel that is all a clean breast is all we ask then sir samuelgeorge rose and took a bundle of papers from the tablelet us find my partner you shall hear what i have to say ah thats rightthats sensible i knew that you would be open to reason come he is sure to be alone at this early hour come at once they went out together the clerks noted their faces full of business as we poetically put itmatters of buying and selling being notoriously of the highest importance conceivable evidently something very serious indeed had passed but the chief personage still held up his head game sir game to the last but there will be a bolt mr dering was in his usual place before the letters which were still unopened he looked ill worn and worried brother said sir samuel i bring you a young gentleman who has a communication to make of great importance is it about this case have youat last found out something the tone the words suggested extreme irritability i fear not you know i believe all that we have found out but now said sir samuel rubbing his handsnow comes the longexpected george interruptedwhat i have to say will not take long i hear from sir samuel that he and checkley between them have got up a case which involves me in these forgeries quite right said sir samuel involves you inextricably and that things have gone so far that i am about to be arrested tried and convicted which he rightly thinks will be a great scandal so it willso it certainly will he therefore proposes that i should make a clean breast of the whole business and give back the stolen bonds i am sorry that i cannot do this for a very simple reasonnamely that there is nothing to confess but there is one thing that i must do you placed the case in my hands i did i asked you to find out i have brought no charge against you have you found out mr dering spoke like a schoolmaster in one of his least amiable moods it is a very improper thing for a person accused of a crime to be engaged in detecting it so i resign the casethere are the papers you had better go to some solicitor accustomed to this kind of work stuff and rubbish cried mr dering sir you have deceived me sir samuels face was gradually resuming its normal length you promised to confess and you have not you as good as confessed just nowthis man is clearly unmistakably guilty he added turning to his brother i have not asked you my partner mr dering added more softly to give up the case i have heard what is said i have observed that the socalled case is built up entirely on conjecture nono said sir samuel it is a sound structure complete in every part and there is nothing as yet to connect any man with the thingnot even the man edmund gray quite wrongquite wrong said sir samuel in the city we may not be lawyers but we understand evidence i cannot choose but give up the case george replied consider already mrs arundel has requested her daughter to break off her engagement i am forbidden the house elsie has left her mother and gone to her brother no sirtake the papers and give them to some other person mr dering mechanically took the papers and laid his hand upon them let me remind you george continued how far we have got we have proved that edmund gray is a real person known to many we have not proved the connection between him and the robberies committed in his name he is apparently a most respectable person the problem before you is still to fix the crime on someone i shall be glad to hear that it has been successfully solved glad asked sir samuel you will be glad this is amazing eight years ago mr dering another man stood here and was accused of a similar crime he refused to stay in the house under such a charge that was foolish time has established his innocence i shall stay i am your partner the partnership can only be dissolved by mutual consent i remain mr dering laid his head upon his hand and sighed i believe i shall be driven mad before long with this business he said querulously he had lost something of his decision of speech well i will give the case to somebody else meantime look here tell me how these things came here the things were two envelopes containing letters they were addressed to edmund gray and had been opened one of them was georges own note inviting him to call the other was the letter from the manager of the bank asking for other references how did they get here asked mr dering again had you not better ask checkley george rang the bell i found these on the top of my letters checkley said mr dering you were the first in the room you put the letters on the table i found them on the top of the heap nobody had been in the room except you and me you must have put them there checkley looked at the envelopes and began to tremble i dont know he said i put the letters on the table they were not among them somebody must have put them therehe looked at the new partnersome friend of mr edmund gray between the time that i left the room and the time when you came i entered the room mr dering replied as you were leaving it observe said george that in the whole conduct of this business there has been one man engaged who has control of the letters that manthe only man in the officeis i believe the man before usyour clerkcheckley how came the letters here mr dering repeated angrily i dont know answered checkley heindicating georgemust have put them there the devil is in the office i believe how do things come here how do they vanish who put the notes in the safe who took the certificates out of the safe all you can do is to stand and accuse each other what good are youany of you find out find out yesterday there was a handbill about edmund gray in the safe the day before there was a handful of socialist tracts on the letters find out i say give the things to detectives said george let me take the case in hand brother sir samuel laid hands on the papers i flatter myself that i will very soon have the fellow under lock and key and then sirhe turned to georgescandal or no scandal there shall be no pityno mercynone george laughed well sir samuel in a fortnight or so i shall call myself your brotherinlaw till then farewell he left the office and returned to his own room the ripple of the laughter still upon his lips and in his eyes so that the clerks marvelled and the faith of those who believed in him was strengthened before then young crowing bantam cried sir samuel after him i shall have you under lock and key ah this was checkley the little interjection expressed far more than any words could do his satisfaction at the prospect then he left the room grumbling and muttering i believe that this business will finish me off mr dering sighed again and passed his hand over his forehead night and day it worries me it makes my forgetfulness grow upon me i am as good as gone this hour i cannot remember the last hour seei had breakfast at home as usual i remember that i remember setting out it is ten minutes walk from bedford row to here i have taken an hour and a half how i do not know what did i do last night i do not know and i am pursued by this forgerrobberdemon he puts things in my safeyesterday a placard that edmund gray was going to give a lecture on something or otherthe day before a bundle of tracts by edmund gray what do these things mean what can i do chapter xx he comes from edmund gray nothing said athelstan could possibly happen more fortunately we have turned whispering conspirators into declared enemies now you are free to investigate in your own way without having to report progress every day about this new business about the letters and the things in the safe said elsie it looks to me like diablerie checkley couldnt do it no conjuror in the world could do it there must be somebody else in the office to do these things they mean defiance the forger says seei do what i please with you i return your letters addressed to edmund gray i place placards about edmund gray in your safefor which nobody has a key except yourself find me if you can yes it is very mysterious a person on two sticks might manage it very likely he is concerned in the business or a boy under the table would be able to do it perhaps there is a boy under the table there must be mr derings table is like the big bed of ware i daresay fifty boys might creep under that table and wait there for a chance but perhaps there is only onea comic boy i should like to catch the joker said george i would give him something still more humorous to laugh at if there is no comic boyand no person on two sticks elsie continued we are thrown back upon checkley he seems to be the only man who receives the letters and goes in and out of the office all day welli dont think it is checkley i dont think it can be george you once saw mr dering in a very strange condition unconscious walking about with open eyes seeing nobody dont you think that he may have done this more than once what do you mean elsie dont you think that some of these thingsthings put in the safe for instance may have been put there by mr dering himself you saw him open the safe afterwards he knew nothing about it could he not do this more than oncemight it be a habit wellbut if he puts the things in the safethings that belonged to edmund gray he must know edmund gray for instance how did he get my note to edmund gray left by me on his table in grays inn that must have been given to him by edmund gray himself or by some friend of edmund gray yes that is quite certain come said athelstan this infernal edmund gray is too much with us let us leave off talking about him for a while let him rest for this eveningelsie put on your things we will go and dine somewhere and go to the play afterwards they did so they had the quiet little restaurant dinner that girls have learned of late to love so muchthe little dinner where everything seems so much brighter and better served than one can get at home after the dinner they went to a theatre taking places in the dress circle where given good eyes one sees quite as well as from the stalls at half the money after the theatre they went home and there was an exhibition of tobacco and soda water those were very pleasant days in the piccadilly lodgings even allowing for the troubles which brought them about athelstan was the most delightful of brothers and every evening brought its feast of laughter and of delightful talk but all through the evening all through the play elsie saw nothing but mr dering and him engaged in daylight somnambulism she saw him as george described him opening the safe closing it again and afterwards wholly forgetful of what he had done she thought about this all night now when one has a gleam or glimmer of an idea when one wants to disengage a single thought from the myriads which cross the brain and to fix it and to make it clear there is nothing in the world so good as to talk about it the effort of finding words with which to drag it out makes it clearer every storyteller knows that the mere telling of a story turns his characters who before were mere shadows and shapeless shadows into creatures of flesh and blood therefore in the morning she began upon the thought which haunted her athelstan she said do you know anything about somnambulism i knew a man once in california who shot a grizzly when he was sleepwalking at least he said so thats the sum of my knowledge on the subject i want to know if people often walk about in the daytime unconscious they do it is called woolgathering seriously athelstan consider george saw mr dering arrive in a state of unconsciousness he saw nobody in the room he opened the safe and placed some papers there then he locked the safe then he sat down at the window presently he awoke and became himself again if he did that once he might do it again well and then you heard yesterday about the letters and the placard and the socialist tracts now checkley couldnt do that he couldnt and he wouldnt well but mr dering could if he had that attack once he might have it again and again why he constantly complains of forgetting things but the letters yesterday were addressed to edmund gray how do you connect edmund gray with edward dering i dont know but my dear brother the more i think of this business the more persuaded i am that checkley is not the prime mover or even a confederate the same hand has doubtless been at work throughout if not checkleys aid to make that hand possible and successful who is there and look at the malignity with which he tries to fix it on some one else that may be because he is afraid of its being fixed upon him consider that point about the control of the letters the business could only be done by some one through whose hands passed all the letters checkley is the only person possible yes he understands that it makes him horribly afraid he therefore lies with all his might in order to pass on suspicion to another person you and george think him guiltywell i do not if i were trying to find out the man i should try a different plan altogether her brother had work to do which took him out directly after an early breakfast when elsie was left alone she began again to think about mr derings strange daylight somnambulism about his continual fits of forgetfulness about the odd things found on his table and in his safe all connected with edmund gray checkley could not have placed those letters on the table he could not have put those things in the safe elsie looked at the clock it was only just after nine she ran to her room put on her jacket and hat and called a cab she arrived at halfpast nine checkley was already in his masters room laying out the table for the days work as usual the girl was touched at the sight of this old servant of sixty years service doing these offices zealously and jealously she stood in the outer office watching him through the open door when he had finished he came out and saw her oh he grumbled its you is it wellhe hasnt come if you want to see mr dering its full early if you want to see the new partner he isnt come he dont hurry himself perhaps youll sit down a bit and look at the paper heres the times hell be here at a quarter to ten checkley sat down at his desk and took up a pen but he laid it down again and began to talk were in trouble miss no fault of yours i dont say it is were in trouble the trouble is going to be worse before its better theyre not content with robbing the master but they mock at him and jeer him they jeer him they put on his table letters addressed to the man they call edmund gray they open his safe and put things in it belonging to edmund gray were not so young as we was and it tells upon us were not so regular as we should be sometimes were lateand sometimes we seem just for a bit not to know exactly who we are nor what we are oh its nothingnothing but what will pass away when the troubles over but think of the black ingratitood missoh blackblack im not blamin you but i think you ought to know the trouble were inconsidering whos done it and all elsie made no reply she had nothing to say certainly she could not enter into a discussion with this man as to the part if any taken in the business by the new partner then checkley made a show of beginning to write with zeal the morning was hot the place was quiet the old mans hand gradually slackened the pen stopped the eyes closed his head dropped back upon his chair he was asleep it is not uncommon for an old man to drop off in this way elsie sat perfectly still at eleven oclock she heard a step upon the stairs it mounted it stopped the private door was opened and mr dering entered he stood for a moment in the doorway looking about the room now as the girl looked at him she perceived that he was again in the condition described by georgeas a matter of fact it was in this condition that mr dering generally arrived in the morning his coat was unbuttoned his face wore the genial and benevolent look which we do not generally associate with lawyers of fifty years standing the eyes were mr derings eyes but they were changednot in colour or in form but in expression elsie was reminded of her portrait that imaginary sketch was no other than the mr dering who now stood before her he closed the door behind him and walked across the room to the window then elsie lightly so as not to awaken the drowsy old clerk stepped into mr derings office and shut the door softly behind her the sleepwalker stood at the window looking out elsie crept up and stood beside him then she touched him on the arm he started and turned young lady he said what can i do for you he showed no sign of recognition at all in his eyes he did not know her can i do anything for you he repeated i am afraidnothing she replied he looked at her doubtfully then apparently remembering some duty as yet unfulfilled he left the window and unlocked the safe he then drew out of his pocket a manuscript tied up with red tape elsie looked into the safe and read the titlethe new humanity by edmund gray which was written in large letters on the outer page then he shut and locked the safe and dropped the key in his own pocket this done he returned to the window and sat down taking no manner of notice of his visitor all this exactly as he had done before in presence of george and his old clerk for ten minutes he sat there then he shivered straightened himself stood up and looked about the room mr dering again elsie he cried i did not know you were here how long have you been here not very long a few minutes perhaps i must have fallen asleep it is a hot morning you must forgive the weakness of an old man child i had a bad night too i was awake a long time thinking of all these troubles and worries they cant find out elsie who has robbed me he spoke querulously and helplessly they accuse each other instead of laying their heads together nonsense checkley couldnt do it george couldnt do it the thing was done by somebody else my brother came here with a cockandbull case all built up of presumptions and conclusions if they would only find out the trouble is mine as much as yours mr dering i have had to leave my mothers house where i had to listen to agreeable prophecies about my lover and my brother i wish with you that they would find out he took off his hat and hung it on its peg he buttoned his frockcoat and took his place at the table upright and precise yet his eyes were anxious they tease me too they mock me yesterday they laid two letters addressed to this man edmund gray on my letters what for to laugh at me to defy me to find them out checkley swears he didnt put them there i arrived at the moment when he was leaving the room are we haunted and the day beforeand the day before thatthere were things put in the safe in the safe oh but nobody has the key except yourself how can anything be put in the safe i dont know i dont know anything i dont know what may be taken next my housesmy mortgages my lands my very practice naythey could not is there anything this morning he turned over his letters apparently not stay i have not looked in the safe he got up and threw open the safe then he took up a packet again he cried almost with a scream again see this he tossed on the table the packet which he had himself only ten minutes before placed in the safe with his own hands see this thus they laugh at methus they torment me he hurled the packet to the other side of the room returned to his chair and laid his head upon his hands sighing deeply elsie took up the parcel it was rather a bulky manuscript the title you have heard she untied the tape and turned over the pages the work she saw was the autobiography of edmund gray and it was in the handwriting of mr dering she replaced it in the safe put everything there she said which is sent to you everything do you know anything at all about this man edmund gray nothing my dear child absolutely nothing i never saw the man i never heard of him yet he has planted himself upon me he holds his chambers on a letter of recommendation from me i was his introducer to the manager of the bankiin my own handwritingas they thought he drew a cheque of l upon me eight years ago and he has transferred thirtyeight thousand pounds worth of shares and stock to his own address added to which he has been the cause of suspicion and vile accusation against my lover and my brother which it will cost a great deal of patience to forgive dear mr dering i am so sorry for you it is most wonderful and most mysterious suppose she laid her hand upon hissuppose that i was to find out for you you child what can you do when the others have failed i can but try try in heavens name try my dear if you find out you shall be burned for a witch no if i find out you shall be present at my wedding you were to have given me away but nownowathelstan shall give me away and you will be there to see and it will be a tearful weddingthe tears came into her own eyes just to illustrate the remarkbecause everyone will be so ashamed of the wicked things they have said sir samuel will remain on his knees the whole service and checkley will be fain to get under the seatgoodbye mr dering i am a prophetess i can foretell you shall hear in a very few days all about edmund gray she ran away without any further explanation mr dering shook his head and smiled he did not believe in contemporary prophecy that young people should place their own affairstheir lovemakings and weddingsbefore the affairs of their elders was not surprising for himself as he sometimes rememberedand always when this girl with her pretty ways and soft voice was with himher visit had cheered him he opened his letters and went on with the days work as for elsie the smile in her eyes died out as she descended the stairs if she had been herself a lawyer she could not have worn a graver face as she walked across the courts of the venerable inn she had established the connection between mr dering and edmund gray it was he and nobody else who laid those letters on the tableplaced those things in the safe this being so it must be he himself and nobody else who wrote all the letters signed the cheques and did all the mischief he himself but how elsie had read of hypnotism wonderful things are done daily by mesmerists and magnetisms under their new name mr dering was hypnotised by this man edmund grayas he called himselffor his own base ends wellshe would find out this edmund gray she would beard this villain in his own den she walked resolutely to grays inn she found no she mounted the stairs the outer door was closed she knocked but there was no answer she remembered how george had found his laundress and visited her at her lodgingsshe thought she would do the same but on the stairs she went down she met an old woman so dirty so ancient so feeble that she seemed to correspond with georges account of her you are mr grays laundress she asked yes miss i am the woman looked astonished to see such a visitor i want to see him i want to see him on very important business most important to himself when can i see him i dont know miss he is uncertain he was here yesterday evening he said he should not be here this evening but i dont know look here elsie drew out her purse tell me when you think he will be here and if i find him i will give you two poundstwo golden sovereigns if you tell me right i will give you two sovereigns she showed them the old woman looked hungrily at the coins well miss hes been here every saturday afternoon for the last six months i know it by the litter of papers that he makes every saturday afternoon very good you shall have your money if i find him in the evening elsie said nothing about mr dering and her strange discovery the two young men talked about trying this way and that way always with the view of implicating checkley but she said nothing chapter xxi i am edmund gray on saturday afternoon the policeman on dayduty at grays inn was standing near the southern portals of that venerable foundation in conversation with the boy who dispenses the newspapers from a warehouse constructed in the eastern wall of the archway it was halfpast three by the clock and a fine day which was remarkable for the seasonaugustand the year the sun poured upon the dingy old courts making them dingier instead of brighter where the paint of the windows and doorposts is faded and dirtywhere the panes are mostly in want of cleaningwhere there are no flowers in the windowswhere there are no trees or leaves in the squarewhere the bricks want painting and where the soot has gathered in every chink and blackens every crannythen the sunshine of summer only makes a dingy court shabbier grays inn in july and august unless these months are as the august of the year of grace looks old but not venerable age should be clean and nicely dressed age should wear a front to conceal her baldness age should assume false teeth to disguise those gums stripped of their ivory it was felt by the policeman we want a washin and a brightenin in this old place he remarked to the journalist we want somethin younger than them old laundresses said the newspaper boy great is the goddess coincidence even while he uttered this aspiration a young lady entered the gate and passed into the inn ha breathed the policeman softly ah sighed the journalist she was a young lady of adorable face and form surpassing the wildest dreams either of policeman or of papermanboth of whom possessed the true poetic temperament she was clothed in raiment mystic wonderful such as seldom indeed gets as far east as grays inn something in gray or silver gray with an open front and a kind of jacket she passed them rapidly and walked through the passage into the square no said the policeman now who does she want at no whos on the groundfloor of right handarchitects and surveyors left handuniversal translators perhaps shes a universal translator they must be all gone by this time the first floor is lawyers theyre all gone too i saw the clerks march out at two oclock second floortheres mr carstone on the left and mr edmund gray on the right perhaps its mr carstone shes after i hope it isnt him hes a gentleman with fine manners and they do say a great scholar but hes a lushington and a sweet young thing like that ought not to marry a man who is brought home every other night too tipsy to stand or theres mr graythe old gentperhaps shes his daughter whats mr edmund gray by calling joe nobody knows he dont often come an old gentlemanbeen in the inn a long timefor years lives in the country i suppose and does no work lives on other peoples workmy workhonest working mens work said the boy who was a socialist and advanced ah theres something up about mr gray people are coming to inquire for him first it was a young gentleman very affable he wasand free with his moneymost likely other peoples money he wanted to know a good deal about mr graymore than i could tell himwanted to know how often he came and what he was like when he did comeand would i tell him all i knew he went to the old laundress afterwardsthen it was a little old mani know him by sightuses the salutation parlour of an eveninghe wanted to know all about mr gray too no halfcrown in that quarter though hes been spying and watching for himgoes and hides up the passage on the other side of the square kind of a spider he is hes watching him for no good ill bet perhaps the young lady wants to find out about him toojoe theres something up at no the old gentleman isnt in his chambers i believe shell come out again presently and itll be oh mr policeman could you very kindly tell me how i can find mr edmund gray with a shilling perhaps and perhaps not i wonder what she wants with mr edmund gray sometimes these old chaps break out in the most surprising manner joe if you ever go into the service youll find the work hard and the pay small but theres compensation in learnin things if you want to know human nature go into the force theres old mr langhorne up at the top so there is but no young lady wants to see that poor old chap hes got no friends young nor oldno friends and no money just now hes terrible hard up took a shillin off o me last sunday to get a bit of dinner with fine thingisnt it joeto be a gentleman and a barrister all your life isnt itand to end like that starvation in a garreteh look out she will be coming down directly but she did not come down two hours and more passed and she did not come down the visitor was elsie arundel she walked up the stairs to the second floor here she stopped there was a black door closed on the right of her and another black door closed on the left of her on the lintel of one was the name of mr f w carstone on the lintel of the other was that of mr edmund gray elsie knocked with her parasol at the latter door there was no reply the old laundress she murmured told me that saturday afternoon was my best chance of finding him i will wait she sat down with hesitation on the stairs leading to the third floorthey were not too cleanand waited she was going to do a very plucky thinga dangerous thing she had made a discovery connecting mr dering directly with this edmund gray she had learned that he came to the office in a strange condition perhaps hypnotic bringing things from edmund gray she now suspected that the only person who carried on the forgeries on mr dering was mr dering himself acted on and perhaps mesmerised by edmund grayand she wanted to find out who this edmund gray was she would confront him and tax him with the crime it was dangerous but he could not kill her besides he was described as quite an elderly man he was also described as a benevolent man a charitable man a kindly man and he wrote letters brimful of the most cheerful optimism yet he was carrying on a series of complicated forgeries she resolved to wait for him she would wait till sundown if necessary for him the place was very quiet all the offices were closed and the clerks gone most of the men who lived in the chambers were away out of town gone on holiday gone away from saturday till monday everything was quite quiet and still the traffic in holborn was only heard as a continuous murmur which formed part of the stillness the policeman who had now said all he had to say to the newspaper boy was walking slowly and with heavy tread round the court the inn was quite empty and deserted and still only overhead there was the footfall of a man who walked up and down his room steadily never stopping or ceasing or changing the time like the beat of a pendulum elsie began to wonder presently who this man could be and if he had nothing better to do than to pace his chamber all day long when the sun was bright and the leaves on the trees and the flowers in full bloom the clock struck four elsie had been waiting half an hour still mr edmund gray did not arrive still the steady beat of the footstep continued overhead the clock struck five still that steady footfall still elsie sat upon the stairs waiting in patience when the clock struck six the footsteps stoppedor changed then a door overhead opened and shut and the steps came down the stairs elsie rose and stood on one side an old man came downtall and thin closeshaven pale dressed in a black frockcoat worn to a shiny polish in all those parts which take a polisha shabby old man whose hat seemed hardly able to stand upright and a gentlemanwhich was perfectly clear from his bearinga gentleman in the last stage of poverty and decay he started surprised to see a young lady on the stairs you are waiting for mr carstone he asked he is out of town he will not be back till monday nobody ever comes back before monday from saturday to monday i have the inn to myself all that time there are no slammers and no strangers it is an agreeable retreat if only he shook his head and stopped short i am not waiting for mr carstone i am waiting for mr edmund gray he is very uncertain no one knows when he comes or whither he goeth i would not wait if i were you he may come today or tomorrow or at any time he comes on sunday morning often i hear him coming upstairs after the chapel bell stops he is a quiet neighbourno slammer or tramper i would not wait i say if i were you i will wait a little longer i am very anxious to see mr gray he should wait for you mr langhorne replied politely the stairs are not a fit restingplace for you this old inn is too quiet for such as you mirth and joy belong to you silence and rest to such as me even slamming does not i daresay greatly displease youth and beauty chambers are not for young ladies beauty looks for life and love and admiration they do not exist here run away young ladyleave the inn to the poor old men like me who cannot get away if they would thank youi must see mr edmund gray if i can it will not hurt me to wait a little longer you wish to see edmund gray so do i so do i you are a friend of his perhaps therefore you will do as well those who are his friends are like unto him for kindness of heart those who wish to be his friends must try to be like unto him young lady i will treat you as the friend of that good man you can act for him what can i do if i do act for him but there was a hungry eagerness in the mans eyes which made her divine what she could do it is saturday he replied without looking at her he turned away his head he spoke to the stairwindow tomorrow is sunday i have before this on one or two occasions found myself as i do nowwithout money i have borrowed of mr carstone and of mr edmund gray sometimes i have paid it backnot always lend mefor mr edmund grayif you are not rich he will give it back to youthe sum of five shillingssay five shillings otherwise i shall have nothing to eat until monday when mr carstone returns nothing to eat nothing at all to eat beggars in the street often make the same confession but somehow their words fail to carry conviction mr langhorne however did carry conviction the old man shook his head i had some food yesterday at this time since then i have had nothing there was neither tea nor bread in my rooms for breakfast when the clock struck six my dinner hour i thought i would walk along the street and look at the things to eat which are placed in the shop windows that relieves a little but tomorrow will be a bad timea very bad time i shall lie in bed oh i have gone through it before sometimeshe dropped his voicei have been sore tempted to take something nono dont think i have given way nono whyi should bedisbarred not yetnot yet elsie opened her purse it contained two sovereigns and a shilling or two take all she said eagerly take all the gold and leave me the silver take it instantly she stamped her foot he hesitated all he asked all can you spare it i can never repay take it she said again imperiously he obeyed he took the gold out of the purse with trembling fingers then he raised his rickety old hatwas that a tear that stole into his eyes or the rheum of old ageand slowly walked down the stairs holding by the banisters he was weak poor wretch with hunger but it was his dinner hour and he was going to have his dinner elsie sat down again it was halfpast sixshe had been waiting for three hourswhen other footsteps entered the house elsie sprang to her feet she turned pale her heart stood still for now she realised that if this step was truly that of the man she expected she was about to confront a person certainly of the deepest criminality and possibly capable of villainy in any other direction the steps mounted the stairs i really think that the bravest persons in the world are those who before the event look forward to it with the utmost apprehension they know you see what the dangers are elsie was going to face a great danger she was going to find out alone and unaided who this man was and why and how he worked these deeds of darkness the footsteps mounted higher from the door to the top of the stairs it took but a single minute yet to elsie it seemed half an hour so rapid were her thoughts then the man mounted the last flight of steps heavens elsie was fain to cry out for sheer amazement she cried out she caught at the banisters for before her taking the key of mr edmund grays chambers from his waistcoat pocket was none other than mr dering himself yes an elderly man of truly benevolent aspect his coat open flying all abroad his face soft gracious smiling and full of sunshine his hat just the least bit pushed back his left hand in his pocket elsie thought again of her portrait at home in which she had transformed her guardianand here he was in the fleshtransformed according to her portrait she stared at him with an amazement that bereft her of speech and of motion she could only stare even if her mothers voice were suddenly to call out to her that it is rude for little girls to stare she could not choose but stare for mr dering looked at her with that kind of surprise in his eyes which means what have we here to do with beautiful young ladies there was not the least sign of any knowledge of her he looked at her as one suffers the eyes to rest for a moment without interest upon a stranger and a casual passenger in the street he opened his outer door and was about to walk in when she recovered some presence of mindnot much she stepped forward can you tell me please how i could find mr edmund gray certainly he smilednothing easier i am edmund gray youyouedmund gray oh nono you cannot be edmund grayyou yourself all her beautiful theory of hypnotic influence vanished no mesmerism or magnetic influence at all you yourself she repeated youedmund gray assuredly why not why should a man not be himself oh i dont understand the world is going upside down i took youtook you for another person he laughed gently truly i am none other than edmund grayalways edmund gray my first name i can never change if i wished because it is my baptismal name the latter i do not wish to change because it is my name ancestral i asked becausebecausei fancied a resemblance to another person were you ever told that you are much like a certain other person no i think not resemblances however are extremely superficial no two living creatures are alike we are alone each living out his life in the great cosmos quite aloneunlike any other living creature however i am edmund gray young lady it isnt often that i receive a visit from a young lady in these chambers if you have no other doubt upon that point will you let me ask you once more how i can help you and will you come in and sit down oh it is wonderful she criedwonderful most wonderful again she controlled herself are you she asked again the same mr edmund gray who wrote the letter to the times the other day certainly there is no other person i believe of the name in this inn have you read that letter yesoh yes and you have come here to talk to me about that letter yesyes she caught at the hint that is why i cameto talk about that letter i came in the hope of finding the author of that letter at home he threw open the door of his sittingroom will you step in we can talk quite quietly here the inn at this hour on saturday is almost deserted he closed the outer door and followed his visitor into the sittingroom this he went on is the quietest place in the whole of london we have not in this square the stately elms of the old garden but still we have our little advantagesspacious roomsquiet always in the evening and on sundays a few rackety young men perhaps but for one who reads and meditates no better place in londonnow young lady take the easychair and sit down we will talk there are very few people who talk to me about my theories that is because i am old so that i have lost my friends and because my views are in advance of the world no man is so lonely as the man born before his time he is the prophet you know who must be stoned because he prophesies things unintelligible and therefore uncomfortableeven terrifying i shall be very glad to talk a little with younow allow me first to open these letters elsie sat down and looked about her she was in a large low wainscoted room with two windows looking upon the square the room was quite plainly but quite well furnished there was a goodsized study table with drawers a small table between the windows a few chairs a couch and an easychair and a large bookcase filled with booksbooks on socialism george had told her a door opened upon a smaller room there was probably a bedroom at the back a plain carpet covered the floor above the high oldfashioned mantel were two or three portraits of socialist leaders the room if everything had not been covered with dust would have been coldly neat the chairs were all in their places the windowblinds were halfway down as the laundress thought was propermillions of londoners always keep their blinds halfway downa subject which must some day be investigated by the folklore society the curtains were neatly looped it wanted only a bible on a table at a window to make it the front parlour of a dalston villa there were no flowers no ornaments of any kind mr edmund gray opened halfadozen letters lying on his table and glanced at them there were a great many more waiting to be opened all are from people who have read my letter he said they share with me in the new faith of a new humanity happy is the man who strikes the note of leading at the right moment happy he who lights the lamp just when the darkness is beginning to be feltyes young lady you are not the only one who has been drawn towards the doctrines of that letter but i have no time to write to all of them a letter makes one converta paragraph may make a thousand elsie rose from her chair she had decided on her line you have heard that her voice was curiously soft and winninga voice that charmsa voice which would soothe a wild creature and fill a young mans heart with whatever passion she chose to awaken she had besides those soft eyes which make men surrender their secrets part with their power and their strength did she know that she possessed all this powerthe girl who had no experience save of one mans love and that the most natural easy and unromantic love in the world when two who are brought up side by side and see each other every day presently catch each other by the hand and walk for the future hand in hand without a word yet delilah herself the experienced the crafty the trained and taughtcould notdid notact more cleverly and craftily than this artless damsel to be sure she possessed great advantages over delilahby some esteemed attractivein the matter of personal charm oh she murmured softly it is a shame that you should be expected to waste your valuable time in writing letters to these people you must not do it your time is wanted for the world not for individuals it is he repliedit is you have said it you are a mastera leadera prince in israela preachera prophet i ami am you have said it i should not myself have dared to say it but i am no one can doubt it who has read that letter be my mastertooas well as the master ofof all these people who write to you be your master he blushed like a boy could i desire anything better my father and my master she added with a little change of colour girls take fright very easily and perhaps this old gentleman might interpret the invitationwellinto something other than was meant yesyes he held out his hand she took it in her ownboth her own soft hands and bowed her headher comely headover it i came today thinking onlyoh delilahto thank you for your great and generous and noble words which have put fresh heart into me and now that i have thanked you i am emboldened to ask a favour anything anything you will be my masteryou will teach me let me in return relieve you of this work she laid her hand on the pile of letters let me answer them for you let me be your private secretary i have nothing to do let me work for you she looked into his face with the sweetest eyes and the most winning smile and her voice warmed the old mans ear like soft music ah circenow that i have seen youlet me be your disciple your most humble disciple andah sirenlet me be more edmund grayi cannot say mr graylet me be more edmund gray she laid her hand her softgloved dainty delicate hand upon his and it produced the effect of an electric battery gently handled let me be your secretary it was ten oclock before elsie reached home that evening and she refused to tell them even her own brother and her lover where she had been or how she had spent her evening chapter xxii master and disciple it was sunday afternoon in grays inn the new disciple sat at the feet of the master her gamaliel one does not know exactly the attitude adopted by a young rabbi of old but in this case the disciple sat in a low chair her hands folded in her lap curiously and earnestly watching the master as he walked up and down the room preaching and teaching master she asked have you always preached and held these doctrines not always there was a time when i dwelt in darknesslike the rest of the world how did you learn these things by reading books no i discovered them i worked them out for myself by logic by reason and by observation everything good and true must be discovered by a man for himself what did you believe in that old time was it with the rest of the world the sacredness of property perhaps he stood in front of her laying his right forefinger in his left forefinger and inclining his head my dear young scholar one who believes as i believe not with half a heart but wholly and without reserve willingly forgets the time when he was as yet groping blindly in darkness or walking in artificial light he wishes to forget that time there is no profit in remembering that time i have so far drilled and trained myself not to remember that time that i have in fact clean forgotten it i do not remember what i thought or what i said or with whom i associated in that time it is a most blessed forgetfulness i daresay i could recover the memory of it if i wished but the effort would be painful spare me the recovery of that part would be humiliating spare me scholar yet if you wishif you command oh no no forgive me elsie touched his hand he took hers and held it was it with a little joy or a little fear that the girl observed the power she already had over him i would not cause you pain besideswhat does it matter you know my child when the monk assumes the tonsure and the triple cord he leaves behind him outside the cell all the things of the worldambition love luxury the pride of the eyeallall he forgets everything he casts away everything he abandons everythingfor meditation and prayer the monk added the sage is a foolish person because his meditation advances not the world a whit i am like the monk save that i think for the world instead of myself and so spending days and nights in meditation i know not what went beforenor do i care it is a second birth when the new faith takes you and holds you together so that you care for nothing else oh childupon you also this shall comethis obsessionthis possessionso that your spirit shall know of no time but that spent in the service of the cause nay i go so far that i forget from day to day what passed except when i was actively engaged for the cause yesterday i was here in the afternoon you came we talked you offered yourself as my disciple i remember every word you said could i ever forget a disciple so trustful and so humble butbefore you came where was i doubtless heremeditating but i know not then there are things which one must do to livebreakfast dinnerof these i remember nothing why should i it is a great gift and reward to me that i should not remember unnecessary thingslow and common things why should i try to do so nono murmured the catechumen carried away by his earnestness best forget them best live altogether in and for the cause yetshe wonderedhow was she to bring things home to him unless he could be made to remember he was mad one hour and sane the next how should she bridge the gulf and make the mad man cross over to the other side the master took her hand in his and held it paternally we needed such a disciple as you he went on slightly bending his head over her among my followers there is earnestness without understanding they believe in the good time but they are impatient they want revolution which is terrific and destroys i want conviction there are times when a great idea flies abroad like the flame through the stubble but mens minds must first be so prepared that they are ready for it the world is not yet ready for my idea and i am old and may die too soon to see the sudden rise of the mighty flood when that doctrine shall suddenly cease in all mankind we need disciples above all we need women why do women i wonder throw themselves away in imitating man when there are a thousand things that they can do better than any man i want womenyoung beautiful faithful i can find work for hundreds of women hypatia would be worth to meto usfar more than he of the golden mouth childyour sweet voice your sweet face your sweet eyesi want them i will take them and use themexpend themfor the great cause it may be that you will be called upon to become the first martyr of the cause hypatia was murdered by a raging mob you will have against you a mob worse than any of alexandria you will have a mob composed of all those who are rich and all who want to be rich and all the servile crews at their command happy girl you will be torn to pieces for the cause of humanity happy girl i see the roaring shrieking mob i see your slender figure on the stepswhat steps where i hear your voice clear and high you are preaching to them they close in round you you disappearthey have dragged you down they trample the life out of you you are deaddeaddeadand a name for ever and the cause has had its martyr it was strange she who had offered herself as a disciple with deception in her heart thinking only to watch and wait and spy until she could see her way plain before her who knew that she was listening to the voice and the dreams of a madman yet she was carried away he made her see the mob she saw herself dragged down and trampled under their heels she shuddered yet she was exultant her eyes glowed with a new light she murmured yesyes do with me what you please i am your disciple and i will be your martyr if you please great and wonderful is the power of enthusiasm you see it matters nothingnothing in the worldwhat a man has to preach and teachwhether he advocates obi or telepathy or rapping or spirits who hide teacups in coat pocketsit matters nothing that there is neither common sense nor evidence nor common reason to back him if he only possess the magnetic power he will create a following he will have disciples who will follow him to the death what is itthis power it makes the orator the poet the painter the novelist the dramatist it makes the leader of men it made the first king the first priest the first conqueror come said mr edmund gray the time passes i must take you to my place they walked out together master and scholar the man who was mad walked carelessly and buoyantly his coat flying open one hand in his pocket the other brandishing his walkingstick his head thrown back his face full of light and though his words were sometimes strong always full of kindness now the sane man the man of lincolns inn wore his coat tightly buttoned walked with a firm precise step looked straight before him and showed the face of one wholly occupied with his own thoughts there was a man who was mad and a man who was sane and certainly the madman was the more interesting of the two this place said the master meaning grays inn is entirely filled with those who live by and for the defence of property they absorb and devour a vast portion of it while they defend it no one you see defends it unless he is paid for it your country your family your honouryou will defend for nothing but not another mans propertyno for that you must be paid every year it becomes more necessary to defend property every year the hordes of mercenaries increase here they are lawyers and lawyers clerksa vast multitude outside there are agents brokers insurers financiersi know not whatall defending property they produce nothing these armies they take their toll they devour a part of what other people have produced before they hand on the residue to the man who says it is his property ohbut elsie did not say this aloudif these words could only be heard in lincolns inn if they could be repeated to a certain lawyer from time to time she looked at him curiously how if he should suddenly return to his senses what would he think how should she explain mr dering you have been off your head you have been talking the most blasphemous things about property you would never believe that even in madness you could say such things no he never would believe itnever he could not believe it what if his brother sir samuel were to hear those words meantime the apostle walked along unconscious filled with his great mission oh heavens that mr deringmr deringshould believe he had a mission the master stopped a passing tramcar let us climb up to the roof he said there we can talk and breathe and look about us and sometimes we can listen on the seat in front of them sat two young men almost boys talking together eagerly mr edmund gray leaned forward and listened shamelessly they are two young atheists he said they are cursing religion there is to be a discussion this evening at battle arches between a christian and an atheist and they are going to assist they should be occupied with the question of the day they can not because they too are paid defenders of property they are lawyers clerks they are poor and they are slaves all their lives they will be slaves and they will be poor instead of fighting against slavery and poverty which they know and feel they fight against the unknown and the unintelligible pity pity they passed two great railway termini covering an immense area with immense buildings now said the sage there are millions of property invested in railways whenever the railway servants please they can destroy all that property at a stroke perhaps you will live to see this done but said elsie timidly we must have things carried up and down the country certainly we shall go carrying things up and down the country but not in the interests of property the tram ran past the stations and under broad railway arches called battle archeswhere the two young atheists got down eager for the fray always renewed every sunday afternoon with the display of much intellectual skill and much ignorance it is a duel from which both combatants retire breathed and flushed proud of having displayed so much smartness both claiming the victory surrounded by admiring followers and neither of them killed neither of them hurt neither of them a bit the worse and both ready to begin again the following sunday with exactly the same attack and exactly the same defence there are some institutionschristianity the church of england the house of lords for instancewhich invite and receive perpetual attacks from which they emerge without the least hurt so far as one can perceive if they were all abolished tomorrow what would the spouters do the car stopped again and two girls mountedtwo work girls of the better sortnot that is to say the sort which wears an ulster and a large hat with a flaming feather in it workinggirl dressed quietly and neatly they ought to have been cheerful and even gay for they were both young both goodlooking both nicely dressed and it was sunday afternoon warm and sunny yet they were not cheerful at all one of them was in a rage royal and the other her friend was in a rage sympatheticquite a real rage they were talking loudly on the kerb while they waited for the tram they carried on their conversation as they climbed the stair they continued it while they chose a seat and before they sat down without the least regard to those who sat near them whether they overheard or wished not to hearor anything they were wholly occupied with themselves and their rage and their narrative they neither saw nor heeded anyone elsewhich is the way that the angry woman has so i told heri up and told her i did yes i sez you and your fifteen hours a day and overtime i sezand your finesso as to rob the poor girls of their money and your stinkin little room as isnt fit for two let alone a dozenand your flarin gas i sez to choke us and poison usand your dinnersyah your dinners i sezfit for pigs and your beast of a husband comin round with his looks and his leersyou let my husband alone she sezhis looks and his leers i sez some day the girlsll take him out and drownd him head first in the gutter i sez and a good job too you didnt say all that liz asked the other admiringly my whats she say to that her beast of a husband and his looks and his leers did you really liz and her that jealous i did oh i let her have it for once she did have it then i took my money and i went offnever mind what she called me that dont matter she got the truth for once what do you make of this disciple asked the master it seems a quarrel between the girl and her employer these are the makers of property they are not the soldiers who defend it they are those who create it the girls are employed by the sweater who stands on the lowest rung of the ladder of property and steals the things as fast as they are made one of them has been turned out what will she do will she find another place i dont know what becomes of the young it is a difficult question no one knows some say this and some say that we know what becomes of the old when they are turned out they die but as for the young i know not you are young and you are a woman go among the young women who have been turned out and find for yourselffor the worldwhat does become of them they passed an immense churchyard with an ancient church standing in the midstthe churchyard now cleared of its headstones and converted into a beautiful garden after the modern fashion in which we have abandoned the pretence of remembering the dead and plant flowers and turf above their graves for the solace of the living why not let the nameless dead be remembered by the nameless dead their virtues if they had any may live after them in their descendants see said mr edmund gray moralising here they lie those who were soldiers of property and those who were slaves of property they are mostly the poor of their parish who lie in that garden no headstones mark their grave they were born they toiled for others to enjoy and they died is this the life that men should most desire nay said the disciple but there must be the strong and weakclever and dull there must be inequalities yes inequalities of gifts one man is stronger one is sharper one is cleverer than another formerly those gifts were used to make their possessor richer and more powerful the strong man got followers and made slaves the clever man cheated the dull man out of his land and his liberty henceforth these gifts will be used for the general good patience you shall understand all in good time he stopped the tram and they descended lying east of the hampstead road and camden high street and bounded on that side by the canalthe great space occupied by the midland and great northern goods depot by gasworks wharfs and railway archesthere is a network of streets very little known to any but the parish clergy no part of london is less interesting than this district it used to be called somers town but i think that the old name has almost died out it is about a hundred years old regarded as a settlement it possesses three churches at least two workhouses one almshouse and three burialgrounds turned into gardens it is also cheered by the presence of a coal depot many small industries are carried on in this quarter there are many lodginghouses the streets are rather grimy the houses are rather shabby the people are rather slipshod they are not criminals they are in a way respectablethat is to say tolerably respectable it is not a picturesque suburb dulness reigns it is a dull a dull a dismally dull quarter there are children but they lack mirth and young girls but they lack the spring of youth one would say that there was a low standard in everything even in the brightness of dress the place looks better in winter than in summer today the bright sunshine only made the shabbiness of the streets more shabby is your place here asked elsie yes it is hereyou wonder why i came here because the people here are not all workingpeople some of them are small employersthose of whom i spokewho stand on the lowest rung of the ladder and steal the things as fast as they are made and take toll and hoard up savings the workingman is generous and open to others compared with these people i planted my place down in the midst of them but you shall seeyou shall see it was like a dream elsie walked beside her conductor yesterday she made the acquaintance of this man for the first time she had never seen him before except in his sane condition he was a madmana real dangerous madmanstark staring mad he was taking her she knew not whereto some place among strange people she walked beside him without the least fear she who would have fled before the most harmless lunatic and she was going with him as his disciple george she said afterwards i do not know how it happened i could not choose but go with him i could not choose but to become his disciple he compelled me i lost my will i even forgot that he was a madman i gave up my reason and all i followed him and i believed all that he told me how did he get that power directly i left him i became myself again i perceived the mad enthusiast i saw mr dering caricatured and proclaiming foolishness but in his presence i was his servant and his slave here we are he said this is my place let us go in chapter xxiii the hall of the new faith the place as mr edmund gray modestly called it was a meek and unpretending structure the word is used advisedly because no one could call it anything else not an edifice not a buildinga structure it turned its gabled front to the street with a door below and a window above it was of gray brick with a slate roofa very plain and simple structure it might have been a primitive methodist chapelthe connexion are fond of such neat and unpretending places or a room belonging to the salvation army or one of those queer lecture halls affected by secularists and generally called the hall of science on the doorpost was affixed a small handbill announcing that every sunday evening at seven oclock an address would be pronounced by edmund gray on the subject of property on the same bill below the line of the principal title were suggestive subtitles thus property and its origin property and its evils property and its dangers property and liberty property and progress property and its decay the master pointed to the bill read it he said there you have my mission clearly announced no mistake about it a bold pronouncement which cannot be mistaken i make war against propertyi am the enemy irreconcilablethe enemy to the deathof property i am almost alone against the world for my followers are a feeble folk and without power all the interests all the prejudices all the powers all the intellect of the whole world are against me i stand alone but i fear nothing because the future is given over to me and to mineyeathough i do not live to see the day of victory he opened the door and elsie entered she found herself in a room about sixty feet long by twenty broad and loftya fine and goodly room it was furnished with a long and narrow table running down the middle and a few benches nothing else the table was laid with a white cloth and provided with plates of ham and beef cold sausages hardboiled eggs cakes toast muffins bread and butter marmalade jam shrimps watercresses and teacups in fact there was spread out a tea of generous proportions the room was half filled with thirty or forty people mostly young though there were some elderly men among them elsie remarked without surprise the decayed barrister of grays inn perhaps he was attracted as much by the loaves as by the sermon threequarters of them were young men elsie noticed that they were young men of a curious typetheir faces keen their eyes hard their manner aggressive they belonged to a church militant they longed to be fighting on the appearance of their preacher they flocked about him shaking hands and inquiring after his health at least therefore he had the affection of his followers my friends said the prophet i bring you a new disciple she comes to us from the very stronghold of property her friendsyet he had shown no sign of recognitionare either those who pillage the producer or those who rob the possessor on pretence of defending him she is at present only a recruit she comes to listen and to learn she will go home to remember and to meditate she is a recruit now who will be hereafter a leader the people received her with curiosity they were not of the higher classes to put it mildly and they had never had a young lady among them before two or three girls who were presentgirls from the dressmakers workroomslooked at her frock with envy and at her bonnet and her gloves with a yearning helpless heartsinking admiration to the young men she seemed a goddess unapproachable they stood at a distance men of the rank above them would have worshipped these young men only gaped such a girl had nothing to do with their lives apparently they had been waiting for the master for at the moment a stout woman and a girl appeared bearing trays with teapots and jugs of hot water which they placed upon the board mr edmund gray took the chair elsie began to feel like alice in wonderland she came to see a place she expected to hear a sermon or a lecture and behold a tea sit beside me said the master we begin our evening on sunday with a simple feast which i provide it is a sign of brotherhood every sunday we begin with this renewal of fraternity those who break bread together are brothers and sisters in the good time to come every meal shall be in common and every evening meal shall be a feast eat and drink with us my daughter so you will understand that you belong to a brotherhood try some shrimps miss said her neighbour on the right an elderly man who was a builders foreman history does not concern itself with what elsie took she found the meal very much to the purpose after a long afternoon of talk argument and emotion she was young and she was hungry the tea was good the things to eat were good the cake and toast were admirable elsie ate and drank and wondered what was coming next after a little she began to look round her and to watch the company there were now she counted fortyfive of themfortyfive disciples of mr edmund gray what had he to teach them the destruction of property out of the four millions of london fortyfive were found who wanted to destroy propertyonly fortyfive but perhaps all who advocated that step were not present her ancient prejudices whispered that this was a reassuring fact considering that the preacher had preached his doctrine for nine long years only fortyfive next to her the foreman began to talk to her of fourier and owen and a dozen halfforgotten leaders in the old experiments he had been a chartist in the forties he was a socialist in these the nineties but he confessed that before any real reform was attempted property must first be destroyed its the selfishness he whispered earnestly thats got to be torn out by the roots take that away and theres a chance for the world it never can be taken away till a man finds that he cant work no longer for himself and that he must work for all whether he likes it or lumps it dont give him the choice nor the chance i say take away property and theres neither choice nor chance left you hear mr gray upon that oh hes powerful what do they say naked we came into the world naked we enter into the kingdom of heaven theres a wonderful lot of fine things hangin to that you must wait till you hear mr gray upon that themekingdom of heaven to hear the parsons talk its away above the clouds not so its hereclose beside uson this earth all weve got to do is to put out our hands and reach it you may put out your hands as much as you like said one of the younger men but you wont reach it all the same property stands between at our place said a girl sitting oppositea girl of intelligent face pale and thinwe work from eight till eight and sometimes longer for twelve shillings a week i know what things cost and what they sell for i could produce enough to keep meah a good deal better than i live nowif i could sell what i made myselffor four hours work a day so i work eight hours a day not counting the dinner hour just to keep the boss and to make property for him my property it iswelli knowin here we say our property outside we say my property wheres your kingdom of heaven then if you reach out your hand ever so far so long as ive got to work to make somebody else rich lets destroy property and then we shall see a desirea foolish concealed desire born of prejudice seized elsie to argue for she perceived in the girls reasoning certain confusions and intricacies but she had the courage to suppress the inclination she refrained she was a disciple she must listen i am a slave like all the rest of us another young man remarked cheerfully my master owns me he can sell me if he likes only he calls it by another name he cant take a whip and lash me though hed like to because if he did id break every bone in his body for him but he can cut down the work and the money i do editing and reporting for a local paper thirty shillings a week the proprietor makes ten pounds a week out of it and im not allowed to tell the truth for fear of advertisers he added a few words not commonly heard in a place that looks like a chapel on a sunday evening elsie observed that their faces showed two variations of expressiononly two the majority of the company had the eyes of the dreamer the theorist the enthusiast they are soft eyes and in repose are heavy and they look through stone walls into space far awayspace where their dreams are realised and men and women live according to their theories in moments of enthusiasm and passion they become flaming fires these eyes belonged to most of those present the restthe minoritywere those who are angry and restless and eager for the practical application of the doctrine these want revolution they are impatient they feel for themselves the injustices and impressions which enthusiasts feel for others these are always resentful the others are always hopeful these want to convert the world at once with bludgeon and with gun the others are certain that before long the world will be converted by reason the one despairs of anything but force the other will have no force the one hates his enemy he would kill him if he could he has no words too bad for him the enthusiast on the other hand regards his enemy with pity and would at any moment welcome him forgive him andwellinvite him to a fraternal tea if he would only desert his ranks and come over and these are the two divisions in every party and such is the nature of man that there must always be these two divisions the fraternal tea finished the company cleared the tables everybody lending a hand perhaps as another sign or pledge of fraternity it was then nearly seven oclock the hour appointed for the address the door was thrown wide open for the admission of the world but there was no sign that the world took the least interest in the subject of property no one came at all elsie learned afterwards that the world outside the hall had long since grown tired of the subject on which mr gray had been preaching for nine years those who came to the tea were the inner circle of believers or disciples a small but faithful company to whose members there was rarely any addition at seven mr edmund gray rose to commence his address standing at the head of the table so that it was like an afterdinner speech outside the sun was hot and bright and the air clear within the hall there were the mingled odours and steams of longprotracted and hearty fraternal tea the air was heavy and the room dark when the master began to speak a young manone of the ardent and wrathful kinddrew out a notebook and took everything down all listened with respect some with rapt interest some noddedsome groanedsome said hear softlyto encourage the preacher and to show their adhesion to principle elsie sat at the right hand of the speaker his discourses moved her much less in this public place than in his chambers the persuasive voice was there but it did not persuade hermoreover she could not meet his eyes their magnetism failed to touch her so much the better because she could listen with cold judgment and watch the people my friends he began my brothers and my sisterswe are all long since agreed that the root of all evil the first form of disease the first fatal step that was leading to so many other mischiefs was the beginning of property we have proved that so oftenwe are all so entirely agreed upon this vital principle that we seldom and only on rare occasions find it necessary to do more than assume its truth that occasion however is the present when we have among us one who comes as a stranger yet a disciple one who has a mind open to the influence of reason one who is anxious to clear herself of the prejudices and absurdities in which she has been from infancy brought up let us therefore briefly for her instruction and for the strengthening of our own faith point out some of the arguments which support this position it is to us an axiom to the world it still requires proof and the world refuses to accept the proof because it is given over to the chase of the abominable thing he proceeded to parade the reasons which made his school regard property as the root of all evil the line which lie pursued was not new many men have pointed out before mr edmund gray the selfishness of mankind as illustrated by the universal game of grab others with equal force have shown that the protection of things causes an immense expenditure and a great shrinkage in things others have shown that it is the continual efforts of men to get without working the things for which others have worked that fill our jails and keep up an army of police we start with a false principle the master went on which has ruined the world and still keeps it down if there are to be rich men they must become rich at the expense of the rest they must be few and the poor must be many therefore the protection of property is the robbery of the poor by law we all know that in this place we have agreed so far a thousand times the rich can only become rich by robbing the poor they rob their land they rob their work they rob their whole livesand they are permitted and encouraged by the law shall we then change the law no it would be a work too vast shall we change the minds of men not by reason it is impossible by any argument so long as by law and custom they can still rob the producer of his work the only way is to destroy all property when men can no longer by any kind of thought get richer than their neighbours then they will cease to think for themselves and think for the whole community you will saysome one may objectthat some are not the same in strength of mind or of body there will be many then who will refuse to work at all and become burdens on the community we have thought of that objection at first there would be many such but not for long because we should kill them yes my friends he added with a smile of the sweetest benevolence for the good of the community it will be necessary without any sentimental considerations to kill all those who refuse to work all those who shirk their work all those who persistently do scamped and bad work they must die so the commonwealth shall contain none but those who are vigorous loyal and true for the restdeathif it means the death of a million who were once richdeath is the only escape from the difficulty which is so often objected it has been asked again how we differ from the socialists in this we would begin with no theories no constitution no code only let every man give all his strength all his heart all his mind to the good of the commonwealth without the least power of enriching himself saving moneyof course there would be no moneywithout the chance of getting better food and better clothes than the restand we may safely leave the world to take care of itself whymy brotherswhymy sistersshould we poor purblind creatures unable to comprehend more than a glimpse of that glorious future which awaits the world when property shall be destroyedwhyi sayshould we dare to lay down schemes and invent systems for that glorified humanity let us leave them to themselves they will be as far above us my brothers as we are already above the holders and the defenders of property elsie looked at the little gatheringfiveandfortywith a little smile they were then already far above the holders and the defenders of property and again she thought what if these words were heard in lincolns inn how then can property be destroyed at this practical question every one sat upright coughed and looked interested their preacher had often enough declaimed upon the evils of property he seldom spoke of a practical way perhaps the time had come there are my friends several ways they are already beginning to be understood and to be worked the irish and the politicians who wanted the irish vote have shown the world how to destroy property in land believe me that example will be followed it was an evil day for the holders of property when the government interfered between the landlord and his tenant that example will bear fruit elsewhere we shall see everywhere the owners of the land turned out and their places taken by those who work the land the next step is from land to houses why not with houses as with land since a beginning has been made it must be carried on but there is other property besides lands and houses there are companies with shares railways and so forth we have only begun to see what united labour can effectsince union of labour is in fact not yet begun when it is fairly started it will pay small respect to shareholders and to dividends when wages are paid there will be perhaps no dividend left at all in a single yearnay a single weekthe whole capital invested in all the companies will lose its value it will be so much wastepaper my friends we need not stir hand or foot to bring about this end it will be done for us by the workingman and by those who follow the example of ireland they will do it for their own selfish ends firstbutproperty once destroyed we shall never again allow it to be created ohhe warmed with his subject his voice grew more musical his face glowedi see a splendida noble sight i see the great houses in the country fallen to ruin and decay their contents are stored in museums the great palaces of the towns are pulled down the towns themselves are decayed and shrunk there is no property there is no one working for himself the man of science works his laboratory for the communitybut he has the honour of his discoveries the medical man pursues his work with no thought of getting rich there is plenty to go the round of everythingoh plenty of the best we can have what we like do what we like dress as we like teach what we pleaseprovided we work for the state if we refusedeath if we give bad workdeath it is the only law we shall have no lawyersno powerno magistrates oh great and glorious timeyou shall see it you who are youngyes you shall see itwhile iiiwho have dreamed of the time so longi shall lie low in the grave what matterso the time come and so the world rises free at last to follow out the destiny of a new and glorified humanity he sat down and laid his head upon his hand as one in prayer they remained in silence till he raised his head then the young man who had called attention to his slavery spoke there is perhaps another way he said which might do the job for us suppose the chemists were to find out how to produce foodfood of any kindartificiallyjust as good and as nourishing as if it was butchermeat or bread suppose it could be produced dirt cheapmost chemists things cost nothing then no one would need to work because hed have his food found for him if no one would need to work no one could get rich any more and if no one wanted to buy anything nobody could sell then riches wouldnt count and there you are lets get a chemist to take the thing up the conversation that followed struck out new ideas presently it flagged and one by one the people stole away the master and the disciple returned in the tram as far as grays inn the master fell into profound silence a quarter of an hour before the end of the journey when they got down elsie observed first that he buttoned his coat next that he put on gloves thirdly that he pulled his hat forwards and lastly that he ignored her presence he drew himself erect and walked away with firm and precise step in the direction of bedford row which is on the other side of grays inn he was once more mr edward dering i wonder said elsie how much tomorrow he will recollect chapter xxiv can he remember it was past ten oclock that sunday evening when elsie arrived home athelstan and george were waiting up for her again the mysterious appointment asked the former are we to know anything yetelsie shook her headnot tonight very good you look tired elsie i am tired thank you andand i think i would rather not talk tonight i will go to my own roomhave patience both of you for a day or two longer believe me everything is going well the only reason why i cannot tell you what i have been doing is that it is so strangeso wonderfulthat i have not been able even to shape it into words in my own mindwhat is today the st of august only eleven days yeteleven long days said george but also eleven short days i do not forget wellyou may both of you sit downgo about your businessyou need do nothing more as for me i think you will have to get on without me every evening this week but be quite easy the thing is done and with that nodding and laughing she ran out of the room it is done repeated george the thing is done which thing it is done repeated athelstan what is done how was it done who did it when was it done since elsie says it is done i am bound to accept her assurance presumably she has caught old checkley at south square in the very act never mind i am quite sure that elsie knows what she says in her own retreat elsie sat down to consider if you think of it she had a good deal to consider she had in fact a tremendous weapon an eightyton woolwich in her possession a thing which had to be handled so that when it was fired it should not produce a general massacre all those who had maligned and spoken and thought evil of her brother and her lover should she thought be laid prostrate by the mere puff and whiff of the discharge checkley should fall backwards and raise a bump at the back of his head as big as an egg sir samuel and hilda should be tumbled down in the most ignominious fashion just as if they had no money at all and her mother should be forced to cry out that she had been wrong and hasty she held in her own hands nothing less than the complete demolition of all this erection of suspicion and malignity nothing less she could restore to her brother that which he had never lost save in the eyes of his own people who should have been the most jealous to preserve it no greater service could be rendered to him and she could clear from her lovers name whatever shreds and mists had been gathered round it by the industrious breath of checkleythat humble cloud compeller you see we all have this much of zeus in us even in the compelling of clouds every man by the exercise of a little malignity a little insinuation and a few falsehoods can raise quite a considerable mist about the head or the name or the figure or the reputation of anyone womensome women that isare constantly engaged in this occupation and after they have been at their work it is sometimes hard for the brightest sunshine to melt those mists away to be able to clear away clouds is a great thing besides this elsie had found out what the rest had failed to find outand by the simplest method she had learned from the only person who knew at what hour she should be most likely to find the mysterious edmund gray and she had then waited on the stairs until he came no method more directyet nobody thought of it except herself she had done it as the result there was no longer any mystery the man who forged the first cheque the man who wrote those letters and conducted their transfer was as they all thought at first edmund gray no other and edmund gray was edward dering one and the same personand edward dering was a madman and this discovery it was which so profoundly impressed her there were no confederates there was no one wanted to intercept the post no one had tampered with the safe the chief himself had received the letters and conducted the correspondence alternately as edmund gray himself or edmund gray acting unconsciously for edward dering perfectly impossible perfectly simple perfectly intelligible as for the impossibility a fact may remain when its impossibility is established elsie was not a psychologist or a student of the brain she knew nothing about mental maladies she only said after what she had seen and heard the man is mad then she thought how she should best act to establish the identity of mr dering and edmund gray must be done it was the one thing necessary very well that could easily be done and in a simple way she had only to march into his office at the head of a small band of witnesses and say you wanted us to find out edmund gray i have found him and thou art the man he would deny it he certainly knew nothing about it then she would call upon her witnesses first athelstans commissionaire who declared that he should remember even after eight years or eighty years the gentleman who sent him to cash that cheque who is this man commissionaire that is mr edmund gray next the landlord of his chambers who is this man that is mr edmund gray my tenant for nine years then she would call the eminent barrister mr langhorne do you know this man he is my neighbour mr edmund gray and freddy carstone the coach he is my neighbour mr edmund gray and the laundress and she would say i have done for the gentleman for nine years hes a very good gentleman and generousand his name is mr edmund gray and the people from the halland they would make answer with one consent that is mr edmund gray our preacher and our teacher and she herself would give her testimony i have sat with you in your chambers i have heard you lecture in your hall surrounded by these good people and you are edmund gray the thing was quite easy to do she could bring forward all this evidence at once and it would be unanswerable and convincing even to sir samuel except for one thing which made it difficult the discovery would be a most dreadfula most terriblerevelation to one who believed himself to be the most respectable solicitor in the whole of london the most trustworthy the clearest in mind the keenest in vision the coldest in judgment he would learn without the least previous suspicion or preparation or any softening of the blow that for many years he had been what is there any other wordany kinder wordany word less terrifying or less humiliating by which the news could be conveyed to him that he had been madmadmad heavens what a word it is how terrible to look at with its three little letters which mean so much all the words that mean much are monosyllables godlovejoyhatefeargladsadmadbadhellhomewife childhousesongfeastwinekisseverythingthey are the oldest words you see they have been used from time immemorial by prehistoric man as well as by ourselves mr dering had to be told that he was mad somehow or other he must be told that it seemed at first the only way out of the difficulty how could this girl communicate the dreadful news to her guardian who had always been to her considerate and even affectionate she shrank from the task then she thought she would hand it over to her brother athelstan but he was far more concerned about clearing up the hateful business than about softening the blow for mr dering or of communicating it to george what should she do mr dering was mad not mad all the time but mad now and then sometimes every day sometimes with intervals this kind of madness i believe takes many formsa fact which should make the strongest men tremble sometimes it lasts a long time before it is found out sometimes even it is never found out at all solicitors and doctors tell queer stories about it for instance that storyquite a common storyof an old gentleman of irreproachable reputation a speaker and leader in religious circles a man enormously respected by all classes concerning whom not his bitterest enemy had a word of scandalyet after his death things deplorable things incredible things to be suppressed at any cost were brought to the knowledge of his lawyers at certain times he went mad you see then he forgot who he was he forgot his reputation his place in the world and the awful penalties of being found out he went down he lived among people of the baser sort and became an inferior man with another name and died without ever knowing his own dreadful record another of whom i have heard was mad for fifteen years yet the chief of a great house who all the time conducted the business with great ability he was found out at last because he began to buy things once he sent home six grand pianos another time he bought all the cricket bats that were in stock in a certain shop and another time he bought all the hats that fitted him at all the hatters shops within a circle whose centre was piccadilly circus and the radius a mile long after this they gave him a cheerful companion who took walks abroad with him and he retired from active business some philosophers maintain that we are all gone mad on certain points in that case if one does not know it or suspect it and if our friends neither know nor suspect it what does it matter there are also we all know points on which some of us are mad and everybody knows it there is the man who believes that he is a great poet and publishes volume after volume all at his own expense to prove it there is the manbut he ought to be taken away and put on a treadmillwho writes letters to the papers on every conceivable subject with the day before yesterdays wisdom there is the man who thinks he can paintwe all know plenty of men mad like unto these and we are for the most part willing to tolerate them considerations however on the universality of the complaint fail to bring consolation to any except those who have it not in the same way nobody who dies of any disease is comforted with the thought of the rarity or the frequency of that disease its interesting character has no charm for him nor is the man on his way to be hanged consoled by the reminder that thousands have trodden that flowery way before him to mr dering proud of his own intellect selfsufficient and strong the discovery of these things would certainly bring humiliation intolerable perhapsevenshame unto death itself howoh how could things be managed so as to spare him this pain elsies difficulties grew greater the more she pondered over them it was past midnight when she closed the volume of thought and her eyes at the same moment in the morning athelstan kissed her gravely do you remember what you said last night elsie you said that we could rest at peace because the thing was done well athelstan the words could only have one meaning could they i mean if you want me to be more explicit that the thing is actually done my dear brother i know all about it now i know who signed that first chequewho sent the commissionaire to the bankwho received the noteswho placed them in the safewho wrote about the transferswho received the letters and carried on the whole business i can place my hand upon him today if necessary without doubt with proofs ample proofs without the least doubtwith a cloud of witnesses my dear brother do not doubt me i have done it yetfor a reasonto spare one most deeply concernedfor the pity of itif you knewgive me a few daysa week perhaps to find a way if i can if i cannot then the cruel truth must be told bluntly whatever happens remember all the mischief the old villain has done the old villain oh you mean checkley of course whom should i mean nobodynothing brother if you bid me speak today i will speak no one has a better right to command but if thisthis personwere to die today my proofs are so ample that there could be no doubt possible yeseven my motherit is dreadful to say itbut she is so hard and so obstinateeven my mother would acknowledge that there is no doubt possible athelstan stooped and kissed her order it exactly as you please my child if i have waited eight long years i can wait another week another week then i shall at last be able to speak of my people at home i shall go back to california with belongings like other men i shall be able to make friends i can even if it comes in my way make love elsie do you think you understand quite what this means to me he left her presently to go about his work in the corner of the room stood her easel with the portrait the fancy portrait of mr dering the benevolentmr dering the optimistmr dering as he might be with the same features and the least little change in their habitual setting elsie stood before this picture looking at it curiously yes she murmured you are a dear tenderhearted kindly benevolent simple old thing you believe in human nature you think that everybody is longing for the kingdom of heaven you think that everybody would be comfortable in it that everybody longs for honesty before i altered you and improved your face you were justice without mercy you were law without leniency you were experience which knows that all men are wicked by choice when they get the chance you had no soft place anywhere you held that society exists only for the preservation of property oh you are so much more lovable now if you would only think soif you only knew you believe in men and women that is a wonderful advanceand you have done well to change your old name to your new name i think i should like you always to be edmund gray but how am i to tell you how in the name of wonder am i to tell you that you are edmund gray first of all i must see you i must break the thing gently i must force you somehow to recollect as soon as possible i must make you somehow understand what has happened she had promised to meet mr edmund gray at his chambers that evening at five he showed his confidence in her by giving her a latchkey so that she might let herself in if he happened not to be in the chambers when she called at five she would try then to bring him back to himself she pictured his amazementhis shameat finding himself in strange rooms under another name preaching wild doctrines it would be too much for him better go to mr dering the real mr dering and try to move him in his own office to recollect what had happened because you see elsie unacquainted with these obscure forms of brain disease imagined that she might by artful question and suggestion clear that clouded memory and show the lawyer his double figuring as a socialist she waited till the afternoon she arrived at new square about three two hours before her engagement at grays inn mr dering received her with his usual kindness he was austerely benignant i tried to see you last night she said untruthfully because the words conveyed the impression that she had called upon him nono i was i suppose i was out i went out his face clouded and he stopped yesyou were saying mr dering that you went out last night was sunday wasnt it yes i went outwhere did i go he drummed the table with his fingers irritably where did i go wherewhat does it matter nothing at all only it is strange that you should not remember i told you once before elsie he said i sufferi labourunder curious fits of forgetfulness now at this moment iit really is absurdi cannot remember where i was last night i am an old man it is the privilege of age to forget yesterday and to remember fifty years ago i was talking last night to an old gentleman who said much the same he has chambers where he goes to write he has a lecture hallwhere he preaches to the people mr dering looked at her in mild surprise what did she mean elsie coloured of course she said this has nothing to do with you how i spent the evening i know very well mr dering went on yet i forget that is the trouble with me my housekeeper will not give me dinner on sunday evening and on that day i go to my club i get there about five or six i read the magazines till seven sometimes i drop off to sleepwe old fellows will drop off you knowabout seven i have dinner after dinner i take my coffee and read or talk if there is any one i know about nine i walk home that has been my custom for many years therefore that is how i spent the evening of yesterdaybut you see i cannot remember it breakfast i remember and the church service afterwards luncheon i remember getting home at ten i remember but the interval between i cannot remember do you forget other things do you remember saturday afternoon for instance yesperfectly i left the office about five i walked straight homenonothat isnt right it was nearly eight when i got home i remember the dinner was spoilednoi did not go straight home perhaps you stayed here till past seven nono i remember looking at the clock as i put on my hat it was halfpast five when i went out five what did i do between halfpast five oclock and eight i forget you see my trouble elsiei forget perhaps i went to the club perhaps i strolled about perhaps i came back here there are three hours to account forand i have forgotten them all chapter xxv will he remember should she tell him she could not the way must somehow be prepared noshe could not tell him just soin cold blood how would he look if she were to begin i have found out the mystery you are edmund gray during the hours that you cannot recall you are playing the part of a socialist teacher and leader you are actively propagating the doctrines that you hold to be dangerous and misleading what would he say what would he feel when he realised the truth on the table lay a copy of the timesa fortnightold copyopen at the place where there was a certain letter from a certain edmund gray elsie pointed to it mr dering sighed again he said they persecute me now it is a letter addressed to edmund gray lying on my table now it is the bill of a pernicious lecture by edmund gray today it is this paper with the letter that appeared a week or two ago who brought it here checkley says he didnt who put it on my table elsie made no reply it was useless to test her former theory of the boy under the table as for the man who wrote this letter mr dering went on he bears the name of our forger and writes from the same address yet he is not the man of that i am convinced this man is a fool because he believes in the honesty of mankind he is a generous fool because he believes that people would rather be good than bad nonsense they would rather be stealing from each others plates like the monkeys than dividing openly he has what they call a good heartthat is he is a soft creatureand he is full of pity for the poor now in my young days i was taughtwhat afterexperience has only brought more home to methat the poor are poor in consequence of their vices we used to say to them go awaypractise thrift be soberwork hard by exercising these virtues we rose out of your ranks by continuing to exercise them we remain on these levels go away there is no remedy for disease contracted by vice go away and suffer thats what we said formerly what they say now is victims of greed you are filled with every virtue possible to humanity you are downtrodden by the capitalist you are oppressed make and produce for others to enjoy we will change all this we will put the fruitsthe harvestof your labour in your own hands and you shall show the world your justice your noble disinterestedness your generosity your love of the common weal thats the new gospel elsie and i prefer the old strange that a man should at one time hold and preach with so much fervour and earnestness the very creed which at another time he denounced as fiercely this man and such as he continued mr dering lifted out of his anxieties by that subject would destroy property in order to make the workman rich wonderful doctrine he would advance the world by destroying the only true incentive and stimulant for work invention civilisation association and every good and useful thing he would destroy property and then can he not see what would follow why these people do not know the very alphabet of the thing by property they mean the possession by individuals of land or money but that is only a part of property take that away and the individual remains and he has gotwhat you cannot take awaythe rest of his property by which he will speedily repair the temporary loss consider child if you can what does a man possess he has i say propertyall his ownwhich cannot be taken from him or shared with anotherproperty in his brain his trade his wit his craft his art his skill his invention his enterprise his quickness to grip an opportunity again he has his wife and childrensometimes a very valuable property he has besides his memories his knowledge his experience his thoughts his hopes his projects and intentions he has his past and he has his future he has or thinks he has his inheritance in the kingdom of heaven take away all these things bit by bit what is left nothing not even the shadow of a man not even a naked figure this elsie is property these things separate the individual from the mass and each man from his neighbour a shallow fanatic like this edmund gray thinks that wealth is the whole of property why i say it is only a part of property it is the external and visible side of certain forms of property take all the wealth away todayeven if you make ten thousand laws the same qualitiesthe same forms of propertythe same lack of those qualities will produce like results tomorrowdo you now understand child what is meant by property it is everything which makes humanity wealth is only the symbol or proof of society so organised that all these qualitiesthe whole property of a man can be exercised freely and without injustice i see said elsie gazing with wonder undisguised was this last nights prophet could the same brain hold two such diverse views you are surprised child that is because you have never taken or understood this larger view of property it is new to you confess however that it lends sacredness to things which we are becoming accustomed to have derided believe me it is not without reason that some of us venerate the laws which have been slowly very slowly framed and the forms which have been slowly very slowly framed as experience has taught us wisdom for the protection of manworking man not loafing lazy man it is wise and right of us to maintain all those institutions which encourage the best among us to work and invent and distribute by these forms alone is industry protected and enterprise encouraged then such as this edmund grayhe laid his hand again upon the letterwill tell you that propertypropertycauses certain crimesergo property must be destroyed everything desirable causes its own peculiar class of crime consider the universal passion of love it daily causes crimes innumerable yet no one has yet proposed the abolition of loveeh i believe not elsie replied smiling i hope no one willyet no but the desire for property which is equally universalwhich is the most potent factor in the cause of law and orderthey desire and propose to destroy i have shown you that it is impossible let the companies pay no dividends let all go to the working men let the lands pay no rent the houses no rent let the merchants capital yield no profit tomorrow the clever man will be to the front again using for his own purposes the dull and the stupid and the lazy that is my opinionforgive this sermon elsie you started me on the subject it is one on which i have felt very strongly for a long time in fact the more i think upon it the more i am convinced that the most important thing in any social system is the protection of the individualpersonal liberty freedom of contract right to enjoy in safety what his ability his enterprise and his dexterity may gain for him elsie made no reply for a moment the conversation had taken an unexpected turn the vehemence of the upholder of property overwhelmed her as much as the earnestness of its destroyer besides what chance has a girl of oneandtwenty on a subject of which she knows nothing with a man who has thought upon it for fifty years besides she was thinking all the time of the other man and now there was no doubtnone whateverthat mr dering knew nothing of mr edmund graynothing at all he knew nothing and suspected nothing of the truth and which should she believe the man who was filled with pity for the poor and saw nothing but their sufferings or the man who was full of sympathy with the rich and saw in the poor nothing but their vices are all men who work oppressed or are there no oppressed at all but only some lazy and stupid and some clever tell me more another time she said with a sigh come back to the casethe robbery is anything discovered yet i have heard nothing george refuses to go on with the case out of some scruple because oh i know the cause very cruel things have been said about him do you not intend to stand by your own partner mr dering to stand by him why what can i do you know what has been said of himwhat is said of himwhy i have had to leave home i know what is said certainly it matters nothing what is said the only important thing is to find outand that they cannot do they want to connect edmund gray with the forgeries and they are trying the wrong way checkley is not the connecting linknor is george you talk in riddles child perhaps do you think yourself that george has had anything whatever to do with the business if you put it so i do not if you ask me what i have a right to thinkit is that everything is possible that is what you said about athelstan yet now his innocence is established that is to say his guilt is not proved find me the man who forged that cheque and i will acknowledge that he is innocent until then he is as guilty as the other mancheckleywho was also named in connection with the matter mind i say i do not believe that my partner could do this thing i will tell him so i have told him so if it had to be done over again i would ask him to become my partner but all things are possible my brother is hot upon it welllet him search as he pleases in such a case the solution is always the simplest and the most unexpected i told him only this morninghe had lunch with methat he was on a wrong scentbut he is obstinate let him go on yeslet him divide a familykeep up bitterness between mother and sonmake a lifelong separation between those who ought to love each other most oh it is shameful it is shameful and you make no effortnone at allto stop it what can i do what can i say more than i have said if they would only not accuse each otherbut find out something mr deringforgive mewhat i am going to sayshe began with jerks the honour of my brotherof my loverare at stake say child what you please i think that perhapsshe did not dare to look at himif you could remember sometimes those dropped and forgotten eveningsthose hours when you do not know what you have said and doneif you could only remember a littlewe might find out more he watched her face blushing and her eyes confused and her voice stammering and he saw that there was something behindsomething that she hinted but would not or could not express he sat upright suspicious and disquieted tell me what you mean child i cannotif you do not remember anything you come late in the morningsometimes two hours late you think it is only ten oclock when it is twelve you do not know where you have been for the last two hours try to remember that you were late on saturday morning perhaps this morning where were you his face was quite white he understood that something was goingsoonto happen i know not elsieindeedi cannot remember where was i you leave here at five you have ordered dinner and your housekeeper tells me that you come home at ten or eleven where are you all that time i am at the club can you remember thinkwere you at the club last night george went there to find you but you were not thereand you were not at home where were you he tried to speakbut he could not he shook his headhe gasped twice you cannot remember oh trymr deringtryfor the sake of everybodyto put an end to this miserable conditiontry i cannot remember he said again feebly is it possiblejust possiblethat while you are awayduring these intervalsyou yourself may be actuallyin the companyof this socialistthis edmund gray elsiewhat do you mean i meancan you not remember you mean more child do you know what you mean if what you suggest is true then i must be madmad do you mean it do you mean it do you understand what you say trytry to remember she replied that is all i mean my dear guardian is there any one to whom i am more grateful than yourself you have given me a fortune and my lover an income trytry to remember she left him without more words he sat looking straight before himthe horror of the most awful thing that can befall a man upon him presently he touched his bell and his old clerk appeared checkley he said tell me the truth i always do he replied surlily i have been suffering from fits of forgetfulness have you observed any impairing of the faculties when a mans mental powers are decaying he forgets things he loses the power of work his old skill leaves him he cannot distinguish between good work and bad he shows his mental decay i believe in physical wayshe shuffles as he walks he stoops and shamblesand in his speechhe wanders and he repeatsand in his food and manner of eating have you observed any of these symptoms upon me checkley not one you are as upright as a lance you eat like fiveandtwenty your talk is as good and your work is as good as when you were fortydont think such things to be sure you do forget a bit but not your work you only forget sometimes what you did out of the officeas if that matters do you remember the case you tackled yesterday afternoon certainly do you tell me that any manforty years younger than youcould have tackled that case more neatly garn go long checkley went back to his office what did she mean by it then mr dering murmured who put her on to such a suspicion what did she mean by it of course its nonsense so reassuring himself he yet remained disquieted for he could not remember at halfpast five or so mr edmund gray arrived at his chambers the outer door was closed but he found his disciple waiting for him she had been there an hour or more she said she was reading one of the books he had recommended to her with the words of mr dering in her ears she read as if two voices were speaking to hertalking to each other across her she laid down the book and rose to greet him master she said i have come from mr dering he is your solicitor you told me assuredly he manages my affairs it is curiousi asked him if he knew youand he said that he knew nothing about you that is curious certainly my solicitor forfor many years he must have mistaken the name orhe grows oldperhaps he forgets people do you often see him i saw him this morning i took him my letter to the times he is narrowvery narrow in his views we argued the thing for a bit but really one might as well argue with a stick as with dering when property is concerned so he forgets does he poor old chap he forgetswellwe all grow old together he sighed it is his time today and mine tomorrowmy scholar let us talk the scholar left her master at seven on her way out she ran against checkley who was prowling round the court you he cried you ah ive caught you have i on saturday afternoon i thought i see you going into no now ive caught you coming out have i checkley she said if you are insolent i shall have to speak to mr dering and walked away theres another of em checkley murmured looking after hera hardened one if ever there was all for her lover and her brother a pretty nest of em and calls herself a lady chapter xxvi the lesson of the street child said the master it is time that you should take another lesson i am ready let us begin she crossed her hands in her lap and looked up obedient not a lesson this time from books a practical lesson from men and women boys and girls children and infants in arms let us go forth and hear the teaching of the wrecks and the slaves i will show you creatures who are men and women mutilated in body and mindmutilated by the social order come i will show you not by words but by sight why property must be destroyed it was seven oclock when mr dering ought to have been thinking of his dinner that mr edmund gray proposed this expedition now since that other discourse on the sacredness of property a strange thing had fallen upon elsie whenever her master spoke and taught she seemed to hear following him the other voice speaking and teaching exactly the opposite sometimesthis is absurd but many true things are absurdshe seemed to hear both voices speaking together yet she heard them distinctly and apart looking at mr dering she knew what he was saying looking at mr edmund gray she heard what he was saying so that no sooner had these words been spoken than like a response in church there arose the voice of mr dering and it said come you shall see the wretched lives and the sufferings of those who are punished because their fathers or themselves have refused to work and save not to be able to get property is the real curse of labour it is no evil to work provided one chooses the work and creates for ones self property the curse is to have to work for starvation wages at what can never create property if the worker should live for a thousand years of the two voices she preferred the one which promised the abolition of poverty and crime she was young she was generous any hope of a return of the saturnian reign made her heart glow of the two old menthe mad man and the sane manshe loved the mad man who would not love such a man why he knew how to make the whole world happy ever since the time of adam we have been looking and calling out and praying for such a man every year the world runs after such a man he promises but he does not perform the world tries his patent medicine and is no better then the year after the world runs after another man elsie rose and followed the master it was always with a certain anxiety that she sat or talked with him always she dreaded lest by some unlucky accident he should awaken and be restored to himself suddenly and without warningsay in his lecture hall how would he look what should she say seein this place for many years past you have in course of madness preached the very doctrines which in hours of sanity you have most reprobated these people around you are your disciples you have taught them by reason and by illustration with vehemence and earnestness to regard the destruction of property as the one thing needful for the salvation of the world what will you say now will you begin to teach the contrary they will chase you out of the hall for a madman will you go on with your present teaching you will despise yourself for a madman truly a difficult position habit however was too strong there was little chance that edmund gray among his own people and at work upon his own hobby would become edward dering they went out together he led herwhither it mattered not north and south and east and west you may find everywhere the streets and houses of the very poor hidden away behind the streets of the working people and the welltodo the master stopped at the entrance of one of those streetsit seemed to elsie as if she was standing between two men both alike with different eyes at the corner was a publichouse with swinging doors it was filled with men talking but not loudly now and then a woman went in or came out but they were mostly men it was a street long and narrow squalid to the last degree with small twostoried houses on either side the bricks were grimy the mortar was constantly falling out between them the woodwork of doors and windows was insufferably grimy many of the panes were broken in the windows it was full of children they swarmed they ran about in the road they danced on the pavement they ran and jumped and laughed as if their lot was the happiest in the world and their future the brightest moreover most of them though their parents were steeped in poverty looked well fed and even rosy all these children said mr edmund gray will grow up without a trade they will enter life with nothing but their hands and their legs and their time that is the whole of their inheritance they go to school and they like school but as for the things they learn they will forget them or they will have no use for them hewers of wood and drawers of water shall they be they are condemned already that is the system we take thousands of children every year and we condemn them to servitudewhatever genius may be lying among them it is like throwing treasures into the sea or burying the fruits of the earth waste waste yet if the system is to be bolstered up what help said the other voice the world must have servants these are our servants if they are good at their work they will rise and become upper servants if they are good upper servants they may rise higher their children can rise higher still and their grandchildren may join us service is best for them good service hard service will keep them in health and out of temptation to lament because they are servants is foolish and sentimental standing in the doorways sitting on the doorsteps talking together were womenabout four times as many women as there were houses this was because there were as many families as rooms and there were four rooms for every house as they stood at the end of the street and looked down elsie observed that nearly every woman had a baby in her arms and that there were a great many types or kinds of women that which does not surprise one in a drawingroom where every woman is expected to have her individual points is noticed in a crowd where one thinks the people should be like sheepall alike a splendid place this street for such a student as you should be my scholar the master looked up and downhe sniffed the air which was stuffy with peculiar satisfaction he smiled upon the grubby houses you should come often you should make the acquaintance of the people you will find them so human so desperately human that you will presently understand that these women are your sisters change dresses with one of them let your hair fall wild take off your bonnet shall i then be quite like them asked elsie like them master oh not quite like them not quite like them he said no you could never talk like them he walked about among the people who evidently knew him because they made way for him nodded to him and pretended such was their politeness to pay no attention to the young lady who accompanied him every one of them is a study he continued i could preach to you on every one as a text here is my young friend alice parden for instancehe stopped before a pale girl of seventeen or so tall and slender but of drooping figure who carried a baby in her arms look at her consider alice is foolish like all the alices of this street alice must needs marry her chap a year ago when she was sixteen and he was eighteen alice should be still at her club in the evening and her work in the daytime but she must marry and she is a child motheris he out of work still alice nodded and hugged her baby closer mr edmund gray shook his head in admonition but gave her a coin and went on now look at this good womanhe stopped before a door where an amazon was leaninga woman five feet eight in height with brawny arms and broad shoulders and a fiery furnace for a facea most terrible and fearful womanhow are you this evening mrs moss and how is your husband long is the arm of coincidence mrs moss was just beginning to repose after a row royal she was slowly simmering and slowly calming there had been a row royal a dispute an argument a quarrel and a fight with her husband all four were only just concluded all four had been conducted on the pavement for the sake of coolness and air and space the residents stood around the controversy was sharp and animated the lady bore signs of its vehemence in a bruise rapidly blackening over one eye and abrasions on her knuckles the husband had been conducted by his friends from the spot to the publichouse at the corner where he was at present pulling himself together and forgetting the weight of his consorts fists and solacing his spirit with strong drink how is my husband the lady repeated oh ill tell you ill tell you mr gray how my husband is oh how is he go look for him in the publichouse you shall see how he is and what he looks like she descended two steps still retaining the advantage of the lowest then describing a semicircle with her right arm she began an impassioned harangue the residents fled right and left not knowing whether in her wrath she might not mistake the whole of them collectively for her husband the men in the publichouse hearing her voice trembled and looked apprehensively at the door but mr gray stood before her without fear he knew her better than to run away the lady respected his courage and rejoiced in a sympathetic listener presently she ran down she paused she gasped she caught at her heart she choked she wept she sat down on the doorstep this great strong woman with the brawny arms and the fiery face and she wept the residents crept timidly back again and gathered round her murmuring sympathy the men in the publichouse trembled again mr gray grasped her by the hand and murmured a few words of consolation for indeed there were great wrongs such as few wives even in this street expect and undeniable provocations then he led his scholar away at the next house he entered taking elsie with him to a room at the back where a woman sat making garments she was a middleaged woman and though very poorly dressed not in rags the room was neat except for the garments lying about she looked up cheerfullyher eyes were bright her face was fineand smiled you here mr gray she said well i was only thinking yesterday how long it is since you came to see me last i mustnt stop working but you can talk this is a very special friend of mine said the master i have known her for ten years ever since i began to visit the street she is always cheerful though she has to live on sweating work and sweating pay she never complains she lives like the sparrows and eats about as much as a sparrow she is always respectable she goes to church on sundays she is always neat in her dress yet she must be always hungry ah said the woman youd wonder miss if you knew how little a woman can live upon oh but said elsie to have always to live on that little she is the daughter of a man once thought well to dohe was most respectable said the womanhe died and left nothing but debts the family were soon scattered andyou seethis street contains some of those who have fallen low down as well as those who are born low down it is misfortune lane as well as poverty lane to the third and fourth generation misfortune when it beginsthe reason of its beginning is the wickedness of one manstill persecutes and follows the family thank you miss said the woman and if you will come again sometimes oh you neednt be afraid no one would hurt a friend of mr gray so they went out on the next doorstep and the next and the next there sat women old and young but all of these had the same look and almost the same featuresthey were heavyfaced dulleyed thicklipped unwashed and unbrushed these said the master are the women who know of nothing better than the life they lead here they have no hope of rising they would be unhappy out of this street they bear children they bring them up and they die it is womanhood at its lowest they want warmth food and drink and that is nearly all they are the children and grandchildren of women like themselves and they are the mothers of women like themselves savage lands have no such savagery as this for the worst savages have some knowledge and these women have none they are mutilated by our system we have deprived them of their souls they are the products of our system in a better order these people could not exist they would not be allowed parents or birth the boy would still be learning his trade and the girl would be working at hers that little woman who meets her troubles with so brave a heart has been sweated all her lifeever since her misfortunes began she takes it as part of the thing they call life she believes that it will be made up to her somehow in another world i hope it will all these people said the other voice are what they are because of the follies and the vices of themselves and their fathers the boyhusband has no trade whose fault is that the rickety boy and the rickety girl bring into the world a rickety baby whose fault is that let them grow worse instead of better until they learn by sharper suffering that vice and folly bring their punishment you see the children continued the master and the mothers you do not see any old men because this sort mostly die before they reach the age of sixty those who are past work and yet continue to live go into the house the girls you do not see because those who are not forced to work all the evening as well as all the day are out walking with their sweethearts nor the men because they are mostly in the publichouse they are all handtomouth working men they live by the job when they can get any when they are out of work they live upon each other we hide this kind of thing away in back streets like this and we think it isnt dangerous but it is formerly the wreckage huddled together bred plagues and pestilences which carried off rich and poor with equal hand and so revenged itself in other ways the wreckage revenges itself still this kind of people said the other voice may be dangerous we have a police on purpose to meet the danger they would be quite as dangerous if you were to give them free dinners and house them without rent the class represents the untameable element they are always a danger to cry over them is silly and useless they walked down the street everybody knew mr edmund gray he had a word for all it was evident that he had been a visitor in the street for a long time he had the air of a proprietor he entered the houses and opened doors and sat down and talked his disciple standing beside him and looking on he asked questions and gave advicenot of a subversive socialistic kind but sound advice recognising the order that is not the order that should be all the rooms in this street were tenanted mostly a family to each in many of them work was going on still though it was already eight oclock sometimes it would be a woman sitting alone in her room like a prisoner in a cell stitching for dear life sometimes three or four women or girls sitting all together stitching for dear life sometimes a whole family little children and all making matches making canvas bags making paper bags making cardboxes all makingmakingmaking for dear life and the fingers did not stop and the eyes were not lifted though the visitors opened the door and came in and asked questions to which one replied in the name of all the rest it is an old old storyeverybody knows the slum people go to gaze upon it it is one of the chief sights of victorian london just as a hundred and fifty years ago it was one of the sights to see the women flogged at bridewell not such a very great advance in civilisation perhaps after all it is a hivethe place is swarming with life said the girl who had never before seen such a street life means humanity all these people are so like you my scholar that you would be surprised you would not be like them if you were dressed in these things but they are like you they want the same things as youthey have the same desiresthey suffer the same pains what makes your happiness foodwarmth sufficiency not too much work these are the elements for you as well as for them in my system they will have all theseand then perhaps they will build up as you have done an edifice of knowledge art and sweet thoughts but they are all like you and most in one thing for all women of all classes there is one thing needful these girls like you want love they all want love oh child they are so like you so very like youthese poor women of the lowest class so very like their proud sisters he paused for a moment elsie made no reply you see he continued they are so hard at work that they cannot even lift their eyes to look at younot even at you though they seldom see a girl among them so lovely and so well dressed one would have thoughtbut there is the whip that drivesthat dreadful whipit hangs over them and drives them all day long without rest or pause their work pays their rent and keeps them alive it just keeps them alive and that is all no more it must be hard to work all day long for another personif you come to think of it happily they do not think and all this grinding povertythis terrible work that one family may be able to live in a great house and to do nothing they are working said the other voice because one man has had the wit to create a market for their work his thrift his enterprise his clearness of sight have made it possible for these girls to find the work that keeps them if they would have the sense not to marry recklessly there would be fewer working girls and wages would go up if their employer raised their wages only a penny a day he would benefit them but little and would ruin himself they must learnif they canthe lesson of forethought by their own sufferings no one can help them as mr edmund gray walked into the houses and out again elsie went with him or she waited outside while he went in sometimes she heard the chink of coin sometimes she heard words of thanks the socialist whatever he taught practised the elementary form of charity possible only for those who have money elsie remarked this little point but said nothing what you see here said the master is the lowest class of allif one ever gets to the lowest level for my own part i have seen men and women so wretched that you would have called them miserrimiof all created beings the most wretched yet have i afterwards found others more wretched still in this street are those who make the lowest things those who can make nothing and have no trade and live on odd jobs and those who can neither make nor work but thieve and lie about i see all that but dear master what will your new order do for such people will it make those who will not work industrious it will give every producer the fruits of his own labour it will teach a trade to every man and find men work and those who cannot work it will kill or lock up until they die they shall have no children perhaps it will kill them all it might be better we will have no human failures in our midst that street is full of lessons all calling aloud for the destruction of property then the other voice spoke the presence of the human failure is a lesson always before usa warning and a lesson to rich and poor alike as he is so all may be none are so rich but they may be brought to poverty none so poor but they may be poorer so far from hiding away the wreckage it is always in our sight it prowls about the streets we can never escape it and it fills all hearts with terror it spurs all men to industry and invention and perseverance the human failure inspires a neverending hymn in praise of property elsies guide stopped to greet a woman whom he knew she had the usual baby on her arm she was a sadfaced woman with some refinement in her looks she was wretchedly dressed thin pale and dejected the same story yes sir its always the same she sighed hopelessly but he would work if he could get anything to do nobody will employ a man whos had a misfortune its hardbecause such a thing may happen to anybody its like measles my husband says he cant get drunk because theres no money thats my only comfort he gave her some money and she passed on her way her husband was a clerk mr gray explained who took to drink and robbed his employer his father was a barrister who died young his grandfather was a wellknownalmost a great lawyer i know the whole family history i learned it he stopped for a moment as if his memory suddenly failed himsomehowa long time ago it is a story which shows how our sins and follies fall upon our own children this family sprang from the gutter first the working man then his son the shopkeeper then his grandson who became a great lawyer then his greatgrandson not so great a lawyer he you see is the first of the family who begins life as a gentleman and is brought up among gentlemen he inherited money he had a practice he married in the class called gentle and had children but he lost all his money and in despair he killed himself cousinly affection is a cold thing at best it helped the widow to a pittance and sent her boys to a cheap school at fifteen they had to take whatever employment they could get observe that this branch of the family was now going downhill very fast the future of a boy who has been taught no trade and has entered no profession is black indeed one of the boys went out to new zealand which has little to give a friendless boy another enlisted served three years and has never got any work since i believe he carries boards about the street another became a tenthrate actor and now starves on fifteen shillings a week paid irregularly anotherthe youngestwas put into a merchants office he rose to a hundred and twenty pounds a year he married a girl of the clerkly classthat woman you saw he took to drink he embezzled his masters money he went to prison he is now hopelessly ruined he cannot get any lower in the social scale what will his children do they have no friends they will grow up like the children around them they will join the hopeless casuals they will be hewers of wood property my child propertyhas done this he stole in our society nobody will be tempted to steal he drankwith us he would be kept judiciously under control until he could be trusted again that would be the care of the state he is another victim of property when his grandfather was framing acts of parliament for the protection of property he did not dream that he was making another engine for the oppression of his grandchildren said the other voice we rise by our virtues we sink by our vices let these people suffer their sufferings should make the rest of us wiser teach the children to rise again as their greatgrandfather rose do not contend against the great law which metes out suffering in return for vice those continued the socialist professor who do most to make a few men rich are the real enemies of what they suppose themselves to be defending given a thousand women sweated for one man and there presently arises indignation either among the women or among the bystanders from indignation we get revolution because the employer never gives way he cannot he would lose if he did his wealth which is his heaven if you divide the thousand women into companies of ten each company under its own sweater and all the sweaters under other sweaters you make a hierarchy of sweaters culminating in one at the top that was the old state of things the man at the top was a chief a patriarch he knew his people he sweated them but kindly he tossed them crumbs he looked after the sick and the old now all this is changing the old family tiesuch as it wasis dissolved the man at the top has disappeared a board of directors has taken his place there is nothing left but the board and its employees the men who work are no longer interested in the business of the firm except so far as their pay is concerned their pay will go up and the dividends will go down and with every increase of wages so much property is destroyed let every thingeverythingbe turned into companies to help the destruction of property said the other voice property is strengthened by being diffused companies organise labour they give capital its proper power they are not easily intimidated they interest all who can save anything let us turn into companies every industrial and distributive business in the country all times of change the master went on are times of interest we are living at a time when great changes are impendingthe greatest changes possible before great changes there is always a period of unconscious preparation the minds of people are being trained without any perception of the fact old ideas are dying out and new ones are coming into existence when the revolution actually arrives everybody is ready for it and nobody is surprised it was so with the reformation for a hundred years and more the idea of the great revolt had been slowly growing in mens minds when it came at last there was no surprise and there were few regrets for a hundred years and more the ideas of the french revolution had been talked about by philosophers these ideas sank down among the people nobody was surprised not even the nobles themselves when the end came so with our revolution it is comingit is comingits ideas are no longer timidly advancedhere and thereby a fanatic here or a philosopher there they are lying in the hearts of the people ready to spur them into action they are helping on the cause by successive steps every one of which means nothing less than the abolition of property these things are new to you child you were only born yesterday or the day before i was born a hundred years ago or thereabouts consider againhe leaned against a lamppost for greater ease and discoursed as one addressing an audienceconsider i say this great question of companies and their results formerly one man made things which he took to marketsold or exchanged and went home again he by himself did everything then one man made and another man sold the next improvement was for twenty men to work for one to receive and to collect their work and for another to sell it in this way the twenty remained poor and the two became rich so they went on and trade flourished and the twenty producers more and more fell into the power of the two who were now very rich and strong now the merchants are forming themselves into companies and the companies are amalgamating with each other and the small people may contemplate ruin for thesenow merchants shopkeepers manufacturers workmenthere will be nothing but service in the companies no possibility of acquiring property nothing but service all their lives now do you see how that helps the cause they will become accustomed to work but not for themselves they will grow accustomed to work for a bare living and no more they wont like either but they will ask why the second should go with the first the two great obstacles to socialism will be removed theneither the step i spoke of just nowthe abolition of the dividendsor which is just as likely a revolution when the servants of the companies shall make the state take over all and work them for the good of all some there are who think that the workman will have hope and power for union crushed out of him i think not but if sowoe to the rich the jacquerie and the french revolution will be spoken of as mild ebullitions of popular feeling compared with what will happen then but i think not i do not believe that the working man will sink again he has got up so far but he needs must climb higher you think it would be impossibleby this time a small crowd had got round them but the speaker still addressed his disciple as if no one else at all was listeningfor the state to take over the great producing and distributing companies but it has been done already the state has the post and the telegraph services they will deal with railways steamers coaches cabs omnibuses trams canals water gas electric light breweries bakeries factories shops just as they have dealt with these two the state can take it all the state will take the management of all but you say the shares of the company will become funds they will and the funds will pay interestbut the interest will become rapidly lower and lower so that what was once five per cent is now but two and a half and before long shall be twoone and a halfoneand nothing at all there will be no cry of spoliation because the holders of stock will be forced gradually into looking more and more to their own efforts and because widows and sick people and old people to whom the stocks were once so useful will be all provided for by the state as a matter of right and without any of the old humiliation of pauperdom pauper oh heavenly word child in the world of the futurethe world which you will help to mould we shall all be paupersevery one he spoke with fine enthusiasm his face lit up his eyes bright the girl was almost carried away until the other voice began coldly and judicially nothing is so good for man as to be ruled and kept in discipline service and subjection it is a foolish and a mischievous dream which supposes all men eager for advance the mass of mankind asks for no advancement it loves nothing and desires nothing but the gratification of the animal give it plenty of animalism and it is satisfied that condition of society which keeps the mass down and provides for the rise of the ambitious few is the only condition which is reasonable and stable base your social order on the inertness of the mass make the workman do a good days work pay him enough so that he shall have some of the comforts he desires educate the clever boy and make him foreman headman manager or artist journalist dramatist novelist give him the taste for wealth let him have some then he too will be ready to fight if necessary in the army of order while the other voice was speaking there came slouching around the corner into the street where he held the fifthperhaps the tenth part of a room a really excellent specimen of the common or london thief the habitual criminal he was a young manthe habitual criminal is generally young because in middle and elderly life he is doing long sentenceshe had a furtive look such as that with which the jackal sallies forth on nocturnal adventures he had a short slight figure a stooping and slouching gait and narrow shoulders his eyes were bright but too close together his mouth was too large and his jowl too heavy his face was pale his hair was still short though growing rapidly his hands were pendulous his round hat was too big for his little head he wore a long loose overcoat his face his figure his look proclaimed aloud what he was he stopped at the corner and looked at the little crowd everybody for different reasons is attracted by a crowd professionals sometimes find in crowds golden opportunities this crowd however was already dispersing the speaker had stopped perhaps they had heard other and more fervid orators on the socialist side perhaps they were not in the least interested in the subject you see it is very difficult to get the handtomouth class interested in anything except those two organs this street said the master observing him with professional interest is fullreally fullof wealth for the observer here is a case nowan instructive though a common case the fellow was turning away disappointed perhaps at the melting of the crowd and any little hope he might have based upon their pockets my friendhe heard himself called and looked round suspiciouslyyou would like perhaps to earn a shilling honestly for once he turned slowly at the sight of the coin held up before him his sharp eyes darted right and left to see what chance there might be of a grab and a bolt apparently he decided against this method of earning the shilling what for he asked by answering a few questions where were you born i dunno where were you brought up herein this street very well you went to school with the other children you were taught certain subjects up to a certain standard what trade were you taught i wasnt taught no trade your father was i believe a thiefthe lad noddedand your mother toohe nodded again and grinnedand you yourself and your brothers and sisters are all in the same line i supposehe nodded and grinned againhere is your shilling the fellow took it and shambled away fathermotherthe whole family live by stealing where there is no property there can be no theft in our world such a creature would be impossible he could not be born such parents as his could not exist with us he could not be developed there would be no surroundings that would make such a development possible he would be what i believe men of science call a sport he would be a deformity we should put him in a hospital and keep him there until he died in that world said the other voice there would be deformities of even a worse kind than thisthe deformities of hypocrisy and shams by a thousand shifts and lies and dishonesties the work of the world would be shifted on the shoulders of the weak the strong man has always used his strength to make the weak man work for him and he always will the destruction of property would be followed by the birth of property on the very selfsame day there is the power of creationof inventionwhich is also a kind of property laws cannot destroy that power laws cannot make men industrious laws cannot make the strong man work for the weak laws cannot prevent the clever man from taking advantage of the stupid man when all the failuresall the deformitieshave been killed off the able man will still prey upon the dullwitted better let the poor wretch live out his miserable life driven from prison to prison an example for all the world to see it was at this point that elsie discovered the loss of her purse her pocket had been picked by one of the intelligent listeners in the crowd she cried out on finding what had happened in the unphilosophic surprise and indignation with which this quite common accident is always received child said the master when there is no longer any property money will vanish there will be no purses even the pocket will disappear because there will no longer be any use for a pocketdid the purse contain much suppose you had nothing to lose and nothing to gain think of the lightness of heart the sunshine on all faces which would follow i fear you are rich child i have observed little signs about you which denote riches your gloves are neat and good your dress seems costly better far if you had nothing master if i were like that girl on the other side would you like me better could i be more useful to the cause if i dressed like her the girl was of the common typethey really do seem at first all alikewho had on an ulster and a hat with a feather and broken boots if i were like her elsie went on i should be ignorantand obliged to give the whole day to work so that i should be useless to youand my manners would be rough and my language coarse it is because i am not poor that i am what i am the day for poverty is not come yet dear master in the future dear child there shall be no poverty and no riches to have nothing will be the common lot to have all will be the common inheritance oh there will be differences men shall be as unlike then as now we shall not all desire the same things you and such as you will desire art of every kind you shall have what you desire in our world as in this like will to like you shall have the use for yourselves of pictures of musical instruments of everything that you want the rest of the world will not want these things if they do more can be made you shall have dainty foodthe rest of the world will always like coarse and common fare think not that we shall level up or level down all will be left to rise or to sink only they shall not starve they shall not thieve they shall not be sweated oh i know they paint our society as attempts to make all equal and they think that we expect men no longer to desire the good things in the world they will desire themthey will hunger after thembut there will be enough for all the man who is contented with a dinner of herbs may go to a carthusian convent which is his place for we shall have no place for him in a world which recognises all good gifts and assigns to every man his share then spoke the other voice but sadly dreams dreams there are not enough of the good things to go roundgood things would become less instead of more without the spur there is no work without the desire of creating property all that is worth anything in life will perishall but the things that are lowest and the meanest and the commonest men will not work unless they must by necessity alone can the finest work be ordered and executed as men have been so will men always be the thing that hath been that shall be again you have learned some of the lessons of poverty lane scholar said the masterlet us now go home chapter xxvii i know the man another evening of mystery elsie said athelstan yes another and perhaps another but we are getting to an end i shall be able to tell you all today or tomorrow the thing is becoming too great for me alone you shall tell us when you please meantime nothing new has been found out i believe checkley still glares george tells me but the opinion of the clerks seems on the whole more favourable he believes than it was of that however he is not perhaps a good judge they shall all be turned out cried elsie how dare they so much as to discuss my sister it is a very remarkable thing and a thing little understood but it is a true thing people peopleclerks and le service generallyare distinctly a branch of the great human tribe they are anthropoid therefore they are curious and prying and suspicious they have our own faults my dear all day elsie felt drawn as with ropes to mr derings office was it possible that after that long evening among the lessons of poverty lane he should remember nothing how was she to get at himhow was she to make him understand or believe what he had done could she make the sane man remember the actions and words of the insane man could she make the insane man do something which would absolutely identify him with the sane man she could always array her witnesses but she wanted more she wanted to bring mr dering himself to understand that he was mr edmund gray she made an excuse for calling upon him it was in the afternoon about four that she called she found him looking aged his face lined his cheek pale his eyes anxious this business worries me he said day and night it is with me i am persecuted and haunted with this edmund gray his tracts are put into my pockets his papers into my safe he laughs at me he defies me to find him and they do nothing they only accuse each other they find nothing patience said elsie softly only a few daysa day or twothenwith your helpwe will unravel all this trouble you shall lose nothing shall i escape this mocking devilthis edmund gray i cannot promise perhapsnow my dear guardian i am to be married next wednesday i want you to be present at my wedding why not because things have been said about george and because your presence will effectually prove that you do not believe them oh believe them i believe nothing it is however my experience that there is no act however base that any man may not be tempted to do happily it is my experience said the girl of twentyone that there is no act of baseness however small that certain men could possibly commit you will come to my wedding then athelstan will give me away athelstan yes i remember we found those notes didnt we i wonder who put them into the safe athelstan yes he has been living in low company i heardcamberwellrags and tatters oh elsie stamped impatiently you will believe anythinganything and you a lawyer athelstan is in the service of a great american journalrags and tatters american oh yes mr dering sat up and looked interested why of course how could i forget it had it been yesterday evening i should have forgot but it is four years ago he wrote to me from somewhere in america where was it ive got the letter it is in the safe bring me the bottom righthand drawer it is there i know he took the drawer which elsie brought him and turned over the papers here it is among the papers of that forgery here is the letter he gave it to elsie read it he writes from america you see he was in the states four years agoandandwhat is it oh cried elsie suddenly springing from her chairoh do you know what you have given me oh do you know what you have told me it is the secretthe secretof my fortune oh athelstan gave it to meathelstanmy brother mr dering took the letter from her and glanced at the contents i ought not to have shown you the letter he said i have violated confidence i forgot i was thinking of the troublei forgot i forget everything nowthe things of yesterday as well as the things of today yes it is true child your little fortune came to you from your brother but it was a secret that he alone had the right to reveal and now i know it i know it oh what shall i say to him the tears came in her eyes he gave me all he hadall he hadbecauseoh for such a simple thingbecause i would not believe him to be a villain oh my brothermy poor brother he went back into poverty again he gave me all becauseoh for such a little thingmr dering she turned almost fiercely upon him after such a letter could you believe that man to be a villain could you tell me after such a deed and such a letter i believe nothing my experience however tells me that any man whoever he is may be led to commit no i wont have it said againnow listen mr dering these suspicions must cease there must be an end athelstan returned six weeks agoor thereabouts that can be proved before that time he was working in san francisco on the journal that can be proved while these forgeries with which he is now so freely charged were carried on here he was abroad i dont ask you to believe or to disbelieve or to bring up your experienceoh such experienceone would think you had been a police magistrate all your life no elsie mr dering smiled grimly there was no need to sit upon the bench the police magistrate does not hear so much as the family solicitor my dear prove your brothers innocence by finding out who did the thing that is after all the only thing it matters nothing what i believehe is not proved innocentall the world may be suspected of ituntil the criminal is found remove the suspicions which have gathered about your lover by finding the criminal there is no other way very well then i will find the criminal since no one else can mr dering went on without heeding her words they want to get out a warrant against edmund gray i think for my own part that the man edmund gray has nothing to do with the business he is said to be an elderly man and a respectable mana gentlemanwho has held his chambers for ten years they need not worry about a warrant elsie replied tell your brother mr dering that it will be perfectly useless meantimei doubt if it is any good asking youbutif we want your help will you give me all the help you can assuredly all the help i can why not i am the principal person concerned you are indeed said elsie gravelythe principal person concerned very well mr deringnow i will tell you more i know thethe criminal i can put my hand upon him at any moment it is one man who has done the whole beginning with the cheque for which athelstan was suspectedone man alone why child what can you know about it what can you do you were never in love mr deringelse you would understand that a girl will do a great dealoh a great deal more than you would thinkfor her lover it is not much to think for him and to watch for himand for her brotherthe brother who has stripped himself of everything to give his sister she was fain to pause for the tears which rose again and choked her voice but elsiewhat does this mean how can you know what no one else has been able to find out that is my affair mr dering perhaps i dreamed it do you mean that you will get back all the papersall the transfersthe dividends that have been divertedeverything everything is safe everything shall be restoredmy dear guardian it is a long and a sad story i cannot tell you now presently perhaps or tomorrow i do not know how i shall be able to tell you but for your property rest easy everything will come back to youeverythingexcept that which cannot be stored in the vaults of the bank the last words he heard not or understood not i shall get back everything the eyes of the individualist lit up and his pale cheek glowedold age has still some pleasures it is not until one loses property that one finds out how precious it has become elsie you remember what i told you a day or two ago ah i dont forget quite everythinga man is not the shivering naked soul only but the complete figure equipped and clothed armed and decorated bearing with him his skill his wit his ingenuity his learning his past and his present his memories and his rejoicings his sorrows and his trials his successes and his failures and his propertyyeshis property take away from him any of these things and he is mutilated he is not the perfect soul why you tell me that my property is coming back i awake again i feel stronger already the shadows are flying before me even the terror of that strange forgetfulness recedes and the haunting of edmund gray i can bear all if i get my property back again as for this forgerthis miscreantthis criminalyou will hale him before the judge yesyes we will see about the miscreant afterwards the first thing is to find the man and recover your property and to dispel the suspicions resting on innocent persons if i do the former you must aid me in the latter assuredly i shall not shrink from that duty very wellnow tell me about yourself sometimes it does good to talk about our own troubles tell me more about these forgetful fits do they trouble you still her eyes and her voice were soft and winning one must be of granite to resist such a voice and such eyes my dearmr dering softened you are good to interest yourself in an old mans ailments it is anno domini that is the matter with me the forgetful fits are only symptomsand the disease is incurable ask the oak why the leaves are yellowit is the hand of winter that is my complaint first the hand of winter then the hand of death meantime the voice of the grasshopper sings loud

have read of such cases there was a man oncehe was like myselfa solicitorwho would go out and do things not knowing what he did they found him out at last doing something so incredibly foolish that there was but one explanation in another man and a younger man it would have been worse than foolish it would have been criminal then they gave him a companion and he discovered what he had done the shame and the shock of it killed him i have thought of that man of late good heavens think if you can of any worse disaster let me dielet me die i say rather than suffer such a fatesuch an affliction i see myself brought before the magistratememyselfat my age charged with this and with that what defence none save that i did not remember that could never be said elsie confidently because she knew

could not even in a waking dream people who dream i am sure always remain themselves however strangely they may act how could youyouafter such a life as yours become a haunter of low company one might

there as well he has promisedand now my dear guardian if you will come round to grays inn with me i will show you the chambers of mr edmund gray nono thank you elsie i do not wish to make the personal acquaintance of a socialist he has chambers on the second floor the principal room is large and well furnished it is a wainscoted room with two windows looking on the square it is not a very pretty square because they have not made a garden or laid down grass in the middleand the houses are rather dingy he sits there in the evening he writes and meditates sometimes he teaches me but that is a new thing in the morning he is sometimes there between nine oclock and twelve he has an old laundress who pretends to keep his rooms clean she murmured these words softly thinking to turn his memory back and make him understand what had happened they are pleasant rooms are they not he made no replyhis eyes betrayed trouble she thought it was the trouble of struggling memoryhe sits here alone and works he thinks he is working for the advancement of the world there is no one so good i think as edmund gray he suddenly pushed back the chair and sprang to his feet my scholar you speak of me it was so sudden that elsie cried out and fell backwards in her chair she had brought on the thing by her own words by conjuring up a vision of the chambers butthe trouble was not the struggle of the memory getting hold of evasive facts why child he remonstrated you look pale is it the heat come it is cooler outside let us go to the chambers in grays inn this old fellowthis deringhere he sits all day long it is tom tiddlers ground it is paved with gold which he picks up the placelet us whisperbecause he must be in the outer officeit reeks of propertyreeks of property he took his hat and gloves my scholar let us go by force of habit he shut and locked the safe and dropped the bunch of keys in his pocket chapter xxviii athelstans discovery on the evening of that same day the same discovery was made by another of the persons chiefly concerned you have seen that athelstan on his return made haste to find out the commissionaire who had presented the forged cheque happily the man remembered not only the circumstance itself but also his employer on that occasion a generosity far above what is commonly found among those who employ the services of that corps endeared and preserved the memory of the day he had received in fact half a sovereign for an eighteenpenny job and the commissionaire is not like the cabby to whom such windfalls are common not at all with the former we observe the letter of the law after eight years this mans memory was rewarded this thrice blessed job produced yet more golden fruit heard one ever of a more prolific job after breakfast athelstan was informed that a commissionaire desired to speak with him it was his onearmed friend beg your pardon sir he said saluting after the military manneryou said i was to come and tell you first thing if i found your man for you certainly i told you also that i would give you a fivepound reward for finding my man as you call him welli will be as good as my word if you have found him i saw him yesterday the very same old gentleman that sent me to the bank that day hes older and he doesnt look so jolly and he walks slower but i knew him at once oh are you quite sure because a resemblance you know well sir i can swear to him i remember him as well as i remember anybody he sat in the chair and he laughed and he said youve been quick over the job my man theres something extra because you might have dropped the money down a grating or run away with it or something he says heres half a sovereign for you my man says he and i daresay you can do with it i can so sir i says and with as many more like them as i can pick up then he laughed and i laughed and we both laughedand thats the same man that i saw yesterday evening oh this is very curious are you quite sure id swear to him anywhere a man cant say fairer noas you saya man can hardly say fairer can he now then when did you see him it was between six and seven id been doing a message for a gentleman in the stranda gentleman in the diningroom line to a gentleman in holborn in the sausage and tripe lineand i was going back with a letter and going through lincolns inn for a short cut just as i was getting near the gate to the fields i saw coming out of the door at no the very man you want to find i wasnt thinking about him not a bit i was thinking of nothing at all when he come out of the door and walked down the steps then i knew him lord i knew him at once youre the man i says to myself as give me the halfsov instead of eighteenpence well i stood at the corner and waited to see if he would remember me not a bit of it he stared at me hard but he never recollected me a biti could see that why should he nobody remembers the servant any more than they remember the private in the ranks the very same old gentleman but hes grown older and he didnt look jolly any more praps hes lost his money came out of no did he why dering sons office is there what does this mean i thought id like to find out something more about him and i thought that a fivepound note was better worth looking after than eighteenpenceso i let the letter from the tripe and sausage man lay a bit and i followed my old gentleman at a good distance oh you followed him very good did you find out where he lived i can tell you that he went to no south square grays inn no he didnt sirbut you are not very far wrong he went through great turnstile then he crossed holborn and turned into featherstone buildings which is all lodginghouses but he doesnt live there he walked through the buildings and so into bedford row and he stopped at a house there what in bedford row yes in bedford rowand he pulls out a latchkey and lets himself in thats where he lives no bedford row on the west side very near the bottom he lives in bedford rowwell sir i like to do things proper and so to make the job complete i went to the salutation holborn where they keep a directory and i looked out his name the gentleman that lives at no bedford row is named edward deringand among the names of no new square lincolns inn is the name of dering sonso sir i dont think it is too much to say that your man is mr dering who belongs both to bedford row and lincolns inn hes the man who sent me to the bank eight years ago athelstan stared at him he the man he cried you are talking impossibilities he cant be the man nobody else sir if that was mr dering that i saw yesterday walking home from new square to bedford rowhes the man who sent me for the money to this statement the man stuck firm nor could he be moved by any assertion that his position was impossible for my friend said athelstan the man who sent you with the cheque was the man who robbed mr dering cant help that sir if the gentleman i saw yesterday walking from lincolns inn to bedford row was mr deringthen he robbed hisself thats foolishness oh there must be some explanation look here mr edward dering leaves his office every evening between six and seven i will be in new square on the west side this evening at six you be there as well try not to seem as if you were watching for anybody stand about at your ease ill make it sentrygo sir said the old soldier ill walk up and down in front of the door same as some of our chaps got to do in front of shops you trust me sir and i wont take no notice of you this little plot in fact was faithfully carried out at six oclock athelstan began to walk up and down outside the gate which opens upon lincolns inn fieldsthe commissionaire at the same time was doing sentrygo in front of no in new square when the clock struck six there was a rush and a tramp of hurrying feet these were the clerks set free for the day there are not many solicitors offices in new square and these once gone the place becomes perfectly quiet at halfpast six there was the footfall as of one man on the stairs and he descended slowly he came out of the door presently an old bent figure with white hair and shrivelled face paying no heed to the sentry he walked away with feeble step in the direction of chancery lane checkley this was on his way to look after his tenants and his property athelstan looked after him through the gate then he called his old soldier see that man he asked thats the man who sent you to the bank nohe isnt the man was stout on that point not a bit like him that old mans a servant not a gentleman see the way he holds his hands never a gentleman yet carried his hands that way you can always tell em by their hands the other day i met an old palseemed to forget me he did wanted to make out that hed never been in the army at all so i lay by for a bit then i gets upand he gets up too tention says i and he stood to tention like a good old tommy atkins you watch their hands whatever they say always tell em by their hands that old man hes a servant he isnt a gentleman he cant sit among the swells and order about the waiters he hasnt learned that way hed get up himself if you asked him and put the napkin under his arm and bring you a glass of sherry wine hes not my man you wait a bit at a quarter to seven another footstep was heard echoing up and down the empty building then an old man erect thin tightly buttoned wearing neat gloves and carrying an umbrella came out of the door his face was hard even austere his walk was firm the sentry as this person walked out of the gate followed at a distance when he was beside athelstan he whispered thats the man id swear to him anywhere thats the man that sent me to the bank athelstan heard in unbounded astonishment that the man whyit was mr dering himself let us follow him he whispered not together on opposite sides of the road good heavens this is most wonderful do not lose sight of him to follow him was perfectly easy because mr dering turned neither to the right nor to the left but marched straight on through great turnstile across holborn through featherstone buildings and into bedford row at no his own house where else should he stop athelstan took out his purse and gave the man the five pounds i dont know what it means he said i cant understand a word but i suppose you have told me the truth i dont know why you should make up a lie its gauspel truth said the man and therefore againi dont understand it wellive got your name and your number if i want you again i will send for you the man saluted and walked away half a sovereign for an eighteenpenny job and eight years afterwards five pounds on account of the same job robbery was it robberyand the old man pretending to rob himself now what did that mean laying it on to some poor harmless innocent cove the soldier guessed laying it on to some one as he had a spite againstthe old villainvery likely this young governormost likely donation on account of that same job very likelythe old villain as for athelstan he returned to lincolns inn fields where the evening being fine and the sun warm and the place quiet except for the children at play he walked up and down the east or sunny side for half an hour turning the thing over in his mind for you see if mr dering went through the form of robbing himself and finding out the robbery and coldly suffering the blame to fall upon himselfthen mr dering must be one of the most phenomenally wicked of living men or if mr dering robbed himself and did not know itthen mr dering must be mad again if such a thing could be done on a small scale it might be done on a larger scale with the same resultnamely suspicion to fall upon a blameless person obloquy to gather round his namefor in some cases simply to be charged is almost as fatal as to be convicted and perfect impunity for himself this is not my own writing but a forgery said the man who had been robbed then who is the forger youyou none but you the bare suspicion becomes a certainty in the minds of those who were once that mans friendsand his life is cankered at the outset he thought of his own life the bitterness of alienation and exile never any time for eight years when he could explain the reasons of his exile debt the cultivation of wild oats failure to pass examinationsanything would do for such a reason except suspicion of forgery athelstan was a cheerful young man he seldom allowed himself to be cast down by the blows of fate nevertheless during his whole time of exile the drop of bitterness that poisoned his cup was that he could not tell the whole story because the world would believe no more than halfthat half namely which contained the accusation when one walks about thinking there comes a time when it seems no good to think any longer the mind can only get a certain amount out of a case at one sitting that amount absorbed the best thing is to go on to something else athelstan went on to dinner he left his sister to the care of her young man and dined by himself he took a steak at a holborn restaurant with an evening paper which he considered professionally after dinner he returned to his subject perhaps he should get a step farther noperhaps on account of the sweet influence of dinner he got no farther at all here was an astonishing fact how to account for it you have seenby one of two waysmalignity unspeakable or madnessmadness of a very curious kindthe madness of a man whose calm cold judgment had made him appear to his friends as one with an intellect far above any ordinary weaknesses of humanity mr dering mad then the chancellor of the exchequer the speaker of the house of commons the president of the royal society the president of the institute of civil engineers the cambridge professors of mathematicsall these men might be mad as well and nobody to know it or to suspect it mr dering mad and yet if not what was he there was one way he had tried it already once he left the restaurant and turned eastwards he was going to try south square grays inn again perhaps mr edmund gray would be in his rooms he was not the door was shut but the opposite door stood open that of freddy carstone athelstan knocked and was admitted with eloquence almost tumultuous just in time said the coach ive got a new brand of whisky straight from glasgow you shall sample it have you had dinner yet so have i sit down let us talk and smoke tobacco and drink whisky and soda i will do the talking and the tobacco at any rate i love virtue said freddy she is a lovely goddessfor if virtue feeble were heaven itself would stoop to her she has only one fault there is reproach in her voice reproach in her eye and reproach in her attitude she is an uncomfortable goddess fortunately she dwells not in this venerable foundation do not imitate virtue old boy let me thats right we shall then start fair upon the primrose paththe broad and flowery waythough i may get farther down than you athelstan the wanderermelmoth the wandererchilde harold the pilgrimdrink and be human he set the example good whiskyvery good whisky athelstan theres a poor devil upstairs starving for the most partlets have him down its a charity he ran upstairs and immediately returned with the decayed advocate who looked less hungry than usual and a shade less shabbyyou have seen how he borrowed of mr edmund gray through elsie now said the host i call this comfortable a warm august evening the window open a suspicion of fresh air from the gardens soda and whisky and two men for talk most evenings one has to sit alone then theres a temptation toto close the evening too quickly freddy i want to hear more about your neighbour you told me something if you remember a week or two ago very odd thing old checkley at the salutation is always pestering about mr edmund gray what has he to do with mr edmund gray wanted me to answer his questions and me said mr langhorne i did answer them wellmr edmund gray is what is he an old gentleman of cheerful aspect who is apparently a socialist we must all be allowed our little weaknesses all i ask for is he reached his hand for the whisky this old gentleman carries his hobbies so far as to believe in them seriously ive talked to him about them i have heard him lecture at camden town said the barrister i go there sometimes on sunday evening they have a teafeast with him and cake and toast it is a pleasant gathering it reminds one of the early church well athelstan what else can i tell you hark there was a step heard ascending the stairs i believe that is the old man himself if it is you shall see him i will bring him in he went out to meet the unknown footstep on the landing he greeted the owner of that footstep he stopped him he persuaded him to step into the opposite room you must be lonely mr gray sitting by yourself come in and have an hours talk come in this way the room is rather dark here is mr langhorne your overhead neighbour whom you know and here is mr athelstan arundel whom you dont know those who do know him like him except for his virtue which is ostentatious in one so young it was now nearly nine oclock the lamp was not lit and the room lay in twilight it is the favourite shade for ghosts a ghost stood before athelstan and shook hands with himthe ghost of mr dering i am happythe ghost held out his handto make your acquaintance mr arundel an old man like myself makes acquaintances but not friends his time for new friendships is gone still the world may be full of pleasant acquaintances he sat down taking a chair in the window the shade of the curtain fell upon his face so that nothing could be seen but a white circle let us have candles freddy said athelstan by all means freddy lit a lamp on the table and two candles on the mantelshelf by their light the lineaments and figure of the ghost came out more distinctly athelstan gazed on it with bewilderment his head went round he closed his eyes he tried to pull himself together he sat up he drank half a glass of whisky and soda he stared steadily at the figure he had not seen for eight years since good heavens and this man had done it himself and he was as mad as a hatter mr edmund gray looked serenely cheerful he lay back in the long chair his feet extended and crossed his elbows on the arms of the chair his fingertips touching his face was wreathed with smiles he looked as if he had always found the world the best of all possible worlds athelstan heard nothing of what was said his old friend freddy carstone was talking in his light and airy way as if nothing at all mattered he was not expected to say anything freddy liked to do all the talking for himselftherefore he sat watching a man under an illusion so extraordinary that it made him another man nothing was changed in himneither features nor voice nor dressyet he was another man why asked athelstan why did he write that cheque for seven hundred and twenty pounds presently freddy stopped talking and mr edmund gray took up the conversation what he saidthe doctrines which he advanced we know already and these things said athelstan to himself from those lips is it possible at ten oclock mr edmund gray rose he had to write a letter he prayed to be excused he offered his hand again to athelstan goodnight sir he said to the pleasure of seeing you again have we never met before mr gray athelstan asked i think not i should remember you mr arundel i am sure mr gray replied politely besides i never forget a face and yours is new to megoodnight sir chapter xxix checkley sees a ghost to checkley watching every evening though not always at the same time sooner or later the same discovery was certain to come it happened in fact on friday evening the day after athelstan shook hands with mr edmund gray on that night he left the office between six and seven walked to his lodgings in clerkenwell made himself a cup of tea and hurried back to grays inn here he planted himself as usual close to the passage in the northeast corner of south square so that he could slip in on occasion and be effaced like many of the detective tribe or like the ostrich fount of many fables he imagined himself by reason of this retreat entirely hidden from the observation of all of course the exact contrary was the result the policeman regarded him with the liveliest curiosity the laundresses watched him daily the newspaper vendor came every evening from the gateway to see what this ancient spy was doing and why he lurked stealthily in the passage and looked out furtively he was one of the little incidents or episodes which vary the daily routine of life in the inn many of these occur every year the people who come to their offices at ten and go away at five know nothing about them the residents who leave at ten and return at six or seven or twelve know nothing about them but the service know and they talk and conjecture here was an elderly mannay an old old man apparently eighty years of age what did he want coming night after night to hide himself in a passage and peer out into the square what indeed the policeman who had done duty in hyde park could tell instructive stories from his own experience about frisky age the laundresses remembered gentlemen for whom they had done and pranks with which those gentlemen amused themselves but no one knew a case parallel to this why should an old man stand in the corner and secretly look out into the square he generally arrived at halfpast seven and he left his post at nine when it was too dark to see across the square then he went to the salutation and enjoyed society conversation and a cheerful glass as you have seen the time he chose was unfortunate because mr edmund gray when he called at his chambers generally did so at halfpast six or seven on his way to the hall of science kentish town therefore checkley might have gone on watching for a long timesay an aeonwatching and waiting in vain but an accident happened which rewarded him richly for all his trouble it was on friday elsie provided by this time with a latchkey to the chambers arrived at grays inn at six she was going to spend the evening with the master she walked in ascended the staircasemr gray had not yet arrivedopened the door shut it behind her and entered the room the hand of woman was now visible in the general improvement of the room the windows were clean and bright the wainscoted walls had been cleaned the ceiling whitewashed the carpet had been swept and the furniture dusted there were flowers on the table there was an easel on which stood elsies fancy portrait of mr dering so wonderfully like mr graya speaking likeness books lay about the tablethey were all books on the labour question on the social question on the problems of the day all the books on all the questions with which men now torture themselves and think thereby to advance the coming of the kingdom of heaven there were new curtains dainty curtains of lace hanging before the windows and the windowblinds themselves were clean and new elsie looked about her with a certain satisfaction it was her own doing the work of her own hand because the old laundress was satisfied to sit down and look on at the least she said the poor dear man has a clean room then she remembered that in a day or two she would leave him to his old solitude and she sighed thinking how he clung to her and leaned upon her and already looked upon her as his successora clean room she said when i have left him perhaps he will leave the room too and be all day long what he used to besane or mad i love him best when he is mad the table was covered with manuscripts these were part of the great work which he was about to give to the world elsie had never seen the room behind this a guilty curiosity seized her she felt like the youngest of bluebeards wives she felt the impulse she resisted she gave way she opened the door and looked in she found a room nearly as large as the sittingroom the windows were black with dust and soot she opened one and looked out upon a small green area outside littered with paper and bottles and all kind of jetsam the floor of the room was a couple of inches deep with dust the chairs and the dressingtable were deep in dust the bed was laid but the blankets were devoured by moths there was not a square inch left whole it looked as if it had been brought in new and covered with sheets and blankets and so left the room unopened the bed untouched for the ten years of mr edmund grays tenancy between the bedroom and the sittingroom was a small dark room containing a bath a table for washingup knives and forks in a basket teacups and saucers the pantry said elsie and the scullery and the housemaids closet all together oh beautiful and to think that men live in such densand sleep there contentedly night after night in this lonely ghostly old place horrible a rattling behind the wainscoting warned her that ghosts can show themselves even in the daytime she shuddered and retreated to the sittingroom here she took a book and sat by the open window heedless of the fact that she could be seen by anyone from the square it was seven oclock before mr edmund gray arrived ah child he cried tenderly you are here before me i was delayedsome business what was it pshaw i forget everything never mindi am here and before we take a cab i want you once more to go through with me the points of my new catechism now if you are ready quite ready master at halfpast seven checkley arrived at his corner and took a preliminary survey of the square there he is said the policeman there he is again said two laundresses conversing on a doorstep there he is as usual said the newspaper man now asked all in chorus whats he want there mr checkley looked out from his corner saw no one in the square and retreated into his passage then he looked out again and retreated again if anyone passed through the passage checkley was always walking off with great resolution in the opposite direction presently in one of his stealthy peerings he happened to look up then he startedhe shaded his eyes he looked his hardest yes at the open window freely displayed without the least attempt at concealment he saw the head and face of miss elsie arundel there there what more was necessary edmund gray was athelstan arundel or george austin or bothand elsie arundel was an accomplice after the act there there he retreated to the seclusion of the passage and rubbed his hands this would please sir samuel he should hear it that very night this ought to please him very much because it made things so clear at last there she wasupstairs in the chambers of mr edmund grayin the very room there there there perhaps he was mistaken but his sight was very goodfor distant things in reading a newspaper he might make mistakes because he was one of those elderly persons who enjoy their newspaper most when they can nail it upon the wall and sit down to read it from the other side of a large room he looked up again the setting sun shining on the window of the side where he stoodthe eastern side was reflected upon the windows of no elsies shapely headshe had taken off her hatwas bathed in the reflected sunshine no doubt about her at all there she was there there there the old man was fain to take a walk up verulam buildings and back again to disguise his delight at this discovery he walked chuckling and cracking his fingers so that those who saw himbut there are not many in raymonds buildings on an august eveningthought that he must be either a little mad or a little drunk or a little foolish but nobody much regards the actions of an ancient man it is only the respect of his grandchildren or the thought of his possessions that gives him importance only the strong are regarded and an old man who looks poor gets no credit even for foolishness and silly chuckles then checkley went back to his corner oh what was that he rubbed his eyes again he turned pale he staggered he caught at the doorposts what was that he shaded his eyes and looked againbent and trembling and shaking all over said the policeman looks as if hes going to get em again said the laundresses he looks as if hed seen a ghost the newspaper boy stepped halfway across the square hes looking at mr edmund gray and the young lady jealousprapsknows the young ladywouldnt have believed it probly yescheckley was looking at that window no doubt of that at all he was not able to disguise his astonishment he no longer pretended to hide himself for he saw sitting in the window the young lady whom he believed to be an accomplice in the crime and standing over her with an expression of fatherly affection was none other than mr dering himself yes mr dering most wonderful what did it mean had mr dering resolved to clear up the mystery of edmund gray had he penetrated the chambers and found therenot edmund graybut elsie arundel my friend said the policeman standing before him so that the view of the window was intercepted you seem interested over the way i am i am oh yes much interested welldont you think youve looked at that old gentleman long enough perhaps he wouldnt like so much looking at theres a young lady too it isnt manners to be staring at a young lady like a stuck pig nono policeman ive seen enoughthank you and still talking in a friendly way do you think mr edmund gray over there would like it if he knew there was a detective or a spy watching every evening on the other side of the square whats the little game guvnor anything in our line not with that most respectable old gentleman i do hopethough sometimes wellwhat is it because we cant have you goin on as you have a been goin on you know policemancheckley pulled him aside and pointed to the little group at the windowyou see that old gentleman theredo you know him certainly known him ever since i came to the inntwo years ago the people of the inn have known him for ten years i believe thats mr edmund gray hes not one of the regular residents and he hasnt got an office comes here now and then when he fancies the placemr edmund gray that is i wish all the gentlemen in the inn were half as liberal as he is oh its impossible say it again policeman perhaps im a little deafim very old you knowa little deaf perhaps say it again whats the matter with the man for he was shaking violently and his eyes stared of course that is mr edmund gray what does the girl do with him why are they both there together how should i know why she calls upon him shes a young lady and a sweet young thing too hes her grandfather likely checkley groaned i must go somewhere and think this out he said excuse me policeman i am an old man andand ive had a bit of a shock and goodevening policeman he shaded his eyes again and looked up yesthere they were talking then elsie rose and he saw her putting on her hat then she retreated up the room but still he stood watching not had enough yet guvnor asked the policeman only a minute i want to see her go outyesthere they aregoing out together it is after all oh there is no mistake there is no mistake guvnor said the policeman there goes mr edmund gray and there goes that sweet young thing along of himah theres many advantages about being a gentleman no mistake i say about them twonow old man you look as if youd had a surprise hadnt you better go home and take a drop of something it was earlier than checkley generally went to the salutation but he delayed no longer he tottered across the square showing very much of extreme feebleness looking neither to the right nor to the left his cheek white his eyes rolling the people looked after him expecting that he would fall but he did not he turned into the tavern hobbled along the passage and sank into an armchair in the parlour good gracious mr checkley cried the barmaid as he passed whatever is the matter some of the usual company were already assembled although it was as yet hardly eight the moneylender was there sitting in his corner taking his tobacco and his grog in silence the decayed barrister was there his glass of old and mild before him reading the morning newspaper the exmp was there when checkley tumbled into the room they looked up in surprise when he gazed about him wildly and gasped they were astonished for he seemed like unto one about to have a fit give me something robertgive me something he cried quicksomething strong ill have it short quickquick robert brought him a small glass of brandy which he swallowed hastily oh he groaned sitting up ive seen ive seen you look as if you had seen a ghost said the barmaid who had come along with a glass of water shall i bathe your forehead nono i am better nowi am all right againgentlemenhe looked round the room solemnlyive seen this evening a good manan old mana great mana rich man gentlemen wrecked and cast away and destroyed and ruined with a little devil of a woman to laugh at him they dont generally laugh at the men when they are ruined said mr langhorne they laugh while they are ruining them its fun to them so it is to the men great fun it is while it lasts i daresay the little woman wont really laugh at him in my case his case was left untold because he stopped and buried his head in his newspaper then shylock spoke he removed his pipe from his lips and spoke moved after his kind by the mention of the words wreck and ruin just as the vulture pricks up its feathers at the word death to see a rich man wrecked and ruined mr checkley is a thing which a man may see every day the thing is not to lose by their wreckto make money out of it rich men are always being wrecked and ruined what else can you expect if men refuse to pay their interest and to meet their bills the melancholy thingah the real sadnessis the ruin of a man who has trusted his fellow creatures and got taken in for his pains only this morning i find that ive been let in by a swindlera common swindler gentlemenwho comes round and says he cant pay upcant pay upand im welcome to the stickswhich kind of man might your friend be mr checkley the man whos trusted his neighbour and got leftor the neighbour whos ramped the man that trusted him it isnt money at all checkley replied then sir if it isnt money said the moneylender i dont know why you come in frightening this honourable company out of their wits if it isnt money how the devil can the gentleman be wrecked and ruined for two hours mr checkley sat in silence evidently not listening to what was said then he turned to mr langhorne the barrister youve known mr edmund gray a long time i believe nine yearsten yearssince he came to the inn always the same man i suppose said checkley never another mannot sometimes a young manor two young menone rather a tall young man looks as if the world was all hissupercilious beast never more than one man at once replied the barrister with a show of forensic keenness he might have been two young men rolled into one but not to my knowledge always the same man to look at so far as i knowand the same man to talk with oh yesyes theres no hope leftnone hes ruined and lost and cast away and done for he rose and walked out the company looked after him and shook their heads then they drew their chairs a little closer and the gap made by his departure vanished chapter xxx the day after the ghost when mr dering arrived at his office next morning he observed that his table had not been arranged for him imagine the surprise of the housewife should she come down to breakfast and find the ham and the toast and the tea placed upon the table without the decent cloth with such eyes did mr dering gaze upon the pile of yesterdays letters lying upon his blottingpad the pens in disorder the papers heaped about anyhow the dust of yesterday everywhere such a thing had never happened before in his whole experience of fiftyfive years he touched his bell sharply why he asked hanging up his coat without turning round why is not my table put in order he turned and saw his clerk standing at the open doorgood heavens checkley what is the matter for the ancient servitor stood with drooping head and melancholy face and bent shoulders his hands hung down in the attitude of one who waits to serve but he did not serve he stood still and he made no reply he understood now since the apparition of south square he had had time to reflect he now understood the whole business from the beginning to the end one hand there was and only one concerned with the case now he understood the meaning of the frequent fits of abstraction the long silences this strange forgetfulness which made his master mix up days and hours and caused him to wonder what he had done and where he had been on this and that evening and somebody else knew the girl knew she had told her lover she had told her brother that was why the new partner laughed and defied them it was on his charge that young arundel had been forced to leave the country it was he who declared that he had seen him place the stolen notes in the safe it was he who had charged young austin and whispered suspicions into the mind of sir samuel now the truth would come out and they would all turn upon him and his master would have to be told who would tell him how could they tell him yet he must be told and what would be done to the jealous servant and how could the old lawyer with such a knowledge about himself continue to work at his office all was finished he would be sent about his business his master would go home and stay therewith an attendant how could he continue to live without his work to do what would he do all day with whom would he talk everything finished and done with everything he stood therefore stricken dumb humble waiting for reproof are you ill checkley asked mr dering you look ill what is the matter i am not ill he replied in a hollow voice with a dismal shake of the head i am not exactly ill yes i am ill i tried to put your table in order for you this morning but i couldnt i really couldnt i feel as if i couldnt never do anything for younever again after sixty years service its hard to feel like that he moved to the table and began mechanically laying the papers straight no one has touched your table but me for sixty years its hard to think that another hand will do this for youand do it quite as well youll think thats what we get for faithful service he put the papers all wrong because his old eyes were dimmed with unaccustomed moisture checkley had long since ceased to weep over the sorrows of others even in the most moving situations when for instance he himself carried off the sticks instead of the rent but no man is so old that he cannot weep over his own misfortunes checkleys eye was therefore dimmed with the tear of compassion which is the sister of charity i do not understand you this morning checkley have you had any unpleasantness with mr austinwith any of the people nono only that i had better go before i am turned out thats all thats allhe repeated the words in despair nothing but that who is going to turn you out what do you mean checkley what the devil do you mean by going on like this am i not master here who can turn you out you can sir and you willand id rather if youll excuse the liberty go out of my own accord im a small manonly a very small manbut thank god ive got enough to give me a crust of bread and cheese to live upon i tell you what checkley you had better go home and lie down and rest a little you are upset now at our age we cant afford to be upset go home and be easy old friends dont part quite so easily as you think mr dering spoke kindly and gently one must be patient with so old a servant checkley sobbed and choked like a child he sobbed like a child of four checkley choked and sniffed you dont understand he said oh noyou cant understand its what i saw last night this is very wonderful what did you see a ghost worse than a ghostwho cares for a ghost ghosts cant turn a man out of his place and bring him to be a laughingstock nono it was a man that i saw not a ghost if you can find it possible to talk reasonablymr dering took his chair and tore open an envelopewhen you can find it possible to talk reasonably i will listen meantime i really think that you had better go home and lie down for an hour or two your nerves are shaken you hardly know what you are saying i was in grays inn yesterday evening by accident at eight he spoke in gasps watching his master curiously by accidentnot spying noby accident on my way to my clubat the salutation walking through south square not thinking of anything looking about mecarelesslike south square grays inn that is the place where the man edmund gray lives the man we want to find and cannot find oh lord lord exclaimed the clerk is it possible he lifted his hand and raised his eyes to heaven and groaned then he resumed his narrative coming through the passage i looked up to the windows of no mr edmund grays chambers you know i believe so mr derings face betrayed no emotion at all go on i am told so in the window i saw mr edmund gray himselfhimself curious you have seen himbut why not the man weve all been so anxious to find the man who endorsed the cheque and wrote the letters and got the papersthere he was question of identity how did you know him since you had never seen him before this question checkley shirked he came downstairs five minutes afterwards while i was still looking up at the windows came downstairs and walked out of the squaremade as if he was going out by way of raymonds buildingsmuch as if he might be going to bedford row these details are unimportant againhow did you know him i asked the policeman who the gentleman was he said it was mr edmund gray i asked the newspaper boy at the holborn entrance he said it was mr edmund gray and that everybody knew him so everybody knows him well checkley i see nothing so very remarkable about your seeing a man so well known in the inn it adds nothing to our knowledge that he exists we know already what share if any he has had in this case of ours remains still a mystery unless that is you have found out something else checkley gazed upon his master with a kind of stupor nono he murmured i cant what did you do when you found out that it was the man nothing you did nothing wellunder the circumstances i dont know what you could have done and he walked away oh he walked away very important indeedbut checkley this story does not in the least account for your strange agitation this morning have you anything more to tell me i see that you have but you seem to experience more than usual difficulty in getting it out the clerk hesitated do you he asked at lastdo youhappento know grays inn i daresay i have been thereyears ago why oh you havent been there lately have you not latelynot for forty years or some such inconsiderable period why i thought you might yourself have met mr edmund graybeen to his chambers perhaps mr dering sat upright and laid his hand upon his letters checkley he said i am always willing to make allowance for people in mental distress but i think i have made allowance enough come to the point have you lost any money nono not so bad as thatbut bad enough no i couldnt afford to lose money i havent got enough to spare any but i got a shocka kind of strokepartly because of the man i met and partly because of the person with him oh who was that are we arriving at something i hadnt told you that the person who was sitting at the open window with him who came downstairs with him and walked out of the square with him was no other than your own ward miss elsie arundel herself oh why not asked mr dering carelessly she told me yesterday was it that she knows him if it had been anyone else she was with he replied mixing up his grammarif it had been anyone else who was with heri wouldnt have been surprised but to see the two together that gave me a turn that i cant get over stillwhy not miss elsie arundel has already told me that she is acquainted with mr edmund gray what she has told youshe has actually told you oh what has she told you oh lord lord what is a man to say or to do she told youwhat is best to do he wrung his hands in his distress and his perplexity i cannot understand checkley said mr dering with emphasis the reason for this display of excitement why should she not tell me or anybody else do you suppose that my ward is doing anything clandestine she has told me that she is acquainted with this man she asserts furtherthat we have made a great mistake about him what she means i cannot understand she says in fact that this gentleman is a perfectly honourable person it is possible that he has deceived her it is also possible that the name of edmund gray has been wrongfully used in the papers which belong to the case certainly it was an edmund gray who endorsed the first cheque and an edmund gray having an address at south square whose name is connected with the later business well we shall see presentlywhen do you take out the warrant for the arrest of this man by the way elsie arundel implores me not to allow that step when are you going to do it this morning i was going to do it everything is readybut but what i cant do it now the man is clean gone off his head leave it till tomorrowonly tomorrow or monday before then something is certain to turn up oh certain sure it is something must turn up there is certainly something that you are keeping behind checkley wellwait till monday today is saturday he cant do very much mischief between this and mondaythats enough about edmund gray now here is another point to which i want a direct answer from you my brother asserts i believe on your authority that athelstan arundel has been living in a low and profligate manner in some london suburb and that he was in rags and poverty early this year what is your authority for this why i heard him confessor not denythat hed been living in camberwell in bad company it was at the salutation i heard it he didnt see me id got my head behind a paper he never denied it humphand about the rags i dont know anything about the rags very likely there is as much foundation for the one charge as for the other three or four years ago he was in america to my knowledge he wrote to me from america i now learn on the authority of his sister that he only came back a month ago and that he has been and is still in the service of an american paper what have you got to say to that nothing i dont feel as if i could say anything its all turned upsy down that wont do i suppose no more than the rest but my friend if that is true your theory of conspiracy and confederacy which you took so much pains to build up falls to the ground as far as athelstan is concerned yes oh i havent nothing to say it was a mark of the trouble which possessed him that his language reverted to that of his young days before he had learned the art of correct speech from the copying of legal documents he preserved the same attitude with bent head and hanging hands a sad and pitiful object since athelstan was not in london during the months of march and april he could have had no hand in the later forgeries and it is acknowledged that the same hand was concerned both in the earlier and the later business yesyesthe same hand oh yesthe same hand he repeated with pathos unintelligible to his master the same handthe same hand yesyesthe same handthats the devil of itsame hand done it all then what becomes of your charge against my young partner you were extremely fierce about it so was my brother you had no proofsnor had he if the same hand was in both forgeries it could not have been the hand of george austin what do you say to that nothing im never goingstill standing hands hangingto say anything again as long as i live but you were very fierce about it checkley you must either find more proofs or withdraw your accusation oh if thats all i withdraw i withdraw everything why did you bring that charge then checkley youve been making yourself very busy over the character of my partner you have permitted yourself to say things in the office before the clerks about him if it turns out that he has had nothing to do with the business you will be in a very serious position i withdraw i withdraw everything the old clerk replied but not meekly he was prepared to withdraw but only because he was forced remember too that it was you who brought the charge against young arundel i withdraw i withdraw everything you went so far as to rememberthe other dayhaving seen him replace the notes in the safe what do you say to that i withdraw but it was a direct statementthe testimony of an eyewitness was it true or noti dont know you this morning checkley first you appear shaking and trembling then you tell me things which seem in no way to warrant so much agitation next you withdraw an accusation which ought never to have been made except with the strongest proof and now you wish to withdraw an alleged fact checkley shook his head helplessly i acknowledge that the business remains as mysterious as before nothing has been found out but there remains an evident and savage animosity on your part towards two young gentlemen in succession why what have they done to you checkley made reply in bold words but still standing with hanging hands i withdraw the animosity i withdraw everything as for young arundel he was a supercilious beast we were dirt beneath his feet the whole earth belonged to him he used to imitate my ways of speaking and he used to make the clerks laugh at me i hated him then i hate him still it was fun to him that an old man nigh seventy with no education shouldnt speak like a young gentleman of oxford and cambridge college he used to stick his hat on the back of his head as if it was a crown and hed slam the door after him as if he was a partner i hated him i was never so glad as when he ran away in a rage he was coming between you and me toooh i saw it cunning he was laying his lines for to come between you and me whyyou were jealous checkley i was glad when he ran away and i always thought hed done it too as for seeing him put the cheque back in the safe i perceive now that i never did see him do it yet i seemed to think at the time that id remembered seeing him do a kind of a sort of a something like it i now perceive that i was wrong he never done it he hadnt the wits to contrive it that sort is never half sharp too fine gentleman for such a trickoh i know what you are going to say next how about the second young fellow i hate him too i hate him because hes the same supercilious beast as the other and because hes been able to get round you hes carneyed youno fool like an old fooland flattered youtill youve made him a partner ive worked for you heart and soul for sixty years and more and this boy comes in and cuts me out in a twelvemonth well but checkleyhang iti couldnt make you a partner you didnt want no partners you could do your work and i could do mine and yours too even if you did want to go asleep of an afternoon this is grave however you hated mr austin and therefore you bring against him this foul charge this is very grave checkley no i thought he was guilty i did indeed everything pointed that way and i dont understand about young arundel because he came into the salutation with the cambridge gentleman who gets drunk there every night and he said that he lived at camberwell for eight years with bad company as i wouldnt name to you sir i thought he was guilty i did indeed and now oh now it is all over everythings upsy down nobodys guilty i know now that he hasnt had anything to do with it hes a young man of very slow intelligence and inferior parts he couldnt have had anything to do with it we ought to have known that wellbut who has done it after all thats it checkley was so troubled that he dropped into a chair in the presence of his master thats it whos done it dont you know who done it no i see you dont so much as suspect no more dont i elsewhat to dowhat to saylord only knows he turned and ranhe scuttled out of the room banging the door behind him hes mad said mr dering poor man age makes some men forgetful but it has driven checkley mad chapter xxxi the three accomplices on that same evening the three accomplicesprobably on the proceeds of their iniquitieswere dining together at the savoy after dinner they sat on the verandah overlooking the river and the embankment tis sweet what time the evening shades prevail while one is still in the stage of physical comfort and mental peace attendant upon an artistic little banquet to view from the serene heights of a balcony at that hotel the unquiet figures of those who flit backwards and forwards below theyalashave not dined so well or they could not walk so fast or drag their limbs so hopelessly or lean over the wall so sadly elsie leaned her head upon her hands looking down upon this scene though not quite with these thoughts young ladies who are quite happy and are going to be married next week do not make these comparisons happiness is selfish when one is quite happy everybody else seems quite happy tooeven lazarus and the leper we must never be happy if we do not wish to be selfish coffee was on the table athelstan had a cigar they were all three silent during dinner they had talked gaily because everybody knows that you cannot talk with strange people listening after dinner they sat in silence because it is only when the waiters are gone that one is free to talk elsie said george presently you have something to tell ussomething you have discovered for my own part since i handed the case over to anybody else i feel as if i were not interested in it but still one would like to knowjust for curiositys sakewhen checkley is to be run in yes said elsie i must tell you perhaps i ought to have told you before yet there was a reason nowyou will be greatly astonished george before you begin elsie athelstan removed his cigari must tell you that yesterday evening i too made a discoverywhat the americans call a pivotal discoverya discovery that discovers everything i should have told you last night but you announced your communications for this evening and i thought we would expose our discoveries at the same time you have found out too elsie cried i see by your face that you have well athelstan so much the better now tell your discovery first and i will follow it is this i have discovered edmund gray i have sat with him and discoursed with him in freddy carstones chambers he came in sat beside me and conversed for more than an hour oh said elsie then you know allas much as i know observe george interposed that i know nothing as yet wait a moment george learn that i have myself known mr edmund gray for a fortnight you will think perhaps that i ought to have told you before wellbut there is a reasonbesides the way to begin with did not lie quite clear before me now the time has come when you should advise as to the best course to follow you have certainly been more mysterious than any oracle elsie yet you will bear witness if it comes to bearing witness that i accepted your utterances and believed in them you certainly did georgeand now athelstan tell him the whole in one word thenedmund gray the man we have been looking after so long is none other than edward dering of new square lincolns inn solicitor i dont understand said george bewildered say it all again athelstan repeated his words that is my discovery too said elsie now you know all as you understand but i dont understand how can one man be another man i sat beside one man athelstan added for an hour and more and lo all the time he was another man and still i am fogged what does it mean it means george what you would never suspect the one man received me as a stranger he knew nothing about me he had never heard my name even yet the other man knows me so well it was very odd at first i felt as if i was talking to a sleepwalker oh cried george i know now you have seen mr dering in a kind of sleepwalking state i too have seen him thus but he said nothing you may call it sleepwalking if you like but george there is another and a more scientific name for it the old man is mad he has fits of madness during which he plays another part under another name now do you understand yesbutis it possible it is more than possible it is an actual certainty wait let elsie tell her story then elsie began with a little air of triumph because it is not given to every young lady to find out what all the men have failed to find wellyou seei was always thinking over this business and wondering why nothing was found out about it and watching you look this way and that and it occurred to me that the first thing of all was to find out this mr edmund gray and lay hands upon him at first i thought i would just go and stand outside his door all day long and every day until he came but that seemed a waste of time so i remembered how you found his door open and went in and spoke to the laundress i thought that i would do the same thing and sit down there and wait until he should come but i was afraid to sit in the rooms of a strange man all aloneno i could not do it so i just found out the old womanthe laundressas you did george and i gave her money and she told me that mr gray was at his chambers almost every saturday afternoon very well if anybody chose to wait for him all saturday afternoon he would certainly be found so on saturday afternoon i took a cab and drove to holborn and got to the place before his arrival but again as it was not quite nice to stand at an open doorway in a public square i thought i would wait on the stairs so i mountedthe doors were all closednobody was left in the place at alli thought i should be perfectly safe and undisturbed when i heard the noise of footsteps overheada tramp tramp tramp up and down with every now and then a groanlike a hungry creature in a cage this kept on for a long time and frightened me horribly i was still more frightened when a door overhead opened and shut and the footsteps came downstairs they belonged to a manan elderly manwho seemed as much frightened at seeing me as i was at seeing him he asked me whether i wanted any one and when i said i wanted mr edmund gray he said that he was a friend of mr grays and that since i was a friend too i might act for edmund gray and lend him some money he looked desperately poor and horribly hungry and thin and shabby the poor old man so you acted for edmund gray that was old langhorne he is a barrister who lives in the garret and is horribly down on his luckgo on poor elsie said george think of her all alone on the staircase when he was gone there was no sound at all the place was perfectly quiet the time passed so slowlyoh so slowly at last however i heard a step it came up the stairs oh my heart began to beat suppose it should be mr edmund gray suppose it was some other person suppose it was some horror of a man but i had not long to wait because mr edmund gray himself stood on the landing he stared at me rather surprised to find a young lady on the stairs but he showed no sign of recognition whatever i was a complete stranger to him and was the man mr dering he wasmr dering there was just the least little change in him he wore his coat open instead of buttoned he had no gloves his hat was not pulled over his eyes and his face was somehow lighter and brighter than usual that is so said athelstan exactly with these little changes he presented himself to me perhaps there is another man in the world exactly like him futile remarkgo on elsie then i guessed in a moment what it meant i stepped forward and asked him if he was mr edmund gray and then i followed him into his roomsgeorge there is no manner of doubt whatever mr dering has periods whether regular or not i cannot tell when he loses himself and becomes in imagination another man he is mad if you like but there is method in his madness the other man is just himself turned inside out mr dering believes in the possible wickedness of everybody the other man believes in the actual goodness of every man mr dering considers property the only stable foundation of society the other man considers property the root of all evil mr dering is hard and jealous the other man is full of geniality and benevolence mr dering is justice the other man is mercy very neatly put elsie there is quite an eighteenthcentury balance about your sentences and sentiments so farathelstan contributed his confirmationso far as i could judge nothing could be more true i found my man the exact opposite of himself can such a thing be possible if i were to speak to him would he not know me you forget george you have seen him in that condition and he did not know you nothing is more commonathelstan the journalist began to draw upon the encyclopaedic memory which belongs to his professionthan such a forgetfulness of self have you ever been into a lunatic asylum i havefor professional purposes i have discoursed with the patients and been instructed by the physicians half the time many of the patients are perfectly rational during the other half they seem to assume another mind with other memories it is not real possession as the ancients called it because they never show knowledge other than what they have learned before thus a sane man who cannot draw would never in insanity become an artist so mr dering when he is mad brings the same logical power and skill to bear upon a different set of maxims and opinions said a physician to me at this asylum of which i speak there are thousands of men and women but especially men who are mad every now and then and dont know it most of the crimes are i believe committed in moments of madness a young fellow steals moneyit is because at the moment he is so mad that he even persuades himself that borrowing is not stealing that he is only borrowing that he can get it back and put it back before it is found out what is uncontrollable rage but sudden madness there are the men who know that they are mad on some point or other and cunningly hide it and are never found out and there are the men who are mad and dont know it in their mad times they commit all kinds of extravagances and follies yet somehow they escape detection so he talked and he told me of a man who was a lawyer in one town with a wife and family and also a lawyer in another with a different wife and family but one lawyer never found out the other and the thing was only discovered when the man got a paralytic stroke and died in a kind of bewilderment because when the time came for him to be the other man he found himself lying in a strange bedroom with a strange family round him i had long forgotten the asylum i did the place for my paper three or four years ago and scored by the description since last night i have been recalling my experience and applying it you see there can never be any physical change this is no hyde and jekyll business whatever happens must be conducted with the same body and the same mind the same processes of mind in which the man is trained remain but his madness requires a new setting one cannot understand said elsie no but then one cannot understand everything thats the real beauty of this world we are planted in the midst of things we can give names to themadam began that way didnt hebut we cant understand any of them and most people think that when we have given a name we have succeeded in understanding well elsiewe dont understand but we may find out something i take it that the other man grew up by degrees in his brain so that there is no solution in the continuity of thought and recollection the edmund gray developed himself he has been developed for nearly ten years since he has occupied the same chambers all the time but about the forgeries george sprang to his feet i declare he cried that i had quite forgotten the real bearing on our case edmund gray said elsie says that his own lawyer who manages his affairs is edward dering if he were to write letters while edmund gray he would not impose upon edward dering he cannot write to two men said athelstan there must be a borderland between the waking and the dreaming when the two spirits of edmund gray and edward dering contend for the mastery or when they command each otherwhen edmund gray endorses cheques and edward dering writes letters and conducts transfers for his clienthis doublehimself i have seen him in such a state said george at the time i never suspected anything but a passing trouble of mind which caused him to be so wrapped up in his thoughts as not to be able to distinguish anything he was then i doubt not now carrying out the instructions of edmund gray or he was edmund gray acting for himself checkley whispered not to disturb him he said that he had often seen him so i have never tried to understand said elsie but i saw that edmund gray was mr dering gone mad and that he himself and nobody else was the perpetrator of all these forgeries and i have been trying to discover the best waythe kindest way to himthe surest way for us of getting the truth knowngeorge this is the secret of my mysterious movements this is why i have not given you a single evening for a whole fortnight every eveningboth sundaysi have spent with this dear old man he is the most delightfulthe most gentlethe most generousold man that you ever saw he is full of ideasoh quite fulland they carry you out of yourself until you awake next morning to find that they are a dream i have fallen in love with him i have had the most charming fortnightonly one was always rather afraid that he might come to himself which would be awkward well elsie have you found a way i think i have first i have discovered that when he is surrounded with things that remind him of edmund gray he remains edmund gray next i have found out that i can by talking to him even at his office when he has his papers before him turn him into edmund gray you are a witch elsie she is said george looking at her in the foolish lovers way you see what she has turned me intoa long time ago and she has never turned me back again i have been thinking too said athelstan for our purposes it would be enough to prove the identity of edmund gray and edward dering that explains the resemblance of the handwriting and of the endorsement my commissionaires recollection of the man also identifies the cheque as drawn by himself for himself under another name it explains the presence of the notes in the safe it also shows that the long series of letters which passed between him and the broker were written by himself for himself here however is a difficulty i can understand edward dering believing himself to be edmund gray because i have seen it but i cannot understand edward dering believing himself to be the solicitor to edmund gray and writing at his command but i have seen him in that condition said elsie it was while he was changing from one to the other he sat like one who listens i think that edmund gray was at his elbow speaking to him i think i could make him write a letter by instruction from edmund gray that he should believe himself acting for a client in writing to the broker is no more wonderful than that he should believe himself another man altogether show me if you can the old man acting for an imaginary client meantime i mentioned the point as a difficulty prove however to mr dering and to the others concerned that he is edmund gray and all is proved and this we can do by a host of witnesses i want more than this athelstan said elsie it would still be open to the enemy to declare that george or you or i had made use of his madness for our own purposes i want a history of the whole case written out by edmund gray himselfa thing that we can show to mr dering and to everybody else but i dread his discovery already he is suspicious and anxious i sometimes think that he is half conscious of his condition we must break it to him as gently as we can but the shock may kill him yet there is no escape if the forgeries were known only to ourselves we might keep the discovery a secret and only if necessarybut it would not be necessarykeep some sort of watch over him and warn the bank but checkley has told the clerks and the people at the bank and there are ourselves to think of and my mother and hildano we must let them all know and if one may mention ones self said athelstan my own little difficulty presses because you see i dont know how long i may be kept here perhaps tomorrow i might go on to st petersburg or to pekin before i go elsie i confess that i should like my mother to understand thatthat she was a little hastythat is all you are not going to st petersburg brother elsie took his hand you are not going to leave us anymore you are going to stay i have made another discovery pray if one may ask oh you may ask i saw a letter todaymr dering showed it to me it was written from the states three or four years ago it showed where you were at that time and showed me more athelstanit showed me how you lost the pile of money that you made over that silver mineyou remember athelstan he made no reply oh do you think that i am going to accept this sacrifice george you do not know the donor of that great sum of money which mr dering held for mewe have often wondered who it was i have only found out todayit was athelstan he gave me all he had for such a trifling thingonly because i would not believe that he was a villainall he had in the worldand went out again into the cold he said he dropped his money down a gully or a grating on the prairiesome nonsense and he sent it all to me georgewhat shall we do is this really true athelstan did you really give up all this money to elsie she says so it is quite true george i saw the lettermr dering showed it to mein which he sent that money home and begged mr dering to take care of it and to give it to me on the day when i should be oneandtwenty he cannot deny it look at him he blusheshe is ashamedhe hangs his headhe blows tobaccosmoke about in clouds hoping to hide his red cheeks and he talks of going on to st petersburg when we know this secret and have got the money what do you call this conduct george athelstanthere is no word for it but you must have it back you must and shall there can be no discussion about it and there is not another man in the world i believe who would have done it nonsense i should only have lost it if i had kept it athelstan replied after the irish fashion you hear athelstan it is yours there can be no discussion thats what i like a man for while we women are all talking and disputing the man puts down his foot and says there can be no discussion then we all stop and the right thing is done it is yours brother and you shall have it and you shall stay at home with us always and always she laid her hand upon his shoulder and her arm round his neck caressing him with hand and voice the man who had wandered alone for eight years was not accustomed to sisterly caresses they moved him the thing itself moved him all this belongs to another chapter he said huskily we will talk of it afterwards when the business in hand is despatched well thenthat is agreed you are to have your money back my mother is to take her suspicions back mr dering is to have his certificates back and his dividends checkley is to take his lies back sir samuel is to have his charges back george and i are going to have our peace of mind back and we are

will see her then and acquaint her with the news that the wedding will take place as originally proposed at her house this will astonish her very much and she will become angry and polite and sarcastic then i shall tell her to prepare not only for a wedding feast but also for a great a very great surprise and i shall also inform her that i shall be given away by my brother and thenthenif i know my mother aright she will become silent i shall do that tomorrow morningin the evening george you will get your bestman and i will get your sisters my bridesmaids and we will come here or go to

read me a new paper he has just finished in which he shows that property can be destroyed by a painless processathelstan put all your money into your pocket and keep it therein less than a twelvemonth and with it all crimeall sweating all injusticeno athelstan he is not mad when he argues on this theme he is persuasive and eloquent he convinces everybody i shall hear him out and then i shall try to make him write down all that has happened if we can only get such a confession it would be better than anything else but it may be difficult he does not like being questioned about himself if i do succeedi dont know quite what i ought to do next he must be told some time or other he must have the truth i thought of asking all the people mentioned to meet at his office on monday morning at noon when mr dering is always himself on sunday i would not he has to address his people on sunday evening let him do so undisturbed i will leave him in happiness that one night longer but you twoyou will be anxious come on sunday eveningbetween eight and nineto the hall of science then you will hear him and see me and i will let you know how i have prospered sunday evening said george monday comes next then tuesday and before wednesday my elsie the character of these two convicts has to be completely whitewashed even to the satisfaction of hilda herself are we not running it pretty close unbeliever doubter i tell you that you shall be married with all your friends round you and that athelstan shall give me away and you shall go away on your holiday with a quiet heart and nothing to trouble you what a foolish boy not to be able to trust his bride even for such a simple thing as getting a confession out of a madman do you sport a crest old man asked athelstan i believe there is some kind of a sort of a thing somewhere around but crests are foolishness not always take a new one georgea real one stamp it on your spoons and forks and in your books and on your carriage let it be simply the words dux femina facti chapter xxxii elsie and her mother can you spare me a few minutes mother mrs arundel looked up from the desk where she was writing a letter and saw her daughter standing before her she started and changed colour but quickly recovered and replied coldly i did not hear you come in elsie what do you want with me outside the bells were ringing for church it was a quarter to eleven mrs arundel was already dressed for church she was one of those who do not see any incongruity between church and a heart full of animosities she was bitter against her daughter and hard towards her son and she hated her soninlaw elect with all the powers of her passionate nature but my brothers what an array of bare benches should we see in every place of worship were those only admitted who came with hearts of charity and love do you wish to keep me long elsie if so we will sit down if not i am ready for church and i do not like to arrive late people in our position should show a good example i do not think that i shall keep you very long but if you sit down you will be so much more comfortable comfort elsie you have driven out of this house i will bring it back with me then on monday evening mother i am coming back oh what do you mean child has the blow really fallen i heard that it was impending is the young manis hea prisoner no mother you are quite mistaken you have been mistaken all along yet i shall come back on monday alone then i shall leave it to you whether i come back alone or with the two men whom i most regard of all the worldmy lover and my brother you know my opinions elsie there has been no change in them there can be none wednesday is my wedding day i am not interested in that event elsie after your wedding with such a man against the opinions the wishes the commands of all whom you are bound to respect i can only say that you are no longer my daughter oh how can you be so fixed in such a belief mother let me make one more appeal to your better feelings throw off these suspicions believe me they are baseless there is not the shadow of a foundation for this ridiculous structure they have raised consider it is nowhow longthree weeks since they brought this charge and they have proved nothingabsolutely nothing if you would only be brought to see on what false assumptions the whole thing rests on solid foundationshard factsi want no more if i could prove to you that athelstan was in america until a month ago unhappy girl he is deceiving you he has been living for eight years in profligacy near london elsie do not waste my time it should be enough for me that my soninlaw sir samuel dering a man of the clearest head and widest experience is convinced that it is impossible to draw any other conclusions it is enough for me elsie rejoined quickly that my heart tells me that my brother and my lover cannot be such creatures you have something more to say i suppose mrs arundel buttoned her gloves the clock was now at five minutes before eleven yes if it is no use at all trying to appeal to no use at all mrs arundel snapped i am not disposed for sentimental nonsense i am sorry because you will be sorry afterwards well then i have come to tell you that i have made all the preparations with georges assistance for wednesday oh yes the wedding cake will be sent in on tuesday my own dresswhite satin of course very beautifulis finished and tried on it will be sent in on monday evening the two bridesmaids dresses will also come on monday george has arranged at the church he has ordered the carriages and the bouquets and has got the ring the presents you have already in the house we shall be married at three there will be a little gathering of the cousins after the wedding and you will give them a little simple dinner in the evening which will i daresay end with a little dance george has also seen to the red cloth for the steps and all that oh and on tuesday evening you will give a big dinner party to everybody are you gone quite mad elsie not mad at all my dear mother it is sir samuel who is mad and has driven you and hilda mad oh everything will come off exactly as i tell you perhaps you dont believe it you are mad elsie you are certainly mad no my dear mother i am not mad oh it is so absurd if it were not so serious but we are determined george and i not to make this absurdity the cause of lasting bitterness therefore my dear mother i do not want to be married from my brothers lodgings but from your house you will come to my wedding i prophesy full of lovefull of loveher eyes filled with tearsfor me and for georgeand for athelstanfull of love and of sorrow and of selfreproach i am to be given away by my brotheryou will come i say with a heart full of love and of pity for him mrs arundel gazed at her stonily everybody will be there and you will receive all your friends after the wedding i have taken care of the invitations hilda will be there too horribly ashamed of herself it will be a lovely wedding and we shall go away with such good wishes from yourself as you would not in your present state of mind believe possible go now to church my dear mother prepared for a happy and a joyful day i sometimes believe elsie said mrs arundel more coldly still that you have been deprived of your senses so far from this i shall not be present at your wedding i will not interfere with your holding your marriage here if you like you may fill the house with your friends if you please i shall myself take shelter with my more dutiful daughter i refuse to meet my unhappy son i will not be a consenting party to the tie which will entail a lifelong misery my dear motheryou will do everything exactly as i have prophesiednow do not say any more because it will only make our reconciliation a little more difficult i ought to go to church on the sunday before my wedding if any day in the week if you would only recover your trust in my lovers honour i could go to church with you and kneel beside you but without that trust oh go my dear mother you will find my prophecy come true word for wordbelieve me or not mrs arundel went to church during the service she felt strange prickings of foreboding and of compunction and of fear anxiety and hope with a little sadness caused by the communication and the assurances of her daughter even in such a case as this the thinker of evil is sometimes depressed by the arrival of the prophet of good when mrs arundel came away from church she became aware that she had not heard one single word of the sermon not that she wanted very much to hear the sermon any more than the first or second lessonall three being parts of the whole which every person of respectability must hear once a week only it was disquieting to come away after half an hours discourse with the feeling that she did not remember a single syllable of it she took her early dinner with the other daughter to whom she communicated elsies remarkable conduct and her prediction and her invitation it was decided between them that her brain was affectedno doubt only for a timeand that it was not expedient for them to interfere that it was deplorable but a part of what might have been expected and that time would show meanwhile sir samuel reported that it had been resolved to get a warrant for the arrest of the man edmund gray who hitherto had eluded all attempts to find him he appears to be a real person the knight concludedan elderly man whose character so far as we can learn is good it is however significant that nothing has been discovered concerning his profession or calling that is mysterious for my own part i like to know how a man earns his daily bread i have even consulted a person connected with the police nothing is known or suspected about him but we shall see as soon as he is before the magistrate and wednesday is so close oh my dear sir samuel hurry them up even at the last momenteven at the risk of a terrible scandalif elsie could be saved well said sir samuel it is curiousi dont understand itwe had arranged for the application for a warrant for friday morning would you believe it that old donkey checkley wont go for itwants it put offsays he thinks it will be of no use what with this young man austin at first and this old man checkley next we seem in a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice but tomorrow i shall go myself to my brother it is time this business was finished yesyes said mrs arundel and my dear sir samuel before wednesdaylet it be before wednesday i implore you for all our sakes my dear madam it shall be tomorrow at noon elsie returned to half moon street where george was waiting for her i have made one more attempt she said with tears but it was useless her heart is as hard about you as ever it was about athelstan it is wonderful that she should have so little faith i suppose it comes of going into the city and trying to make money edmund gray would say so i would have told her all but for the old mans sake he knows nothing he suspects nothing and i want to make the case so complete that there shall be no doubtnone whateverpossible in the minds of the most suspicious even checkley must be satisfied i shall finish the work i hope this afternoon oh georgeis it possible is our wedding day next wednesdayactually next wednesday and the hateful cloud shall be blown away andandand for the rest of this chapter look into the book of holy kisses where you will very likely find it chapter xxxiii plenary confession early on sunday afternoon elsie started upon her mission she was anxious because she was entering upon a most important business and one requiring the greatest delicacy in the handling it was enoughmore than enoughthat her witnesses should be able one after the other to identify mr dering with mr edmund gray but how much more would her hands be strengthened if she could produce a full and complete narrative of the whole affair written by the hand which had done it all to get that narrative was her business with the master that afternoon but she was hopeful partly because she knew her power over the philosopher and partly because like every woman who respects herself she had always been accustomed to get exactly what she wanted either by asking coaxing flattering or taking the master was waiting for herone should never keep a master waitingand she was a little late he was impatient he had so much to talk about and to teach one point suggested another in his mind so much to say he grudged the least delay he walked about the room chafing because the hour appointed was already five minutes in the past he would scold her she must really learn to be punctual they had only about five short hours before them for all he had to say was this the zeal of a student but at that point she opened the door and ran in breathless smiling eager holding out both her hands a dainty delicate maiden all his ownhis disciplehis daughterthe daughter of the new humanityand he forgot his irritation and took her hands in his and kissed her forehead child he sighed you are late but never mind you are here why you have grown so precious to me that i cannot bear you to be a minute late it is such a happinesssuch a joy in the presentsuch a promise for the futurethat i have such a disciple now sit downtake off your bonnet i have put a chair for you at the windowand a table for you to write here is your notebooknowyou have thought over what i taught you lastthat is well let us resume at the point where we left offthe rise of the cooperative spirit which is the rise of the new humanity he talked for two hourstwo long eloquent hours he walked about the room or he stopped before his disciple emphasising with the forefinger of admonitionrepeatingillustrating by anecdote and memoryhe had a prodigious memory the scholar listened intelligently sometimes she asked a question sometimes she made notes you must not think that she was a sham scholar her interest in the masters system was not simulated above all things she loved to hear this enthusiast talkwho would not love to hear of the new jerusalem always he made her heart to glow with the vision that he conjured up before her eyes of a world where there should be no more sorrow nor crying nor any more pain nor any of the former things he made her actually seewhat others only read ofthe foursquare city itself with its gates open night and day its jasper walls and its twelve foundations of precious stoneswhy he said the gates are open night and day because there is no property to defend and the walls are of jasper because it is the most beautiful of minerals and because it can be polished like a mirror so that the country around is reflected on its surface which shows that it all belongs to the city and the precious stones are the twelve cardinal virtues of humanity on which the order of the future shall restnamely faith brotherly love obedience patience loyalty constancy chastity courage hope simplicity tenderness and industry it is an allegorythe whole book is an allegoryof humanity and she saw beside the city the river of life with the tree of life for the healing of all nations then she clean forgot the purpose for which she had come she was carried away her heart beather cheek glowed oh lovely vision oh great and glorious prophet he made a heaven and placed it on this earth now the mind of man can conceive of no other happiness but that which humanity can make out of the actual materials found upon this earthly ball the heaven even of the most spiritual is a glorified world the hell even of the most gentle is a world of fleshly pain no other heaven attracts no other hell terrifies there is no promise or hope or prospect or inheritance that man desires or poet can feign or visionary can preach but an earthly heaven it must be a heaven containing sunshine and shower kindly fruits in due season love and joy and music and art and men and women who love each other and labour for each other such a worldsuch a new jerusalemthe master drew every day he loved it and lingered over it he painted over and over again this splendid vision he was never tired of painting it or his hearers of gazing upon it but today he spoke with greater fulness more clearly more brilliantly more joyously than ever was the prophet really a man of seventy years and more for his mind was youngthe enthusiast like the poet never grows old his voice might have been the voice of a boya marvellous boya shelleypreaching the glories of the world when property should be no more he ceased and the vision which he had raised quickly faded away they were back again in the dingy old inn they were among the solicitors and the moneylenders and the young fellows who have their chambers in the place the inn is about as far from the new jerusalem as any place under the sun it is made over bodily and belongsevery stairevery chamberto the interests of property he ceased his prophecy and began to argue to reason to chop logic which was not by any means so interesting at last he stopped this as well you have now dear child he said heard quite as much as you can profitably absorb i have noticed for the last two or three minutes your eyes wandering and your attention wearied let us stoponly remember what i have just said about the diseases of the body politic they are akin to those that affect the human body by comparing the two we may learn not only cause but also effect we have our rheumatisms gouts asthmas neuralgias colds and coughs fevers and other ills so has the body politic whence come our diseases from the ignorance the follies the vices the greed and gluttony of our forefathers so those of the body politic take away property and you destroy greed with that half the diseases vanish elsie heard and inclined her head it did occur to her that perhaps property in the body politic might be represented by food in the body human but she forbore the master was one who did not invite argument nearly all the great teachers of the world if you think of it have conveyed their wisdom in maxims and aphorisms he took out his watch it is nearly four he said shall we go on to the hall not yet there is no need for us to be there before six we have two good hours before us let us use them more pleasantly than in sitting alone in the hallyou must own that it is stuffy we will talk about other thingsabout ourselvesnot about me because i am quite an insignificant person but about you dear master she was now about to enter upon her plan of duplicity she felt horribly ashamed but it had to be done she strengthened herself she resolved she suppressed the voice of conscience about me asked the master but what is there to talk about oh there is ever so much she took his right hand in her own and held it knowing that this little caress pleased and moved him masterwhat a wonderful chance it was that brought me here i can never sufficiently wonder at it i have told georgegeorge austinmy lover you know and athelstanhe is my brother she looked at him sharply but there was no sign of recognition of those two names edmund gray had never heard of either i have told them about you and of your great work and how you are teaching me and everything but when they ask me who you are where you have lived and all about you i can tell them nothing oh i know it matters nothing about me and my own friends but my dear master we have to think of the future when the cause has spread and spread and spread till it covers the whole world people will want to know all about the man who first preached its principles who will be able to tell them no one you are alone you have no wife or children your name will remain for ever attached to the cause itself but youyouthe manwhat will you be nothing nothing but a name you ought to write an autobiography i have sometimes thought i would do sohis face became troubled butbut but you are always occupied with working for the world you have no time of course i quite understand that and it worries youdoes it notto be called upon to turn your thoughts from the present back to the past yesyes it doesit does elsie you exactly express the difficulty and yetyou must ownyou must confessit is natural for the world to want to know all about you who was the great edmund gray why they will want to know every particularevery single particular where you were bornwhere you were educatedwho were your masterswhat led you to the study of humanity and its problemswhere you lived if you were married and to whomwhat you readwho were your friends oh there is no end to the curiosity of the world about their great men perhaps he rose and looked out of the window when men are greatly pleased they must always be moving i confess that i have never thought of these things at all yet to be sureyou are right he murmured and purred no but i have thought of them ever since i had the happiness of being received by you master will you trust me shall i become your biographer you cannot find one more loving you have only to give me the materials nowlet me ask you a few questions just for a beginningjust to show you the kind of thing i shall want to know he laughed and sat down again why my life has not got in it one single solitary incident or episode or adventure there are no misfortunes in it there is not such a thing as a disease in it i have always been perfectly well there is not even a love episode or a flirtation in it there are not even any religious difficulties in it without love illhealth misfortune religious doubtswhere is the interest in the life and what is there to tell well a life that has no incident in it must be the life of a student it is only a student who never falls in love or said the philosopher a moneygetter happily there are not many students or we women should be disconsolate indeed do you know master that you can only be excused such a dreadful omission in your history by that one plea sit down again master for again he was walking about restlessly partly disturbed by her questions and partly flattered and pleased by her reasons she opened her notebook and began to ask questions about himselfvery simple questions such as would not introduce any disturbing points he answered readily and she observed with interest that he gave correctly the facts of his ownedward deringshistory he was born he said in that class which upholds propertythe better classmeaning the richer his father was a wealthy solicitor who lived in bedford row he was born in the year waterloo year he was the eldest of a family of fivethree daughters and two sons he was educated at westminster on leaving school his father offered him the advantage of a university course but he refused being anxious to begin as early as possible his lifes workas he thoughtin the defence of property he was therefore articled to his father and at the age of twentytwo he passed his examination and was admitted and then you were youngyou were not yet a studentyou went into society you saw girls and danced with them yet you never fell in love and were never married how strange i thought everybody wanted love a mans real life only begins i have always been taught with love and marriage love means everything to you my child no doubt it does such as you are born for love he added gallantly venus herself smiles in your eyes and sits upon your lips but as for me i was always studious more or less though i did not for long find out my true line i worked hardi went out very little i was cold by nature perhaps i had no time to think about such things now when it is too late i regret the loss of the experience doubtless if i had that experience i should have gained greatly in the power of persuasion i should have a much more potent influence over the women among my hearers if i were a married man i should be much more in sympathy with them nonno elsie hesitated a little perhaps womenespecially the younger kindget on better with unmarried men however you were not married at first then i was a solicitor with my father thenpresently his face put on the troubled look again you continued elsie interrupted quickly to work at your profession though you took up other studies nononot quite that you began to take up social problems and gradually abandoned your profession nononot that eitherquite you found you could not reconcile your conscience any longer to defending property noi forget exactly it is strange that one should forget a thing so simple i am growing old i supposewellit matters not i left the profession that is the only important thing to remember that i did so these chambers prove i came out of it yes that was it just at the moment my head being full of other things i cannot remember the exact time or the manner of my leaving the profession i forget the circumstances probably because i attached so little importance to it the real point is that i came out of it and gave myself up to these studies she noted this important point carefully and looked up for more there my dear child is my whole life for you without an incident or an episode i was born i went to school i became a solicitor i gave up my profession i studied social economy i made my great discovery i preached it thendid i say my life was without an episode and without love nonoi was wrong my daughteri have at last found love and a childand a disciple what more have i to ask my master no daughter could be more in sympathy with him than this girl it is all most valuable and interesting she said though the facts are so few books will be written in the future on these facts which will be filled out with conjecture and inference even the things that you think of so little importance will be made the subject of comment and criticism wellbut my biography of you will be the first and best and most important i shall first make a skeleton life out of the facts and then fill in the flesh and blood and put on the clothes and present you dear master just as you are ask me what you will but not too often it worries me to remember the past my dear i am like a man who has made himselfwho has risen from the gutter he cannot deny the fact but he doesnt like to be talking about it and he is insulted if anyone charges him with the fact or alludes to it in any way in his presence that is my case exactly i have made myself i have raised myself from the gutterthe gutter of property i actually worked in defence of property till i was sixty years old and more now i am rather ashamed of that fact i do not deny ityou must put it into your biographybut i do not like talking about it you were once a solicitor and you are now a prophet what a leap what a wonderful leap i quite understand yet sometimes now and then for the sake of the curious impertinent world look back and tell me what you see i suppose it is because i am so absorbed in my work that it is difficult for me to remember things why elsie day after day from morning to evening i sit here at work and in the evening i remember nothing of the flight of time the hours strike but i hear them not only the books on the table show what has been my occupation and you want me to go back not to yesterday but ten twenty thirty years ago my dear child i cannot some of the past is clear to mea day here and there i remember clearlyall my evenings at the hall of science my lessons with you those i remember but to recall days passed in meditation and absorbing study is not possible nonoi cannot even try he spoke with a little distress as if the very thought of the necessary effort troubled him believe me my dear master said elsie i would not vex you only for some of the things which you do remember for instance the world always wants to know about the private fortunes of its great men your own affairs you told me once are in the hands of amrmrwhat is his name deringdering a very well known solicitor his office is in new square lincolns innhe manages my money matters i am i believe what the world calls wealthy that gives you independence and the power of working for humanity does it not it does said the scourge and destroyer of property unconscious of the incongruity dering my solicitor is i believe a very honest man narrow in his viewswedded to the old schoolquite unable to see the advance of the tide but trustworthy he belongs to a tribe which is indispensable so long as property is suffered to exist yesonly so long property and lawyers will go out hand in hand and magistrates he added with enthusiasm and courts of justice and prisons and criminals because the chief incentive to crime will be destroyed what a glorious world without a law or a lawyer or a policeman mr dering is it why my dear master i know something about mr dering my brother athelstan was articled to him he became a managing clerk for him then there was trouble about a cheque something was wrong about it he was unjustly blamed or suspected and he left the house i wonder now whether you could throw any light upon that business of the cheque i my dear child a single solitary cheque at a lawyers office how should i possibly know anything about it oh but you might remember this cheque because now i think of it your own name was connected with it yesit was i am certain it was the cheque was drawn in march in the year a cheque for seven hundred and twenty pounds payable to your orderthe order of edmund gray a cheque for seven hundred and twenty pounds in march that must have been yesyesthat was about the time now this is really most remarkable child most remarkable that you should actually hit upon a chequeone of thousands issued from that officewhich i should remember perfectly life is full of coincidencesone is always hearing odd things said meeting faces which one knowswell it is most remarkable because i received a cheque for that very amount at that very time from dering oh i remember perfectly it was when i had a schemei thought it then being younger than i am nowa very good scheme indeed it was intended for the gradual destruction of property i did not understand at that time so fully as i do now the rising of the tide and the direction of the current which is steadily advancing to overwhelm property without any feeble efforts on my part yet my scheme was good so far as it went and it might have been started with good effect but for the apathy of the workers you see they were not educated up to it i had already begun upon my scheme by advancing to certain working men sums which should make them independent of their employers until they should have produced enough to sell directly without the aid of an employer at their own cooperative stores unfortunately most of them drank the money the few who used it properly instead of backing up their fellowworkmen became themselves employers and are now wealthy well i thought i would extend this method i thought that if i got together a chosen bandsay of seventy or soand if after teaching them and educating them a bit i gave them say ten pounds apiece to tide them over the first few weeks that i might next open a distributive and cooperative store for them and so take the first step to abolishing the middlemanthe man of trade i see and so you drew the money for that purpose yes but as i told you i was obliged to abandon my scheme the men were not sufficiently advanced they listened they professed great willingness to receive the money but they gave me no encouragement to hope that they would carry out my plan so it fell through and the men remain to this day with their employers and soyou seei never used the money i remember that i had the cheque cashed in tenpound notes for the purpose what became of the notes i dont know they are in the bank i supposewandering about the world i gave them back to dering oh my dear masterelsie sprang to her feet and laid a sheet of paper on the tablethis is most providential i cannot tell you what a dreadful cause of trouble this cheque has been to us it has half ruined my brothers life for heavens sake write it all down for me quick quick before you forget it all i shall not forget it nevertheless elsie if a statement of the facts can be of any use to youhe changed his seat and took up the pencertainly i will write it for you i am requested he wrote by miss elsie arundel my scholar to state what i know of a certain transaction which took place in march the facts are as follows i had need of a sum of seven hundred and twenty pounds for certain purposes i wanted it in tenpound notes i asked my agent mr dering to give me a cheque and as i thought that i should want the money immediately perhaps in an hour or so i asked him to make it payable to my order and not to cross the cheque he drew the cheque and gave it to me in his office i then went to the hotel where i was stoppinga place in arundel street strand and sent a commissionaire to the bank for the money he brought it as i had requested in tenpound notes in a few days i discovered that my plan could not be even commenced without the greatest danger of defeating its own object i therefore took the notes to mr derings office and placed them in his safe i suppose that he has long since returned them to the bank there child he said reading this statement aloud that is what i recollect about this matter sign it elsie gave him the pen again sign it dear masteroh thanksthanks a thousand times you dont knowoh you will never know or understandi hopehow precious this document will be for meshe folded the paper in an envelope and placed it in her handbagand for my peoplemy brother and all oh my dear master she stooped and kissed his hand to hide the tears in her eyes athelstans name was safe now whatever happened he would be completely cleared at last why my dear scholarmy dear daughter mr edmund gray was moved himself almost to tears at this unexpected burst of feeling as if there was anything i would not do for you if i could i who have never loved any woman before love one now she is my daughtermy grandchildso your brother will be helped by this little reminiscencewill he actually your brother i wonder if there is anything more that i could remember for you in this uneventful life of mine oh nothat would be too much to hope yet there is a chancejust a chance i wonder if i may tell you there is still time before us if we are at the hall by six we shall do very well it is no more than halfpast four shall i tell you the trouble oh but it is a shame and you with this great work laid upon you nonoi must not oh delilah oh circe for she looked as if in spite of her unwilling words she wanted to tell it very badly indeed nay my dear you must and you shallwhat you are in trouble and you will not tell me what it is youmy scholarmy cleareyed disciple who can see what these dull

is on your mind george was one of mr derings managing clerksyour mr dering you knowmr edmund gray nodded gravely he had no money when we were engaged and we thought that we were going to be quite a poor and humble pair but a great piece of good fortune happened to him for mr dering made him a partner did he very lucky for your friend but i always thought that dering ought to have a partner at his age it was only prudentnecessary even so we were made very happy and i thought we were the luckiest couple in the world but just then there was a discovery made at the officea very singular discoveryi hardly know how to describe it because it is not quite clear to me even yet it was concerned with the buying or selling or transfer of certain stocks and shares and coupons and that kind of thing mr dering seems not to remember having signed the papers concerned there is a fear that they are in wrong hands there is a suspicion of forgery even i am ashamed even to mention such a thing to you but my lovers name has been connected with the business and derings clerk checkleyyou know checkley certainlyderings old servant has openly charged georgeon no evidence to be sureof having forged the letters or of having assisted in the forgery this is very serious it is very serious but we do not intend to let the thing interfere with our wedding only unless i can remove the last ray of suspicion before wednesday we shall spend our honeymoon at home in order to watch the case from day to day buying or selling stocks dering would be constantly doing that it appears that these transactions were the only things of the kind that he has done this year that is to say he denies having done these wellas for these having been the only transactions of the kind he managed a good bit of such business for me this last spring did he do you remember the details of that business clearly it was only yesterday so to speak was it the purchase or transfer of stock or shares certainly to a very large amount i have told you about my industrial village have i not the village where all are to be equalall are to work for a certain time every day and no longerall are to be paid in rations and clothes and houses and there is to be no private propertymy ideal village i know a lovely village it was early in the spring that i finished my designs for it then it occurred to me that it would be well if instead of always going to my lawyer for money i had a large sum at my command lying at my bank so i instructed dering to transfer to my name a great quantity of stocks lying in his name he was a trustee or awellit is rather unusual but i like having all my business affairs managed for me and but this will not interest youthis with the look of irritation or bewilderment which sometimes passed over his face the important thing is that it was done and that my bank received those transfers and has instructions to receive the dividends oh and has all the papers i suppose it had them but i thought that perhaps my old friend might think it looked like want of confidence if i left them there so i sent for them and took them to his office they are now in the safe i put them there myself with my own hand or he did with his own handi forget sometimesit is very oddwhen i think of things done at that office i seem to have done it myself and sometimes i think that he did it not that it matters not at all the papers are actually in the safe again certainly ithat ishehe or iput them there oh my dear masterelsie clapped her handsthis is even more important than the other you do not knowyou cannot guesswhat mischiefs you are able to stop if i had only been able to talk to you about these things before the paper you have already written is for my brother now sit down my master and write another that will do for me i will do anything you ask meand everything but as for this why not ask dering his memory never fails his mind is like a box which holds everything and can never be filled perhaps he would not like these private affairsas between solicitor and clientto be talked about we cannot go to mr dering there are certain reasons which would not interest you all we want is a clear straightforward statement an exact statement of what happened sit down now and write me a full account of each transaction certainly if it will be of the least use to you early in the present year he began i found that my plan of an industrial village if it was to be carried into effect would want all the money i could command it occurred to me that it would be well to transfer a certain sum from the hands of my agent and to place it in my own bank ready to hand i began then in march with a sum of six thousand pounds which dering by my instructions handed over to my bank in the form of shares and stocks i believe they were transfers of certain stocks held by him in his own name but forming part of my fortunemy large private fortune the bank was instructed to receive the dividends on that sum a month or so later i obtained from dering other stock to the value of twelve thousand pounds the papers of which were also given to my bank and after that i took out papers representing twenty thousand pounds so that i had in my hands ready to be sold out and used at a moments notice no less than thirtyeight thousand pounds all this money i intended to devote to my industrial village the scheme is still one in which i put my whole confidence but it has not yet been carried into effect in consequence of the difficulty of finding working men equal to the situation they understand working for the man who has the money they do not understand working for the man who has none that is for each other and for themselves for my own part i could only find working men of that stamp perhaps i am too much in the study i do not go about enough among working men there must be some advanced to my stage of developmentwell for want of men i could not start my village and i have not used the money as for the papers i have taken them out of the bank and placed them in derings safe elsie looked over his shoulder reading every word the letters which mr dering wrote to the stockbroker in accordance with your instructions they were written for himperhapsby you it is unusual but i told you he replied sharply what is the use of saying things twice there are some things which confuse a man i wrote themhe wrote themhe acted for meor i acted for myself what matter the end is as i have written down for younow will this paper be of any use to you of the greatest use please sign it dear master he obeyed and signed edmund gray there is one thing more elsie saw in his face signs of disquiet and hastened on you have got your bank book here yes the manager sent it here with an impertinent note about references which i have sent on to deringwhat do you want with the bank book it is in one of those drawers seehere it ischeque book too if i were you master i would have no more trouble about the money you have given mr dering the transfers and paperswhy not give him back the money as well do not be bothered with money matters it is of all things important to you to be free from all kinds of business and money matters who ever heard of a prophet drawing a cheque you sit here and work and meditate you go to the hall of science and teach it is the business of your friends to see that all your necessities are properly suppliednow if you will in these minor matters suffer your friends to advise surely i ask for nothing else then dear master here is your

threepencei will take care of the chequesooh you have signed edward deringcareless master draw anothernow sign it edmund graythat will doand you had better at the same time write a letter to the bank asking the manager in future to receive the dividends for the account of mr dering i will write the letter and you shall sign it nownononot edward deringedmund gray your thoughts are wanderingtherenow dear master you are free from everything that might trouble you the master pushed back the blottingpad with impatience and rose from the chair elsie took possession of the signed cheques the cheque book the bank book and the letter she had allthe statement in edmund grays own handwritingallallthat was wanted to clear up the business from the beginning to the end she put everything together in her handbag she glanced at her companion she perceived that his face was troubled i wish he said fretfully that you had not worried me with those questions about the past they disturb me the current of my thoughts is checked i am full of dering and his office and his safehis safeand all elsie trembled his face was changingin a minute he would have returned to mr dering and she would have had to explain master she cried laying her hand upon his arm think we are going to the hall of scienceyour hall of scienceyours the people are waiting for their prophet you are to address them tonight you must surpass yourself because there are strangers coming tell usonce againall over againof that world where there is no crime no suffering no iniquity no sin no sorrowwhere there are no poor creatures deprived by a cruel social order of liberty of leisure of comfort of virtue of everythingpoor wretches born only to toil and to endure think of them speak for them plan for them make our hearts burn within us for shame and rage oh masterfor his face was troubled still and doubtful as if he was hovering on the borderland between himself and his other selfno one can speak to them like you no one has your power of speech make them feel that new worldmake them see itactually see it with their earthly eyesmake them feel it in their hearts childhe sighed his face fell back into reposeyou comfort me i was fallingbefore you came to me i often used to fallinto a fit of gloomi dont know why something irritates me something jars something awakens a feeling as if i ought to rememberrememberwhat i do not knowi am better now your voice my dear at such a moment is to me like the sound of davids harp to saul it chases away the shadows oh i am better already i am well if you want to ask any other questions do so as for those transactionsthey are perfectly correct in form and everything i cannot for the life of me understand why dering who is a practical man never mind dering my dear masteror those transactions think only of the world of the new humanity leave the transactions and the papers to me i hope that you will never find out why they were wanted or how they were to be usednow let us start we shall be in excellent time the hall of science was half full of peoplethe usual gatheringthose who came every sunday evening and took the simple feast of fraternity the table was spread with the white cloth on which were laid out the toast and muffins the ham and shrimps and bread and butter and watercress and on the appearance of the chief the tea was brought up and they all sat down now it had been observed by all that since the adhesion of this young lady the leaders discourses had been much more confident his manner had been clearer his points more forcibly put this was because for the first time he had had an opportunity of discussing his own doctrines with a mind able to follow him nothing so valuable to a teacher of new things as a sympathetic woman for listener and disciple witness the leading example of the prophet mohammed also their leader had never before been so cheerfulso hopefulso full of life and youth and spring he was young again he talked like a young man though his hair was gray this was because he loved a woman for the first time in his life he called it paternal affection whatever kind of love it was it worked in him the same miracle that love always works in manyoung or oldit gave him back the fire of youth this evening he sat at the head of the table dispensing his simple hospitality with a geniality and a heartiness unknown before the arrival of this young lady he talked meantime in the lofty vein above the style and manner common to his hearers but not above their comprehension he spoke of a higher life attainable by man at his best when the victory over nature should be complete and every force should be subdued and made slave to man and all diseases should be swept away and the perfect man should stand upon the earth at last lord and master of alladamus redivivus when that time should come there would be no property of course everything was to be in common but the new life would be full of love and joy there would be longcontinued youth so that none should be made to rise from the feast unsatisfied nay it seemed to this dreamer that everyone should continue at the feast as long as he pleased till he was satiated and desired a change longcontinued youth all were to be young and to keep young the girls were to be beautiful and the men strong he pronouncedhethe hermitthe anchoritethe celibate who knew not lovea eulogy on the beauty of women and he mourned over those men who miss their share of love the hearts of those who heard were uplifted for this man had the mesmeric faculty of compelling those who heard him to feel what he wanted them to feel most of them had been accustomed to regard their leader as a man of benevolent manners but austere principles now he was tender and human full of sympathy even with those weak vessels who fall in love and for the sake of love are content to be all their lives slavesyea even slaves to property after tea the tables being cleared the chief pronounced his weekly address or sermon it was generally a discourse on the principles which all professed of equality and the abolition of property tonight he carried on the theme on which he had spoken at teatime and discoursed on the part which should be played by love in the new humanity never before had he spoken so convincingly never had orator an audience more in sympathy with him shortly after the beginning of the address there arrived two gentlemen young and well dressed who sat down modestly just within the door and listened the people turned and looked at them with interest they were not quite the kind of young man peculiar to the street or to the quarter when the lecture was over and the audience crowded together to talk before they separated elsie slipped across to the newcomers and led them to the lecturer master she said this is my brother athelstan mr edmund gray shook hands with him why elsie he said your brother and i have met already in grays inn and this is my friend george austin partner of mr dering mr austin said mr edmund gray i am glad to meet the man who is about to enter into the most sacred of all bonds with one whom i venture to love sir as much as you yourself can do though i love her as my daughter and you love her as your bride you will be the happiest of men take care sir that you deserve your happiness this day said elsie you have rendered us all such a service as can never be acknowledged or repaid or forgotten yet we hope and pray that somehow you will never understand how great it is chapter xxxiv le conseil de famille checkley said mr dering on monday morning here is a note from miss elsie arundel she makes an appointment with me at four oclock this afternoon keep me free for that hour her brother athelstan is coming with herwhats the matter man its coming then i knew it would come checkley groaned its all over at last what is all over everything but dont you believe it tell em its a lie made up to screen themselves they cant prove it nobody can prove it ill back you up only dont you believe it mindit is a liea madeup lie i dont know what has been the matter with you for the last day or two checkley what am i not to believe what is a lie who is making up a lie which cannot be proved oh i cant say the wordi cant its all over at lastat last he ran out of the room and slammed the door behind him my dear motherhilda drove to pembridge square directly after breakfasti have had a most curious letter from elsie what does it mean she ordersshe does not inviteshe positively orderssir samuelactually orders sir samueland myself to attend at mr derings office at four we are ordered to assist she says at the demolition of the structure we have so carefully erectedwhat structure what does she mean here is the letter i too dear have had a letter from her she says that at four oclock this afternoon all the wrongful and injurious suspicions will be cleared away and that if i value the affection of my son and herselfthe affection of herselfi must be presenthilda what does this mean i am very much troubled about the letter on saturday she came here and informed me that the wedding would be held on wednesday just as if nothing had happened and she foretold that we should all be present and that athelstan would give her awayathelstan it is a very disquieting letter because my dear do you think we could all of uscould we possibly be wrong have been wrong from the very beginningin athelstans case could sir samuel be wrong in georges case my dear mother it is impossible the case unhappily is too clear to admit of any doubt sir samuel with his long experience could not be wrong then hilda dear what can elsie mean we have been talking about it all through breakfast the only conclusion we can come to is that there is going to be a smothering up of the whole business mr dering who has been terribly put out with the case must have consented to smother up the matter we think that the papers have been returned with the money received on dividends and coupons and that mr dering has agreed to take no further proceedings now if he would do that athelstan of course would come under a kind of act of indemnity and as the notes were never used by him but were returned to their owner it becomes as easy to recognise his innocence as that of the other mando you see yes but that will not make them innocent certainly not but it makes all the difference in the world oh there are families everywhere who have had to smother up things in order to escape a scandal well i hope you will agree with us and accept the invitation i suppose i mustbut how about removing all the suspicions oh that is only elsies enthusiastic way she will go on if she likes believing that george had nothing to do with it he will have every inducement to live honestly for the future we can easily pretend to believe that athelstan was always innocent and we can persuade himat least i hope we can persuade himto go abroad sir samuel kindly says that he will advance a hundred pounds in order to get rid of him then there will be no scandal and everybody will be satisfied as for our relations with elsie and her husband we can arrange them afterwards perhaps they will agree to live in a distant suburbsay redhill or chislehurst or walthamstowso that there may be a good excuse for never having them to the house becausesmothering or no smotheringi can no longer have the same feelings towards elsie as before her obstinate infatuation for that man exasperates me only to think of it nor have i the least intention of being on intimate relations with a forger who has only just escaped being a convict sir samuel entirely agrees with me the mother sighed i could have wished that we were mistaken perhaps after all there may be something that elsie has found out some unexpected say a miracle at once my dear mother it is just as likely to happen the first to arrive at the office in the afternoon was elsie herself carrying a handbag you were going to bring your brother elsie said mr dering where is he and what is your important business with me i suppose it is something about this wretched forgery which really seems destined to finish me off i have heard of nothing elsei think of nothing elseever since it happened first has anything new been discovered i hardly know mr dering replied wearily they seem to have found the man edmund gray but checkley has suddenly cooled formerly he clamoured perpetually that we must lose no time in getting a warrant for his arrest he now wants to put it off and put it off he was going on very strangely this morning my dear i sometimes think that my old clerk is off his head and you yourselfhave you had any return of your forgetfulness worseworseevery day worse i now know when to look for a return of these fits every morning i ask myself what i did the day before always there are the same hours of forgetfulnessthe morning and the evening last night where was i perhaps somebody will find out for mefor i cannot remember shall i find out for you mr dering if i were to tell you where you spent the evening yesterday would youwould you what how can you find out elsie bent her head the moment had almost arrived and she was afraid she had come with the intention of clearing her brother and her lover at the cost of letting her guardian know that he was insane a dreadful price to pay for their honour but it had to be paid and it must be done in the sight of all so that there should be no possible margin left for malignity or suspicion this business she said concerns the honour of the two men who are dearer to me than all the world beside remember thatnothing short of that would make me do what i have been doingwhat i am now doing their honouroh their honour think what it means to them selfrespect dignity everything the happiness of their homes the pride of their children compared with one mans honour what matters another mans humiliation what matters the loss of that mans selfrespect what matters his loss of dignity their honour mr dering think of thattheir honour he bowed his head gravely wondering what was to follow a mans honour as you say elsie is the greatest thing in the world to him compared with that another mans selfrespect need not i should say as a general principle be considered at all selfrespect may be regained unless honour is lost remember that then mr dering when you hear what i have to say promise me to remember that oh if there were a thousand reasons formerly why i would not pain you by a single word there are ten thousand nowalthough you understand them not why elsie you are troubling your little head about trifles you will not offend me whatever you say it is so important a thing she went on that i have asked my mother and sister and sir samuel to meet us here at four oclock in order that they too may hear as well as you athelstan is with george they have one or two persons to introduce to you all this seems to promise a meeting of some interest and so far as one may judge from the preamble of more than common importance well elsie i am quite in your hands if you and your brother between you will kindly produce the forger and give me back my property i shall be truly grateful you shall see mr dering but as for the gratitudeoh here is sir samuel the city knight appeared large and important he shook hands with elsie and his brother and took up his position on the hearthrug behind his brothers chair well elsie he said we are to hear something very important indeed if one may judge by the tone of your letter which was imperative very important indeed sir samuel the next to arrive were mrs arundel and hilda they wore thick veils and hilda was dressed in a kind of halfmourning they took chairs at the open window between the historic safe and the equally historic small table lastly george and athelstan walked in they received no greetings mr dering rose athelstan he said it is eight years since you left us he held out his hand presently mr dering said athelstan he looked round the room his mother trembled dropped her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes but said nothing his sister looked out of window sir samuel took no notice of him at all athelstan took a chairthe clients chairand placed it so as to have his mother and sister at the side he was not therefore compelled to look at them across the table he sat down and remained in silence and motionless the court was now complete mr dering sat in his chair before his table expectant judicial sir samuel stood behind him mrs arundel and hilda the two ladies sat at the open window elsie stood opposite to mr dering on the other side of the table her handbag before her she looked like counsel about to open the case for plaintiff athelstanor plaintiffnaturally occupied the clients chair on mr derings left and george as naturallythe other plaintiffstood behind him now elsie if you please mr dering began i shall want your clerk checkley to be present if you please mr dering touched his bell the clerk appeared he stood before them like a criminal pale and trembling he looked at his master appealingly his hands hung beside him yet not a word of accusation had been brought against him lord man alive cried sir samuel what on earth has come over you checkley shook his head sadly but made no reply i want to ask you a question or two checkley said elsie quietly you have told mr deringyou have told sir samuelthat you saw my brother furtively put a parcelpresumably the stolen notesinto the safe at the very moment when you were charging him with forgery now consider that was a very serious thing to say it was a direct statement of fact before the charge rested on suspicion alone but this is fact consider carefully you may have been mistaken any of us may make a mistake it was truegospel truthi see him place a parcelalong sidewaysin the safe the parcel we found afterwards in the safe containing all the notes the words were confident but the manner was halting very well next you told sir samuel that my brother had been living in some low suburb of london with profligate companions and that he had been even going about in rags and tatters yes i did i told sir samuel what i heard mr carstone told me youd better ask him i only told what i heard george went out and returned bringing with him mr freddy carstone he looked round the room and stared with surprise at mr dering but said nothing he had been warned to say nothing except in answer to questions now mr carstone elsie asked him how long is it since you met my brother after his return to england about three weeks ago i met him it was in holborn i invited him into the salutation tavern did you tell mr checkley here anything about his way of living i remember saying foolishly that he looked too respectable to have come from america and i said in joke that i believed he had been in camberwell all the time nothing about profligacy nothing at all nothing about rags and tatters certainly not in fact i knew nothing at all about athelstans life during the eight years that he has been away have you anything to say checkley you still stick to the parcel story do you very well and to the camberwell and profligacy story checkley made no answer now then there is another question you made a great point about certain imitations of mr derings writing found in a drawer of athelstans table well they were there in your brothers hand george you have something to say on this point only this i was not long articled at that time the table was taken from the room in which i sat and placed here for some special work now the imitations of mr derings handwriting were made by myself and another clerk in joke i remember them perfectly they were written at the back of a letter addressed to me mr dering went to the safe and produced the bundle containing all the papers in the case he unrolled the bundle and placed the contents on the table everybody was now serious lady dering looked out of the window no longer mrs arundel had drawn her chair to the table elsie picked out the paper containing the imitations tell me she said if you remembermindeverybodythis bundle of papers has never been shown to georgetell me the name of your correspondent it was leonard henryson she gave the paper to mr dering you see she said the lawyer gave it to his brother who passed it on to his wife who gave it to her mother mrs arundel laid it on the table and raised her veil the next point said elsie is about athelstans whereabouts during the last eight years one letter was received by you mr dering four years ago you have already shown it to me will you let me read this letter aloud for all to hear it was in the bundle with the stopped notes he bowed assentand she read it twelve thousand pounds cried sir samueltwelve thousand pounds all he had good heavens all he had in the world said elsie and all for a child who refused to believe that her brother could be a villain all he had in the world her eyes filled with tearsbut she dashed them aside and went on he was in the states four years ago that i suppose will no longer be denied the next question iswhen did he return to this country george left the room again and returned with a young gentleman this gentleman elsie continued comes from messrs chenery sons bankers of new york and london he has brought a letter with him will you kindly let me see it sirit is she explained a letter of credit brought over by my brother from california you see the datejune th of this year mr dering read it and gave it to his brother who gave it to his wife as before it says that mr athelstan arundel one of the staff of a certain californian paper will leave new york on june the st by the shannon and that he is authorised to draw on messrs chenery sons for so muchthank you the young gentleman retired now mr dering are you satisfied that athelstan was in america four years agothat he left america two months ago and that he was then on the staff of a californian paper there seems no reason to doubt these factsbuthe put his forefinger on the cheque payable to the order of edmund grayare we any nearer to the forger of this cheque i am coming to that presently i am going to show you all so that there shall be no doubt whatever who is the forgerthe one handin the business wait a little strangely enough every eye fell upon checkley who now trembled and shook with every sign of terror sit down checkley said his masterelsie do we want this gentleman any longer his name i have not the pleasure of knowing oh come said mr carstone who was nearest you know my name surely george warned him with a look and he subsided into silence i think i shall want you mr carstone elsie replied if you will kindly take a chair and waitnow sir samuel i think i am right in saying that your belief in the guilt of george rested entirely on the supposed complicity of athelstan that gone what becomes of your charge also there is no doubt i believe that one hand and one hand alone has committed the whole long list of letters and forgeries if therefore athelstan could not execute the second business how could he do the first but i have more than arguments for you sir samuel coughed mrs arundel sighed as regards the charge against george apart from his supposed intimacy with an imaginary criminal the only suspicious thing is that he may have had access to the open safe well checkley also may have had accessdont be afraid checkleywe are not going to charge you with the thing at all you are not the forger in fact there was a third person who had access to the safe she opened her handbag and took out a packet of papers then she sat down with these in her hand and leaning over the table she looked straight and full into mr derings eyes and began to talk slowly in a low and murmuring voice and now indeed everybody understood that something very serious indeed was going to be said and done at the last moment a way had occurred to elsie she would let them all see for themselves what had happened and she would spare her guardian the bitter shame and pain of being exposed in the presence of all this company mr dering she began you have strangely forgotten that you know mr edmund gray how could you come to forget that why it is ten years at least since you made his acquaintance he knows you very well he does not pretend to have forgotten you you are his solicitor you have the management of his propertyhis large private fortunein your hands you are his most intimate friend it is not well to forget old friends is it you must not say that you forget edmund gray mr dering changed colour his eyes expressed bewilderment he made no reply you know that edmund gray leaves this room every evening on his way to grays inn you remember that and that he comes here every morning but not till eleven or twelvetwo hours after the time that you yourself used to come his head is always so full of his thoughts and his teaching that he forgets the time between twelve and four just as you forget the evening and the morning you are both so much absorbed that you cannot remember each other mr dering sat upright the tips of his fingers touching he listened at first gravelythough anxiously presently a remarkable change passed over his face he became full of anxiety he listened as if he was trying to remember as if he was trying to understand edmund gray he said speaking slowly yes i remember my client edmund gray i have a letter to write for him what is it excuse me a moment i must write that note for him he took pen and paper and hastily wrote a note which elsie took from him read and gave to sir samuel you want to tell the banker that mr edmund gray has returned you the transfersyesthank you i thought you could not forget that client of all others he leaned back smilinghis expression no longer anxious but pleased and happy the change transformed him he was not mr dering but another go on child the rooms of grays inn are quiet all day long it is a peaceful place for study is it not you sit there your books before you the world forgotten quite forgotten said mr dering nono cried checkley springing to his feet i wont have it done i sit down george pushed him back into his chair another word and you leave the room it is a peaceful day elsie continued that you passfor the most part aloneyou with your books sometimes you come here to call upon your old friend and solicitor mr dering sometimes he replied we are very old friends though his views are narrowwhere is he he looked about the room you are all waiting to see him he will be here directly he is always here about this time yes directly you remember what i said to you on sunday concerning certain transactions i told you how important it was to have the exact truth about them certainly i remember i wrote an account of them for you you did are these papers what you wrote he looked at them for a moment these are my papers he said they are what i wrote at your request they contain a perfectly true account of what happened now before i go on you will not mindthese people here do not know mr edmund grayyou will not mind my asking a few persons to testify that you are really mr edmund gray my dear child ask all the world if you wish though i do not understand why my identity should be doubted not quite all the worldmr carstone will you tell us the name of this gentleman he is mr edmund gray my neighbour at no south square grays inn mr edmund gray inclined his head and smiled george went outside and returned followed by a small company who in answer to elsie stepped forward one after the other and made answer said one i am the landlord of the rooms at south square tenanted by mr edmund gray he has held the rooms for ten years this gentleman is mr edmund gray my tenant said another i am a barrister and the tenant of the rooms above those held by mr edmund gray i have known himmore or lessfor ten years this gentleman is mr edmund gray said a third i am a commissionaire i remember this gentleman very well though it is eight years since he employed me and only for one job then i went from an hotel in arundel street strand to a bank with a cheque which i was to cash for him in tenpound notes he gave me half a sovereign quite so said mr edmund gray i remember you too it was a cheque for seven hundred and twenty pounds the particulars of which you have in my statement elsie i well remember this onearmed commissionaire and a fourth i am the laundress who does for mr edmund gray i have done for him for ten years this gentleman is mr edmund gray and a fifth i am a newsagent and i have a shop at the entrance of grays inn this gentleman is mr edmund gray of south square i have known him in the inn for ten years to each in turn mr dering nodded with a kindly smile athelstan said elsie will you tell us when and where you have met mr edmund gray i met him last week in carstones rooms on the same landing he sat with us for an hour or more it is quite true said mr dering i have had the pleasure of meeting mr arundel on that occasion i also saw him athelstan continued at a small lecture hall at kentish town on sunday eveningyesterday to complete the evidence said elsie i have myself spent many hours almost daily with mr edmund gray during the last fortnight or sois not that true dear master quite true my scholar brotherbrothersir samuel touched his armi implore yourouse yourself shake off this fancy let him alone sir samuel said georgelet him alone we have not done with him yet yes cried mrs arundel who had now left her seat and was leaning over the table following what was said with breathless interestlet us finish out this comedy or tragedyas the case may be let no one interrupt i have also met you sirmr dering addressed checkley who only groaned and shook it was outside a tavern you took me in and offered me a drink checkley shook his head either in sadness or in denialbut replied not and at the thought of offering mr dering a drink everybody laughed which was a relief dear master elsie went on in her soft voice i am so glad that you remember all these things it makes ones task so much easier why your memory is as strong as ever in spite of all your worknow i am going to read the two statements you wrote down yesterday afternoon then you may recall anything else you might like to add remember that as regards this first affair the cheque for seven hundred and twenty pounds my brother was charged on suspicion only with having forged it now listen she read the brief statement which you have already seen concerning the business of the first cheque that is your history of the affair quite so dering drew the cheque at my request i cashed it i found that i had no need of the notes and i returned them that is very simple it is all so simple that nobody ever guessed it beforenow we come to the transfers made in the spring of the present year you wrote a second statement regarding them i will read that as well please listen very carefully she read the other statement which you have also seen already she read it very slowly so that there should be no mistake possible during the reading of these documents sir samuels face expressed every possible shade of surprise mrs arundel leaning over the table followed every line hilda wepther head gracefully inclined over her pockethandkerchief as if it was an urn this is your account of the business certainly there is nothing more to be added it is a plain statement of the facts i do not understand how they could be in any way doubted or misrepresented would you sir samuel like to ask mr edmund gray any question i dont understand he says that mr dering wrote a letter for him elsie showed him the letter they had seen mr dering write which he was passing from one to the other where are the transfers sir samuel went on he says they were placed by himself in the safe mr edmund gray rose and walked to the safe he laid his hands upon a packet and took it out these are the papers he said sir samuel opened the roll and looked them over they seem all right he said this is very wonderful wonderfuland sadmost lamentable whispered lady dering wonderful indeed mrs arundel echoed most wonderful most unexpected a moment more and i have done elsie again took up the tale here is a cheque to the order of mr dering signed by mr edmund gray for the whole of the money lying in his name at the bankyou agree master that it is best for the future that all your affairs should be in the hands of your solicitor i quite agree here is a letter to the manager of the bank requesting him to pay over edmund grays dividends to the account of mr deringand now i think i have proved my case here in the safe were the tenpound notes received by mr edmund gray and placed there by him here were the transfers and certificates placed there by him you have heard halfadozen people testify to the fact that you have edmund gray before you his statement of the business has been read to you it shows what no other theory of the case could show how the thing was really done lastly it shows the absolute and complete innocence of my brother and of georgehave you anything more to say sir samuel nothingexcept that i was misled by a statement concerning a profligate life among low companions without which no suspicion could have fallen upon either of you gentlemen it washe pointed to the unhappy checkleya vile and malignant falsehood do you hear sir vile and malignant it only remains for us all to make such reparation as we maynothing would suffice i know but such reparation as we canby the expression of the shame and regret that we all feel athelstan said his mother what can i say oh what can i say athelstan roseduring the long business he had sat motionless in the clients chair his head in his hand now he rose and stepped over to his mother hush he said not a word it is all forgottenall forgiven but hilda sank upon her knees and caught his hands george said sir samuel forgive me the case looked black against you at one time it did indeed forgive me he held out his hand then there was great handshaking embracing and many tears as for checkley he crept out and vanished in the retreat of his own room it is all over he murmuredall over ive lost four hundred pounds a year thats gone all overall over mr edmund gray looked on this happy scene of family reconciliation with benevolence and smiles family reconciliations must not be prolonged you cannot sit over a family reconciliation as over a bottle of port it must be quickly despatched sir samuel whispered to hilda that they had better go come said lady dering we will all meet again this evening at pembridge squareand tomorrow eveningand on wednesday afternoonelsie you are a witch and a sorceress and a wise woman you said that athelstan should give you away and he willbrother come with us leave elsie to georgeoh how handsome you are looking my poor illused brother try to forgive us if you can she turned to mr edmund gray sir she said we ought to be very grateful to youindeed we arefor enabling us to clear away the odious cloud of suspicion which had rolled over our heads it was very good of you to draw out those statements for my sister but i do think that if mr dering had told his old friends about youabout mr edmund graywe should have been spared a great deal of trouble and unnecessary shamegoodday sir sir samuel lingered a moment he looked as if he would appeal to mr edmund gray as to a brother dont speak to him elsie whispered let him alone he will become himself again presently let him alone so he went out and the door was shut and edmund gray was left alone with george and the scholar my masterelsie sat down beside himi fear you have been interrupted but indeed it was necessary dont ask why things get into a muddle sometimes dont they you have gathered something of the trouble too now that is all overpast and gone i am glad for your sake child masterdear masteri have a confession to make when i found out who you werei mean what manner of man you weremy only thought at first was to coax you and wheedle you and flatter you till you gave me exactly the information that i wanted i confess it that was my only purpose naymorefor the sake of my lover and my brother i would do it again welli found that the only way to win your confidence was to pretend to be your scholar and to believe all you taught so i pretended so i won your confidence so i obtained all i wanted so i have made it impossible for even the most malignant creature in the world to pretend that these two men had anything to do with what they called a forgery butbelieve me dear masterwhile i pretended i was punished because my pretence is turned to certainty child i knew it you could not pretendno woman could pretend so as to deceive me on a point so simple dear master you do not know the possibilities of feminine craft but i pretend no more oh i care not how you make your attempt whether you destroy property or not mr dering says that property is civilisationbut i dont care to me it is enough to dreamto knowthat there is an earthly paradise possible if only men will think so and will keep it before their eyes though it be as far off as the blue hills it is beautiful only to think of it the soul is lifted up only to think that there is such a place keep the eyes of your people on this glorious place dear master make it impossible for them to forget it or to let it go out of their sight then halfunconsciously they will be running dragging each other forcing each otherexhorting each other to hurry along the dusty road which leads to that earthly paradise with its foursquare city of the jasper wall preach about it master write about it make all men talk about it and think about it she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him master we shall be away for a month or two then we shall come back and i shall sit at your feet again you shall come and stay with us we will give you love and you shall give us hope i have made my confession forgive me they left him sitting alone presently he arose put all the papers back in the safe and walked slowly awayto grays inn next morning when he opened his letters he found one marked private it was from sir samuel dear edward it saidwe are all very glad to tell you that the business of the shares and certificates is now completely cleared up checkley is not in any way concerned in itnor is george austin and i am happy to say there is a complete solution of the former mystery which entirely clears hildas brother under these circumstances we are agreed that it is best for you not to trouble yourself about any further investigations you will find in the safe the transfers a cheque to yourself of all the money received by edmund gray and an order in the bank concerning the dividends you have been the victim of a very remarkable hallucination i need not explain further mr edmund gray however is undoubtedly insane i hear and have myself observed that you have been greatly disturbed and distressed by these mysterious events now that they are settled finallyi may say that only a happy chance set us on the right trackwe all hope that you will be satisfied with our assurance and that you will not trouble yourself any more in the matteryour affectionate brother samuel dering mr dering after reading this letter got up and looked in the safe where he found the papers referred to he rang the bell checkley who has been at my safe nobody but you dont tell lies who put those papers in the safe they must have been put there yesterdayyou were in the room yesterdaywhat happened yesterday checkley was silent who was here yesterdaygo on checkley dont be afraid sir samuel was hereand lady deringand mrs arundeland miss elsieand your partnerand mr athelstan two or three more came in and went away that will do you need tell me no more i dont want to know the particularscheckley my days work is done i have thought so for some time past now i am certain i shall retire nono cried checkley the tears running down his face not to retireafter all these yearsnot to retire i know now the meaning of my fits of forgetfulness i have feared and suspected it for a long time while i am lost to myself i am going about the world doing i know not what and i will not ask i may be this edmund gray who preaches socialism and gives me his precious tracts i may be some one else i say checkley that i know now what has happened to me deny it if you canif you can i say checkley did not offer any denial he hung his head this is the meaning of elsies strange hints and queer protestations half my time i am a madmana madmancheckley ask mr austin to come to me at once my day is done he closed his open blottingpad and placed the unopened letters beside it then he rose and pushed back his chairthe chair in which he had sat for fifty years and more my day is donemy day is done chapter xxxv the last mr dering left his office went back to grays inn and sat down again before the ivory gate those who have once sat for an hour or two in this place return to it again and again and never leave it it is to begin with the most beautiful gate ever erected the brain and wit and fancy of man could never conceive such a gate could never execute such a conception it is all of pure ivory carved with flowers such as never grew curving and flowing lines leading nowhere figures of maidens lovely beyond all dreams philosophers whose wisdom reaches unto the heavens statesmen who discern the gathering forces and control the destinies of a nation inventors who conquer nature physicians who prolong life ecclesiastics who convert the carthusian cell into a bower of delight poets who here find their fantasies divine men and women in a workaday dress who wear the faces of the heavenly host all the dreamers lie here not asleep but dreaming their eyes are open but they do not see each other they see these dreams those of the young who are also generous come here and dream until they grow older and are chained to their work and can dream no more men of all conditions come hereeven the little shopboyeven the maiden who cleans the knives and polishes the bootsall are here the young prince is here the little charity boy is here the lad whose loftiest ambition is that he may one day stand in the pulpit of the little baptist village chapel is here here is the undergraduate who was captain of eton and will be senior classic and member of parliament and ministereven prime ministerand will belong to history the poet is here and the painter and sometimes hither comes the novelist and but more rarely the dramatist hither comes the musician to lift up his soul with thoughts that only music can give and the singer so that he sings more than is apparent from the words and the actor so that he puts things into the play never dreamed by him who wrote it great is the power great the gifts of this noble gate of ivory sitting before that gate such a dreamer as edmund gray receives strange visions he sees clearly and near at hand the things which might be yet are not and never can be until man lays down his garb of selfishness and puts on the white robes of charity to that dreamer the kingdom of heaven which seems to some so far off and to others impossible so that they deride the name of it is actually close at handwith useasy to enter if we only choose he exhorts his fellows to enter with him and they would follow but they cannot because they are held back by custom and necessity they must obey the laws of the multitude and so they stay where they are and when the dreamer passes away his memory is quickly lost and the brightness quickly leaves those dimlylighted lives yet other dreamers comeevery day there arises an edmund gray now when edmund gray takes the place of edward dering in which guise does the soul in the end leave the earth are the dreams of edmund gray perhaps the logical development of the doctrines held by edward dering is the present stage of individual propertywhere every man works for himself and his householdone through which the world must pass before it can reach the higher level of working each for all first men and women hunt separate they live apart in hollow trees and caves then they live together and the man hunts for his wife and children next they live in communities which grow into towns and tribes and nations then men rely upon the protection of the law and work for themselves again that is our present stage it has lasted longvery long perhaps it will break up some day perhaps sooner than we think who knows all things are possibleeven the crash and wreck of a civilisation which has taken thousands of years to build up and upon it may comeone knows notthat other stage which now belongs to the dreamer before the ivory gate the wedding was held then as elsie said it should be shorn of none of its splendours and relieved of the cloud which had hung over them so long and threatened them so gloomily athelstan the exileathelstan the neerdowellathelstan the profligateathelstan the resident of camberwellathelstan the smirched and soiledstood beside the altar tall and gallant and gave away the bride for all the world to seenobody in the least ashamed of him there was not any breath of scandal left here he was returned from his travels a tall and proper man dressed in broadcloth perhaps with money in purse prosperous and successful in the sight of all his mother gazed upon him when she should have been looking at the bride or into her prayer book her eyes were red but then a mother is allowed a tear or two when her daughter leaves the nest and as to those who had whispered words about family jars quarrels and estrangements or had spoken against the fair fame of the groom they were now as mute as mice all the richer members of the house of arundelthe city arundelswere present one of themchief partner in a leading firm of accountantsafterwards computed for the greater increase of the family glory how many hundreds of thousands of pounds were gathered together at one moment beneath that sacred roof he counted the members and made that little addition during the performance of the ceremony those of the austins who were not disgracefully poorthere are some branches of the family i believe pretty low downwere also present and the company went to pembridge square after the service gazed admiringly at the wedding presents and drank the health of the bride and bridegroom and gathered with cousinly curiosity round the returned prodigal but they knew nothingmind youof his connection with camberwell and nothing about his supposed complicity in the edmund gray business there had been happily no scandal among the company in the church was mr dering he stood tall and erect his coat buttoned his face keen and hard the family lawyer stamped by nature and long custom presently when the service was about half way through a change came over him his face relaxed the lines curved just a little laterally the austerity vanished his eyes brightened he took off his gloves furtively and opened his coat he was edmund gray in that capacity he afterwards drank to the bride and wished her happiness and he walked all the way from pembridge square to south square grays inn i see in the future an old man growing feeble he leans upon the arm of a girl whom he calls his scholar his disciple and his child his face is serene he is perfectly happy the advent of that kingdom whose glories he preaches is very nigh at hand he lives in the house of his disciple he has forgotten the very existence of his lawyer he goes no more to lincolns inn always he is lying night and day before that miracle of carven work in ivory there he watchesit is his visionthe long procession of those who work and sing at their work and are happy work they ever so hard because they work each for all and all for each and there is no more sorrow or crying and no more pain what hath the gate of hornthrough which is allowed nothing but what is truebitterly trueabsolutely truenakedly coldly shiveringly trueto show in comparison with this a crowd trampling upon each other men who enslave and rob each other men and women and children lying in miserymen and women and children starvinglet us fly my brotherslet us swiftly flylet us hastento the gate of ivory opinions of the press on the ivory gate by walter besant the novel shows us throughout that mr besant is one of those fortunates who find fresh material mr besant is a popular novelist but he shows here an artists appreciation of whimsical contrast and an artists skill in the delineation of character we are inclined to think the ivory gate worthy of the past reputation of mr besant and indicative of future developmentspeaker it would be impossible to discuss at length the many and great merits of the ivory gate without telling the story and it is certainly a story to be read not to be told our interest in the story never flags for a moment neither in the golden butterfly nor the chaplain of the fleet are there any characters to equal the city knight sir samuel dering and his wife hilda or the old clerk checkleysaturday review the writing in the ivory gate has that nameless charm which belongs to everything that comes from mr besants pennational review the complications arising from the situation are cleverly worked out with all the love of detail and the dramatic skill which always distinguishes mr besants workmanshiptimes the subject of the novel is a strong one and it might have been made most powerful but the dreams that come to mr dering through the ivory gate are such happy ones and he himself is so much more lovable dreaming than awake that the pathos of the situation does not weigh too heavily upon the readerguardian a story told in the authors happiest manner the spirit which pervades the story is akin to that which pervades all sorts and conditions of men there is a good deal of the feeling of dickens in this pleasantly interesting storysporting life the story is interesting imaginative abounding in matter for thought and is in mr besants happiest styledaily news mr besants story is a solid boon a fantasy in which he half escapes from the commonplace veracities of existence and yet keeps his readers feet on the london flagstones throughoutathenaeum a delightful work a charming tale full of life and interest as a story it is in all respects excellent it is worked out with skill and power there are many very fine passages the ivory gate is charming in its originality and in the simplicity and force with which the plot is developedscotsman there is a good deal that is pleasant in the ivory gate both hero and heroine are admirabledaily chronicle mr besant has hit on rather a felicitous subject which is very well wrought outwe venture to predict that hours spent over the ivory gate will be pleasantscottish leader mr besant illustrates a very curious phase of madness he preaches a highly poetical kind of socialism and he gives us a clear and attractive picture of ordinary english life
