golden butterfly was first published this story is inscribed by the authors preface the golden butterfly which gives a name to this novel was seen by an english traveller two years ago preserved as a curiosity in a mining city near sacramento where it probably still remains this curious freak of nature is not therefore an invention of our own to the same traveller mr edgar besant we are indebted for the description on which is based our account of empire city the striking of oil in canada in the manner described by gilead p beck was accomplished with the waste of millions of gallons of the oil for want of casks and buckets to receive it and with the result of a promise of almost boundless wealth by a man named shaw some ten years ago shaw speculated we believe lost his money and died in poverty names of great living poets and writers have been used in this book in connection with a supposed literary banquet a critic has expressed surprise that we have allowed gilead beck's failure to appreciate browning to stand as if it were our own is a writer of fiction to stop the action of his story in order to explain that it is his character's opinion and not his own that he states and it surely is not asking too much to demand of a critic that he should consider first of all the consistency of a character's actions or speeches gilead beck a man of no education and little reading but of considerable shrewdness finds browning unintelligible and harsh what other verdict could be expected if the whole of empire city in its palmiest days had been canvassed moreover we have never even from that great writer's most ardent admirers heard an opinion that he is either easy to read or musical the compliments which mr beck paid to the guests who honoured his banquet are of course worded just as he delivered them gilead beck's experiences as an editor are taken with a little dressing from the actual experiences of a living canadian journalist from their virginian home jack dunquerque and phillis his wife send greetings to those who have already followed their fortunes she only wishes us to add that mr abraham dyson was right and that the coping stone of every woman's education is

speaker who was leading by a half a length turned in his saddle and looked at his companion push on growled the chief who was a man of few words if you were not so intolerably conceited about the value of your words hang it man you are not the poet laureate you might give your reasons why we should not camp where we are the sun will be down in two hours the way is long the wind is cold or will be soon this pilgrim has tightened his belt to stave off the gnawing at his stomach here is running water here is wood here is everything calculated to charm the poetic mind even of captain ladds road interrupted his fellow traveller pointing along the track marked more by deep old wheel ruts grown over with grass than by any evidences of engineering skill roads lead to places places have beds beds are warmer than grass no rattlesnakes in beds miners in hotels amusing fellows miners if ever i go out again after buffaloes or bear or mountain deer or any other game whatever which this great continent offers with a monosyllabic man may i be condemned to another two months of buffalo steak without worcester sauce such as i have had already may i be poisoned with bad bourbon whisky may i never again see the sweet shady side of pall mall may i here he stopped suddenly for want of imagination to complete the curse the first speaker was a young man of four and twenty the age which is to my sex what eighteen is to the other because at four and twenty youth and manhood meet he of four and twenty is yet a youth inasmuch as women are still angels every dinner is a feast every man of higher rank is a demigod and every book is true he is a man inasmuch as he has the firm step of manhood he has passed through his calf love he knows what claret means and his heart is set upon the things for which boys care nothing he is a youth because he can still play a game of football and rejoice amazingly in a boat race he is a man because he knows that these things belong to the past and that to concern one's self seriously with athletics when you can no longer be an athlete in the games is to put yourself on the level of a rowing coach or the athletic critic of a sporting paper being only four and twenty the speaker was in high spirits he was also hungry he was always both what has life better to offer than a continual flow of animal spirits and a perpetual appetite he was a tall slight and perhaps rather a weedy youth a little too long of leg a little too narrow in the beam a little spare about the shoulders but a youth of a ruddy and a cheerful countenance to say that the lines of his face were never set to gravity would be too much because i defy any man to laugh when he is sleeping eating or drinking at all other times this young man was ready to laugh without stopping not a foolish cackle of idiotic vacuity such as may be heard in earlswood asylum or at a tea party to meet the curate but a cheerful bubble of mirth and good humour proof that the spirit within took everything joyously seeing in every misadventure its humorous side and in every privation its absurdity the other who rode beside him was some years older at least a man of thirty five or perhaps more a man with a hatchet face nose and forehead in one straight line long chin and long upper lip in another face red with health as well as bronzed with the sun a good honest face supernaturally grave grave beyond all understanding lips that were always tightly closed eyes which sometimes sparkled in response to some genial thought or bubbled over at some joke of his companion but which as a rule were like gimlets for sternness so that strangers especially stranger servants the nigger of jamaica the guileless hindoo of his indian station and other members of the inferior human brotherhood trembled exceedingly when they met those eyes captain ladds was accordingly well served as cold reserved men generally are mankind takes everything unknown pro terribili for something dreadful and until we learn to know a man and think we know him he is to be treated with the respect due to a possible enemy hostis means a stranger and it is for strangers that we keep our brickbats people who knew ladds laughed at this reputation they said the gallant captain was a humbug they pretended that he was as gentle as a turtle dove beneath those keen eyes they said and behind that sharp hatchet face lurked the most amiable of dispositions at any rate ladds was never known to thrash a native servant or to swear more than is becoming and needful at a syce while his hatchet face had been more than once detected in the very act of looking as soft and tender as a young mother's over her first born the name of this cavalier was short and simple it was thomas ladds his intimate friends called him tommy they were in california and were not buffalo hunting now because there is not a buffalo within five hundred miles of sacramento their buffalo hunting was over having been accompanied by such small hardships as have been already alluded to they rode along a track which was as much like a road as richmond park is like the forest of arden they were mounted on a pair of small nervous mustangs their saddles were the mexican saddles used in the country in front of which was the never failing horn round this was wound the horsehair lariat which serves the western nimrod for lassoing by day and for keeping off snakes at night no snake having ever been known to cross this barrier of bristly horsehair you might as well expect a burgling coolie smeared with oil and naked to effect his escape by crawling through a hedge of prickly pear also because they were in a foreign land and wished to be in harmony with its institutions they wore immense steel spurs inlaid with silver filigree and furnished with lobs attached to them which jangled and danced to make melody just as if they formed part of an illustration to a christmas book boots of course they wore and the artistic instinct which a year before had converted the younger man into a thing of beauty and a joy for the whole park in the afternoon now impelled him to assume a cummerbund of scarlet silk with white tasselled fringes the like of which perhaps had never before been seen on the back of a californian mustang his companion was less ornate in his personal appearance both men carried guns and if a search had been made a revolver would have been found either hidden in the belt of each or carried perdu in the trousers pocket in these days of pacific railways and scampering globe trotters one does not want to parade the revolver but there are dark places on the earth from the traveller's as well as from the missionary's point of view where it would be well to have both bowie and derringer ready to hand on the american continent the wandering lamb sometimes has to lie down with the leopard the harmless gazelle to journey side by side with the cheetah and the asp may here and there pretend to play innocently over the hole of the cockatrice behind the leaders followed a little troop of three consisting of one english servant and two greasers the latter were dressed in plain unpretending costume of flannel shirt boots and rough trousers behind each hung his rifle the english servant was dressed like his master but more so his spurs being heavier the pattern of his check shirt being larger his saddle bigger only for the silk cummerbund he wore a leather strap the last symbol of the honourable condition of dependence he rode in advance of the greasers whom he held in contempt and some thirty yards behind the leaders the mexicans rode in silence smoking cigarettes perpetually sometimes they looked to their guns or they told a story or one would sing a snatch of a song in a low voice mostly they were grave and thoughtful though what a greaser thinks about has never yet been ascertained the country was so far in the far west that the sierra nevada lay to the east it was a rich and beautiful country there were park like tracts supposing the park to be of a primitive and early settlement kind stretching out to the left these were dotted with white oaks to the right rose the sloping sides of a hill which were covered with the brush wood called the chaparelle in which grew the manzanita and the scrub oak with an occasional cedar pine not in the least like the cedars of lebanon and clapham common hanging about in the jungle or stretching its arms along the side of the dry water course which ran at the traveller's feet beside the road was the wild vine loaded with its small and pretty grapes now ripe nature in inventing the wild grape has been as generous as in her gift of the sloe it is a fruit of which an american once observed that it was calculated to develop the generosity of a man's nature because he explained you would rather give it to your neighbour than eat it yourself the travellers were low down on the western slopes of the sierra they were in the midst of dales and glades canyons and gulches of perfect loveliness shut in by mountains which rose over and behind them like friendly giants guarding a troop of sleeping maidens pelion was piled on ossa as peak after peak rose higher all clad with pine and cedar receding farther and farther till peaks became points and ridges became sharp edges it was autumn and there were dry beds which had in the spring been rivulets flowing full and clear from the snowy sides of the higher slopes yet among them lingered the flowers of april upon the shrubs and the colours of the fading leaves mingled with the hues of the autumn berries a sudden turn in the winding road brought the foremost riders upon a change in the appearance of the country below them to the left stretched a broad open space where the ground had been not only cleared of whatever jungle once grew upon it but also turned over they looked upon the site of one of the earliest surface mining grounds the shingle and gravel stood about in heaps the gullies and ditches formed by the miners ran up and down the face of the country like the wrinkles in the cheek of a baby monkey old pits not deep enough to kill but warranted to maim and disable lurked like man traps in the open the old wooden aqueducts run up by the miners in the year ' were still standing where they were abandoned by the pioneers here and there lay about old washing pans rusty and broken old cradles and bits of rusty metal which had once belonged to shovels these relics and signs of bygone gatherings of men were sufficiently dreary in themselves but at intervals there stood the ruins of a log house or a heap which had once been a cottage built of mud palestine itself has no more striking picture of desolation and wreck than a deserted surface mine they drew rein and looked in silence presently they became aware of the presence of life right in the foreground about two hundred yards before them there advanced a procession of two the leader of the show so to speak was a man he was running he was running so hard that anybody could see his primary object was speed after him with heavy stride seeming to be in no kind of hurry and yet covering the ground at a much greater rate than the man there came a bear a real old grisly a bear who was shadowing the man and meant claws a bear who had an insult to avenge and was resolved to go on with the affair until he had avenged it a bear too who had his enemy in the open where there was nothing to stop him and no refuge for his victim but the planks of a ruined log house could he find one both men without a word got their rifles ready the younger threw the reins of his horse to his companion and dismounted then he stood still and watched the most exhilarating thing in the whole world is allowed to be a hunt no greater pleasure in life than that of the shekarry especially if he be after big game on this occasion the keenness of the sport was perhaps intensified to him who ran by the reflection that the customary position of things was reversed no longer did he hunt the bear the bear hunted him no longer did he warily follow up the game the game boldly followed him no joyous sound of horns cheered on the hunter no shout such as those which inspirit the fox and put fresh vigour into the hare not even the short eager bark of the hounds at the sound of which reynard begins to think how many of his hundred turns are left it was a silent chase the bear who represented in himself the field men in scarlet ladies master pack and everything set to work in a cold unsympathetic way infinitely more distressing to a nervous creature than the cheerful ringing of a whole field to hunt in silence would be hard for any man to be hunted in silence is intolerable grisly held his head down and wagged it from side to side while his great silent paws rapidly cleared the ground and lessened the distance tommy whispered the young fellow i can cover him now wait jack don't miss give grisly two minutes more gad how the fellow scuds tommy you see obeyed the instinct of nature he loved the hunt if not to hunt actively to witness a hunt it is the same feeling which crowds the benches at a bullfight in spain it was the same feeling which lit up the faces in the coliseum when hermann formerly of the danube prisoner taken red handed in revolt and therefore moriturus performed with vigour sympathy and spirit the role of actaeon ending as we all know in a splendid chase by bloodhounds after which the poor teuton maddened by his long flight and exhausted by his desperate resistance was torn to pieces fighting to the end with a rage past all acting it is our modern pleasure to read of pain and suffering those were the really pleasant days to the roman ladies when they actually witnessed living agony give grisly two minutes said captain ladds by this time the rest of the party had come up and were watching the movements of man and bear in the plain stood the framework of a ruined wooden house man made for log house bear without any apparent effort but just to show that he saw the dodge and meant that it should not succeed put on a spurt and the distance between them lessened every moment fifty yards forty yards man looked round over his shoulder the log house was a good two hundred yards ahead he hesitated seemed to stop for a moment bear diminished the space by a good dozen yards and then man doubled getting pumped said ladds the critical then he too dismounted and stood beside the younger man giving the reins of both horses to one of the mexicans mustn't let grisly claw the poor devil he murmured let me bring him down tommy bring him down young un the greasers looked on and laughed it would have been to them a pleasant termination to the play had bruin clawed the man neither hunter nor quarry saw the party clustered together on the rising ground on which the track ran man saw nothing but the ground over which he flew bear saw nothing but man before him the doubling manoeuvre was however the one thing needed to bring grisly within easy reach faster flew the man but it was the last flight of despair had the others been near enough they would have seen the cold drops of agony standing on his forehead they would have caught his panting breath they would have heard his muttered prayer let him have it growled ladds it was time grisly swinging along with leisurely step rolling his great head from side to side in time with the cadence of his footfall one roll to every half dozen strides like a fat german over a trois temps waltz suddenly lifted his face and roared then the man shrieked then the bear stopped and raised himself for a moment pawing in the air then he dropped again and rushed with quickened step upon his foe then but then ping one shot it has struck grisly in the shoulder he stops with a roar good young un said ladds bringing piece to shoulder this time grisly roars no more he rolls over he is shot to the heart and is dead the other participator in this chasse of two heard the crack of the rifles his senses were growing dazed with fear he did not stop he ran on still but with trembling knees and outstretched hands and when he came to a heap of shingle and sand one of those left over from the old surface mines he fell headlong on the pile with a cry and could not rise the two who shot the bear ran across the ground he lay almost at their feet to secure their prey after them at a leisurely pace strode john the servant the greasers stayed behind and laughed grisly's dead said tommy pulling out his knife steak no skin cried the younger let me take his skin john we will have the beast skinned you can get some steaks cut where is the man they found him lying on his face unable to move now old man said the young fellow cheerfully might as well sit up you know if you can't stand bruin's gone to the happy hunting grounds the man sat up as desired and tried to take a comprehensive view of the position jack handed him a flask from which he took a long pull then he got up and somewhat ostentatiously began to smooth down the legs of his trousers he was a thin man about five and forty years of age he wore an irregular and patchy kind of beard which flourished exceedingly on certain square half inches of chin and cheek and was as thin as grass at aden on the intervening spaces he had no boots but a sort of moccasins the lightness of which enabled him to show his heels to the bear for so long a time his trousers might have been of a rough tweed or they might have been black cloth because grease many drenchings the buffeting of years and the holes into which they were worn had long deprived them of their original colour and brilliancy above the trousers he wore a tattered flannel shirt the right arm of which nearly torn to pieces revealed a tattooed limb which was strong although thin the buttons had long ago vanished from the front of the garment thorns picturesquely replaced them he wore a red cotton handkerchief round his neck a round felt hat was on his head this like the trousers had lost its pristine colour and by dint of years and weather its stiffness too to prevent the hat from flapping in his eyes its possessor had pinned it up with thorns in the front necessity is the mother of invention there is nothing morally wrong in the use of thorns where other men use studs diamond pins and such gauds and the effect is picturesque the stranger in fact was a law unto himself he had no coat the rifle of californian civilisation was missing there was no sign of knife or revolver and the only encumbrance if that was any to the lightness of his flight was a small wooden box strapped round tightly and hanging at his back by means of a steel chain grown a little rusty where it did not rub against his neck and shoulders he sat up and winked involuntarily with both eyes this was the effect of present bewilderment and late fear then he looked round him after as before explained a few moments of assiduous leg smoothing which as stated above looked ostentatious but was really only nervous agitation then he rose and saw grisly lying in a heap a few yards off he walked over with a grave face and looked at him when henri balafre duc de guise saw coligny lying dead at his feet he is said only it is a wicked lie to have kicked the body of his murdered father's enemy when henri iii of france ten years later saw balafre dead at his feet he did kick the lifeless body with a wretched joke the king was a cur my american was not he stood over bruin with a look in his eyes which betokened respect for fallen greatness and sympathy with bad luck grisly would have been his victor but for the chance which brought him within reach of a friendly rifle a near thing he said since i've been in this doggoned country i've had one or two near things but this was the nearest the greasers stood round the body of the bear and the english servant was giving directions for skinning the beast and which of you gentlemen he went on with a nasal twang more pronounced than before perhaps with more emphasis on the word gentlemen than was altogether required which of you gentlemen was good enough to shoot the critter the english servant who was like his master captain ladds a man of few words pointed to the young man who stood close by with the other leader of the expedition the man snatched from the jaws of death took off his shaky thorn beset felt and solemnly held out his hand sir he said i do not know your name and you do not know mine if you did you would not be much happier because it is not a striking name if you'll oblige me sir by touching that he meant his right hand we shall be brothers all that's mine shall be yours i do not ask you sir to reciprocate all that's mine sir when i get anything shall be yours at present sir there is nothing but i've luck behind me shake hands sir once a mouse helped a lion sir it's in a book i am the mouse sir and you are the lion sir my name is gilead p beck the young man laughed and shook hands with him i only fired the first shot he explained my friend here no first shot disabled hunt finished then grisly out of the running glad you're not clawed unpleasant to be clawed young un did it no thanks tell us where we are mr gilead p beck catching the spirit of the situation told them where they were approximately this he said is patrick's camp at least it was the pioneers of ' could tell you a good deal about patrick's camp it was here that patrick kept his store in those old days they're gone now if a man wanted to buy a blanket that article sir was put into one scale and weighed down with gold dust in the other same with a pair of boots same with a pound of raisins patrick might have died rich sir but he didn't none of the pioneers did so he died poor and died in his boots too like most of the lot not much left of the camp no sir not much the mine gave out then they moved up the hills where i conclude you gentlemen are on your way prospecting likely the new town called empire city ought to be an hour or so up the track i was trying to find my way there when i met with old grisly perhaps if i had let him alone he would have let me alone but i blazed at him and sir i missed him then he shadowed me and the old rifle's gone at last how long did the chase last i should say sir forty days and forty nights or near about and you gentlemen air going to empire city we are going anywhere perhaps for the present you had better join us ii mr gilead p beck partly recovered from the shock caused to his nerves by the revengeful spirit of the bear and in no way discomfited by any sense of false shame as to his ragged appearance marched beside the two englishmen it was characteristic of his nationality that he regarded the greasers with contempt and that he joined the two gentlemen as if he belonged to their grade and social rank an englishman picked up in such rags and duds would have shrunk abashed to the rear or he would have apologised for his tattered condition or he would have begged for some garments any garments to replace his own mr beck had no such feeling he strode along with a swinging slouch which covered the ground as rapidly as the step of the horses the wind blew his rags about his long and lean figure as picturesquely as if he were another autolycus he was as full of talk as that worthy and as lightsome of spirit despite the solemn gravity of his face i once saw a poem i think in the spectator on artemus ward in which the bard apostrophised the light hearted merriment of the western american a very fortunate thing to say because the western american is externally a most serious person never merry never witty but always humorous mr beck was quite grave though at the moment as happy as that other grave and thoughtful person who has made a name in the literature of humour panurge when he escaped half roasted from the turk's serai i ought he said to sit down and cry like the girl on the prairie why ought you to cry i guess i ought to cry because i've lost my rifle and everything except my luck here he pulled at the steel chain in that darned long stern chase you can easily get a new rifle said jack with dollars interrupted mr beck as for them there's not a dollar left nary a red cent only my luck and what is your luck that said mr beck i will tell you by and by perhaps it's your luck too young boss he added thinking of a shot as fortunate to himself as william tell's was to his son he pulled the box attached to the steel chain round to the front and looked at it tenderly it was safe and he heaved a sigh the way wound up a valley a road marked only as has been said by deep ruts along its course behind the travellers the evening sun was slowly sinking in the west before them the peaks of the sierra lifted their heads coloured purple in the evening light and on either hand rose the hill sides with their dark foliage in alternate splashes of golden light and deepest shade it wanted but a quarter of an hour to sunset when mr gilead p beck pointed to a township which suddenly appeared lying at their very feet empire city i reckon a good sized town of wooden houses they were all alike and of the same build as that affected by the architects of doll's houses that is to say they were of one story only had a door in the middle and a window on either side they were so small also that they looked veritable dolls' houses there were one or two among them of more pretentious appearance and of several stories these were the hotels billiard saloons bars and gambling houses it's a place bound to advance sir said mr beck proudly empire city when i first saw it which is two years ago was only two years old it is only in our country that a great city springs up in a day empire city will be the chicago of the west i see a city said captain ladds can't see the people it was certainly curious there was not a soul in the streets there was no smoke from the chimneys there was neither carts nor horses there was not the least sign of occupation mr gilead p beck whistled all gone he said guess the city's busted up he pushed aside the brambles which grew over what had been a path leading to the place and hurried down the others followed him and rode into the town it was deserted the doors of the houses were open and if you looked in you might see the rough furniture which the late occupants disdained to carry away with them the two englishmen dismounted gave their reins to the servants and began to look about them the descendants of og king of bashan have left their houses in black basalt dotted about the lava fields of the hauran to witness how they lived in the outposts of desert stations of the east the roman soldiers have left their barracks and their baths their jokes written on the wall and their names to show how they passed away the weary hours of garrison duty so the miners who founded empire city and deserted it en masse when the gold gave out left behind them marks by which future explorers of the ruins should know what manner of men once dwelt there the billiard saloon stood open with swinging doors the table was still there the balls lay about on the table and the floor the cues stood in the rack the green cloth mildewed covered the table tommy said the younger we will have a game to night the largest building in the place had been an hotel it had two stories and was like the rest of the houses built of wood with a verandah along the front the upper story looked as if it had been recently inhabited that is the shutters were not dropping off the hinges nor were they flapping to and fro in the breeze but the town was deserted the evening breeze blew chilly up its vacant streets life and sound had gone out of the place i feel cold said jack looking about him they went round to the back of the hotel old iron cog wheels lay rusting on the ground with remains of pumps in the heart of the town behind the hotel stretched an open space of ground covered with piles of shingle and intersected with ditches mr beck sat down and adjusted one of the thorns which served as a temporary shirt stud two years ago he said there were ten thousand miners here now there isn't one i thought we should find a choice hotel with a little monty or poker afterwards now no one left nothing but a chinaman or two how do you know there are chinamen see those stones he pointed to some great boulders from three to six feet in diameter some operation of a mystical kind had been performed upon them for they were jagged and chipped as if they had been filed and cut into shape by a sculptor who had been once a dentist and still loved the profession the miners picked the bones of those rocks but they never pick quite clean then the chinamen come and finish off gentlemen it's a special providence that you picked me up i don't altogether admire the way in which that special providence was played up to in the matter of the bar but a christian without a revolver alone among twenty chinamen he stopped and shrugged his shoulders they'd have got my luck he concluded chief i don't like it said the younger man it's ghostly it's a town of dead men as soon as it is dark the ghosts will rise and walk about play billiards i expect what shall we do hotel growled the chief sleep on floor sit on chairs eat off a table they entered the hotel a most orderly bar the glasses there the bright coloured bottles two or three casks of bourbon whisky the counter the very dice on the counter with which the bar keeper used to go the miners for drinks how things at once so necessary to civilised life and so portable as dice were left behind it is impossible to explain everything was there except the drink the greasers tried the casks and examined the bottles emptiness a miner may leave behind him the impedimenta but the real necessaries of life rifle revolver bowie and cards he takes with him and as for the drink he carries that away too for greater safety inside himself the english servant looked round him and smiled superior no tap for beer as usual sir he said these poor californians has much to learn mr gilead p beck looked round mournfully everything gone but the fixin's he sighed there used to be good beds where there wasn't more'n two at once in them and there used to be such a crowd around this bar as you would not find nearer'n st louis city hush said jack holding up his hand there were steps mr beck pricked up his ears chinamen likely if there's a row gentlemen give me something if it's only a toothpick to chime in with but that's not a chinese step that's an englishman's he wears boots but they are not miner's boots he walks firm and slow like all englishmen he is not in a hurry like our folk and who but an englishman would be found staying behind in the empire city when it's gone to pot the footsteps came down the stairs most unhandsome of a ghost said the younger man to walk before midnight the producer of the footsteps appeared told you he was an englishman cried mr beck indeed there was no mistaking the nationality of the man in spite of his dress which was cosmopolitan he wore boots but not as the quick ear of the american told him the great boots of the miner he had on a flannel shirt with a red silk belt he wore a sort of blanket thrown back from his shoulders and he had a broad felt hat of course he carried arms but they were not visible he was a man of middle height with clear blue eyes the perfect complexion of an englishman of good stock and in complete health a brown beard long and rather curly streaked with here and there a grey hair square and clear cut nostrils and a mouth which though not much of it was visible looked as if it would easily smile might readily become tender and would certainly find it difficult to be stern he might be any age from five and thirty to five and forty the greasers fell back and grouped about the door the questions which might be raised had no interest for them the two leaders stood together and mr gilead p beck rolling an empty keg to their side turned it up and sat down with the air of a judge looking from one party to the other englishmen i see said the stranger ye yes said ladds not as mr beck expected immediately holding out his hand for the stranger to grasp you have probably lost your way been hunting working round san francisco followed track accident got here your hotel perhaps fine situation but lonely not a ghost then murmured the other with a look of temporary disappointment if you will come upstairs to my quarters i may be able to make you comfortable for the night your party will accommodate themselves without our help he referred to the greasers who had already begun their preparations for spending a happy night when he led the way up the stairs he was followed not only by the two gentlemen he had invited but also by the ragamuffin hunter miner or adventurer and by the valet who conceived it his duty to follow his master he lived this hermit in one of the small bed rooms of the hotel which he had converted into a sitting room it contained a single rocking chair and a table there was also a shelf which served for a sideboard and a curtain under the shelf which acted as a cupboard you see my den he said i came here a year or so ago by accident like yourselves i found the place deserted i liked the solitude the scenery whatever you like and i stayed here you are the only visitors i have had in a year chinamen said mr gilead p beck well chinamen of course but only two of them they take turns at forty dollars a month to cook my dinners and there is a half caste who does not mind running down to sacramento when i want anything and so you see i make out pretty well he opened the window and blew a whistle in two minutes a chinaman came tumbling up the stairs his inscrutable face expressed all the conflicting passions of humanity at once ambition vanity self respect humour satire avarice resignation patience revenge meekness long suffering remembrance and a thousand others no aryan comes within a hundred miles of it dinner as soon as you can said his master ayah can do replied the celestial what time you wantchee as soon as you can half an hour can do my no have got cully powder have makee finish have got look for some make achow help how can no b'long his pidgin he no helpee b'long my pidgin makee cook chow chow ayah achow have go makee cheat over mexican man makee play cards all same euchre in fact on looking out of the window the other celestial was clearly visible manipulating a pack of cards and apparently inviting the mexicans to a friendly game in which there could be no deception then ladds' conscience smote him beg pardon should have seen make remark about hotel apologise he means said the other that he was a terrible great fool not to see that you are a gentleman ladds nodded let me introduce our party the speaker went on this is our esteemed friend mr gilead p beck whom we caught in a bear hunt bar behind said mr beck this is captain ladds of the th dragoons ladds said ladds nibs cocoa nibs pure aroma best breakfast digester blessing to mothers perfect fragrance his name is ladds and he wishes to communicate to you the fact that he is the son of the man who made an immense fortune immense tommy ladds nodded by a crafty compound known as 'ladds' patent anti dyspeptic cocoa' this is ladd's servant john boimer the best servant who ever put his leg across pig skin and my name is roland dunquerque people generally call me jack i don't know why but they do their host bowed to each including the servant who coloured with pleasure at jack's description of him but he shook hands with ladds one of ours he said my name is lawrence colquhoun i sold out before you joined i came here as you see and now gentlemen i think i hear the first sounds of dinner boimer you will allow me ladds you will find claret and champagne behind that curtain pardon a hermit's fare i think they have laid out such a table as the wilderness can boast in the next room the dinner was not altogether what a man might order at the junior united but it was good there was venison there was a curry there was some mountain quail there was claret and there was champagne both good especially the claret then there was coffee the honourable roland dunquerque whom we will call in future what everybody always called him jack ate and drank like friar john the keen mountain air multiplied his normal twist by ten mr gilead p beck who sat down to dinner perfectly unabashed by his rags was good as a trencherman but many plates behind the young englishman mr lawrence colquhoun their host went on talking almost as if they were in london only now and then he found himself behind the world it was his ignorance of the last derby the allusion to an old and half forgotten story perhaps his use of little phrases not slang phrases but those delicately shaded terms which imply knowledge of current things which showed him to have been out of london and paris for more than one season four years he said since i left england but you will come back to it again i think not better said jack whose face was a little flushed with the wine much better robinson crusoe always wanted to get home again so did selkirk so did philip quarles then the host produced cigars later on brandy and water the brandy and water made mr gilead p beck who found himself a good deal crowded out of the conversation insist on having his share he placed his square box on the table and loosed the straps let me tell you he said the story of my luck i was in sonora city he began patting his box affectionately after the worst three months i ever had and i went around trying to borrow a few dollars i got no dollars but i got free drinks so many free drinks that at last i lay down in the street and went to sleep wal gentlemen i suppose i walked in that slumber of mine for when i woke up i was lying a mile outside the town i also entertained angels unawares for at my head there sat an indian woman she was as wrinkled an old squaw as ever shrieked at a buryin' but she took an interest in me she took that amount of interest in me that she told me she knew of gold and then she led me by the hand gentlemen that aged and affectionate old squaw to a place not far from the roadside and there lying between two rocks and hidden in the chaparelle glittering in the light was this bauble he tapped his box i did not want to be told to take it i wrapped it in my handkerchief and carried it in my hand then she led me back to the road again 'bad luck you will have' she said 'but it will lead to good luck so long as that is not broken sold given away or lost' then she left me and here it is he opened the little box there was nothing to be seen but a mass of white wool bad luck i have had look at me gentlemen adam was not more destitute when the garden gates were shut on him but the good will come somehow he removed the wool and behold a miracle of nature two thin plates of gold delicately wrought in lines and curious chasing like the pattern of a butterfly's wing and of the exact shape but twice as large they were poised at the angle always the same at which the insect balances itself about a flower they were set in a small piece of quaintly marked quartz which represented the body a golden butterfly a golden butterfly said mr beck no goldsmith made this butterfly it came from nature's workshop it is my luck and if the butterfly fall and break farewell the luck of gilead beck said jack thank you sir that's very neat i'll take that sir if you will allow me for my motto unless you want it for yourself no said jack i have one already if this golden butterfly fall and break farewell the luck of gilead p beck repeated the owner of the insect if you are going on gentlemen to san francisco i hope you will take me with you colquhoun said ladds you do not mean to stay by yourself much better come with us unless of course lying on the table was a piece of an old newspaper in which jack had wrapped something ladds saw colquhoun mechanically take up the paper read it and change color then he looked straight before him seeing nothing and ladds stopped speaking then he smiled in a strange far off way i think i will go with you he said hear hear cried jack selkirk returns to the sound of the church going bell ladds refrained from looking at the paper in search of things which did not concern himself but he perceived that colquhoun had like hamlet seen something there was in fact an announcement in the fragment which greatly interested lawrence colquhoun on april by the right rev the lord bishop of turk's island at st george's hanover square gabriel cassilis of etc to victoria daughter of the late admiral sir benbow pengelley kcb in the morning they started mr beck being provided with a new rig out of a rough and useful kind at the last moment one of the chinamen leeching the cook besought from his late master as a parting favour and for the purpose of self protection the gift of a pistol powder and ball mr colquhoun gave them to him thinking it a small thing after two years of faithful service then leeching after loading his pistol went to work with his comrade for an hour or so presently achow being on his knees in the shingle the perfidious leeching suddenly cocked his pistol and fired it into achow's right ear so that he fell dead by this lucky accident leeching became sole possessor of the little pile of gold which he and the defunct achow had scraped together and placed in a cache he proceeded to unearth this treasure put together his little belongings and started on the road to san francisco with a smile of satisfaction there was a place in the windings of the road where there was a steep bank by the worst luck in the world a stone slipped and fell as leeching passed by the stone by itself would not have mattered much as it did not fall on leeching's head but with it fell a rattlesnake who was sleeping in the warmth of the sun nothing annoys a rattlesnake more than to be disturbed in his sleep with angry mind he awoke looked around and saw the chinaman illogically connecting him with the fall of the stone he made for him and before leeching knew there was a rattlesnake anywhere near him bit him in the calf leeching sat down on the bank and realized the position being a fatalist he did not murmur having no conscience he did not fear having no faith he did not hope having very little time he made no testamentary dispositions in point of fact he speedily curled up his legs and died then the deserted empire city was deserted indeed for there was not even a chinaman left in it chapter i joseph and his brethren the largest and most solid of all the substantial houses in carnarvon square bloomsbury is number fifteen which by reason of its corner position mulgrave street intersecting it at right angles at this point has been enabled to stretch itself out at the back it is a house which a man who wanted to convey the idea of a solid income without ostentation or attempt at fashion would find the very thing to assist his purpose the ladies of such a house would not desire to belong to the world farther west they would respect the church law and medicine they would look on the city with favourable eyes when it was represented by a partner in an old firm they would have sound notions of material comfort they would read solid books and would take their pleasure calmly one always somehow in looking at a house wonders first of what sort its women are there were however no women at number fifteen at all except the maids its occupants consisted of three brothers all unmarried they were named respectively cornelius humphrey and joseph jagenal cornelius and humphrey were twins joseph was their junior by ten years cornelius and humphrey were fifty joseph was forty people who did not know this thought that joseph was fifty and his brethren forty when the venerable the archdeacon of market basing the well known author of sermons on the duty of tithe offerings the lesbia of catullus and a treatise on the right use of the anapaest in greek iambic verse died it was found that he had bequeathed his little savings worth altogether about l a year to his three sons in the following proportions the twins he said possessed genius they would make their mark in the world but they must be protected they received the yearly sum of l apiece and it was placed in the hands of trustees to prevent their losing it the younger was to have the rest without trustees because his father said joseph is a dull boy and will keep it it was a wise distribution of the money cornelius then nineteen left oxford immediately and went to heidelberg where he called himself a poet studied metaphysics drank beer and learned to fence humphrey for his part deserted cambridge their father having chosen that they should not be rivals and announced his intention of devoting his life to art he took up his residence in rome joseph stayed at school having no other choice when the boy was sixteen his guardians articled him to a solicitor joseph was dull but he was methodical exact and endowed with a retentive memory he had also an excellent manner and the appearance of age as port wine advertisers say before he was out of his articles at twenty five joseph jagenal was a partner at thirty five he was the working partner at forty he was the senior partner in the great lincoln's inn firm of shaw fairlight and jagenal the confidential advisers of as many respectable county people as any firm in london when he was twenty five and became a partner the brethren returned to england simultaneously and were good enough to live with him and upon him they had their l a year each and expensive tastes joseph who had made a thousand for his share the first year of his admission to the firm had no expensive tastes and a profound respect for genius he took in the twins joyfully and they stayed with him when his senior partner died and mr fairlight retired so that joseph's income was largely increased they made him move from torrington square where the houses are small to carnarvon square and regulated his household for him on the broadest and most liberal scale needless to say no part of the little income which barely served the twins with pocket money and their menus plaisirs went towards the housekeeping cornelius poet and philosopher superintended the dinner and daily interviewed the cook humphrey he devotee of art who furnished the rooms according to the latest designs of the most correct taste was in command of the cellar cornelius took the best sitting room for himself provided it with books easy chairs and an immense study table with countless drawers he called it carelessly his workshop the room on the first floor overlooking mulgrave street and consequently with a north aspect was appropriated by humphrey he called it his studio and furnished it in character not forgetting the easy chairs joseph had the back room behind the dining room for himself it was not called a study or a library but mr joseph's room he sat in it alone every evening at work there was also a drawing room but it was never used they dined together at half past six cornelius sat at the head and humphrey at the foot joseph at one side art and intellect thus happily met together and housed under one roof talked to each other joseph ate his dinner in silence art held his glass to the light and flashed into enthusiasm over the matchless sparkle the divine hues the incomparable radiance of the wine intellect with a sigh as one who regrets the loss of a sense congratulated his brother on his vivid passion for colour and taking another glass discoursed on the aesthetic aspects of a vintage wine joseph drank one glass of claret after which he retired to his den and left the brethren to finish the bottle after dinner the twins sometimes went to the theatre or they repaired arm in arm to their club the renaissance now past its prime and a little fogyish mostly they sat in the studio or in the workshop in two arm chairs with a table between them smoked pipes and drank brandy and potash water they went to bed at any time they felt sleepy perhaps at twelve and perhaps at three joseph went to bed at half past ten the brethren generally breakfasted at eleven joseph at eight after breakfast unless on rainy days a uniform custom was observed cornelius poet and philosopher went to the window and looked out humphrey artist and therefore a man of intuitive sympathies followed him then he patted cornelius on the shoulder and shook his head brother i know your thought you want to drag me from my work you think it has been too much for me lately you are too anxious about me cornelius smiled not on my own account too humphrey true on your account let us go out at once brother ah why did you choose so vast a subject cornelius was engaged had been engaged for twenty years upon an epic poem entitled the upheaving of aelfred the school he belonged to would not of course demean themselves by speaking of alfred to them edward was eadward edgar was eadgar and old canute was knut in the same way cicero became kikero virgil was vergil and socrates was spelt as by the illiterate bargee with a k so the french prigs of the ante boileau period sought to make their trumpery pedantries pass for current coin so too chapelain was in labour with the pucelle for thirty years and when it came but cornelius jagenal could not be compared with chapelain because he had as yet brought forth nothing he sat with what he and his called english books all round him in other words he had all the anglo saxon literature on his shelves and was amassing as he said material humphrey on the other hand was engaged on a painting the composition of which offered difficulties which for nearly twenty years had proved insuperable he was painting he said the birth of the renaissance it was a subject which required a great outlay in properties venetian glass italian jewelry mediaeval furniture copies of paintings everything necessary to make this work a masterpiece he bought at joseph's expense up to the present no one had been allowed to see the first rough drawings where's caesar humphrey would say leading the way to the hall caesar why here he is caesar must actually have heard us proposing to go out cornelius called the dog kaysar and he refused to answer to it so that conversation between him and cornelius was impossible there never was a pair more attached to each other than these twin brethren they sallied forth each morning at twelve arm in arm with an open and undisguised admiration for each other which was touching before them marched caesar who was of mastiff breed leading the way cornelius the poet was dressed with as much care as if he were still a young man of five and twenty in a semi youthful and wholly aesthetic costume in which only the general air and not the colour revealed the man of delicate perceptions humphrey the artist greatly daring affected a warm brown velvet with a crimson purple ribbon both carried flowers cornelius had gloves humphrey a cigar cornelius was smooth faced save for a light fringe on the upper lip humphrey wore a heavy moustache and a full long silky beard of a delicately shaded brown inclining when the sun shone upon it to a suspicion of auburn both were of the same height rather below the middle they had features so much alike that but for the hair on the face of one it would have been difficult to distinguish between them both were thin pale of face and both had by some fatality the end of their delicately carved noses slightly tipped with red perhaps this was due to the daily and nightly brandy and water and in the airy careless carriage of the two men their sunny faces and elastic tread it was impossible to suppose that they were fifty and joseph only forty to be sure joseph was a heavy man stout of build broad in frame sturdy in the under jaw while his brothers were slight shadowy men and to be sure joseph had worked all his life while his brothers never did a stroke they were born to consume the fruits which joseph was born to cultivate outside the house the poet heaved a heavy sigh as if the weight of the epic was for the moment off his mind the artist looked round with a critical eye on the lights and shadows of the great commonplace square even in london he murmured nature is too strong for man did you ever my dear cornelius catch a more brilliant effect of sunshine than that upon the lilac yonder time end of april season forward lilacs on the point of bursting into flower sky dotted with swift flying clouds alternate withdrawals and bursts of sunshine i really must said humphrey try to fix that effect his brother took the arm of the artist and drew him gently away in front marched caesar presently the poet looked round they were out of the square by this time where is kaysar he said with an air of surprise surely brother humphrey the dog can't be in the carnarvon arms i'll go and see said humphrey with alacrity he entered the bar of the tavern and his brother waited outside after two or three minutes the poet as if tired of waiting followed the artist into the bar he found him with a glass of brandy and water cold i had he explained a feeling of faintness perhaps this spring air is chilly one cannot be too careful quite right said the poet i almost think yes i really do feel ah thank you my dear the girl as if anticipating his wants set before him a four of brandy and the cold water perhaps she had seen the face before as for the dog he was lying down with his head on his paws perhaps he knew there would be no immediate necessity for moving they walked in the direction of the park arm in arm affectionately it might have been a quarter of an hour after leaving the carnarvon arms when the poet stopped and gasped humphrey my dear brother advise me what would you do if you had a sharp and sudden pain like a knife inside you humphrey replied promptly if i had a sharp and sudden pain like a knife inside me i should take a small glass of brandy neat mind no spoiling the effect with water cornelius looked at his brother with admiration such readiness of resource he murmured pressing his arm i think i see ah yes kaysar he's gone in before us the sagacity of that dog is more remarkable than anything i ever read he took his small glass of brandy neat the artist looking on said he might as well have one at the same time not he added that he felt any immediate want of the stimulant but he might and at all times prevention is better than cure it was two o'clock when they returned to carnarvon square they walked arm in arm with perhaps even a greater show of confiding affection than had appeared at starting there was the slightest possible lurch in their walk and both looked solemn and heavy with thought in the hall the artist looked at his watch pa pasht two corneliush work he marched to the studio with a resolute air and arrived there drew an easy chair before the fire sat himself in it and went fast asleep the poet sought the workshop on the table lay the portfolio of papers outside which was emblazoned on parchment with dainty scroll work by the hands of his brother the artist the title of his poem the upheaving of aelfred an epic in twenty four cantos by cornelius jagenal he gazed at it fondly for a few minutes vaguely took up a pen as if he intended to finish the work on the spot and then with a sigh thought being to much for brain he slipped into his arm chair put up his feet and was asleep in two minutes at half past five one of the maids they kept no footman in carnarvon square brought him tea i have been dozing have i jane he asked very singular thing for me to do we are but the creatures of habit the brethren took the same walk every day made the same remarks with an occasional variation and took the same morning drams they spent the middle of the day in sleep they woke up for the afternoon tea and they never failed to call jane's attention to the singularity of the fact that they had been asleep this day jane lingered instead of going away when the tea was finished did master tell you sir she asked that miss fleming was coming to day it was an irritating thing that although cornelius ordered the dinner and sat at the head of the table although humphrey was in sole command of the wine cellar the servants always called joseph the master great is the authority of him who keeps the bag the power of the penniless twins was a shadowy and visionary thing the master had told his brothers that miss fleming would probably have to come to the house but no date was fixed miss fleming came this afternoon sir said jane with a french maid she's in mr joseph's room now oh tell mr humphrey jane and we will dress for dinner tell mr humphrey also that perhaps miss fleming would like a glass of champagne to day jane told the artist always thoughtful said humphrey with enthusiasm cornelius is for ever thinking of others' comfort to be sure miss fleming shall have a glass of champagne he brought up two bottles such was his anxiety to give full expression to his brother's wishes when the dinner bell rang the brethren emerged simultaneously from their rooms and descended the stairs together arm in arm perhaps in expectation of dinner perhaps in anticipation of the champagne perhaps with pleasure at the prospect of meeting with joseph's ward the faces of both were lit with a sunny smile and their eyes with a radiant light which looked like the real and genuine enthusiasm of humanity it was a pity that humphrey wore a beard or that cornelius did not otherwise it would have been difficult to distinguish between this pair so much alike these youthful twins of fifty who almost looked like five and twenty chapter ii phillis is my only joy my brothers miss fleming joseph introduced the twins with a pride impossible to dissemble they were so youthful looking so airy so handsome besides being so nobly endowed with genius that his pride may be excused castor and pollux the wrong side of forty but slim still and well preserved these greek figures do not run tall might have looked like cornelius and humphrey they parted company for a moment to welcome the young lady large eyed as here who rose to greet them and then took up a position on the hearthrug one with his hand on the other's shoulder like the siamese twins and smiled pleasantly as if being accustomed to admiration and even awe they wished to reassure miss fleming and put her at ease dinner being announced cornelius the elder by a few moments gave his arm to the young lady humphrey the younger hovered close behind as if he too was taking his part in the chivalrous act joseph followed alone of course not counting in the little procession phillis fleming's arrival at no carnarvon square was in a manner legal she belonged to the office not to the shrine of intellect poesy and art created by the twin brethren she was an orphan and a ward she had two guardians one of them mr lawrence colquhoun being away from england and the other mr abraham dyson with whom she had lived since her sixth birthday having finished his earthly career just before this history begins that is to say in the spring of last year shaw fairlight and jagenal were solicitors to both gentlemen therefore joseph found himself obliged to act for this young lady when mr abraham dyson buried and done with it became a question what was to be done with her there were offers from several disinterested persons on miss fleming's bereaved condition being known miss skimpit of the highgate collegiate establishment for young ladies proposed by letter to receive her as a parlour boarder and hinted at the advantages of a year's discipline tempered by christian kindness for a young lady educated in so extraordinary and godless a manner the clergyman of the new district church at finchley called personally upon mr jagenal he said that he did not know the young lady except by name but that feeling the dreadful condition of a girl brought up without any of the gracious influences of anglican ritual and dogma he was impelled to offer her a home with his sisterhood here she would receive clear dogmatic teaching and learn what the church meant by submission fasting penance and humiliation mr jagenal thought she might also learn how to bestow her fortune on anglo catholic objects when she came of age and dismissed his reverence with scant courtesy two or three widows who had known better days offered their services which were declined with thanks joseph even refused to let miss fleming stay with mrs cassilis the wife of abraham dyson's second cousin he thought that perhaps this lady would not be unwilling to enliven her house by the attraction of an heiress and a debutante and it occurred to him that for a short time at least she might without offending a censorious world and until her remaining guardian's wishes could be learned take up her abode at the house of the three bachelors i am old miss fleming he said forty years old a great age to you and my brothers cornelius and humphrey who live with me are older still cornelius is a great poet he is engaged on a work the upheaving of aelfred which will immortalise his name humphrey is an artist he is working at a group the mere conception of which cornelius says would make even the brain of michel angelo stagger you will be proud i think in after years to have made the acquaintance of my brothers she came having no choice or any other wish accompanied by her french maid and the usual impedimenta of travel phillis fleming her father called her phillis because she was his only joy was nineteen she is twenty now because the events of this story only happened last year her mother died in giving her birth she had neither brothers nor sisters nor many cousins and those far away when she was six her father died too not of an interesting consumption or of a broken heart or any ailment of that kind he was a jovial fox hunting ex captain of cavalry with a fair income and a carefully cultivated taste for enjoyment he died from an accident in the field by his will he left all his money to his one child and appointed as her trustees his father's old friend abraham dyson of twickenham and the city and with him his own friend lawrence colquhoun a man some ten years younger than himself with tastes and pursuits very much like his own of course the child was taken to the elder guardian's house and colquhoun going his way in the world never gave his trust or its responsibilities a moment's thought phillis fleming had the advantage of a training quite different from that which is usually accorded to young ladies she went to mr abraham dyson at a time when that old gentlemen always full of crotchety ideas was developing a plan of his own for female education his theory of woman's training having just then grown in his mind to finished proportions he welcomed the child as a subject sent quite providentially to his hand and proceeded to put his views into practice upon little phillis that he did so showed a healthy belief in his own judgment some men would have hastened into print with a mere theory mr dyson intended to wait for twelve years or so and to write his work on woman's education when phillis's example might be the triumphant proof of his own soundness the education conducted on mr dyson's principles and rigidly carried out was approaching completion when it suddenly came to an abrupt termination few things in this world quite turn out as we hope and expect it was on the cards that abraham dyson might die before the proof of his theory this in fact happened and his chief regret at leaving a world where he had been supremely comfortable and able to enjoy his glass of port to his eightieth and last year was that he was leaving the girl the creation of his theory in an unfinished state phillis he said on his deathbed the edifice is now complete all but the coping stone alas that i could not live to put it on and what the coping stone was no man could guess great would be the cleverness of him who seeing a cathedral finished save for roof and upper courses would undertake to put on these with all the ornaments spires lanterns gargoyles pinnacles flying buttresses turrets belfries and crosses drawn in the dead designer's lost plans abraham dyson was a wealthy man therefore he was greatly respected by all his relations in spite of certain eccentricities notably those which forbade him to ask any of them to his house if the nephews nieces and cousins wept bitterly on learning their bereavement deeper and more bitter were their lamentations when they found that mr dyson had left none of them any money not one penny not a mourning ring not a single sign or token of affection to one of them it was a cruel throwing of cold water on the tenderest affections of the heart and mr dyson's relations were deeply pained some of them swore others felt that in this case it was needless to give sorrow words and bore their suffering in silence nor did he leave any money to phillis this obstinate old theorist left it all to found a college for girls who were to be educated in the same manner as phillis fleming and in accordance with the scheme stated to be fully drawn up and among his papers up to the present joseph jagenal had not succeeded in finding the scheme there were several rolls of paper forming portions of the great work but none were finished and all pointed to the last chapter that entitled the coping stone in which it was stated would be found the whole scheme with complete fulness of detail but this last chapter could not be found anywhere if it never was found what would become of the will then each one of mr dyson's relations began to calculate what might fall to himself out of the inheritance that was only natural and perhaps it was not every one who like mr gabriel cassilis openly lamented the number of mr dyson's collateral heirs not to be found joseph jagenal's clerks now engaged in searching everywhere for it and all the relations praying all fervently and some with faith that it might never turn up so that poor phillis is sitting down to dinner with her education unfinished where is that coping stone every young lady who has had a finishing year at brighton may look down upon her perhaps however as her education has been of a kind quite unknown in polite circles and she has never heard of a finishing year she may be calm even in the presence of other young ladies what sort of a girl is she to begin with she has fifty thousand pounds not the largest kind of fortune but still something more than most girls have more than the average heiress has enough to make young fortunio hunter prick up his ears smooth down his moustache and begin to inquire about guardians enough to purchase a roomy cottage where love may be comfortable enough to enable the neediest wooer if he be successful to hang up his hat on the peg behind the door and sit down for the rest of his years fifty thousand pounds is a sum which means possibilities it was her mother's and very luckily for her it was so tied up that captain fleming her father could not touch more than the interest which at three per cent amounts as may be calculated to fifteen hundred a year really after explaining that a young lady has fifty thousand what further praise is wanted what additional description is necessary by contemplation of fifty thousand pounds ardent youth is inflamed as by a living likeness of helen be she lovely or be she loathly be she young or old be she sweet or shrewish she has fifty thousand pounds with her fifty thousand pounds the gods have given phillis fleming a tall figure the lines of which are as delicately curved as those of any yacht in the solent or of any statue from greek studio she is slight perhaps too slight she has hair of a common dark brown but it is fine hair there is a great wealth of it it has a gleam and glimmer of its own as the sunlight falls upon it as if there were a hidden colour lying somewhere in it waiting to be discovered her eyes like her hair are brown they are also large and lustrous her lips are full her features are not straight and regular like those of women's beauties for her chin is perhaps a little short though square and determined she has a forehead which is broad and rather low she wears an expression in which good temper intelligence and activity are more marked than beauty she is quick to mark the things that she sees and she sees everything her hands are curious because they are so small so delicate and so sympathetic while her face is in repose you may watch a passing emotion by the quivering of her fingers just as you may catch if you have the luck the laughter or tears of most girls first in the brightness or the clouding of their eyes there are girls who when we meet them in the street pass us like the passing of sunshine on an april day who if we spend the evening in a room where they are make us understand something of the warmth which nature intended to be universal but has somehow only made special whom it is a pleasure to serve whom it is a duty to reverence who can bring purity back to the brain of a rake and make a young man's heart blossom like a rose in june of such is phillis fleming chapter iii phillis's education the dinner began without much conversation partly because the twins were hungry and partly because they were a little awed by the presence of an unwonted guest in white draperies phillis noted that so far as she had learned as yet things of a domestic kind in the outer world were much like things at mr dyson's that is to say the furniture of the dining room was similar and the dinner was the same i do not know why she expected it but she had some vague notion that she might be called upon to eat strange dishes the boellinger brother cornelius said the artist thoughtful of you brother humphrey the poet answered miss fleming the boellinger is in your honour phillis looked puzzled she did not understand where the honour came in but she tasted her glass it is a little too dry for me she said with admirable candour if you have any veuve clicquot mr jagenal she addressed the younger brother i should prefer that all three perceptibly winced jane the maid presently returned with a bottle of the sweeter wine miss fleming tasted it critically and pronounced in its favor mr dyson my guardian she said always used to say the ladies like their wine sweet at least i do so he used to drink perier jout tres sec and i had veuve clicquot the poet laid his forefinger upon his brow and looked meditatively at his glass then he filled it again then he drank it off helplessly this was a remarkable young lady you have lived a very quiet life said joseph with a note of interrogation in his voice with your guardian at highgate yes very quiet only two or three gentlemen ever came to the house and i never went out a fair prisoner indeed murmured the poet danae in her tower waiting for the shower of gold danae must have wished said phillis when she was put in the box and sent to sea that the shower of gold had never come cornelius began to regret his allusion to the mythological maid for his classical memory failed and he could not at the moment recollect what box the young lady referred to this no doubt came of much poring over anglo saxon chronicles but he remembered other circumstances connected with danae's history and was silent at least you went out said humphrey to see the academy and the water colours she shook her head i have never seen a picture gallery at all i have not once been outside mr dyson's grounds until to day since i was six years old humphrey supported his nervous system like his brother with another glass of the boellinger you found your pleasure in reading divine poetry said the maker softly perhaps in writing poetry yourself oh dear no said phillis i have not yet learned to read mr dyson said that ladies ought not to learn reading till they are of an age when acquiring that mischievous art cannot hurt themselves or their fellow creatures phillis said this with an air of superior wisdom as if there could be no disputing the axiom humphrey looked oceans of sympathy at cornelius who took out his handkerchief as if to wipe away a tear but as none was in readiness he only sighed you were taught other things however joseph asked yes i learned to play my master came twice a week and i can play pretty well i play either by ear or by memory you see she added simply i never forget anything that i am told compensation of civilised nature we read and memory suffers those who do not read remember before wandering minstrels learned to read and write the whole iliad was handed down on men's tongues there are brahmins who repeat all their sacred books word for word without slip or error and have never learned to read there are men at oxford who can tell you the winners of events for a fabulous period and yet get plucked for greats because as they will tell you themselves they really cannot read phillis did not know how to read but she remembered remembered everything could repeat a poem dictated twice if it were a hundred lines long and never forgot it caught up an air and learned how to play it at a sitting she could not read all the world of fiction was lost to her all the fancies of poets were lost to her all the records of folly and crime which we call history were unknown to her try to think what and of what sort would be the mind of a person otherwise cultivated unable to read in the first place he would be clear and dogmatic in his views not having the means of comparison next he would be dependent on oral teaching and rumor for his information he would have to store everything as soon as learned away in his mind to be lost altogether unless he knew where to lay his hand upon it he would hear little of the outer world and very little would interest him beyond his own circle he would be in the enjoyment of all the luxuries of civilisation without understanding how they got there he would be like the mohammedans when they came into possession of byzantium in the midst of things unintelligible useful and delightful you will play to us after dinner if you will be so kind said joseph can it be miss fleming asked humphrey that you never went outside the house at all oh no i could ride in the paddock it was a good large field and my pony was clever at jumping so i got on pretty well would it be too much to ask you how you managed to get through the day not at all she replied it was very easy i had a ride before breakfast gave mr dyson his tea at ten talked with him till twelve we always talked 'subjects' you know and had a regular course when we had done talking he asked me questions then i probably had another ride before luncheon in the afternoon i played looked after my dress and drew you are then an artist cried humphrey enthusiastically cornelius i saw from the first that miss fleming had the eye of an artist i do not know about that i can draw people i will show you some of my sketches if you like to morrow they are all heads and figures i shall draw all of you to night before going to bed and in the evening mr dyson dined at seven sometimes he had one or two gentlemen to dine with him never any lady when there was no one we talked 'subjects' again never any lady here was a young woman rich of good family handsome and in her way accomplished who had never seen or talked with a lady nor gone out of the house save into its gardens since she was a child yet in spite of all these disadvantages and the strangeness of her position she was perfectly self possessed when she left the table the two elder brethren addressed themselves to the bottle of chateau mouton with more rapidity than was becoming the dignity of the wine joseph almost immediately joined his ward when the twins left the dining room with its empty decanters and returned arm in arm to the drawing room they found their younger brother in animated conversation with the girl strange that joseph should so far forget his usual habits as not to go straight to his own room the two bosoms which heaved in a continual harmony with each other felt a simultaneous pang of jealousy for which there was no occasion joseph was only thinking of the coping stone did i not feel it strange driving through the streets phillis was saying it is all so strange that i am bewildered so strange and so wonderful i used to dream of what it was like my maid told me something about it but i never guessed the reality there are a hundred things more than i can ever draw it was as hinted above the custom of this young person as it was that of the mexicans to make drawings of everything which occurred she was thus enabled to preserve a tolerably faithful record of her life show me said joseph show me the heads of my brothers and myself that you promised to do as soon as they are finished the brethren sat together on a sofa the poet in his favorite attitude of meditation forefinger on brow the artist with his eyes fixed on the fire catching the effects of colour their faces were just a little flushed with the wine they had taken one after the other crossed the room and spoke to their guest said cornelius you are watching my brother humphrey study him miss fleming it will repay you well to know that childlike and simple nature innocent of the world and aglow with the flame of genius i think i can draw him now said phillis looking at the artist as hard as a turnkey taking mr pickwick's portrait then came humphrey i see your eyes turned upon my brother cornelius he is a great a noble fellow miss fleming cultivate him talk to him learn from him you will be very glad some day to be able to boast that you have met my brother cornelius to know him is a privilege to converse with him is an education come said joseph cheerfully where is the piano this is a bachelor's house but there is a piano somewhere have you got it cornelius the poet shook his head with a soft sad smile nay he said is a workshop the place for music let us rather search for it in the realms of art in fact it was in mr humphrey's studio whither they repaired the girl sat down and as she touched the keys her eyes lit up and her whole look changed joseph was the only one of the three who really cared for music he stood by the fire and said nothing the brethren on either side of the performer displayed wonders of enthusiastic admiration each in his own way the poet sad and reflective as if music softened his soul the artist with an effervescing gaiety delightful to behold joseph was thinking can we had his thoughts taken form of speech can we reconstruct from the girl's own account the old man's scheme anew provided the chapter on the coping stone be never found problem given a girl brought up in seclusion without intercourse with any of her sex except illiterate servants yet bred to be a lady not allowed even to learn reading but taught orally so as to hold her own in talk required to discover what the old man meant by it and what was wanted to finish the structure could it be reading and writing could abraham dyson have intended to finish where all other people begin this solution mightily commended itself to joseph and he went to bed in great good spirits at his own cleverness in the dead of night he awoke in fear and trembling they will go into chancery he thought what if the court refuses to take my view at three in the morning the brethren long left alone with their pipes rose to go to bed brandy and soda sometimes makes men truthful after the third tumbler and beguiles them with illusory hopes after the fourth the twins were at the end of their fourth cornelius said the artist she has l she has brother humphrey it is a pity cornelius that we who have only l a year each are already fifty years of age humphrey what age do we feel thirty not a month more replied the artist striking out with both fists at an imaginary foe probably old time right not an hour above the thirty said the bard smiting his chest gently as for joseph he is too old very much too old to think of marrying such a young fresh and innocent engaging and clever girl as miss phillis fleming did they then both intend to marry the young lady chapter iv to taste the freshness of the morning air phillis retreated to her own room at her accustomed hour of ten her nerves were excited her brain was troubled with the events of this day of emancipation she was actually in the world the great world of which her guardian had told her the world where history was made where wicked kings as mr dyson perpetually impressed upon her made war their play and the people their playthings she was in the world where all those things were done of which she had only heard as yet she had seen the streets of london or some of them those streets along which had ridden the knights whose pictures she loved to draw the princesses and queens whose stories mr dyson had taught her where the business of the world was carried on and where there flowed up and down the ceaseless stream of those whom necessity spurs to action as a matter of narrow fact she had seen nothing but that part of london which lies between highgate hill and carnarvon square but to her it seemed the city the centre of all life the heart of civilisation she regretted only that she had not been able to discern the tower of london that might be however close to mr jagenal's house and she would look for it in the morning what a day she sat before her fire and tried to picture it all over again horses carriages carts and people rushing to and fro shops filled with the most wonderful exhibition of precious things eccentric people with pipes who trundled carts piled with yellow oranges gentlemen in blue with helmets who lounged negligently along the streets boys who ran and whistled boys who ran and shouted boys who ran and sold papers always boys where were all the girls where were they all going and what were they all wishing to do in the evening the world appeared to narrow itself it consisted of dinner with three elderly gentlemen one of whom was thoughtful about herself spoke kindly to her and asked her about her past life while the other two and here she laughed talked unintelligently about art and themselves and sometimes praised each other then she opened her sketch book and began to draw the portraits of her new friends and first she produced a faithful effigies of the twins this took her nearly an hour to draw but when finished it made a pretty picture the brethren stood with arms intertwined like two children with eyes gazing fondly into each other's and heads thrown back in the attitude of poetic and artistic meditation which they mostly affected a clever sketch and she was more than satisfied when she held it up to the light and looked at it before placing it in her portfolio mr humphrey said i had the eye of an artist she murmured i wonder what he will say when he sees this then she drew the portrait of joseph this was easy she drew him sitting a little forward playing with his watch chain looking at her with deep grave eyes then she closed her eyes and began to recall the endless moving panorama of the london streets but this she could not draw there came no image to her mind only a series of blurred pictures running into each other then she closed her sketch book put up her pencils and went to bed it was twelve o'clock joseph was still thinking over the terms of mr dyson's will and the chapter on the coping stone the twins were taking their third split soda it was brotherly to divide a bottle and the mixture was less likely to be unfairly diluted phillis went to bed but she could not sleep the steps of the passers by the strange room the excitement of the day kept her awake she was like some fair yacht suddenly launched from the dock where she had grown slowly to her perfect shape upon the waters of the harbour which she takes for the waters of the great ocean she looked round her bedroom in carnarvon square and because it was not highgate thought it must be the vast shelterless and unpitying world of which she had so often heard and at thought of which brave as she was she had so often shuddered it was nearly three when she fairly slept and then she had a strange dream she thought that she was part of the great procession which never ended all day long in the streets only sometimes a little more crowded and sometimes a little thinner she pushed and hastened with the rest she would have liked to stay and examine the glittering things exhibited the gold and jewelry the dainty cakes and delicate fruits the gorgeous dresses in the windows but she could not all pushed on and she with them there had been no beginning of the rush and there seemed to be no end faces turned round and glared at her faces which she marked for a moment they were the same which she had seen in the morning faces hard and faces hungry faces cruel and faces forbidding faces that were bent on doing something desperate every kind of face except a sweet face that is a rare thing for a stranger to find in a london street the soft sweet faces belong to the country she wondered why they all looked at her so curiously perhaps because she was a stranger presently there was a sort of hue and cry and everybody began running she with them oddly enough they all ran after her why was that also because she was a stranger only the younger men ran but the rest looked on the twins however were both running among the pursuers the women pointed and flouted at her the older men nodded wagged their heads and laughed faster they ran and faster she fled they distanced she and her pursuers the crowd behind they passed beyond the streets and into country fields where hedges took the place of the brilliant windows they were somehow back in the old highgate paddock which had been so long her only outer world the pursuers were reduced to three or four among them by some odd chance the twin brethren and as one but who she could not tell caught up with her and laid his hand upon hers and she could run no longer and could resist no more but fell not with terror at all but rather a sense of relief and gladness into a clutch which was like an embrace of a lover for softness and strength she saw in front of her dead old abraham dyson who clapped his hands and cried well run well won the coping stone my phillis of your education she woke with a start and sat up looking round the room her dream was so vivid that she saw the group before her very eyes in the twilight herself with a figure dim and undistinguishable in the twilight leaning over her and a little distance off old abraham dyson himself standing as she best remembered him upright and with his hands upon his stick he laughed and wagged his head and nodded it as he said well run well won my phillis it is the coping stone this was a very remarkable dream for a young lady of nineteen had she told it to joseph jagenal it might have led his thoughts into a new channel she rubbed her eyes and the vision disappeared then she laid her head again upon the pillow just a little frightened at her ghosts and presently dropped off to sleep this time she had no more dreams but she awoke soon after it was daybreak being still unquiet in her new surroundings and now she remembered everything with a rush she had left highgate she was in carnarvon square she was in mr joseph jagenal's house she had been introduced to two gentlemen one of whom was said to have a child like nature all aglow with the flame of genius while the other was described as a great a noble fellow to know whom was a privilege and to converse with whom was an education she laughed when she thought of the pair like nebuchadnezzar she had forgotten her dream unlike that king she did not care to recall it the past was gone a new life was about to begin and the april sun was shining full upon her window blinds phillis sprang from her bed and tore open the curtains with eager hand perhaps facing her might be the tower of london perhaps the thames the silver thames with london bridge perhaps st paul's cathedral which christopher wren built in place of the old one destroyed by the great fire phillis's facts in history were short and decisive like the above no tower of london at all no st paul's cathedral no silver thames only a great square with houses all round carnarvon square at dawn not perhaps a fairy piece but wonderful in its novelty to this newly emancipated cloistered nun with whom a vivid sense of the beautiful had grown up by degrees in her mind fed only in the pictures supplied by the imagination she knew the trees that grew in lord manfield's park beyond the paddock she could catch in fine days a glimpse of the vast city that stretches itself out from the feet of breezy highgate she knew the flowers of her own garden and for the rest she imagined it river lake mountain forest and field she knew them only by talk with her guardian and the mighty ocean she knew because her french maid had crossed it when she quitted fair normandy and told her again and again of the horrors encountered by those who go down to the sea in ships so that a second garden was a new revelation besides it was bright and pretty there were the first flowers of spring gay tulips and pretty things whose name she did not know or could not make out from the window the shrubs and trees were green with the first sweet chlorine foliage of april clear and fresh from the broken buds which lay thick upon the ground the tender leaflets as yet all unsullied by the london smoke the pavement was deserted because it was as yet too early for any one even a milk boy to be out the only living person to be seen was a gardener already at work among the plants a great yearning came over her to be out in the open air and among the flowers at highgate she rose at all hours worked in the garden saddled and rode her pony in the field and amused herself in a thousand ways before the household rose subject to no restraint or law but one that she was not to open the front door or venture herself in the outer world mr jagenal said i was to do as i liked she said hesitating it cannot be wrong to go out of the front door now besides reasoning here like a casuist perhaps it is the back door which leads to that garden in a quarter of an hour she was ready she was not one of those young ladies who because no one is looking at them neglect their personal appearance on the contrary she always dressed for herself therefore she always dressed well this morning she wore a morning costume all one colour and i think it was gray but am not quite certain it was in the graceful fashion of last year lying in long curved lines and fitting closely to her slender and tall figure a black ribbon was tied round her neck and in her hat the hats of last year did not suit every kind of face but they suited the face of phillis fleming she wore one of those bright little birds whose destruction for the purposes of fashion we all deplore in her hand she carried as if she were still at highgate and going to saddle her pony a small riding whip and thus she opened the door and slid down the stairs of the great silent house as stealthily and almost as fearfully as the lady godiva on a certain memorable day it was a ghostly feeling which came over her when she ran across the broad hall and listened to the pattering of her own feet upon the oilcloth the broad daylight streamed through the reverbere but yet the place seemed only half lit up the closed doors on either hand looked as if dreadful things lurked behind them with something like a shudder she let down the door chain unbarred the bolts and opened the door as she passed through she was aware of a great rush across the hall behind her it was caesar the mastiff awakened by a noise as of one burgling he crept swiftly and silently up the kitchen stairs with intent to do a desperate deed of valour and found to his rapturous joy that it was only the young lady she who came the night before and that she was going out for an early morning walk a thing he for his part had not been permitted to do for many many moons not since he had been brought a puppy yet and innocent to the heart of london no one out at all except themselves what joy phillis shut the door very carefully behind her looked up and down the street and then running down the steps seized the happy caesar by the paws and danced round and round with him upon the pavement then they both ran a race she ran like atalanta but caesar led till the finish when out of a courtesy more than castilian he allowed himself to be beaten and phillis won by a neck this result pleased them both and phillis discovered that her race had brought her quite to the end of one side of the square and then looking about her she perceived that a gate of the garden was open and went in followed by caesar now in the seventh heaven this was better better than leading a pair of twins who sometimes tied knots with their legs the gate was left open by the under gardener who had arisen thus early in the morning with a view to carrying off some of the finer tulips for himself they raced and chased each other up and down the gravel walks between the lilacs and laburnums bursting into blossom presently they came to the under gardener himself who was busy potting a selection of the tulips he stared as if at a ghost half past five in the morning and a young lady with a dog looking at him he stiffened his upper lip and put the spade before the flower pots beg pardon miss no dogs allowed on the rules miss william she replied for she was experienced in undergardeners knew that they always answer to the name of william also that they are exposed to peculiar temptations in the way of bulb william for whom you are potting those tulips then because the poor youth's face was suffused and his countenance was unto himself for a betrayal she whistled actually whistled to caesar and ran on laughing here's a rum start said william a young lady as knows my name what i'm up to and all coming here at five o clock in the blessed morning when all young ladies as i ever heard of has got their noses in their pillowses else 'tain't no good being a young lady ketches me a disposin' of the toolups with a dawg and whistles like a young nobleman he began putting back the flowers no knowin' who she mayn't tell nor what she mayn't say it's dangerous william by different roads montaigne wrote we arrive at the same end william's choice of the path of virtue was in this case due to phillis's early visit chapter v te duce caesar tired of running the girl began to walk it was an april morning when the east wind for once had forgotten to blow walking she whistled one of the ditties that she knew she had a very superior mode of performing on that natural piccolo flute the human mouth it was a way of her own not at all like the full round whistle of the street boy with as much volume as in a bottle of ' port as full of unmeaning sound as a later poem of robert browning's and as unmelodious as the instrument on which that poet has always played quite the contrary phillis's whistle was of a curious delicacy and of a bullfinch like note only more flexible she trilled out an old english ditty when love was young first simply and then with variations presently forgetting that she was not in the old paddock she began to sing it in her fresh young voice william the under gardener and caesar the dog her only audience they were differently affected william grew sad thinking of his sins the dog wagged his tail and rushed round and round the singer by way of appreciation music saddens the guilty but maketh glad those who are clear of conscience it was half past six when she became aware that she was getting hungry in the old times it was easy to descend to the kitchen and make what indian people call a chota hazri a little breakfast for herself now she was not certain whether supposing the servants were about her visit would be well received or supposing they were not yet up she should know where to find the kettle the tea and the firewood she left the garden followed by caesar who was also growing hungry after his morning walk and resolved on going straight home there were two objections to this first she did not know one house from another and they were all alike second she did not know the number and could not have read it had she known it mr jagenal's door was painted a dark brown so were they all mr jagenal's door had a knocker so had they all could she go all round the square knocking at every door and waking up the people to ask if mr jagenal lived there she knew little of the world but it did occur to her that it would seem unconventional for a young lady to knock in at six in the morning she did not most unfortunately think of asking william the under gardener she turned to the dog now caesar she said take me home caesar wagged his tail nodded his head and started off before her at a smart walk looking round now and then to see that his charge was following lucky said phillis that i thought of the dog caesar proceeded with great solemnity to cross the road and began to march down the side of the square phillis expecting him to stop at every house but he did not arrived at the corner where carnarvon street strikes off the square he turned aside and looking round to see that his convoy was steering the same course he trudged sturdily down that thoroughfare this cannot be right thought phillis but she was loath to leave the dog for to lose him would be to lose everything and she followed perhaps he knew of a back way perhaps he would take her for a little walk and show her the tower of london caesar no longer running and bounding around her walked on with the air of one who has an important business on hand and means to carry it through carnarvon street is long and of the half dismal half genteel order of bloomsbury caesar walked halfway down the street then he suddenly came to a dead stop it was in front of a tavern the carnarvon arms the door of which for it was an early house was already open and the potboy was taking down the shutters the fact that the shutters were only half down made the dog at first suspect that there was something wrong the house as he knew it always had the shutters down and the portals open as however there seemed no unlawfulness of licensed hours to consider the dog marched into the bar without so much as looking to see if phillis was following and immediately lay down with his head on his paws why does he go in there said phillis and what is the place she pushed the door which as usual in such establishments hung half open by means of a leathern strap and looked in nobody in the place but caesar she entered and tried to understand where she was a smell of stale beer and stale tobacco hanging about the room smote her senses and made her sick and faint she saw the bottles and glasses the taps and the counters and she understood she was in a drinking place one of the wicked dens of which her guardian sometimes spoke she was in a tavern that is a place where workmen spend their earnings and leave their families to starve she looked round her with curiosity and a little fear presently she became aware of the early risen potboy who having taken down the shutters was proceeding about his usual work behind the bar when his eyes fell upon the astonishing sight of a young lady a real young lady as he saw at once standing in the bottle and jug department he then observed the dog and comprehended that she was come there after caesar and not for purposes of refreshment why miss he said caesar thinks he's out with the two gentlemen he brings them here regular you see every morning and they takes their little glass don't they caesar probably thought watchful phillis anxious to learn probably a custom of polite life which mr dyson had neglected to teach her and yet he always spoke with such bitterness of public houses will you take a drop of somethink miss asked the polite assistant tapping the handles hospitably what shall it be i should like said phillis to be sure it's full early the man went on for a young lady and all but lor' bless your 'art it's never none too early for most when they've got the coin give it a name miss and there the guvnor he isn't hup and we won't chalk it down to you nor never ask you for the money on'y give it a name thank you very much said phillis i should like to have a cup of tea if i could take it outside he shook his head a gesture of disappointment it can't be had here tea as if he had thought better things of so much beauty tea swipes after all miss it's your way and no doubt you don't know no better there's a early caufy 'ouse a little way up the street you must find it for yourself because the dawg he don't know it knows nothink about tea that dawg you go out miss and caesar he'll go to phillis thanked him again for his attention and followed his advice caesar instantly got up and sallied forth with her instead however of returning to the square he went straight on down carnarvon street still leading the way turning first to the right and then to the left he conducted phillis through what seemed a labyrinth of streets these were mostly streets of private houses not of the best but rather of the seediest it was now nearly seven o'clock and the signs of life were apparent the paper boy was beginning with the milk man his rounds the postman's foot was preparing for the first turn on his daily treadmill of doorsteps and double knocks the workmen paid by time were strolling to their hours of idleness with bags of tools windows were thrown open here and there and an early servant might be seen rejoicing to bang her mats at the street door phillis tried to retain her faith in caesar and followed obediently it was easy to see that the dog knew where he was going and had a distinct purpose in his mind it was to be hoped she thought that his purpose included a return home as soon as possible because she was getting a little tired streets always streets who were the people who lived in them all could there be in every house the family life of which mr dyson used to tell her the life she had never seen but which he promised she should one day see the sweet life where father and mother and children live together and share their joys and sorrows she began to look into the windows as she walked along in the hope of catching a hasty glance at so much of the family life as might be seen so early in the morning she passed one house where the family were distinctly visible gathered together in the front kitchen she stopped and looked down through the iron railings the children were seated at the table the mother was engaged in some cooking operations at the fire were they about to sing a hymn and to have family prayers before their breakfast not at this house apparently for the woman suddenly turned from her occupation at the fire and without any adequate motive that phillis could discern began boxing the children's ears all round instantly there arose a mighty cry from those alike who had already been boxed and those who sat expectant of their turn evidently this was one of the houses where the family life was not a complete success the scene jarred on phillis upsetting her pretty little arcadian castle of domestic happiness she felt disappointed and hurried on after her conductor it is sad to relate that caesar presently entered another public house this time phillis went in after him with no hesitation at all she encountered the landlord in person who greeted the dog asked him what he was doing so early and then explained to miss fleming that he was accustomed to call at the house every day about noon accompanied by two gentlemen who had their little whack and then went away and that she only had to go through the form of coming and departing in order to get caesar out too little whack thought phillis little glass what a lot of customs and expressions i have to learn for those interested in the sagacity of dogs or in comparative psychology it may be noted as a remarkable thing that when caesar came out of that second public house he hesitated as one struck suddenly with a grievous doubt had he been doing right he took a few steps in advance then he looked round and stopped then he looked up and down the street finally he came back to phillis and asked for instructions with a wistful gaze phillis turned round and said home caesar then after barking twice caesar led the way back again with alacrity and renewed confidence he not only led the way home but he chose a short cut known only to himself perhaps he thought his charge might be tired perhaps he wished to show her some further varieties of english life in the districts surrounding bloomsbury are courts which few know except the policeman even that dauntless functionary is chary of venturing himself into them except in couples and then he would rather stay outside if only out of respect to a playful custom of old standing prevalent among the inhabitants they keep flower pots on their first and second floors and when a policeman passes through the court they drop them over if no one is hurt there is no need of an apology if a constable receives the projectile on his head or shoulder it is a deplorable accident which those who have caused it are the first to publicly lament it was through a succession of these courts that the dog led phillis those of the men who had work to do were by this time gone to do it those who had none together with those who felt strongly on the subject of adam's curse and therefore wished for none stayed at home and smoked pipes leaning against the doorposts the ideal heaven of these noble englishmen is for ever to lean against doorposts and for ever to smoke pipes in a land where it is always balmy morning and where there are houses handy into which they can slouch from time to time for a drink the ladies their consorts were mostly engaged in such household occupations as could be carried on out of doors and within conversation reach of each other the court was therefore musical with sweet feminine voices the children played together no officer of the london school board having yet ventured to face those awful flower pots in a continuous stream along the central line of the courts phillis observed that the same game was universal and that the players were apparently all of the same age she also remarked a few things which struck her as worth noting the language of the men differed considerably from that used by mr dyson and their pronunciation seemed to her to lack delicacy the difference most prominent at first was the employment of a single adjective to qualify everything an observance so universal as to arrest at once the attention of a stranger the women it was also apparent were all engaged in singing together a kind of chorus of lamentation in irregular strophe and antistrophe on the wicked ways of their men rough as were the natives of this place no one molested phillis the men stared at her and exchanged criticisms on her personal appearance these were complimentary although not poetically expressed the women stared harder but said nothing until she had passed by then they made remarks which would have been unpleasant had they been audible the children alone took no notice of her the immunity from insult which belongs to young ladies in english thoroughfares depends i fear more upon force of public opinion than upon individual chivalry una could trust herself alone with her lion she can only trust herself among the roughs of london when they are congregated in numbers nor i think the spectacle of goodness and purity combined with beauty produce in their rude breasts by comparison with themselves those feelings of shame opening up the way to repentance which are expected by self conscious maidens ministering in the paths of dorcas phillis walked along with steadfast eyes watching everything and afraid of nothing because she knew of no cause for fear the dog decreasing the distance between them marched a few feet in advance right through the middle of the children who fell back and formed a lane for them to pass once phillis stopped to look at a child a great eyed soft faced curly haired beautiful boy she spoke to him asked him his name held out her hand to him the fathers and the mothers looked on and watched for the result which would probably take the form of coin the boy prefaced his reply with an oath of great fulness and rich flavour phillis had never heard the phrase before but it sounded unmusically on her ear then he held out his hand and demanded a copper the watchful parents and guardians on the door steps murmured approval and all the children shouted together like the men of ephesus at this juncture caesar looked round he mastered the situation in a moment surrounded and isolated his convoy by a rapid movement almost simultaneous in flank and rear barked angrily at the children who threatened to close in en masse and make short work of poor phillis and gave her clearly to understand once for all that she was to follow him with silent and unquestioning docility she obeyed and they came out of the courts and into the squares phillis began to hope that the tower of london would presently heave in sight or at least the silver thames with london bridge but they did not she was very tired by this time it was nearly eight and she had been up and out since five even her vigorous young limbs were beginning to feel dragged by her three hours' ramble quite suddenly caesar turned a corner as it seemed and she found herself once more in carnarvon square the dog feeling that he had done enough for reputation walked soberly along the pavement until he came to no when he ascended the steps and sat down the door was open jane the housemaid assiduously polishing the bell handles lor' a mercy miss she cried i thought you was a bed and asleep wherever have you a bin with caesar too we went for a walk and lost ourselves phillis replied jane i am very hungry what time is breakfast the master has his at eight miss but mr cornelius he told me yesterday that you would breakfast with him and mr humphrey about eleven he said and mr humphrey thought you'd like a little fresh fish and a prawn curry perhaps i shall breakfast with mr joseph said phillis she went to her room in a little temper it was too bad to be treated like a child wanting nice things for breakfast a little more experience taught her that any culinary forethought on the part of the twins was quite sure to be so directed as to secure their own favourite dishes she did breakfast with joseph made tea for him told him all about her morning adventures received his admonitions in good part and sent him to his office half an hour later than usual one of his letters bore an american stamp this he opened putting the rest in a leather pocket book this letter concerns you miss fleming he apologised in an old fashioned way that is why i opened it before you it comes from your remaining guardian mr lawrence colquhoun listen to what he says he writes from new york 'i am sorry to hear that my old friend abraham dyson is gone i shall be ready to assume my new responsibilities in a fortnight after you receive this letter as i hope to land in that time at liverpool meantime give my kindest regards to my ward' so lawrence colquhoun home again tell me about him is he grave and old like mr dyson will he want me to go back to the old life and talk 'subjects' mr jagenal much as i loved my dear old guardian i could not consent to be shut up any more you will not be asked my dear young lady mr colquhoun is a man under forty he is neither old nor grave he was in the army with your father he sold out seven or eight years ago spent a year or two about london and then disappeared i am his lawyer and from time to time he used to send me his address and draw on me for money that is all i can tell you of his travels lawrence colquhoun miss fleming was a popular man everybody liked him especially the the fair sex was he very clever n no i should say not very clever not stupid and now one thinks of it it is remarkable that he never was known to excel in anything though he hunted rode shot and did i suppose all the other things that young men in the army are fond of he was fond of reading too and had a considerable fund of information but he never excelled in anything phillis shook her head mr dyson used to say that the people we like best are the people who are in our own line and have acknowledged their own inferiority to ourselves perhaps the reason why mr colquhoun was liked was that he did not compete with the men who wished to excel but contentedly took a second place this was one of the bits of dysonian philosophy with which phillis occasionally graced her conversation quoting it as reverently as if it had been a line from shakespeare sometimes with startling effect i shall try to like him i am past nineteen and at twenty one i shall be my own mistress if i do not like him i shall not live with him any longer after that i think you will not in any case live at mr colquhoun's residence said joseph but i am sure you will like him a fortnight to wait you must not be shy of him joseph went on you have nothing to be afraid of think highly of yourself to begin with i do said phillis mr dyson always tried to make me think highly of myself he told me my education was better than that of any girl he knew of course that was partly his kind way of encouraging me mr dyson said that shyness was a kind of cowardice or else a kind of vanity people who are afraid of other people he said either mistrust themselves or think they are not rated at their true value but i think i am not at all afraid of strangers do i look like being afraid she drew herself up to her full height and smiled a conscious superiority perhaps you will think that i rate myself too highly that said joseph with a compliment really creditable for a beginner that would be difficult miss fleming when the twins prepared to take their morning walk at twelve an unexpected event happened caesar for the first time on record and for no reason apparent or assigned refused to accompany them they went out without him feeling lonely unhappy and a little unprotected they passed the carnarvon arms without a word at the next halting place they entered the bar in silence glancing guiltily at each other could it be that the passion for drink divested of its usual trappings of pretence presented itself suddenly to the brethren in its horrid ugliness they came out with shame faced looks and returned home earlier than usual they were perfectly sober and separated without the usual cheery allusions to work perhaps the conscience was touched for when jane took up their tea she found the poet in his workshop sitting at the table and the artist in his studio standing at his easel before the one was a blank sheet of paper before the other was a blank canvas both were fractious and both found fault with the tea after dinner they took a bottle of port which humphrey said they really felt to want chapter vi i do not know one of my sex no woman's face remember save from my glass mine own in the afternoon phillis who was writing up her diary after the manner of the ancient aztec received a visitor for the first time in her life the girl found herself face to face with a lady men she knew chiefly men of advanced age they came to dine with abraham dyson women servants she knew for she had a french maid imported too young to be mischievous and there had been a cook at highgate with two or three maids not one of these virgins possessed the art of reading or they would never have been engaged by mr dyson nor was she encouraged by her guardian to talk with them also she knew that in the fulness of time she was to be somehow transferred from the exclusive society of men to that in which the leading part would be taken by ladies women brought up delicately like herself but not all unhappily on the same sound fundamental principle of oral teaching among the loose odds and ends which remained in mr dyson's portfolios and where lay all that joseph jagenal could ever find to help in completing his great system of education was the following scrap women brought up with women are hindered in their perfect development let the girls be separated from the society of their sex and be educated mostly among men in this way the receptivity of the feminine mind may be turned to best account in the acquirement of robust masculine ideas every girl may become a mother let her therefore sit among men and listen perhaps this deprivation of the society of her own sex was a greater loss to phillis than her ignorance of reading consider what it entailed she grew up without the most rudimentary notions of the great art of flirtation she had never even heard of looking out for an establishment she had no idea of considering every young man as a possible husband she had indeed no glimmerings not the faintest streak of dawning twilight in the matter of love while as for angling hooking a big fish and landing him she was no better than a heathen hottentot this was the most important loss but there were others she knew how to dress partly by instinct partly by looking at pictures but she knew nothing about making up nature which gave her the figure of hebe made this loss insignificant to her though it is perhaps the opinion of mr worth that there is no figure so good but art can improve it but not to know about making up is for a woman to lose a large part of useful sympathy for other women again she knew nothing of the way in which girls pour little confidences all about trifles into each other's ears she had not cultivated that intelligence which girls can only learn from each other and which enables them to communicate volumes with a half lifted eyelid she had a man's way of saying out what she thought and even so far as her dogmatic training permitted of thinking for herself she did not understand the mystery with which women enwrap themselves partly working on the imagination of youth and partly through their love of secluded talk a remnant of barbaric times and a proof of the subjection of the sex the frou frou of life was lost to her and being without mystery with the art of flirtation with nothing to hide and no object to gain phillis was entirely free from the great vice into which women of the weaker nature are apt to fall she was perfectly and wholly truthful and now she was about to make acquaintance for the first time with a lady one of her own sex and of her own station i suppose phillis must have preserved the characteristic instincts of her womanhood despite her extraordinary training because the first thing she observed was that her visitor was dressed in a style quite beyond her power of conception and imperfect taste so she generalised from an individual case and jumped at the notion that here was a very superior woman indeed the superiority was in the young person at melton and mowbray's who designed the dress but that phillis did not know a more remarkable point with mrs cassilis phillis's visitor than her dress was her face it was so regular as to be faultless it might have been modelled and so have served for a statue it was also as cold as a face of marble men have prayed men who have fallen into feminine traps to be delivered from every species of woman except the cold woman even king solomon who had great opportunities including long life of studying the sex mentions her not and yet i think that she is the worst of all lord give us tender hearted wives when we carve our ideal woman in marble we do not generally choose the wise minerva nor the chaste diana but venus soft eyed lissom tender and generally true mrs cassilis called as she entered the room she saw a tall and beautiful girl with eyes of a deep brown who rose to greet her with a little timidity she was taken by surprise she expected to find a rough and rather vulgar young woman of no style and unformed manners she saw before her a girl whose attitude spoke unmistakably of delicacy and culture whatever else miss fleming might be she was clearly a lady that was immediately apparent and mrs cassilis was not likely to make a mistake on a point of such vital importance a young lady of graceful figure most attractive face and which was all the more astonishing considering her education perfectly dressed phillis in fact was attired in the same simple morning costume in which she had taken her early morning walk on the table before her were her sketch book and her pencils mrs cassilis was dressed for her part in robes which it had taken the highest talent of regent street to produce her age was about thirty her cold face shone for a moment with the wintery light of a forced smile but her eyes did not soften as she took phillis's hand phillis's pulse beat a little faster in spite of her courage art face to face with nature the girl just as she left her nunnery ignorant of mankind before the perfect woman of the world they looked curiously in each other's eyes now the first lesson taught by the world is the way to dissemble mrs cassilis said to herself here is a splendid girl she is not what i expected to see this is a girl to cultivate and bring out a girl to do one credit but she said aloud miss fleming i am sure it is you are exactly the sort of a girl i expected then she sat down and looked at her comfortably i am the wife of your late guardian's nephew mr gabriel cassilis you have never met him yet but i hope you will very soon make his acquaintance thank you said phillis simply we used to think until mr dyson died and his preposterous will was read that his eccentric behaviour was partly your fault but when we found that he had left you nothing of course we felt that we had done you an involuntary wrong and the will was made when you were a mere child and could have no voice or wish in the matter i had plenty of money said phillis why should poor mr dyson want to leave me any more quite untaught as if any one could have too much money forty thousand pounds a year and all going to female education not respectable female education if it had been left to girton college or even to finding bread and butter with the catechism and contentment for charity girls in poke bonnets it would have been less dreadful but to bring up young ladies as you were brought up my poor miss fleming am i not respectable asked phillis as humbly as a west indian nigger before emancipation asking if he was not a man and a brother my dear child i hear you cannot even read and write that is quite true but everybody learns to read and write all the sunday school children even know how to read and write perhaps that is a misfortune for the sunday school children phillis calmly observed it would very likely be better for the sunday school children were they taught more useful things here phillis was plagiarising using mr dyson's own words at least every one in society knows them miss fleming i am ten years older than you and if you will only trust me i will give you such advice and assistance as i can you are very kind said phillis with a little distrust of which she was ashamed i know that i must be very ignorant because i have already seen so much that i never suspected before if you will only tell me of my deficiencies i will try to repair them and i can learn reading and writing any time you know if it is at all necessary then let us consider my poor girl i fear you have to learn the very rudiments of society of course you are quite ignorant of things that people talk about books are out of the question music and concerts art and pictures china perhaps mr dyson collected no a pity china would be a great help the opera and theatres balls and dancing the rink what is the rink asked phillis the latest addition to the arts of flirtation and killing time perhaps you can fall back upon church matters are you a ritualist what is that my dear girl mrs cassilis looked unutterable horror as a thought struck her did you actually never go to church no mr dyson used to read prayers every day why should people go to church when they pray why why because people in society all go because you must set an example to the lower orders dear me it is very shocking and girls are all expected to take such an interest in religion but the first thing is to learn reading she had been carrying a little box in her hands all this time which she now placed on the table and opened it contained small wooden squares with gaudy pictures pasted on them this is a pictorial alphabet an introduction to all education let me show you how to use it what is this she held up one square it is a very bad picture abominably coloured of a hatchet or a kitchen chopper an axe my dear a x e the initial letter a is below in its two forms and this that is worse i suppose it is meant for a cow what a cow bull my dear b u l l bull the initial b is below and is this asked phillis with great contempt the way to learn reading a kitchen chopper stands for a and a cow with her legs out of drawing stands for b unless i can draw my cows for myself mrs cassilis i shall not try to learn reading you can draw then i draw a little said phillis not so well of course as girls brought up respectably pardon me my dear miss fleming if i say that sarcasm is not considered good style it fails to attract good style thought phillis means talking so as to attract do let me draw you said phillis her temper was not faultless and it was rising by degrees so that she wanted the relief of silence do let me draw you as you sit there she did not wait for permission but sketched in a few moments a profile portrait of her visitor in which somehow the face perfectly rendered in its coldness and strength was without the look which its owner always thought was there the look which invites sympathy the real unsympathetic nature caught in a moment by some subtle artist's touch was there instead mrs cassilis looked at it and an angry flush crossed her face which phillis wondering why noted you caricature extremely well i congratulate you on that power but it is a dangerous accomplishment even more dangerous than the practice of sarcasm the girl who indulges in the latter at most fails to attract but the caricaturist repels oh said phillis innocent of any attempt to caricature but trying to assimilate this strange dogmatic teaching we must always remember that the most useful weapons in a girl's hands are those of submission faith and reverence men hate they hate and detest women who think for themselves they positively loathe the woman who dares turn them into ridicule she looked as if she could be one of the few who possess that daring fortunately she went on such women are rare even among the strong minded crew the shrieking sisterhood most of them are obliged to worship some man or other of their own school i don't understand pardon me mrs cassilis that i am so stupid i say what i think and you tell me i am sarcastic girls in society never say what they think they assent or at best ask a question timidly and i make a little pencil sketch of you and you tell me i am a caricaturist girls who can draw must draw in the conventional manner recognised by society they do not draw likenesses they copy flowers and sometimes draw angels and crosses to please men they draw soldiers and horses but why cannot girls draw what they please and why must they try to attract mrs cassilis looked at this most innocent of girls with misgiving could she be so ignorant as she seemed or was she pretending why phillis fleming only ask me that question again in six months' time if you dare phillis shook her head she was clearly out of her depth have you any other accomplishments i am afraid not i can play a little mr dyson liked my playing but it is all from memory and from ear will you if you do not mind play something to me victoria cassilis cared no more for music than the deaf adder which hath no understanding by dint of much teaching however she had learned to execute creditably the playing of phillis sweet spontaneous and full of feeling had no power to touch her heart ye yes she said that is the sort of playing which some young men like not those young men from oxford who 'follow' art and pretend to understand good music you may see them asleep at afternoon recitals you must play at small parties only phillis can you sing i sing as i play said phillis rising and shutting the piano that is only i suppose for small parties the colour came into her cheeks and her brown eyes brightened she was accustomed to think that her playing gave pleasure then she reproached herself for ingratitude and she asked pardon i am cross with myself for being so deficient pray forgive me mrs cassilis it is very kind of you to take all this trouble my dear you are a hundred times better than i expected phillis remembered what she had said ten minutes before but was silent a hundred times better can you dance my dear no antoinette tells me how she used to dance with the villagers when she was a little girl at yport that can be easily learned do you ride at any other time phillis would have replied in the affirmative now she only asserted a certain power of sticking on acquired on pony back and in a paddock mrs cassilis sighed after all a few lessons will give you a becoming seat nothing so useful as clever horsemanship but how shall we disguise the fact that you cannot read or write i shall not try to disguise it phillis cried jealous of mr dyson's good name well my dear we come now to the most important question of all where do you get your dresses o mrs cassilis do not say that my dresses are calculated to repel cried poor phillis her spirit quite broken by this time antoinette and i made this one between us sometimes i ordered them at highgate but i like my own best mrs cassilis put up a pair of double eye glasses because they were now arrived at a really critical stage of the catechism there was something in the simple dress which forced her admiration it was quite plain and compared with her own as a daisy is to a dahlia it is a very nice dress she said critically whether it is your figure or your own taste or material i do not know but you are dressed perfectly miss fleming no young lady could dress better women meet on the common ground of dress phillis blushed with pleasure at all events she and her critic had something on which they could agree i will come to morrow morning and we will examine your wardrobe together if you will allow me and then we will go to melton mowbray's and i will write to mr jagenal asking him to bring you to dinner in the evening if you will come i should like it very much said phillis but you have made me a little afraid you need not be afraid at all and it will be a very small party two or three friends of my husband's and two men who have just come home and published a book which is said to be clever one is a brother of lord isleworth mr ronald dunquerque and the other is a captain ladds you have only to listen and look interested then i will come and it is very kind of you mrs cassilis especially since you do not like me that was quite true but not a customary thing to be said phillis perceived dislike in the tones of her visitor's voice in her eyes in her manner did mrs cassilis dislike her for her fresh and unsophisticated nature or for her beauty or for the attractiveness which breathed from every untaught look and gesture of the girl swedenborg taught that the lower nature cannot love the nobler that the highest heavens are open to all who like to go there but the atmosphere is found congenial to very few not like you mrs cassilis hardly conscious of any dislike answered after her kind my dear i hope we shall like each other very much do not let fancies get into your pretty head i shall try to be your friend if you will let me again the wintry smile upon the lips and the lifting of the cold eyes which smiled not but phillis was deceived by the warmth of the words she took her visitor's hand and kissed it the act was a homage to the woman of superior knowledge oh yes she murmured if you only will i shall call you phillis my name is victoria and you will tell me more about girls in society i will show you girls in society which is a great deal better for you said mrs cassilis i looked at the girls i saw yesterday as we drove through the streets some of them were walking like this she had been standing during most of this conversation and now she began walking across the room in that ungraceful pose of the body which was more affected last year than at present ladies do occasionally have intervals of lunacy in the matter of taste but if you give them time they come round again even crinolines went out at last after the beauty of a whole generation had been spoiled by them then there were others who walked like this she laid her head on one side and affected a languid air which i have myself remarked as being prevalent in the high street of islington now the way from highgate to carnarvon square lies through that thoroughfare then there were the boys i never dreamed of such a lot of boys and they were all whistling this was the tune she threw her head back and began to whistle the popular song of last spring you know what it was it came between the favourite air from the fille de madame angot and that other sweet melody tommy make room for your uncle and was called hold the fort it refreshed the souls of revivalists in her majesty's theatre and of all the street boys in this great babylon mrs cassilis positively shrieked my dear dear dear girl she cried you must not whistle is it wrong to whistle not morally wrong i suppose girls never do anything morally wrong but it is far worse phillis far worse it is unspeakably vulgar oh said phillis i am so sorry and my dear one thing more do not cultivate the power of mimicry which you undoubtedly possess men are afraid of young ladies who can imitate them for actresses authors artists and common people of that sort of course it does not matter but for us it is different and now phillis i must leave you till to morrow i have great hopes of you you have an excellent figure a very pretty and attractive face winning eyes and a taste in dress which only wants cultivation and that we will begin to morrow at melton and mowbray's oh yes said phillis clapping her hands that will be delightful i have never seen a shop yet she has never seen a shop cried mrs cassilis child it is hard indeed to realise your awful condition of mind that a girl of nineteen should be able to say that she has never seen a shop my dear your education has been absolutely unchristian and poor mr dyson i fear cut off suddenly in his sins without the chance of repentance chapter vii bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear joseph jagenal and his charge were the last arrivals at mrs cassilis's dinner it was not a large party there were two ladies of the conventional type well dressed well looking and not particularly interesting with them their two husbands young men of an almost preternatural solemnity such solemnity as sometimes results from a too concentrated attention to the money market they were there as friends of mr cassilis whom they regarded with the reverence justly due to success they longed to speak to him privately on investments but did not dare there were also two lions newly captured ladds the dragoon of the joint literary venture the little sphere by the dragoon and the younger son is standing in that contemplative attitude by which hungry men awaiting the announcement of dinner veil an indecent eagerness to begin the other the younger son is talking to mr cassilis phillis remarked that the room was furnished in a manner quite beyond anything she knew where would be the dingy old chairs sofas and tables of mr dyson's or the solid splendour of joseph jagenal's drawing room compared with the glories of decorative art which mrs cassilis had called to her aid she had no time to make more than a general survey as she went to greet her hostess mrs cassilis for her part observed that phillis was dressed carefully and was looking her best she had on a simple white dress of that soft stuff called i think indian muslin which falls in graceful folds a pale lavender sash relieved the monotony of the white and set off her shapely figure her hair done up in the simplest fashion was adorned with a single white rose her cheeks were a little flushed with excitement but her eyes were steady phillis stole a glance at the other ladies they were dressed she was glad to observe in the same style as herself but not better that naturally raised her spirits then mrs cassilis introduced her husband when phillis next day attempted to reproduce her impressions of the evening she had no difficulty in recording the likeness of mr gabriel cassilis with great fidelity he was exactly like old time the long lean limbs the pronounced features the stooping figure the forelock which our enemy will not allow us to take the head bald save for that single ornamental curl and a fringe of gray hair over the ears all the attributes of time were there except the scythe perhaps he kept that at his office he was a very rich man his house was in kensington palace gardens a fact which speaks volumes its furnishing was a miracle of modern art his paintings were undoubted his portfolios of water colours were worth many thousands and his horses were perfect he was a director of many companies but you cannot live in kensington palace garden by directing companies and he had an office in the city which consisted of three rooms in the first were four or five clerks always writing in the second was the secretary always writing in the third was mr gabriel cassilis himself always giving audience he married at sixty three because he wanted an establishment in his old age he was too old to expect love from a woman and too young to fall in love with a girl he did not marry in order to make a pet of his wife indeed he might as well have tried stroking a statue of minerva as petting victoria pengelley and he made no secret of his motive in proposing for the young lady as delicately as possible he urged that though her family was good her income was small that it is better to be rich and married than poor and single and he offered if she consented to become his wife to give her all that she could wish for or ask on the material and artistic side of life victoria pengelley on receipt of the offer which was communicated by a third person her cousin behaved very strangely she first refused absolutely then she declared that she would have taken the man but that it was now impossible then she retracted the last statement and after a week of agitation accepted the offer and i must say victoria said her cousin that you have made a strange fuss about accepting an offer from one of the richest men in london he is elderly it is true but the difference between eight and twenty and sixty lies mostly in the imagination i will write to mr cassilis to night which she did and they were married she trembled a great deal during the marriage ceremony mr cassilis was pleased at this appearance of emotion which he attributed to causes quite remote from any thought in the lady's mind calm to all outward seeming he said to himself victoria is capable of the deepest passion they had now been married between two and three years they had one child a boy it is only to be added that mr cassilis settled the sum of fifteen thousand pounds upon the wedding day on his wife and that they lived together in that perfect happiness which is to be expected from well bred people who marry without pretending to love each other their dinners were beyond praise the wine was incomparable but their evenings were a little frigid a sense of cold splendour filled the house the child which belongs to new things and to new men the new man thirty years ago was loud ostentatious and vulgar the new man now there are a great many more of them is very often quiet unpretending and well bred he understands art and is a patron he enjoys the advantages which his wealth affords him he knows how to bear his riches with dignity and with reserve the only objection to him is that he wants to go where other men who were new in the last generation go and do what they do mr cassilis welcomed miss fleming and joseph jagenal and resumed his conversation with jack dunquerque that young man looked much the same as when we saw him last on the slopes of the sierra nevada his tall figure had not filled out but his slight moustache had just a little increased in size and now he looked a good deal bored i have never i confess his host was saying wielding a double eye glass instead of his scythe i have never been attracted by the manners and customs of uncivilised people my sympathies cease i fear where banks end you are only interested in the country of lombardy yes very good precisely so outside the pale of banks men certainly carry their money about with them which prevents the accumulation of wealth my dear sir civilisation was born when men learned to confide in each other modern history begins with the fuggers of whom you may have read i assure you i never did said jack truthfully then dinner was announced phillis found herself on the right of mr cassilis next to her sat captain ladds mr dunquerque was at the opposite corner of the table he had given his arm to mrs cassilis mrs cassilis phillis saw was watching her by occasional glances the girl felt a little anxious but she was not awkward after all she thought the customs of society at a dinner table cannot be very different from those observed and taught her by mr dyson perhaps her manner of adjusting things was a little wanting in finish and delicacy too downright also mrs cassilis observed she made no attempt to talk with captain ladds her neighbour but was curiously enough deeply interested in the conversation of mr cassilis ladds was too young for phillis despite his five and thirty years old men and greybeards she knew young men she did not know she could form no guess what line of talk would be adopted by a young man one who had a deep bass voice when he spoke and attacked his dinner with a vigour past understanding phillis was interested in him and a little afraid lest he should talk to her others watched her too jack dunquerque his view a little intercepted by the epergne lifted furtive glances at the bright and pretty girl at the other end of the table joseph jagenal looked at her with honest pride in the beauty of his ward they talked politics but not in the way to which she was accustomed mr dyson and his brother greybeards were like cassandra elijah jeremiah and a good many prophets of the present day inasmuch as the more they discussed affairs the more they prophesied disaster so that phillis had learned from them to regard the dreadful future with terror every day seemed to make these sages more dismal phillis had not yet learned that the older we get the wiser we grow and the wiser we grow the more we tremble that those are most light hearted who know the least at this table politics were talked in a very different manner they laughed where the sages wagged their heads and groaned they even discussed with a familiarity which seemed to drive out anxiety the favorite bugbear of her old politicians the continental supremacy of germany the two young city men who were as solemn as a pair of home secretaries listened to their host with an eager interest and deference which the other two who were not careful about investments did not imitate phillis observed the difference and wondered what it meant then mr cassilis as if he had communicated as many ideas about russia as he thought desirable turned the conversation upon travelling in the interests of the dragoon and the younger son i suppose he said addressing jack that in your travels among the islanders you practised the primitive mode of barter we did and they cheated us when they could which shows that they have improved upon the primitive man i suppose he was honest i should think not said the host the most honest classes in the world are the richest people who want to get things always have a tendency to be dishonest england is the most honest nation because it is the richest france is the next germany you see which is a poor country yielded to the temptations of poverty and took sleswick holstein alsace and lorraine i believe that men began with dishonesty adam for example said ladds took what he ought not to have taken o captain ladds this was one of two ladies she who had read up the new book before coming to the dinner and had so far an advantage over the other that is just like one of the wicked things the delightfully wicked things in the little sphere now we know which of the two did the wicked things it was the other man said ladds is it fair to ask the lady went on how you wrote the book she was one of those who could she get the chance would ask messieurs erckmann and chatrian themselves to furnish her with a list of the paragraphs and the ideas due to each in their last novel ladds looked as if the question was beyond his comprehension at last he answered slowly steel pen the other man had a gold pen no no i mean did you write one chapter and your collaborateur the next or how let me think it over replied ladds as if it were a conundrum mrs cassilis came to the rescue at all events she said the great thing is that the book is a success i have not read it but i hear there are many clever and witty things in it also some wicked things of course if you write wickedness you are sure of an audience i don't think mr dunquerque she added with a smile that it is the business of gentlemen to attack existing institutions jack shook his head it was not my writing it was the other man i did what i could to tone him down have you read the immortal work ladds asked his neighbour he had not spoken to her yet but he had eyes in his head and he was gradually getting interested in the silent girl who sat beside him and listened with such rapt interest to the conversation this great and manifest interest was the only sign to show that phillis was not accustomed to dinners in society ladds thought that she must be some shy maiden from the country a little rustical perhaps he noticed now that her eyes were large and bright that her features were clear and delicate that she was looking at himself with a curious pity as if which was indeed the case she believed the statement about his having written the wicked things and then he wondered how so bright a girl had been able to listen to the prosy dogmatics of mr cassilis yet she had listened and with pleasure phillis was at that stage in her worldly education when she would have listened with pleasure to anybody mr moody a lecture on astronomy a penny reading an amateur dramatic performance or an essay in the edinburgh for everything was new she was like the blind man who received his sight and saw men like trees walking every new face was a new world every fresh speaker was a new revelation no one to her was stupid was a bore was insincere was spiteful was envious or a humbug because no one was known to him who does not know the inflated india rubber toy is as solid as a cannon ball i never read anything said phillis with a half blush not that she was ashamed of the fact but she felt that it would have pleased captain ladds had she read his book you see i have never learned to read oh it was rather a facer to ladds here was a young lady not being a spaniard or a sicilian or a levantine or a mexican or a paraguayan or a brazilian or belonging to any country where such things are possible who boldly confessed that she could not read this in england this in the year this in a country positively rendered unpleasant by reason of its multitudinous school boards and the echoes of their wrangling jack dunquerque in his place heard the statement and looked up involuntarily as if to see what manner of young lady this could be a gesture of surprise into which the incongruity of the thing startled him he caught her full face as she leaned a little forward and his glance rested for a moment on a cheek so fair that his spirits fell beauty disarms the youthful squire and arms him who has won his spurs i speak in an allegory mrs cassilis heard it and was half amused half angry mr cassilis heard it opened his mouth as if to make some remark about mr dyson's method of education but thought better of it the two ladies heard it and glanced at her curiously then they looked at each other with the slightest uplifting of the eyebrow which meant who on earth can she be mrs cassilis noted that too and rejoiced because she was going to bring forward a girl who would make everybody jealous ladds was the only one who spoke that he said feebly must be very jolly he began to wonder what could be the reason of this singular educational omission perhaps she had a crooked back could not sit up to a desk could not hold a book in her hand but no she was like petruchio's kate like the hazel twig as straight and slender perhaps her eyes were weak but no her eyes were sparkling with the right promethean fire perhaps she was of weak intellect but that was ridiculous then the lady who had read the book began to ask more questions i do not know anything more irritating than to be asked questions about your own book will you tell us mr dunquerque if the story of the bear hunt is a true one or did you make it up we made up nothing that story is perfectly true and the man's name was beck curious said mr cassilis an american named beck mr gilead p beck is in london now and has been recommended to me he is extremely rich i think my dear that you invited him to dinner to day' yes he found he could not come at the last moment he will be here in the evening then you will see the very man said jack unless there is more than one gilead p beck which is hardly likely this man has practically an unlimited credit said the host and talks i suppose like well like the stage americans i suppose said his wife you know jack explained that the stage american is all nonsense the educated american talks a great deal better than we do he can string his sentences together we can only bark perhaps our bark is better than their bite ladds remarked a man who has unlimited credit may talk as he pleases said mr cassilis dogmatically the two solemn young men murmured assent and he always did say that he was going to have luck he carried about a golden butterfly in a box how deeply interesting replied the lady who had read the book and is that other story true that you found an english traveller living all alone in a deserted city quite true really and who was it anybody one has met i do not know whether you have ever met him his name is lawrence colquhoun mrs cassilis flushed suddenly and then her pale face became paler lawrence colquhoun formerly of ours said ladds looking at her mrs cassilis read the look to ask what business it was of hers and why she changed colour at his name colquhoun she said softly then she raised her voice and addressed her husband my dear it is an old friend of mine of whom we are speaking mr lawrence colquhoun yes he had forgotten the name what did he do i think i remember he stopped for he remembered to have heard his wife's name in connection with this man he felt a sudden pang of jealousy a quite new and rather curious sensation it passed but yet he rejoiced that the man was out of england he is my guardian phillis said to ladds and you actually know him will you tell me something about him presently when the men followed half an hour later they found the four ladies sitting in a large semi circle round the fire the centre of the space so formed was occupied by a gentleman who held a cup of tea in one hand and declaimed with the other that is to say he was speaking in measured tones and as if he were addressing a large room instead of four ladies and his right hand and arm performed a pump handle movement to assist and grace his delivery he had a face so grave that it seemed as if smiles were impossible he was apparently about forty years of age mrs cassilis was not listening much she was considering as she looked at her visitor how far he might be useful to her evenings phillis was catching every word that fell from the stranger's lips here was an experience quite new and startling she knew of america mr dyson born not so very many years after the war of independence and while the memory of its humiliations was fresh in the mind of the nation always thought and spoke of americans as england's hereditary and implacable enemies yet here was one of the race talking amicably and making no hostile demonstrations whatever so that another of her collection of early impressions evidently needed reconsideration when he saw the group at the door mr gilead beck for it was he strode hastily across the room and putting aside mr cassilis seized jack dunquerque by the hand and wrung it for several moments you have not forgotten me he said you remember that lucky shot you still think of that grisly of course i do said jack i shall never forget him nor shall i sir never and then he went through the friendly ceremony with ladds you are the other man sir i always am the other man said ladds for the second time that evening how are you mr beck and how is the golden butterfly that inseck captain is a special instrument working under providence for my welfare he slumbers at my hotel the langham in a fire proof safe then he seized jack dunquerque's arm and led him to the circle round the fire ladies this young gentleman is my preserver he saved my life it is owing to mr dunquerque that gilead p beck has the pleasure of being in this drawing room o mr dunquerque said the lady who had read the book that is not in the volume clawed i should have been mauled i should have been rubbed out i should have been on that green and grassy spot but for the crack of mr dunquerque's rifle you will not believe me ladies but i thought it was the crack of doom it was a most charming picturesque spot in which to be clawed said jack laughing you could not have selected a more delightful place for the purpose there air moments said mr beck looking round the room solemnly and letting his eyes rest on phillis who gazed at him with an excitement and interest she could hardly control there air moments when the soul is dead to poetry one of those moments is when you feel the breath of a grisly on your cheek even you young lady would at such a moment lose your interest in the beauty of nature phillis started when he addressed her did he save your life she asked with flashing eyes jack dunquerque blushed as this fair creature turned to him with looks of such admiration and respect as the queen of the tournament bestowed upon the victor of the fight so desdemona gazed upon the moor when he spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field mrs cassilis affected a diversion by introducing her husband to mr beck mr cassilis sir he said i have a letter for you from one of our most prominent bankers and i called in the city this afternoon to give it you but i was unfortunate sir i hope that we shall become better acquainted and i am proud sir i am proud of making the acquaintance of a man who has the privilege of life partnership with mrs cassilis that is a great privilege sir and i hope you value it hum yes thank you mr beck replied mr cassilis in a tone which conveyed to the sharp eared phillis the idea that he thought considerable value ought to be attached to the fact of having a life partnership with him and how do you like our country the worst of going to america if you are an englishman or of crossing to england if you are an american is that you can never escape that most searching and comprehensive question said mr gilead beck well sir a dollar goes a long way in this country especially in cigars and drinks in drinks phillis listened the other ladies shot glances at each other phillis my dear mrs cassilis crossed the room and interrupted her rapt attention let me introduce mr ronald dunquerque do you think you could play something she bowed to the young hero with sparkling eyes and rose to comply with the invitation he followed her to the piano she played in that sweet spontaneous manner which the women who have only been taught hear with despair she touched the keys as if she loved them and as if they understood her she played one or two of the songs without words and then starting a simple melody she began to sing without being asked a simple old ballad her tone was low at first because she did not know the room not because she was afraid but it gradually rose as she felt her power till the room filled with the volumes of her rich contralto voice jack dunquerque stood beside her she looked up in his face with eyes that smiled a welcome while she went on singing you told us you could not read said the young man when she finished it is quite true mr dunquerque i cannot how then can you play and sing oh i play by ear and by memory that is nothing wonderful won't you go on playing she obeyed talking in low measured tones in time with the air i think you know my guardian mr lawrence colquhoun will you tell me all about him i have never seen him yet this unprincipled young man saw his chance and promptly seized the opportunity i should like to very much but one cannot talk here before all these people if you will allow me to call to morrow i will gladly tell you all i know about him you had better come at luncheon time she replied and then i shall be very glad to see you mr abraham dyson usually told his friends to come at luncheon time so she could not be wrong also she knew by this time that the twins were always asleep at two o'clock so that she would be alone and it was pleasant to think of a talk sola cum solo with this interesting specimen of newly discovered humanity a young man who had actually saved another man's life is she an outrageous flirt thought jack or is she deliciously and wonderfully simple on the way home he discussed the problem with ladds i don't care which it is he concluded i must see her again ladds old man i believe i could fall in love with that girl 'ask me no more for at a touch i yield' did you notice her tommy did you see her sweet eyes i must say she has the sweetest eyes in all the world looking with a pretty wonder at our quaint yankee friend did you see her trying to take an interest in the twaddle of old cassilis did you have we eyes ladds growled is the heart at five and thirty a log and her figure tall and slender lissom and gracieuse and her face 'the silent war of lilies and of roses' how i love the brunette faces they are never insipid do you remember the half caste spanish girl in manilla ladds don't dare to mention that girl beside this adorable angel of purity i have found out her christian name it is phillis rhymes to lilies and am going to call at her house to morrow carnarvon square and i am going to have half an hour in the smoking room said ladds as they arrived at the portals of the club so am i said jack you know what othello says of desdemona 'o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee' i mean phillis fleming of course not your confounded tobacco chapter viii they say if money goes before all ways do lie open i call this kind boys said mr gilead p beck welcoming his visitors captain ladds and jack dunquerque i call this friendly i asked myself last night 'will those boys come to see me or will they let the ragged yankee slide' and here you are change said ladds the monosyllabic looking round gold looking up there is a certain suite of rooms in the langham hotel there may be a hundred such suites known to the travellers who have explored that mighty hostelry originally designed for foreign princes ambassadors or those wandering kings whom our hospitality sends to an inn the suite occupied by mr beck consisted of a large reception room a smaller apartment occupied by himself and a bedroom the rooms were furnished in supposed accordance with the tastes of their princely occupants that is to say with solid magnificence mr beck had been in england no more than a week and as he had not yet begun to buy anything the rooms were without those splendid decorations of pictures plate and objects of art generally with which he subsequently adorned them they looked heavy and rather cheerless a fire was burning on the hearth and mr beck was standing before it with an unlighted cigar in his lips apparently he had already presented some letters of introduction for there were a few cards of invitation on the mantelshelf he was dressed in a black frock coat as a gentleman should be and he wore it buttoned up so that his tall stature and thin figure were shown off to full advantage he wore a plain black ribbon by way of necktie and was modest in the way of studs jack dunquerque noticed that he wore no jewelry of any kind which he thought unusual in a man of unlimited credit a new man whose fortune was not two years old he was an unmistakable american his chin was now close shaven and without the traditional tuft but he had the bright restless eye the long spare form the obstinately straight hair the thin flexible mouth with mobile lips the delicately shaped chin and the long neck which seem points characteristic with our transatlantic brethren his grave face lit up with a smile of pleasure when he saw jack dunquerque it was a thoughtful face it had lines in it such as might have been caused by the buffets of fate but his eyes were kindly as for his speech it preserved the nasal drawl of his new england birthplace he spoke slowly as if feeling for the right words and his pronunciation was that of a man sprung from the ranks let us say at once that we do not attempt to reproduce by an affected spelling save occasionally the doric of the new england speech he was a typical man of the eastern estate self reliant courageous independent somewhat prejudiced roughly educated ready for any employment and ashamed of none and withal brave as an elizabethan buccaneer sensitive as a victorian lady sympathetic as as henry longfellow there is change sir he addressed himself to ladds in most things human the high tides and the low tides keep us fresh else we should be as stagnant as a connecticut gospel grinder in his village location this is high tide i see said jack laughing i hope that american high tides last longer than ours i am hopeful mr dunquerque that they air of a more abiding disposition if you should be curious gentlemen to know my history since i left you in san francisco i will tell you it from the beginning you remember that blessed inseck the golden butterfly in the little box said ladds i asked you after his welfare last night jack began to blush before you begin he interposed we ought to tell you that since we came home we have written a book we two about our travels is that so asked mr beck with some natural reverence for the author of a book and we have put you into it with an account of empire city me as i was in rags and without even a gun yes not a flattering likeness but a true one and the lucky shot is that there too some of it is there said ladds jack would not have the whole story published looked ostentatious gentlemen i shall buy that book i shall take five hundred copies of that book for my people in the dominion just as i was you say no boots but moccasins not a dollar nor a cent running for bare life before a grisly gentlemen that book will raise me in the estimation of my fellow countrymen and if you will allow me the privilege i shall say it was written by two friends of mine jack breathed freely he was afraid mr beck might have resented the intrusion of his ragged personality an englishman certainly would mr beck seemed to think that the contrast between present broadcloth and past rags reflected the highest credit on himself this part of the work indeed which the critics declared to be wildly improbable was the only portion read by mr beck and just as he persisted in giving jack the sole credit of his rescue perhaps because in his mental confusion he never even heard the second shot which finished the bear so he steadfastly regarded jack as the sole author of this stirring chapter which was ladd's masterpiece and was grateful accordingly and now he went on i must show you the critter himself the golden bug there was standing in a corner where it would be least likely to receive any rude shocks or collisions a small heavy iron safe this he unlocked and brought forth with great care a glass case which exactly fitted the safe the frame of the case was made of golden rods along the lower part of the front pane in letters of gold was the legend if this golden butterfly fall and break farewell the luck of gilead p beck your poetry mr dunquerque said mr beck pointing to the distich with pride your own composition sir and my motto within the case was the butterfly itself but glorified the bottom of the glass box was a thick sheet of pure gold on which was fixed a rose the leaves flower and stalk worked in dull gold not a fine work of art perhaps but a reasonably good rose as good as that papal rose they show in the cluny hotel the butterfly was poised upon the rose by means of thin gold wire which passed round the strip of quartz which formed the body the ends were firmly welded into the leaves of the flower and when the case was moved the insect vibrated as if he was in reality alive there look at it gentlemen that is the inseck which has made the fortune of gilead p beck he addressed himself to both but his eye rested on jack with a look which showed that he regarded the young man with something more than friendliness the man who fired that shot the young fellow who saved him from a cruel death was his david the beloved of his soul ladds looked at it curiously as if expecting some manifestation of the supernatural is it a medium he asked does it rap or answer questions or tell the card you are thinking of shall you exhibit the thing in the egyptian hall as a freak of nature no sir i shall not but i will tell you what i did if you will let me replace him in his box where he sits and works for me no harm will come to him there unless an airthquake happens sit down general and you too mr dunquerque here is a box of cigars which ought to be good and you will call for your own drink it was but twelve o'clock and therefore early for revivers of any sort finally mr beck ordered champagne that drink he said as you get it here is a compound calculated to inspirit job in the thick of his misfortunes but if there is any other single thing you prefer and it is to be had in this almighty city name that thing and you shall have it then he began i went off after i left you by the pacific railway not the first time i travelled up and down that line and i landed in new york mr colquhoun gave me a rig out and you sir he nodded to jack you sir gave me the stamps to pay the ticket jack accused of this act of benevolence naturally blushed a guilty acknowledgment mr gilead p beck made no reference to the gift either then or at any subsequent period nor did he ever offer to repay it even when he discovered the slenderness of jack's resources that showed that he was a sensitive and sympathetic man to offer a small sum of money in repayment of a free gift from an extraordinarily rich man to a very poor one is not a delicate thing to do therefore this gentleman of the backwoods abstained from doing it new york city he continued is not the village i should recommend to a man without dollars in his pocket london where there is an institootion or a charity or a hospital or a workhouse or a hot soup boiler in every street is the city for that gentleman fiji p'r'aps for one who has a yearning after bananas and black civilisation but not new york no gentlemen if you go to new york let it be when you've made your pile and not before then you will find out that there air thirty theatres in the city with lovely and accomplished actresses in each and you can walk into delmonico's as if the place belonged to you but for men down on their luck new york is a cruel place i left that city and i made my way north i wanted to see the old folks i left behind long ago in lexington i found them dead and i was sorry then i went farther north p'r'aps i was driven by the yellow toy hanging at my back anyhow it was only six weeks after i left you that i found myself in the city of limerick on lake ontario you do not know the city of limerick i dare say it was not famous nor was it pretty in fact gentlemen it was the durndest misbegotten location built around a swamp that ever called itself a city there were a few delooded farmers trying to persuade themselves that things would look up there were a few down hearted settlers wondering why they ever came there and how they would get out again and there were a few log houses in a row which called themselves a street i got there and i stayed there their carpenter was dead and i am a handy man so i took his place then i made a few dollars doing chores around what are chores all sorts the clocks were out of repair the handles were coming off the pails the chairs were without legs the pump handle crank the very bell rope in the meetin' house was broken you never saw such a helpless lot i did not stay among them because i loved them but because i saw things ghosts asked ladds with an eye to the supernatural no sir that was what they thought i saw when i went prowling around by myself of an evening they thought too that i was mad when i began to buy the land you could buy it for nothing a dollar an acre half a dollar an acre anything an acre i've mended a cart wheel for a five acre lot of swamp they laughed at me the children used to cry out when i passed along 'there goes mad beck' but i bought all i could and my only regret was that i couldn't buy up the hull township clear off men women and children and start fresh some more champagne mr dunquerque what was the golden butterfly doing all this time asked ladds that faithful inseck sir was hanging around my neck as when you were first introduced to him he was whisperin' and eggin' me on because he was bound to fulfil the old squaw's prophecy without my knowing it sir that prodigy of the world who is as alive as you are at this moment will go on whisperin' till such time as the rope's played out and the smash comes then he'll be silent again he spoke with a solemn earnestness which impressed his hearers they looked at the fire proof safe with a feeling that at any moment the metallic insect might open the door fly forth and after hovering round the room light at mr beck's ear and begin to whisper words of counsel did not mohammed have a pigeon and did not louis napoleon at boulogne have an eagle why should not mr beck have a butterfly the citizens of limerick gentlemen in that dismal part of canada where they bewail their miserable lives air not a people who have eyes to see ears to hear or brains to understand i saw that they were walking no sleeping over fields of incalculable wealth and they never suspected they smoked their pipes and ate their pork but they never saw and they never suspected between whiles they praised the lord for sending them a fool like me something to talk about and somebody to laugh at they wanted to know what was in the little box they sent children to peep in at my window of an evening and report what i was doing they reported that i was always doing the same thing always with a map of limerick city and its picturesque and interestin' suburbs staking out the ground and reckoning up my acres that's what i did at night and in the morning i looked about me and wondered where i should begin what did you see when you looked about i saw sir a barren bog if it had been a land as fertile as the land of canaan that would not have made my heart to bound as it did bound when i looked across that swamp for i never was a tiller or a lover of the soil a barren bog it was the barrenest boggiest part of it all was my claim when the natives spoke of it they called it beck's farm and then the poor critturs squirmed in their chairs and laughed yes they laughed beck's farm they said it was the only thing they had to laugh about wal up and down the face of that almighty bog there ran creeks and after rainy weather the water stood about on the morasses plenty of water but a curious thing none of it fit to drink no living thing except man would set his lips to that brackish bad smelling water and that wasn't all sometimes a thick black slime rose to the surface of the marsh and lay there an inch thick sometimes you came upon patches of 'gum beds' as they called them where the ground was like tar and smelt strong that is what i saw when i looked around sir and to think that those poor mean pork raisers saw it all the same as i did and never suspected only cursed the gifts of the lord when they weren't laughing at beck's farm and you found what gold no i found what i expected and that was better than gold mind i say nothing against gold gold has made many a pretty little fortune little little sir there's no big fortunes made out of gold though many a pretty villa location with a tidy flower garden up and down the states is built out of the gold mines diamonds again one or two men likes the name of diamonds but not many there's the disadvantage about gold and diamonds that you have to dig for them and to dig durned hard and to dig by yourself mostly americans do not love digging like the young gentleman in the parable they cannot dig and to beg they air ashamed it is the only occupation that they air ashamed of then there's iron and there's coals but you've got to dig for them lord lord this great airth holds a hundred things covered up for them who know how to look and do not mind digging but gentlemen the greatest gift the airth has to bestow she gave to me abundant spontaneous etarnal without bottom and free and that is it is ile mr beck paused a moment his face was lit with a real and genuine enthusiasm a pious appreciation of the choicer blessings of life those namely which enable a man to sit down and enjoy the proceeds of other men's labour no provision has been made in the prayer book of any church for the expression of this kind of thankfulness yet surely there ought to be somewhere a clause for the rich no more blissful repose can fall upon the soul than after long years of labour and failure to sit down and enjoy the fruits of other men's labour a form of thanksgiving for publishers managers of theatres owners of coal mines and such gentlemen as mr gilead p beck might surely be introduced into our ritual with advantage it would naturally be accompanied by incense it is ile sir he opened another bottle of champagne and took a glass ile gold you have to dig to pick to wash gold means rheumatism and a bent back ile flows and you become suddenly rich you make all the loafers around fill your pails for you and then your bankers tell you how many millions of dollars you are worth millions repeated jack the word sounds very rich and luxurious it is so sir there's nothing like it in the old country england is a beautiful place and london is a beautiful city you've got many blessin's in this beautiful city if you haven't got joe tweed you've got hush said jack it's libellous to give names and if you haven't got erie stock and your whiskey rings you've got your foreign bonds to take your surplus cash no gentlemen london is not in some respects much behind new york but one thing this country has not got and that is ile it is nearly a year since i made up my mind to begin my well i knew it was there because i'd been in pennsylvania and learned the signs it was only the question whether i should strike it and where the neighbours thought i was digging for water and figured around with their superior intellecks because they were certain the water would be brackish then they got tired of watching and i worked on boring a well is not quite the sort of work a man would select for a pleasant and variegated occupation i reckon it's monotonous but i worked on i knew what was coming i thought o' that indian squaw and i always had my golden butterfly tied in a box at my back i bored and i bored day after day i bored in that lonely miasmatic bog i bored all day and best part of the night for nothing came and sometimes qualms crossed my mind that perhaps there would never be anything but always there was the gummy mud smelling of what i knew was below to lead me on it was the ninth day and noon i had a shanty called the farmhouse about a hundred yards from my well and there i was taking my dinner to you two young english aristocrats ladds' cocoa the only perfect fragrance shut up ladds growled jack don't interrupt i say to you two young aristocrats a farmer's dinner in that township would not sound luxurious mine consisted on that day and all days of cold boiled pork and bread ah yah said jack dunquerque who had a proud stomach yes sir my own remark every day when i sat down to that simple banquet but when you are hungry you must eat murmur though you will for egyptian flesh pots cold pork was my dinner with bread and the watter to wash it down with was brackish in those days gentlemen i said no grace it didn't seem to me that the most straight walking christian was expected to be more than tolerably thankful for cold pork my gratitude was so moderate that it wasn't worth offering and while you were eating the pork said ladds the golden butterfly flew down the shaft by himself and struck oil of his own accord no sir for once you are wrong that most beautiful creation of nature in her sweetest mood she must have got up with the sun on a fine summer morning was reposing in his box round my neck as usual he did not go down the shaft at all nobody went down but something came up up like a fountain up like the bubbling over of the airth's eternal teapot a black muddy jet of stuff great sun i think i see it now he paused and sighed it was nearly all ile pure and unadulterated from the world's workshop would you believe it gentlemen there were not enough bar'ls not by hundreds in the neighbourhood all round limerick city to catch that ile it flowed in a stream three feet down the creek it was carried away into the lake and lost it ran free and uninterrupted for three days and three nights we saved what we could the neighbours brought their pails their buckets their basins their kettles there was not a utensil of any kind that was not filled with ile from the pig's trough to the child's pap bowl not one it ran and it ran when the first flow subsided we calculated that seven million bar'ls had been wasted and lost seven millions i am a christian man and grateful to the butterfly but i sometimes repine when i think of that wasted ile every bar'l worth nine dollars at least and most likely ten sixty three millions of dollars twelve millions of pounds sterling lost in three days for want of a few coopers did you ever think mr dunquerque what you could do with twelve millions sterling i never did said jack my imagination never got beyond thousands with twelve millions i might have bought up the daily press of england and made you all republicans in a month i might have made the panama canal i might have bought palesteen and sent the jews back i might have given america fifty ironclads i might have put don carlos on the throne of spain but it warn't to be providence wants no rivals meddling and messing that was why the ile ran away and was lost while i ate the cold boiled pork perhaps it's an interestin' fact that i never liked cold boiled pork before and i have hated it ever since the great spurt subsided and we went to work in earnest that well has continued to yield five hundred bar'ls daily that is four thousand five hundred dollars in my pocket every four and twenty hours do you mean that your income is nine hundred pounds a day asked jack i do sir you go your pile on that it is more but i do not know how much more perhaps it's twice as much there are wells of mine sunk all over the place the swamp is covered with gilead p beck's derricks the township of limerick has become the city of rockoleaville my name that was and a virtuous and industrious population are all engaged morning noon and night in fillin' my pails there's twenty five bars i believe at this moment there are three meetin' houses and two daily papers and there air fifteen lawyers it seems better than cocoa nibs said ladds but the oil may run dry it has run dry in pennsylvania that is so and i do not deny it but ile will not run dry in rockoleaville i have been thinking over the geological problem and i have solved it all by myself what is this world gentlemen a round ball said jack with the promptitude of a board schoolboy and the profundity of a woolwich cadet sir it is like a great orange it has its outer rind what they call the crust get through that crust and what do you find more crust replied ladds who was not a competition wallah did you ever eat pumpkin pie sir mr beck replied more socratico by asking another question and if you did was your pie all crust inside that pie sir was pumpkin apple and juice so inside the rind of the earth there may be all sorts of things gold and iron lava diamonds coals but the juice the pie juice is ile you tap the rind and you get the ile this ile will run i calculate for five thousand and fifty two years if they don't sinfully waste it at an annual consumption of eighteen million bar'ls now that's a low estimate when you consider the progress of civilisation when it is all gone perhaps before this poor old airth will crack up like an empty egg this was an entirely new view of geology and it required time for mr beck's hearers to grasp the truth thus presented to their minds they were silent at rockoleaville he went on i've got the pipe straight into the middle of the pie and right through the crust there's no mistake about that main shaft other mines may give out but my ile will run for ever then we may congratulate you said jack on the possession of a boundless fortune you may sir and what do you intend to do for the present i shall stay in london i like your great city here i get invited to dinner and dancin' because i am an american and rich there they won't have a man who is not thoroughbred your friend mrs cassilis asks me to her house a first rater a new york lady turns up her pretty nose at a man who's struck ile 'shoddy' she says and then she takes no more notice shoddy it may be rough my manners may be but i don't pretend to anything and the stamps air real we always thought ourselves exclusive said jack did you sir wall he stopped as if he had intended to say something unpleasantly true i shall live in london for the present i've got a big income and i don't rightly know what to do with it but i shall find out some time that was a lovely young thing with mrs cassilis the other night he went on meditatively a young thing that a man can worship for her beauty while she is young and her goodness all her life not like an american gal ours are prettier but they look as if they would blow away and their voices are not so full miss fleming is flesh and blood don't blush mr dunquerque because it does you credit jack did blush and they took their departure mr dunquerque whispered gilead p beck when ladds was through the door think of what i told you what is mine is yours remember that if i can do anything for you let me know and come to see me it does me good to look at your face come here as often as you can jack laughed and escaped chapter ix by my modesty the jewel in my dower i would not wish any companion in the world but you jack dunquerque was no more remarkable for shrinking modesty than any other british youth of his era but he felt some little qualms as he walked towards bloomsbury the day after mrs cassilis's dinner to avail himself of phillis's invitation was it coquetry or was it simplicity she said she would be glad to see him at luncheon who else would be there probably a mrs jagenal doubtless the wife of the heavy man who brought miss fleming to the party herself a solid person in black silk and a big gold chain motherly with the illiterate dryad houses mighty respectable he thought penetrating into carnarvon square large incomes comfortable quarters admirable port most likely in most of them claret certainly good too none of your gladstone tap sherry probably rather coarse must ask for mrs jagenal i suppose he did ask for mrs jagenal and was informed by jane that there was no such person and that as she presently explained with warmth no such person was desired by the household jack dunquerque thereupon asked for mr jagenal the maid asked which mr jagenal jack replied in the most irritating manner possible the socratic by asking another question the fact that socrates went about perpetually asking questions is quite enough to account for the joy with which an exasperated mob witnessed his judicial murder the athenians bore for a good many years with his maddening questions as to whether this way or that way or how and finally lost patience hence the little bowl of drink quoth jack how many are there of them jane looked at the caller with suspicion he seemed a gentleman but appearances are deceptive suppose he came for what he could pick up the twins' umbrellas were in the hall and their great coats he laughed and showed an honest front but who can trust a london stranger jane remembered the silver spoons now on the luncheon table and began to think of shutting the door in his face you can't be a friend of the family she said else you'd know the three mr jagenals by name and not come here showing your ignorance by asking for mrs jagenal mrs jagenal indeed perhaps you'd better call in the evening and see mr joseph i am not a friend of the family he replied meekly i wish i was but miss fleming expects me at this hour will you take in my card he stepped into the hall and felt as if the fortress was won phillis was waiting for him in the dining room where he observed luncheon was laid for two was he then about to be entertained by the young lady alone if she looked dainty in her white evening dress she was far daintier in her half mourning grey frock which fitted so tightly to her slender figure and was set off by the narrow black ribbon round her neck which was her only ornament for she carried neither watch nor chain and wore neither ear rings nor finger rings this heiress was as innocent of jewelry as any little milliner girl of bond street and far more happy because she did not wish to wear any i thought you would come about this time she said with the kindliest welcome in her eyes and i waited for you here let us sit down and take luncheon mr abraham dyson never had any visitors except for dinner or luncheon so that phillis naturally associated an early call with eating i always have luncheon by myself explained the young hostess so that it is delightful to have some one who can talk she sat at the head of the table jack taking his seat at the side she looked fresh bright and animated the sight of her beauty even affected jack's appetite although it was an excellent luncheon this curried fowl she went on it was made for mr jagenal's brothers but they came down late and were rather cross we could not persuade them to eat anything this morning are they home for the holidays phillis burst out laughing such a fresh bright spontaneous laugh jack laughed too and then wondered why he did it home for the holidays they are always home and it is always a holiday with them do you not allow them to lunch with you she laughed again they do not breakfast till ten or eleven jack felt a little fogged and waited for further information will you take beer or claret no thank you no curry for me jane mr dunquerque will take a glass of beer how beautiful she went on looking steadily in the young man's face to his confusion how beautiful it must be to meet a man whose life you have saved i should like once just once to do a single great action and dream of it ever after but mine was not a great action i shot a bear which was following mr beck and meant mischief that is all but you might have missed said phillis with justice and then mr beck would have been killed might have missed how many vc's we should have but for that simple possibility might have missed and then gilead beck would have been clawed and the golden butterfly destroyed and this history never have reached beyond its first chapter above all phillis might never have known jack dunquerque and you are always alone in this great house he asked to change the subject only in the day time mr joseph and i breakfast at eight then i walk with him as far as his office in lincoln's inn fields now that i know the way at first he used to send one of his clerks back with me for fear of my being lost but i felt sorry for the poor young man having to walk all the way with a girl like me and so i told him after the second day that i was sure he longed to be at his writing and i would go home by myself no doubt said jack he was rejoiced to go back to his pleasant and exciting work all lawyers' clerks are so well paid and so happy in their occupation that they prefer it even to walking with a a a dryad phillis was dimly conscious that there was more in these words than a literal statement she was as yet unacquainted with the figures of speech which consist of saying one thing and meaning another and she made a mental note of the fact that lawyers' clerks are a happy and contented race it adds something to one's happiness to know that others are also happy and the boys mr jagenal's brothers they are always asleep from two to six then they come down to dinner and talk of the work they have done don't you know them oh they are not boys at all one is cornelius he is a great poet he is writing a long epic poem called the upheaving of aelfred humphrey his brother says it will be the greatest work of this century but i do not think very much is done humphrey is a great artist you know he is engaged on a splendid picture at least it will be splendid when it is finished at present nothing is on the canvas he says he is studying the groups cornelius says it will be the finest artistic achievement of the age will you have some more beer jane give mr dunquerque a glass of sherry and now let us go into the drawing room and you shall tell me all about my guardian lawrence colquhoun in the hall a thought struck the girl come with me she said i will introduce you to the poet and the painter you shall see them at work her eyes danced with delight as she ran up the stairs turning to see if her guest followed she stopped at a door the handle of which she turned with great care jack mounted the stairs after her it was a large and well furnished room rows of books stood in order on the shelves a bright fire burned on the hearth a portfolio was on the table with a clean inkstand and an unsullied blotting pad by the fire sat in a deep and very comfortable easy chair the poet sound asleep there she whispered in the portfolio is the great poem look at it we ought not to look at manuscripts ought we not if there is anything written but there isn't of course i may always turn over any pages because i cannot read she turned them over nothing but blank sheets white in virgin purity cornelius sat with his head a little forward breathing rather noisily isn't it hard work laughed the girl poor fellow isn't it exhaustive work let me introduce you mr cornelius jagenal mr ronald dunquerque jack bowed to the sleeping bard now you know each other that is what mr dyson used always to say hush we might wake him up and interrupt the work come away and i will show you the artist another room equally well furnished but in a different manner there were properties drinking glasses of a deep ruby red luminous and splendid standing on the shelves flasks of a dull rich green a model in armour a lay figure with a shawl thrown over the head and looped up under the arm a few swords hanging upon the walls curtains that caught the light and spread it over the room in softened colouring and by the fire a couch on which lay sleeping humphrey with the wealth of silky beard there was an easel and on it a canvas this was as blank as cornelius's sheets of paper permit me again said the girl mr humphrey jagenal mr ronald dunquerque now you know each other jack bowed low to the genius phillis her eyes afloat with fun beckoned the young man to the table pencil and paper lay there she sat down and drew the sleeping painter in a dozen swift strokes then she looked up laughing is that like him jack could hardly repress a cry of admiration i am glad you think it good please write underneath 'the artist at work' thank you is that it we will now pin it on the canvas think what he will say when he wakes up and sees it they stole out again as softly as a pair of burglars now you have seen the twins they are really very nice but they drink too much wine and sit up late in the morning they are sometimes troublesome when they won't take their breakfast but in the evening after dinner they are quite tractable and you see how they spend their day do they never do any work at all i will tell you what i think she replied gravely mr dyson used to tell me of men who are so vain that they are ashamed to give the world anything but what they know to be the best and the best only comes by successive effort so they wait and wait till the time goes by and they cannot even produce second rate work i think the twins belong to that class of people by this time they were in the drawing room and now said phillis you are going to tell me all about my guardian tell me something more about yourself first said jack not caring to bring mr lawrence colquhoun into the conversation just yet you said last night that you would show me your drawings they are only pencil and pen and ink sketches phillis put a small portfolio on the table and opened it this morning mr joseph took me to see an exhibition of paintings most of the artists in that exhibition cannot draw but some can and then oh they cannot draw better than you miss fleming i am quite sure she shook her head as jack spoke turning over the sketches it seems so strange to be called miss fleming everybody used to call me phillis was was everybody young jack asked with an impertinence beyond his years no everybody was old i suppose young people always call each other by their christian names yours seems to be rather stiff ronald ronald i am afraid i do not like it very much my brothers and sisters uncles and aunts cousins and kinsfolk the people who pay my debts and therefore love me most call me ronald but everybody else calls me jack jack she murmured what a pretty name jack is may i call you jack if you only would he cried with a quick flushing of his cheek if you only would not when other people are present but all to ourselves when we are together like this that is if you do not mind could the serpent when he cajoled eve have begun in a more subtle and artful manner one is ashamed for jack dunquerque i shall always call you jack then unless when people like mrs cassilis are present and what am i to call you my name is phillis you know but she knew because her french maid had told her that some girls have names of endearment and she hesitated a little in hope that jack would find one for her he did she looked him so frankly and freely in the face that he took courage and said with a bold heart phillis is a very sweet name you know the song 'phillis is my only joy' i ought to call you miranda the princess of the enchanted island but it would be prettier to call you phil phil her lips parted in a smile of themselves as she shaped the name it is a name which admits of expression you may lengthen it out if you like you may shorten it you like phil that is very pretty no one ever called me phil before and we will be great friends shall we not yes great friends i have never had a friend at all let us shake hands over our promise phil say 'jack dunquerque i will try to like you and i will be your friend' jack dunquerque she placed her hands both of them in his and began to repeat looking in his face quite earnestly and solemnly i will try that is nonsense because i do like you very much already and i will always be your friend if you will be mine and will let me then he with a voice that shook a little because he knew that this was very irregular and even wrong but that the girl was altogether lovable and a maiden to be desired and a queen among girls and too beautiful to be resisted said his say phil i think you are the most charming girl i have ever seen in all my life let me be your friend always phil let me here he stopped with a guilty tremor in his voice i hope i hope that you will always go on liking me more and more he held both her pretty shapely hands in his own she was standing a little back with her face turned up to his and a bright fearless smile upon her lips and in her eyes oh the eyes that smile before the lips some people seal a bargain he went on hesitating and stammering after the manner of the the early christians with a kiss shall we phil before she caught the meaning of his words he stooped and drew her gently towards him then he suddenly released her for all in a moment the woman within her unknown till that instant was roused into life and she shrank back without the kiss jack hung his head in silence phil in silence too stood opposite him her eyes upon the ground she looked up stealthily and trembled jack dunquerque was troubled as he met her look forgive me phil he said humbly it was wrong i ought not only forgive me and tell me we shall be friends all the same yes she replied not quite knowing what she said i forgive you but jack please don't do it again then he returned to the drawings sitting at the table while she stood over him and told him what they were there was no diffidence or mock modesty at all about her the drawings were her life and represented her inmost thoughts she had never shown them all together to a single person and now she was laying them all open before the young man whom yesterday she had met for the first time it seemed to him as if she were baring her very soul for him to read i like to do them she said because then i can recall everything that i have done or seen look here is the dear old house at highgate where i stayed for thirteen years without once going beyond its walls ah how long ago it seems and yet it is only a week since i came away and everything is so different to me now you were happy there phil yes but not so happy as i am now i did not know you then jack he beat down the temptation to take her in his arms and kiss her a thousand times he tried to sit calmly critical over the drawings but his hand shook tell me about it all he said softly these are the sketches of my highgate life stay this one does not belong to this set it is a likeness of you which i drew last night when i came home did you really draw one of me let me have it do let me have it it was meant for your face but i could do a better one now see this is mr beck the american gentleman and this is captain ladds this is mr cassilis they were the roughest unfinished things but she had seized the likeness in every one jack kept his own portrait in his hand let me keep it please no i want that one for myself once more and for the last time in his life a little distrust crossed jack dunquerque's mind could this girl after all be only the most accomplished of all coquettes he looked up at her face as she stood beside him and then abused himself for treachery to love it is like me he said looking at the pencil portrait but you have made me too handsome she shook her head you are very handsome i think she said gravely he was not strictly speaking handsome at all he was rather an ugly youth having no regularity of features and it was a difficult face to draw because he wore no beard nothing but a light moustache to help it out phil if you begin to flatter me you will spoil me and i shall not be half so good a friend when i am spoiled won't you give this to me no i keep my portfolio all to myself but i will draw a better one if you like of you and finish it up properly like this she showed him a pencil drawing of a face which rembrandt himself would have loved to paint it was the face of an old man wrinkled and crows footed that is my guardian mr dyson i will draw you in the same style poor dear guardian i think he was very fond of me another thought struck the young man phil will you instead make me a drawing of your own face but can you not do it for yourself i phil i could not even draw a haystack what a misfortune it seems worse than not being able to read draw me a picture of yourself phil she considered nobody ever asked me to do that yet and i never drew my own face it would be nice too to think that you had a likeness of me particularly as you cannot draw yourself jack would you mind if it were not much like me i should prefer it like you please try give me yourself as you are now do not be afraid of making it too pretty i will try to make it like here is mrs cassilis she did not think it was very good phil you are a genius do you know that i hold you to your promise you will draw a portrait of yourself and i will frame it and hang it up no i won't do that i will keep it myself and look at it when no one is with me that seems very pleasant said phil reflecting i should like to think that you are looking at me sometimes jack i only met you yesterday and we are old friends already yes quite old familiar friends are we not now tell all about yourself she obeyed it was remarkable how readily she obeyed the orders of this new friend and told him all about her life with mr dyson the garden and paddock out of which she never went even to church the pony the quiet house and the quiet life with the old man who taught her by talking her drawing and her music and her simple wonder what life was like outside the gates did you never go to church phil no we had prayers at home and on sunday evenings i sang hymns clearly her religions education had been grossly neglected never heard of a ritualist thought jack with a feeling of gladness doesn't know anything about vestments isn't learned in school feasts and never attended a tea meeting this girl is a phoenix why why was he a younger son and is mr cassilis a relation of yours no mr cassilis is mr dyson's nephew all mr dyson's fortune is left to found an institution for educating girls as i was educated without reading or writing i suppose so only you see it is most unfortunate that my own education is incomplete and they cannot carry out the testator's wishes mr jagenal tells me because they have not been able to find the concluding chapters of his book mr dyson wrote a book on it and the last chapter was called the 'coping stone' i do not know what they will do about it mr cassilis wants to have the money divided among the relations i know isn't it odd and he has so much already and i have got none o jack take some of mine do i know i have such a lot somewhere and i never spend anything you are very good phil but that will hardly be right but do you know it is five o'clock we have been talking for three hours i must go alas i must go and you have told me nothing at all yet about mr colquhoun when i see you next i will tell you what i know of him good bye phil jack come and see me again soon when may i come not to morrow that would be too soon the day after phil make me the likeness and send it to me by post i forgot you cannot write he wrote his address on a sheet of foolscap fold it in that with this address outside and post it to me come again phil i should like to come every day and stay all day he pressed her hand and was gone phillis remained standing where he left her what had happened to her why did she feel so oppressed why did the tears crowd her eyes five o'clock it wanted an hour of dinner when she would have to talk to the twin brethren she gathered up her drawings and retreated to her own room as she passed humphrey's door she heard him saying to jane the tea jane have i really been asleep a most extraordinary thing for me now he will see the drawing of the 'artist at work' thought phillis but she did not laugh at the idea as she had done when she perpetrated the joke she had suddenly grown graver she began her own likeness at once but she could not satisfy herself she tore up half a dozen beginnings then she changed her mind she drew a little group of two one was a young man tall shapely gallant with a queer attractive face who held the hands of a girl in his and was bending over her somehow a look of love a strange and new expression which she had never seen before in human eyes lay in his she blushed while she drew her own face looking up in that other and yet she drew it faithfully and was only half conscious how sweet a face she drew and how like it was to her own nor could she understand why she felt ashamed come again soon jack the words rang in the young man's ears but they rang like bells of accusation and reproach this girl so sweet so fresh so unconventional what would she think when she learned as she must learn some day how great was his sin against her and what would lawrence colquhoun say and what would the lawyer say and what would the world say the worst was that his repentance would not take the proper course he did not repent of taking her hands he trembled and thrilled when he thought of it he only repented of the swiftness with which the thing was done and was afraid of the consequences and i am only a younger son tommy he made his plaint to ladds who received a full confession of the whole only a younger son with four hundred a year and she's got fifty thousand they will say i wanted her money i wish she had nothing but the sweet grey dress jack don't blaspheme goodness sometimes palls beauty always fades grey dresses certainly wear out figures alter for the worse the funds remain i am always thankful for the thought which inspired ladds' perfect cocoa the only true fragrance aroma and nutrition humphrey did not discover the little sketch before dinner so that his conversation was as animated and as artistic as usual at two o'clock in the morning he discovered it and at three o'clock the twins after discussing the picture with its scoffing legend in all its bearings went to bed sorrowful chapter x i have in these rough words shaped out a man whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug with amplest entertainment mr gabriel cassilis who like julius caesar and other illustrious men was always spoken of by both his names stepped from his carriage at the door of the langham hotel and slowly walked up the stairs to mr beck's room he looked older longer and thinner in the morning than in the evening he carried his hands behind him and bore a look of pre occupation and care the man of unlimited credit was waiting for him and with his first cigar pacing the room with his hands in his pockets i got your letter said mr cassilis and telegraphed to you because i was anxious not to miss you my time is valuable not so valuable as yours but still worth something he spread his hands palm downwards and at right angles to the perpendicular line of his body had that been erect but it was curved like the figure of the man with the forelock still worth something he repeated but i am here mr beck and ready to be of any service that i can my time is worth nothing said the american because my work is done for me when i was paid by the hour it was worth the hour's pay but now mr cassilis interposed it is worth at the rate of your yearly income and i observe that you have unlimited credit un lim it ed credit that is what we should hardly give to a rothschild he wanted to know what unlimited credit really meant it was a thing hitherto beyond his experience it is my luck said mr beck ile as everybody knows is not to be approached you may grub for money like a chinee and you may scheme for it like a boss in a whisky ring but for a steady certain flow there is nothing like ile and i sir have struck ile as it never was struck before because my well goes down to the almighty reservoir of this great world i congratulate you mr beck and i have ventured sir on the strength of that introductory letter to ask you for advice 'mr cassilis' i was told 'has the biggest head in all london for knowledge of money' and as i am going to be the biggest man in all the states for income i come to you i am not a professional adviser mr beck what i could do for you would not be a matter of business it is true that as a friend only i might advise you as to investments i could show you where to place money and how to use it sir you double the obligation in america we do nothing without an equivalent here men seem to work as hard without being paid as those who get wages why sir i hear that young barristers do the work of others and get nothing for it doctors work for nothing in hospitals and authors write for publishers and get nothing from them this is a wonderful country mr cassilis at any rate had never worked for nothing nor did he propose to begin now but he did not say so he sat nursing his leg looking up at the tall american who stood over him they were two remarkable faces that thus looked into each other the american's was grave and even stern but his eyes were soft the englishman's was grave also but his eyes were hard they were not stealthy as of one contemplating a fraud but they were curious and watchful as of one who is about to strike and is looking for the fittest place that is the weakest will you take a drink mr cassilis a a a drink the invitation took him aback altogether and disturbed the current of his thoughts thank you thank you nothing in the silver mines i've seen a man threatened with a bowie for refusing a drink and i've known temperate men anxious for peace take drinks when they were offered till their back teeth were under whisky but i know your english custom mr cassilis when you don't feel thirsty you say so now let us go on sir our new york friend tells me mr beck that you would find it difficult to spend your income mr beck brightened he sat down and assumed a confidential manner that's the hitch that's what i am here for in america you may chuck a handsome pile on yourself but when you get out of yourself unless you were to buy a park for the people in the centre of new york city i guess you would find it difficult to get rid of your money it depends mainly on the amount of that money we'll come to figures sir and you shall judge as my friendly adviser my bar'ls bring me in out of my first well dollars and that's l a day without counting sundays and there's a dozen wells of mine around not so good that are worth between them another l a day mr cassilis gasped do you mean mr beck do you actually mean that you are drawing a profit a clear profit of more than l a day from your rock oil shafts that is it sir that is the lowest figure say l a day and how long has this been going on close upon ten months mr cassilis produced a pencil and made a little calculation then you are worth at this moment allowing for sundays at least a quarter of a million sterling wall i think it is near that figure we can telegraph to new york if you like to find out i don't quite know within a hundred thousand and a yearly income of l mr beck said mr cassilis rising solemnly let me allow me to shake hands with you again i had no idea not the slightest idea in asking you to my house the other day that i was entertaining a man of so much weight and such enormous power he shook hands with a mixture of deference and friendship then he looked again with a watchful glance at the tall and wiry american with the stern face the grave eyes the mobile lips and the muscular frame and sat down and began to soliloquise we are accustomed to think that nothing can compare with the great landholders of this country and austria there are two or three incomes perhaps in europe not counting crowned heads which approach your own mr beck but they are saddled their owners have great houses to keep up armies of servants to maintain estates to nurse dilapidations to make good farmers to satisfy younger sons to provide for poor people to help by hundreds and local charities to assist why i do not believe when all has been provided for that a great man say the duke of berkshire with coal mines and quarries scotch irish welsh and english estates has more to put by at the end of the year than many a london merchant that is quite right said mr beck a merchant must save because he may crack up but the land don't run away when you want stability you must go to the airth outside there's the fields the rivers the hills inside there's the mines and there's ile for those who can strike it what an income mr cassilis went on nothing to squander it on no duties and no responsibilities no tenants no philanthropy no frittering away of capital you can't spend a tenth part of it on yourself and the rest accumulates and grows grows spreads and grows he spread out his hands and a flush of envy came into his cheeks mr beck i congratulate you again thank you sir i see mr beck you are yet an unmarried man i believe and without children i foresee boundless possibilities you may marry and found a great family you may lay yourself out for making a fortune so great that it may prove a sensible influence on the course of events you may bequeath to your race the tradition of good fortune and the habit of making money my sons may take care of themselves said mr beck i want to spend money not to save it it was remarkable that during all this generous outburst of vicarious enthusiasm mr beck's face showed no interest whatever he had his purpose but it was not the purpose of mr cassilis to found a family to become a rothschild to contract loans what were these things to a man who felt strongly that he had but one life that he wished to make the most of it and that the world after him might get on as it could without his posthumous interference listen mr beck for one moment your income is l a year you may spend on your own simple wants l bah a trifle not a quarter of the interest you save the whole in ten years you have three millions you are still under fifty forty five sir i wish i was forty five you may live and work for another quarter of a century in that time you ought to be worth twelve millions at least twelve millions nearly as much as ran away and was lost when the ile was struck said mr beck hardly worth while to work for five and twenty years in order to save what nature spent in three days is it what says the proverb is easily got is lightly regarded this man made money so easily that he despised the slow gradual building up of an immense fortune there is nothing beyond the reach of a man with twelve millions mr cassilis went on he may rule the world so long as there are poor states with vast armies who want to borrow why at the present moment a man with twelve millions at his command could undertake a loan with russia austria turkey italy or egypt he could absolutely govern the share market he could rule the bank rate mr beck interrupted quite unmoved by these visions of greatness wal sir i am not ambitious and i leave providence to manage the nations her own way i might meddle and muss till i busted up the whole concern play after all into the hands of the devil and have the people praying to get back to their old original providence or suppose mr cassilis went on his imagination fired with the contemplation of possibilities so far beyond his own reach suppose you were to buy up land to buy all that comes into the market suppose you were to hand down to your sons a traditional policy of buying land with the established principle of primogeniture in twenty years you might have great estates in twenty counties i could have half a state said mr beck if i went out west in your own lifetime you could control an election make yourself president carry your own principles force your opinions on the country and become the greatest man in it the greatest country in the world is the united states of america that is a fact said mr beck laughing so the greatest man in it must be the greatest man in the world i calculate that's a bitter reflection for prince bismarck when he goes to bed at night also for the emperor of all the russias and perhaps your mr gladstone would like to feel himself on the same level with general ulysses grant mr beck cried mr cassilis rising to his feet in an irrepressible burst of genuine enthusiasm and working his right hand round exactly as if he was really father time whom he so much resembled mr beck i consider you the most fortunate man in the world we slowly amass money for our sons to dissipate save when a title or an ancient name entails a conservative tradition which keeps the property together the process in this country and in yours is always the same the strong men climb and the weak men fall and even to great houses like the grosvenors which have been carried upwards by a steady tide of fortune there will surely one day come a fool and then the tide will turn but for you and yours mr beck nature pours out her inexhaustible treasures she does sir in ile you may spend but your income will always go on increasing to a certain limit sir to five thousand and fifty three years i have had it reckoned by one of our most distinguished mathematicians professor hercules willemott of cyprus university wisconsin he made the calculations for me limit or not mr beck you are now a most fortunate man and i shall be entirely at your service i believe he added modestly that i have some little reputation in financial circles that is so sir and now let me put my case mr beck became once more animated and interested suppose sir i was to say to you 'i have more than enough money i will take the luck of the golden butterfly and make it the luck of other people' i do not understand said mr cassilis sir what do you do with your own money you do not spend it all on yourself i use it to make more and when you have enough we look at things from a different point of view mr beck you have enough but i whatever be my success can never approach the fourth part of your income however let me understand what you want to do and i will give such advice as i can offer that's kind sir and what i expected of you it is a foolish fancy and perhaps you'll laugh but i have heard day and night ever since the ile began to run a voice which says to me always the same thing i think it is the voice of my golden butterfly 'what you can't spend give' 'what you can't spend give' that's my duty mr cassilis that's the path marked out before me plain and shinin' as the way to heaven what i can't spend i must give i've given nothing as yet and i am here in this country of giving to find out how to do it we i mean the the mr cassilis was on the point of saying the idiots but refrained in time the people who give money send it to charities and institutions i know that way sir it is like paying a priest to say your prayers for you when the secretaries get the money they pay themselves their own salaries first then they pay for the rent the clerks and the advertising what remains goes to the charity that is so sir and i do not like that method i want to go right ahead find out what to do and then do it but i must feel like giving whatever i do your countryman mr peabody gave his money in trust for the london poor would you like to do the same no sir i should not like to imitate that example mr peabody was a great man and he meant well but i want to work for myself let a man do all the good and evil he has to do in his lifetime not leave his work dragging on after he is dead 'they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth' do you remember that text mr cassilis it means that you must not wait till you are dead to do what you have to do mr cassilis altered his expression which was before of a puzzled cheerfulness as if he failed to see his way into one of unnatural solemnity it is the custom of certain englishmen if the bible is quoted he knew no more than adam what part of the bible it came from but he bowed and pulled out his handkerchief as if he was at a funeral in fact this unexpected hurling of a text at his head floored him for the moment mr beck was quite grave and in much earnestness there is another thing if i leave this money in trust how do i know that my purpose will be carried out in a hundred years things will get mixed my bequests may be worth millions or they may be worth nothing the lawyers may fight over the letter of the will and the spirit may be neglected it is the dead hand that you dread that may be so sir you air in the inside track and you ought to know what to call it but no hand dead or alive shall ever get hold of my stamps your stamps my stamps sir my greenbacks my dollars for i've got them and i mean to spend them 'spend what you can and give what you cannot spend' says the voice to gilead p beck but my dear sir if you mean to give away a quarter of a million a year you will have every improvident and extravagant rogue in the country about you you will have to answer hundreds of letters a day you will be deluged with prospectuses forms and appeals you will be called names unless you give to this institution or to that i shall give nothing to any society and what about the widows of clergymen the daughters of officers the nieces of church dignitaries the governess who is starving the tradesman who wants a hundred pounds for a fortnight and will repay you with blessings and per cent after depositing in your hand as security all his pawn tickets every boat wants steering but i was not born last sunday and the ways of big cities though they may be crooked air pretty well known to me there are not many lines of life in which gilead p beck has not tried to walk my dear sir do you propose to act the part of universal philanthropist and distributor at large no sir i do not and that puzzles me too i should like to be quiet over it there was a man down to lexington when i was a boy who said he liked his religion unostentatious so he took a pipe on a sunday morning and sat in the churchyard listening to the bummin' and the singin' within perhaps sir that man knew his own business perhaps thoughts came over his soul when they gave out the psalm that he wouldn't have had if he'd gone inside to sit with his back upright against a plank his legs curled up below the seat and his eyes wandering around among the gells maybe that is my case too mr cassilis i should like my giving to be unostentatious give what you cannot spend said mr cassilis there are at any rate plenty of ways of spending let us attend to them first and there's another thing sir mr beck went on shifting his feet and looking uneasy and distressed it's on my mind since i met the young gentleman at your house i want to do something big something almighty big for mr ronald dunquerque because he killed the bear yes sir because he saved my life without that shot the luck of gilead p beck would have been locked up for ever in that little box where the golden butterfly used to live what can i do for him is the young gentleman rich on the contrary i do not suppose his brother is one of the poorest peers in the house that the honorable mr ronald dunquerque is worth l a year really i should say that l would be nearer the mark then he is a gentleman and i am well sir i hope i am learning what a gentleman should do and think in such a position as the golden butterfly has brought me into but the short of it is that i can't say to him 'mr dunquerque i owe you a life and here is a cheque for so many thousand dollars' i can't do it sir i suppose not but there are ways of helping a young man forward without giving him money you can only give money to poets and clergymen that is so sir wait a little till your position is known and assured you will then be able to assist mr ronald dunquerque as much as you please he rose and took up his gloves and now mr beck i think i understand you you wish to do something great with your money very good do not be in a hurry i will think things over meantime you are going to let it lie idle in the bank wal yes i was thinking of that it would be much better for me to place it for you in good shares such as i could recommend to you you would then be able to to give away he pronounced the words with manifest reluctance the interest as well as the principal why should the bankers have the use of it that seems reasonable said mr beck mr cassilis straightened himself and looked him full in the face he was about to strike his blow you will place your money he said quietly as if there could be no doubt of mr beck's immediate assent in my hands for investment i shall recommend you safe things for instance as regards the shares of the george washington silver mine he opened his pocket book no sir said mr beck with great decision i was about to observe that i should not recommend such an investment i think however i could place immediately l in the isle of man internal navigation company an english company said mr beck certainly i propose mr beck to devote this morning to a consideration of investments for you i shall advise you from day to day i have no philanthropic aims and financing is my profession but your affairs shall be treated together with mine and i shall bring to bear upon them the same may i say insight that has carried my own ventures to success for this morning i shall only secure you the isle of man shares they presently parted with many expressions of gratitude from mr gilead beck a country where men work for nothing perhaps when men are young not a country where elderly men in the city work for nothing mr cassilis had no intention whatever of devoting his time and experience to the furtherance of mr beck's affairs not at all if the thoughts in his mind had been written down they would have shown a joy almost boyish in the success of his morning's visit the isle of man company we should have read is floated that l was a lucky coup i nearly missed my chances with the silver mine i ought to have known that he was not likely to jump at such a bait a quarter of a million of money to dispose of and five hundred thousand pounds a year and mine the handling of the whole never before was such a chance known in the city a thought struck him he turned and went back hastily to gilead beck's rooms one word more mr beck i need hardly say that i do not wish to be known as your adviser at all perhaps it would be well to keep our engagements a secret between ourselves that of course was readily promised half a million a year the words jangled in his brain like the chimes of st clement's half a million a year and mine the handling he spent the day locked up in his inner office he saw no one except the secretary and he covered an acre or so of paper with calculations his clerks went away at five his secretary left him at six at ten he was still at work feverishly at work making combinations and calculating results what a chance he murmured prayerfully putting down his pen at length what a blessed chance mr gilead beck would have congratulated himself on the disinterested assistance of his unprofessional adviser had he known that the whole day was devoted to himself he might have congratulated himself less had he known the thoughts that filled the financier's brains disinterested how could mr cassilis regard any one with money in his hand but as a subject for his skill and here was a man coming to him not with his little fortune of a few thousand pounds not with the paltry savings of a lifetime not for an investment for widows and orphans but with a purse immeasurable and bottomless a purse which he was going to place unreservedly in his hands mine the handling he murmured as he got into bed it was his evening hymn of praise and joy chapter xi higher she climbed and far below her stretch'd hill beyond hill with lightening slopes and glades and a world widening still phillis's world widened daily like a landscape which stretches ever farther the higher you mount every morning brought her fresh delights something more wonderful than she had seen the day before her portfolio of drawings swelled daily but with riches came discontent because the range of subjects grew too vast for her pencil to draw and her groups became every day more difficult and more complicated life was a joy beyond all that she had ever hoped for or expected how should it be otherwise to her she had no anxieties for the future she had no past sins to repent she had no knowledge of evil she was young and in perfect health the weight of her mortality was as yet unfelt during these early days of emancipation she was mostly silent looking about and making observations she sat alone and thought she forgot to sing if she played it was as if she was communing confidentially with a friend and seeking counsel she had so much to think of herself and the new current of thoughts into which her mind had been suddenly diverted the connection between the world of mr dyson's teachings and the world of reality this was a very hard thing mrs cassilis with her hard cold manner her kind words and her eternal teaching that the spring of feminine action is the desire to attract finally jack dunquerque and of him she thought a good deal all the people she met were interesting she tried to give each one his own individuality rounded and complete but she could not her experience was too small and each figure in her mind was blurred now if you listen to the conversation of people as i do perpetually in trains especially you will find that they are always talking about other people the reason of that i take to be the natural desire to have in your brain a clear idea of every man what he is and how he is likely to be acted upon those people are called interesting who are the most difficult to describe or imagine and who perpetually breaking out in new places disturb the image which their friends have formed none of phillis's new friends would photograph clear and distinct in her brain she thought she missed the focus it was not so however it was the fault of the lens but it troubled her because if she tried to draw them there was always a sense of something wanting even jack dunquerque and here her eyes brightened had points about him which she could not understand she was quiet therefore and watched it was pleasant only to watch and observe she had made out clearly by this time that the twins were as vain and self conscious as the old peacock she used to feed at highgate she found herself bringing out their little vanities by leading questions she knew that joseph jagenal whom in their souls the twins despised was worth them both ten times over and she found that joseph rated himself far beneath his brothers then she gradually learned that their aesthetic talk was soon exhausted but that they loved to enunciate the same old maxims over and over again as children repeat a story and it became one of her chief pleasures to listen to them at dinner to mark their shallowness and to amuse herself with their foibles the twins thought the young lady was fascinated by their personal excellences genius brother cornelius said humphrey always makes its way i see phillis fleming every night waiting upon your words i think the fascinations of art are as great brother humphrey at dinner phillis fleming watches your every gesture this was in the evening in the morning every walk was a new delight in itself every fresh street was different brought up for thirteen years within the same four walls the keenest joy which the girl could imagine was variety she loved to see something new even a new disposition of london houses even a minute difference in the aspect of a london square but of all the pleasures which she had yet experienced even a greater pleasure than the single picture gallery which she had visited was the one afternoon of shopping she had had with mrs cassilis at melton and mowbray's in regent street mrs cassilis took her there first on the morning of her dinner party it was her second drive through the streets of london but an incomparable superior journey to the first the thoroughfares were more crowded the shops were grander if there were fewer boys running and whistling there were picturesque beggars punch and judy shows italian noblemen with organs and the other humours and diversions of the great main arteries of london phillis looked at all with the keenest delight calling the attention of her companion to the common things which escape our notice because we see them every day the ragged broken down old man without a hat who has long grey locks who sells oranges from a basket and betrays by his bibulous trembling lips the secret history of his downfall the omnibus full inside and out the tall guardsman swaggering down the street the ladies looking in at the windows the endless rows of that great and wonderful exhibition which benevolent tradesmen show gratuitously to all the shopman rubbing his hands at the door the foreigners and pilgrims in a strange land he with a cigarette in his mouth lately from the army of don carlos he with a bad cigar a blue black shaven chin and cheek and a seedy coat who once adorned the ranks of delescluze ferre flourens company he with the pale face and hard cynical smile who hails from free and happy prussia the man our brother from sierra leone coal black of hue with snowy linen and a conviction not to be shaken that all the world takes him for an englishman the booted belgian cross between the dutchman and the gaul the young gentleman sent from japan to study our country and its laws he has a cigar in his mouth and a young lady with yellow hair upon his arm the syrian with a red cap and almond eyes the parsee with lofty superstructure a reminiscence of the tower of babel which his ancestors were partly instrumental in building cretes arabians men of cappadocia and pontus with all the other mingled nationalities which make up the strollers along a london street phillis marked them every one and only longed for a brief ten minutes with each in order to transfer his likeness to her portfolio phillis said her companion touching her hand can you practise looking at people without turning your head or seeming to notice phillis laughed and tried to sit in the attitude of unobservant carelessness which was the custom in other carriages like all first attempts it was a failure then the great and crowded street reminded her of her dream should she presently for it all seemed unreal together begin to run while the young men among whom were the twins ran after her and should she at the finish of the race see the form of dead old abraham dyson clapping his hands and wagging his head and crying well run well won phillis it is the coping stone this is melton mowbray's said mrs cassilis as the carriage drew up in front of a shop which contained greater treasures then were ever collected for the harem of an assyrian king she followed mrs cassilis to some show rooms in which lay about carelessly things more beautiful than she had ever conceived hues more brilliant textures more delicate then she ever knew phillis's first shopping was an event to be remembered in all her after life what she chose what mrs cassilis chose for her what joseph jagenal thought when the bill came in it boots not here to tell imagine only the delight of a girl of deep and artistic feeling which has hitherto chiefly found vent in the study of form such form as she could get from engravings and her own limited powers of observation in being let loose suddenly in a wilderness of beautiful things every lady knows messrs melton mowbray's great shop does anybody ever think what it would seem were they to enter it for the first time at the mature age of nineteen in one thing only did phillis disgrace herself there was a young person in attendance for the purpose of showing off all sorts of draperies upon her own back and shoulders phillis watched her for some time she had a singularly graceful figure and a patient face which struck phillis with pity mrs cassilis sat studying the effect through her double eye glasses the saleswoman put on and took off the things as if the girl were really a lay figure which she was excepting that she turned herself about a thing not yet achieved by any lay figure a patient face but it looked pale and tired the duchess living lay figures receive that title in addition to a whole pound a week which messrs melton mowbray generously give them stood about the rooms all day and went to bed late at night some of the other girls envied her this shows that there is no position in life which has not something beneath it presently phillis rose suddenly and taking the opera cloak which the duchess was about to put on said you are tired i will try it on myself pray sit down and rest and she actually placed a chair for the shop girl mrs cassilis gave a little jump of surprise it had never occurred to her that a shopwoman could be entitled to any consideration at all she belonged to the establishment the shop and all that it contained were at the service of those who bought the personnel was a matter for messrs melton mowbray to manage but she recovered her presence of mind in a moment perhaps it will be as well she said to see how it suits you by trying it on yourself when their purchases were completed and they were coming away phillis turned to the poor duchess and asked her if she was not very tired of trying on dresses and whether she would not like to take a rest and if she was happy with one or two other questions at which the saleswoman looked a little indignant and the duchess a little inclined to cry and then they came away it is not usual phillis said mrs cassilis directly they were in the carriage for ladies to speak to shop people is it not the poor girl looked pale and tired very likely she was she is paid to work and work is fatiguing but it was no concern of ours you see my dear we cannot alter things and if you once commence to pitying people and talking to them there is an end of all distinctions of class mr dyson used to say that the difficulty of abolishing class distinctions was one of the most lamentable facts in human history i did not understand then what he meant but i think i do now it is a dreadful thing he meant that one cannot speak or relieve a poor girl who is ready to drop with fatigue because she is a shop girl how sad you must feel mrs cassilis you who have seen so much of shop assistants if they are all like that poor girl mrs cassilis had not felt sad but phillis's remark made her feel for the moment uncomfortable her complacency was disturbed but how could she help herself she was what her surroundings had made her as riches increase particularly the riches which are unaccompanied by territorial obligations men and women separate themselves more and more the lines of demarcation become deeper and broader english castes are divided by ditches constantly widening the circles into which outsiders may enter as guests but not as members become more numerous poor people herd more together rich people live more apart the latter become more like gods in their seclusion and they grow to hate more and more the sight and rumor of suffering and the first step back to the unpitying cruelty of the old civilizations is the habit of looking on the unwashed as creatures of another world if the gods of olympus had known sympathy they might have lived till now this expedition occurred on the day of phillis's first dinner party and on their way home a singular thing happened mrs cassilis asked phillis how long she was to stay with mr jagenal until said phillis my guardian comes home and that will be in a fortnight your guardian child but he is dead i had two you know the other is mr lawrence colquhoun what is the matter mrs cassilis for she became suddenly pallid and stared blankly before her with no expression in her eyes unless perhaps a look of terror it was the second time that phillis had noted a change in this cold and passionless face before the face had grown suddenly soft and tender at a recollection now it was white and rigid lawrence colquhoun she turned to phillis and hardly seemed to know what she was saying lawrence colquhoun he is coming home and he promised me no he would not promise and what will he say to me then she recovered herself with an effort the name or the intelligence of lawrence colquhoun's return gave her a great shock mr colquhoun your guardian i did not know and is he coming home you will come and see me when i am staying if i am to stay at his house i shall certainly said mrs cassilis setting her lips together i shall certainly make a point of seeing mr colquhoun on his return whether you are staying with him or not here is carnarvon square no thank you i will not get down even to have a cup of tea with you good bye phillis till this evening my dear i think the white dress that you showed me will do admirably home at once a woman of steel rubbish there is no man or woman of steel save he who has brooded too long over his own perfections a metallic statue the enemies of mrs cassilis called her they knew nothing a woman who had always perfect control over herself said her husband he knew nothing a woman who turned pale at the mention of a name and longed yet feared to meet a man thought phillis and she knew something because she knew the weak point in this woman's armour being neither curious nor malignant nor a disciple in the school for scandal phillis drew her little conclusion kept it to herself and thought no more about it as for the reasons which prompted mrs cassilis to take up phillis fleming they were multiplex like all the springs of action which move us to act she wanted to find out for her husband of what sort was this system of education which joseph jagenal could not discover anywhere she was interested in although not attracted by the character of the girl unlike any she had ever seen and she wanted to use phillis an heiress young beautiful piquante strange as an attraction to her house for mrs cassilis was ambitious she wished to attract men to her evenings she pictured herself it is the dream of so many cultured women as another madame recamier madame du deffand or madame de rambouillet all the intellect in london was to be gathered in her salon she caught lions she got hold of young authors she made beginnings with third rate people who had written books they were not amusing they were not witty they were devoured by envy and hatred she let them drop and now she wanted to begin again an idle and a futile game she had not the quick sympathies the capacity for hero worship the lovableness of the recamier she had no tears for others she did not know that the woman who aspires to lead men must first be able to be led there was another fatal objection not fully understood by ladies who have evenings and sigh over their empty rooms in these days of clubs what man is going to get up after dinner and find his melancholy way from pall mall to kensington palace gardens in order to stand about a drawing room for two hours and listen to general talk it wants a phillis and a personal if hopeless devotion to a phillis to tear the freshest lion from his club after dinner even if it be to an altar of adulation the evening begins properly with dinner and where men dine they love to stay jack dunquerque came to see me to day phillis told joseph you remember mr dunquerque he was at mrs cassilis's last night he came at two to have luncheon and to tell me about mr colquhoun but he did not tell me anything about him we talked about ourselves is mr dunquerque a friend of yours yes jack and i are friends phillis replied readily there was not the least intention to deceive but joseph was deceived he thought they had been old friends somehow perhaps phillis did not like to talk very much about her friendship for jack i want you to ask him to dinner if you will certainly whenever you please i shall be glad to make mr dunquerque's acquaintance he is the brother of lord isleworth said joseph with a little satisfaction at seeing a live member of the aristocracy at his own table jack came to dinner he behaved extremely well made no allusion to that previous occasion when he had been introduced to the twins listened to their conversation as if it interested him above all things and not once called phillis by her christian name this omission made her reflect they were therefore it was apparent only jack and phil when they were alone it was her first secret and the possession of it became a joy she had not a single word with him all the evening only before he went he asked her if he might call the next day at luncheon time she said to him yes after all these bloomsbury people said cornelius lighting his first pipe it does one good brother humphrey to come across a gentleman mr ronald dunquerque took the keenest interest in your art criticisms at dinner they were general principles only cornelius said humphrey he is really a superior young man a little modest in your presence brother to be sure it is not every day that he finds himself dining with a poet and an artist humphrey thank you cornelius miss fleming had no charms for him i think phillis fleming brother is a girl who is drawn more towards and more attracts men of a maturer age men no longer perhaps within the premiere jeunesse but still capable of love men of our age cornelius shall we split this potash or will you take some apollinaris water jack called and they took luncheon together as before phillis brighter and happier told him what things she had seen and what remarks she had made since last they met a week ago then she told him of the things she most wished to see jack she said i want to see the tower of london and westminster abbey most and then phil then i should like to see a play would mr jagenal allow me to take you to the tower of london now phil this afternoon phillis's worldly education was as yet so incomplete that she clapped her hands with delight shall we go now jack how delightful of course mr jagenal will allow me i will be five minutes putting on my hat now that's wrong too said jack to himself it is as wrong as calling her phil it's worse than wanting to kiss her because the kiss never came off i can't help it it's pleasant what will colquhoun say when he comes home phil is sure to tell him everything jack dunquerque my boy there will be a day of reckoning for you already phil by jove how nice you look do i jack do you like my hat i bought it with mrs cassilis the other day look at yourself in the glass phil what do you see she looked and laughed it was not for her to say what she saw there was a little maid of arcadia once phil and she grew up so beautiful that all the birds fell in love with her there were no other creatures except birds to fall in love with her because her sheep were too busy fattening themselves for the corinthian cattle market to pay any attention to her they were conscientious sheep you see and wished to do credit to the arcadian pastures jack dunquerque began to feel great freedom in the allegorical method well jack well phil the birds flew about in the woods singing to each other how lovely she was how prettily she played and how sweetly she sang nobody understood what they said but it pleased this little maid presently she grew a tall maid like yourself phil and then she came out into the world she was just like you phil she had the same bright eyes and the same laugh and the same identical sunlit face and o phil she had your very same charming ways jack do you really mean it do you like my face and are my ways really and truly not rough and awkward jack shook his head your face is entrancing phil and your ways are more charming than i can tell you well she came into the world and looked about her it was a pleasant world she thought and then i think i will tell you the rest of the story another time phil jack did other people besides birds love your maid of arcadia i'm afraid they did he groaned a good many other people confound them phil looked puzzled why did he groan why should not all the world love the arcadian maid if they pleased then they went out jack being rather silent this is a great deal better than driving with mrs cassilis jack said the girl as she made her first acquaintance with a hansom cab it is like sitting in a chair while all the people move past look at the faces jack how they stare straight before them is work so dear to them that they cannot find time to look at each other work is not dear to them at all i think said jack if i were a clergyman i should talk nonsense and say that it is the race for gold as a matter of fact i believe it is a race for bread those hard faces have got wives and children at home and life is difficult that is all phillis was silent again they drove through the crowded city where the roll of the vehicles thundered on the girl's astonished ears and the hard faced crowd sped swiftly past her life was too multitudinous too complex for her brain to take it in the shops did not interest her now nor the press of business it was the never ending rush of the anxious crowd she tried to realise if ever so faintly that every one of their faces meant a distinct and important personality it was too much for her and as it did to the persian monarch the multitudes brought tears into her eyes where are all the women she asked jack at length at home these men are working for them they are spending the money which their husbands and fathers fight for she was silent again the crowd diminished but not much the street grew narrower presently they came to an open space and beyond oh joy of joys the tower of london which she knew from the pictures only country people go to the tower of london it would almost seem a kindness to london readers were i to describe this national gaudy show but it is better perhaps that its splendours should remain unknown like those of the national gallery and the british museum the solitudes of london are not too many and its convenient trysting places are few the beef eater who conducted the flock attached himself specially to phillis thereby showing that good taste has found a home among beef eaters phillis asked him a thousand questions she was eager to see everything she begged him to take them slowly down the long line of armoured warriors she did not care for the arms except for such as she had heard about as bows and arrows pikes battle axes and spears she lingered in the room where sir walter raleigh was confined she studied the construction of the headsman's axe and the block she glowed with delight at finding herself in the old chapel of the white tower jack did not understand her enthusiasm it was his own first visit also to the tower but he was unaffected by its historical associations nor did he greatly care for the arms and armour think of phillis her guardian's favourite lessons to her had been in history he would read her passages at which her pulse would quicken and her eyes light up somehow these seemed all connected with the tower she constructed an imaginary tower in her own mind and peopled it with the ghosts of martyred lords and suffering ladies but the palace of her soul was as nothing compared with the grim grey fortress that she saw the knights of her imagination were poor creatures compared with these solid heroes of steel and iron on their wooden charges the dungeon in which raleigh pined was far more gloomy than any she had pictured the ghosts of slain rebels and murdered princes gained in her imagination a place and surroundings worthy of their haunts the first sight of london which an american visits is the tower the first place which the boy associates with the past and longs to see is that old pile beside the thames phillis came away at length with a sigh of infinite satisfaction on the way home she said nothing but jack saw by her absorbed look that the girl was happy she was adjusting bit by bit her memories and her fancies with the reality she was trying to fit the stories her guardian had read her so often with the chambers and the courts she had just seen jack watched her stealthily a great wave of passion roiled over the heart of this young man whenever he looked at this girl he loved her there was no longer any possible doubt of that and she only liked him what a difference and to think that the french have only one word for both emotions she liked to be with him to talk to him because he was young and she could talk to him but love cold dian was not more free from love i can make most of it out the girl said turning to jack all except lady jane grey i cannot understand at all about her you must take me again we will get that dear old beef eater all by himself and we will spend the whole day there you and i together shall we not then after her wont she put the tower out of her mind and began to talk about what she saw they passed a printseller's she wanted to look at a picture in the window and jack stopped the cab and took her into the shop he observed not without dismay that she had not the most rudimentary ideas on the subject of purchase she had only once been in a shop and then if i remember rightly the bill was sent to mr joseph jagenal phillis turned over the engravings and photographs and selected half a dozen jack paid the bill next day it was not much over fifteen pounds a mere trifle to a younger son with four hundred a year and then he had the pleasure of seeing the warm glow of pleasure in her eyes as she took the light of the world from the portfolio pictures were her books and she took them home to read at last and all too soon they came back to carnarvon square good bye phil said jack before he knocked at the door you have had a pleasant day very pleasant jack and all through you she replied oh what a good thing for me that we became friends he thought it might in the end be a bad thing for himself but he did not say so for every hour plunged the unhappy young man deeper in the ocean of love and he grew more than ever conscious that the part he at present played would not be regarded with favour by her guardian jack she said while her hand rested in his and her frank eyes looked straight in his face with an expression in which there was no love at all he saw that clearly but only free and childlike affection jack why do you look at me so sadly jack if i were like if i were meant for that maiden of arcadia you told me of yes phil if other people in the world loved me you would love me a little wouldn't you chapter xii hearken what the inner spirit sings 'there is no joy but calm' why should we only toil the roof and crown of things lawrence colquhoun was coming home phillis counting the days remembered with a little prick of conscience that jack dunquerque had never told her a single word concerning her second guardian he was about forty years of age as old as joseph jagenal she pictured a grave heavy man with massive forehead thick black hair and a responsible manner she knew too that there was to be a change in her life but of what kind she could not tell the present mode of living was happiness enough for her a drive with mrs cassilis odd that phillis could never remove from herself the impression that mrs cassilis disliked her a walk with joseph to his office and back in the morning a day of occasional delight with her best friend jack the unscrupulous her drawing for amusement and occupation and a widely increased area so to speak of dress discussion with her maid antoinette once her fellow prisoner now emancipated like herself informed her young mistress that should the new guardian insist on a return to captivity she antoinette would immediately resign her devotion to phillis she explained was unalterable but contrary to the experience of the bard stone walls in her own case did make a prison was mademoiselle going to resign all these pleasures she pointed to the evening dresses the walking dresses the riding habits was mademoiselle about to give up taking walks when and where she pleased was mademoiselle ready to let the young gentleman monsieur dunquerque waste his life in regrets and he so brave so good antoinette it may be observed had in the agreeable society of jane the housemaid clarissa the cook and victoria pamela assistant in either department already received enlightenment in the usages of london courtship she herself a little flirt with the norman blue eyes and light brown hair was already the object of a devouring passion on the part of a young gentleman who cut other gentlemen's hair in a neighboring street further did mademoiselle reflect on the wickedness of burying herself and her beautiful eyes out of everybody's sight a change was inevitable phillis would willingly have stayed on at carnarvon square where the twins amused her and the lawyer joseph was kind to her but mrs cassilis explained that this was impossible that steps would have to be taken with regard to her future and that the wishes of her guardian must be consulted till she was of age you are now nineteen my dear you have two years to wait then you will come into possession of your fortune and you will be your own mistress at liberty to live where and how you please phillis listened but made no reply it was a new thought to her that in two years she would be personally responsible for the conduct and management of her own life obliged to think and decide for herself and undertaking all the responsibilities and consequences of her own actions then she remembered abraham dyson's warning and maxims they once fell unheeded on her brain which was under strict ward and tutelage just like exhortations to avoid the sins of the world on the ears of convent girls now she remembered them life is made up of meeting bills drawn on the future by the improvidence of youth this was a very mysterious maxim and one which had often puzzled her now she began to understand what was meant the consequences of our own actions are what men call fate they accompany us like our shadows hitherto she thought she had had no chance of performing any action of her own at all she forgot how she asked jack dunquerque to luncheon and went to the tower with him every moment of a working life may be a decisive victory that would begin in two years' time brave men act philosophers discuss cowards run away the brave are often killed the talkers are always left behind the cowards are caught and cashiered better to act and be killed than to run away and be disgraced thought phillis that was a thing to be remembered in two years' time women see things through the haze of a foolish education they manage their affairs badly because they are unable to reason you phillis who have never learned to read are the mistress of your own mind keep it clear get information and remember it learn by hearing and watching she was still learning learning something new every day it is not in my power to complete your education phillis that must be done by somebody else when it is finished you will understand the whole but do not be in a hurry when would the finisher of her education come was it lawrence colquhoun and how would it be finished surely some time in the next two years would complete the edifice and she would step out into the world at twenty one her own mistress responsible for her actions equipped at all points to meet the chances and dangers of her life so she waited argued with herself and counted the days meantime her conduct towards the twins inspired these young men with mingled feelings of uncertainty and pleasure she made their breakfast was considerate in the morning and did not ask them to talk when the little dialogue mentioned in an early chapter was finished she would herself pick out a flower there were always flowers on the table in deference to their artistic tastes or their buttonholes and despatch them with a smile that was very satisfactory at dinner too she would turn from one to the other while they discoursed sublimely on art in its higher aspects they took it for admiration it was in reality curiosity to know what they meant after dinner she would too often confine her conversation to joseph on these occasions the brethren would moodily disappear and retire to their own den where they lit pipes and smoked in silence in point of fact they were as vain as a brace of peacocks and as jealous as a domestic pet if attention were shown by the young lady to any but themselves caesar it may be observed quickly learned to distinguish between the habits of phillis and those of his masters he never now offered to take the former into a public house while he ostentatiously so to speak paraded his knowledge of the adjacent bars when conveying the twins one afternoon phillis took it into her head to carry up tea to the twins herself cornelius was as usual sound asleep in an easy chair his head half resting upon one hand and his pale cheek lit up with a sweet and childlike smile he was dreaming of vintage wines he looked sweetly poetical and it was a thousand pities that his nose was so red on the table lay his blotting pad and on it clean and spotless was the book destined to receive his epic poem phillis touched the divine bard lightly on the shoulder he thought it was jane stretched yawned relapsed and then awoke fretful like a child of five months give me the tea he grumbled too sweet again i dare say like yesterday no sugar at all in it mr cornelius he sprang into consciousness at the voice my dear miss fleming is it really you you have condescended to visit the workshop and you find the laborer asleep i feel like a sentinel found slumbering at his post pray do not think it is an accident quite novel to me the exhaustion of continuous effort i suppose she looked about the room i see books i see a table i see a blotting pad and she actually to the poet's horror turned over the leaves of the stitched book with humphrey's ornamental title page not a word written where is your work mr cornelius i work at poesy that book miss fleming is for the reception of my great epic when it is completed non omnis moriar there will be found in that blank book the structure of a lifetime i shall live by a single work like homer what is it all about asked phillis she set the tea on the table and sat down looking up at the poet who rose from his easy chair and made answer walking up and down the room it is called the upheaving of aelfred in the darkest moments of aelfred's life while he is hiding amid the somersetshire morasses comes the spirit of his career and guides him in a vision step by step to his crowning triumphs episodes are introduced that of the swineherd and the milkmaid is a delicate pastoral which i hope will stand side by side with the daphnis and chloe when it is finished would you like me to read you a few cantos no thank you very much said phillis i think i know all that i want to know about alfred disguised as a neatherd he took refuge in athelney where one day being set to bake some cakes by the woman of the cottage he became so absorbed in his own meditations that i never thought it a very interesting story the loves of the swineherd and the milkmaid the poet began yes phillis interrupted unfeelingly but i hardly think i care much for swineherds and if i had been alfred i should have liked the stupid story about the cakes forgotten can't you write me some words for music mr cornelius do and i will sing them to something or other or write some verses on subjects that people care to hear about as wordsworth did my guardian used to read wordsworth to me wordsworth could not write a real epic said cornelius could he not perhaps he preferred writing other things now i must carry mr humphrey his tea good by mr cornelius and do not go to sleep again humphrey too was asleep on his sofa raffaelle himself could not have seemed a more ideal painter the very lights of the afternoon harmonised with the purple hue of his velvet coat the soft brown silkiness of his beard and his high pale forehead like his brother humphrey spoiled the artistic effect by that unlucky redness of the nose the same awakening was performed i have just found your brother said phillis at work on poetry noble fellow cornelius murmured the artist always at it always with nose to the grindstone he will overdo it some day i hope not said phillis with a gleam in her eye i sincerely hope not perhaps he is stronger than he looks and what are you doing mr humphrey you found me asleep the bow stretched too long must snap or be unbent yes said phillis you were exhausted with work my great picture no it is not on the canvas for phillis was looking at the bare easel where is it then do show it to me when the groups are complete i will let you criticise them it may be that i shall learn something from an artless and unconventional nature like your own thank you said phillis that is a compliment i am sure what is the subject of the picture it is the 'birth of the renaissance' an allegorical picture there will be two hundred and twenty three figures in the composition the 'birth of the renaissance' phillis mused i think i know all about that 'on the taking of constantinople in the year the dispersed greeks made their way to the kingdoms of the west carrying with them byzantine learning and culture italy became the chosen home of these exiles the almost simultaneous invention of printing coupled with an outburst of genius in painting and poetry and a new born thirst for classical knowledge made up what is known by the name of the renaissance' that is what my guardian told me one night i think that i do not want to see any picture on that subject sit down now and draw me a girl's face he shook his head art cannot be forced he replied mr humphrey her eyes began to twinkle when you have time i should not like to force your art but when you have time paint me a little group yourself mr cornelius and caesar in the morning walk you may choose for the moment of illustration either your going into or coming out of the carnarvon arms when you intend to have or when you have had your little whack she laughed and ran away humphrey sat upright and gazed at the door through which she fled then he looked round helplessly for his brother who was not there little whack he murmured where did she learn the phrase and how does she know that caesar could not have told her he was very sad all the evening and opened his heart to his brother when they sought the studio at nine an hour earlier than usual i wish she had not come he said she makes unpleasant remarks she does she laughed at my epic to day the poet who sat in a dressing gown drew the cord tighter round his waist and tossed up his head with a gesture of indignation and she laughed at my picture she is dangerous humphrey she watches people when they go for a morning walk cornelius and makes allusion to the carnarvon arms and to afternoon naps if humphrey we have once or twice been obliged to go to the carnarvon arms or have been surprised into an afternoon nap cornelius that is no reason why we should be ashamed to have the subjects mentioned i should hope that this young lady would not speak of us of you brother humphrey and of myself save with reverence she has no reverence brother cornelius jane certainly tells me said the poet that a short time ago she brought mr ronald dunquerque then a complete stranger to my room when i happened by the rarest accident to be asleep and showed me to him if one could hope that she was actuated only by respect but no i hardly dare to think that then i suppose she brought her visitor to the studio brother humphrey we always do the same thing at the same time mutatis mutandis my dear cornelius i design you write i group you clothe your conceptions in undying words perhaps we both shall live it was on the same day that she drew the sketch of me asleep humphrey's mind was still running on the want of respect here it is forsitan hoc nomen nostrum miscebitur illis resumed the poet looking at the sketch the child has a wonderful gift at catching a likeness if it were not for the annoyance one might feel pleased the girl is young and pretty if our years are double what they should be our hearts are half our years they are we cannot be angry with her impossible dear little phillis she was a good inch taller than either of the twins who indeed were exactly the same height and it was five feet four she is charming in spite perhaps on account of her faults her property is in the funds you said cornelius three per cents fifty thousand pounds fifteen hundred a year which is about half what joseph pays income tax upon a pleasant income brother humphrey yes i dare say humphrey tossed the question of money aside you and i cornelius are among the few who care nothing about three per cents what is money to us what have we to do with incomes art glorious art brother is our mistress she pays us not in sordid gold but in smiles in gleams of a haven not to be reached by the common herd in skies of a radiance visible only to the votary's eye cornelius sighed response it was thus that the brothers kept up the sacred flame of artistic enthusiasm pity that they were compelled to spend their working hours in subjection to sleep instead of art our actions and our principles are so often at variance that their case is not uncommon then they had their first split soda then they lit their pipes for it was ten o'clock phillis was gone to bed joseph was in his own room the fire was bright and the hearth clean the twins sat at opposite sides with the materials on a chess table between them and prepared to make the usual night of it cornelius said humphrey joseph is greatly changed since she came the poet sat up and leaned forward with a nod signifying concurrence he is humphrey now you mention it he is and you think i am afraid cornelius that joseph a most thoughtful man in general and quite awake to the responsibilities of his position it is not every younger son brother humphrey who has thought of changing his condition in life cornelius turned pale he has her to breakfast with him she walks to the office with him she makes him talk at dinner joseph never used to talk with us he sits in the drawing room after dinner he used to go straight to his own room this is grave said the poet you must not my dear humphrey have the gorgeous colouring and noble execution of your groups spoiled by the sordid cares of life if joseph marries you and i would be thrown upon the streets so to speak what is two hundred a year nor must you my dear brother have the delicate fancies of your brain shaken up and clouded by mean and petty anxieties humphrey said the poet come to me in half an hour in the workshop this is a time for action it was only half past ten and the night was but just begun he buttoned his dressing gown across his chest tightened the cord and strode solemnly out of the room the painter heard his foot descend the stairs excellent cornelius he murmured lighting his second pipe he lives but for others joseph was sitting as usual before a pile of papers it was quite true that phillis was brightening up the life of this hard working lawyer his early breakfast was a time of pleasure his walk to the office was not a solitary one he looked forward to dinner and he found the evenings tolerable somehow joseph jagenal had never known any of the little agremens of life from bed to desk from desk to bed save when a dinner party became a necessity had been his life from the day his articles were signed you cornelius he looked up from his work and laid down his pen this is unexpected i am glad to find you as usual at work joseph we are a hard working family you with law books poor humphrey and i with but never mind he sighed and sat down why poor humphrey joseph we were happy before this young lady came what has phillis done why we were then old fogies with our bachelor ways and she has roused us up a little and again why poor humphrey we were settled down in a quiet stream of labour thinking that there would be no change i see a great change coming over us now what change joseph if it were not for humphrey i should rejoice i should say 'take her be happy in your own way' for me i only sing of love i might perhaps sing as well in a garret and on a crust of bread therefore it matters nothing it is for humphrey that i feel how can that delicately organised creature to whom warmth comfort and ease are as necessary as sunshine to the flower face the outer world for his sake i ask you joseph to reconsider your project and pause before you commit yourself joseph was accustomed to this kind of estimate which one twin invariably made of the other but the reason for making it staggered him he actually blushed being forty years of age a bachelor and a lawyer on all these grounds presumably acquainted with the world and with the sex he blushed on being accused of nothing more than a mere tendency in the direction of marriage this is the strangest whim he said why cornelius i am as likely to marry phillis fleming as i am to send humphrey into the cold dismiss the thought at once and let the matter be mentioned no more good night cornelius he turned to his papers again with the look of one who wishes to be alone these twins were a great pride to him but he could not help sometimes feeling the slightest possible annoyance that they were not as other men still they were his charge and in their future glory his own name would play an honourable part good night cornelius it is good of you to think of humphrey first i shall not marry either the child phillis fleming or any other woman good night my dear joseph you have relieved my mind of a great anxiety good night five minutes afterwards the door opened again joseph looked around impatiently this time it was humphrey the light shone picturesquely on his great brown beard so carefully trimmed and brushed on the velvet jacket in the pockets of which were his hands and on his soft large limpid eyes so full of unutterable artistic perception such lustrous passion for colour and for form well humphrey joseph exclaimed with more sharpness than he was wont to display to his brothers are you come here on the same wise errand as cornelius has cornelius been with you asked the painter artlessly what did cornelius come to you for poor fellow he is not ill i trust i thought he took very little dinner to day tut tut don't you know why he came here certainly not brother joseph this was of course strictly true because cornelius had not told him guesses are not evidence and it hardly matters does it he asked with a sweet smile for myself i come because i have a thing to say well come humphrey don't beat about the bush it is about miss fleming ah you guess already what i have to say my dear joseph it is this i have watched the birth and growth of your passion for this young lady in some respects i am not surprised she is certainly piquante as well as pretty but my dear brother joseph there is cornelius joseph beat the tattoo on his chair humphrey he groaned i know all cornelius's virtues but not the fragile nature of his beautifully subtle brain that joseph i alone know i tremble to think what would become of that that deliciae musurum were he to be deprived of the little luxuries which are to him necessities a poet's brain joseph is not a thing to be lightly dealt with joseph was touched at this appeal you are really humphrey the most tender hearted pair of creatures i ever saw would that all the world were like you take my assurance if that will comfort you that i have no thought whatever of marrying phillis fleming joseph humphrey grasped his hand this is indeed a sacrifice not at all returned joseph sharply sacrifice nonsense and please remember humphrey that i am acting as the young lady's guardian that she is an heiress that she is intrusted to me and that it would be an unworthy breach of trust if i were even to think of such a thing besides which i have a letter from mr lawrence colquhoun who is coming home immediately it is not at all likely that the young lady will remain longer under my charge good night humphrey i had a thing to say to joseph said humphrey going up to the workshop and i said it i too had a thing to say said the poet and i said it cornelius you are the most unselfish creature in the world humphrey you are i have always maintained it too thoughtful much too thoughtful for others joseph will not marry i know it and my mind is relieved brother shall we split another soda it is only eleven joseph took up his paper he neither smoked nor drank brandy and soda finding in his work occupation which left him no time for either to night however he could not bring his mind to bear upon the words before him he to marry and to marry phillis the thought was new and startling he put it from him but it came back and why not he asked himself why should not he as well as the rest of mankind have his share of love and beauty to be sure it would be a breach of confidence as he told humphrey but colquhoun was coming he was a young man his own age only forty he would not care to have a girl to look after he would again he thought behind him but all night long joseph jagenal dreamed a strange dream in which soft voices whispered things in his ears and he thrilled in his sleep at the rustle of a woman's dress he could not see her face dreams are always so absurdly imperfect but he recognised her figure and it was that of phillis fleming chapter xiii she never yet was foolish that was fair the days sped on but each day as it vanished made phillis's heart sadder because it brought her guardian nearer and the second great change in her life she thought was inevitable think of a girl brought up a cloistered nun finding her liberty for a few short weeks and then ordered back to her whitewashed cell phillis's feelings as regards lawrence colquhoun's return were coloured by this fear it seemed as if argument and probability notwithstanding she might be suddenly and peremptorily carried back to prison without the consolations of a maid because antoinette as we know would refuse to accompany her or the kindly society of the poor old abraham dyson now lying in a synonymous bosom a short three weeks since her departure from highgate a short six weeks since mr dyson's death and the world was all so different she looked back on herself with her old ideas contemptuously poor phillis she thought she knew so little and as happens to every one of us in every successive stage of life she seemed to herself now to know everything life without the sublime conceit of being uplifted by reason of superior inward light and greater outward experience above other men would be but a poor thing phillis thought she had the key to universal knowledge and that she was on the high road to make that part of her life which should begin in two years' time easy happy and clear of pitfalls from the archbishop of canterbury to joe the crossing sweeper we all think in exactly the same way and when the ages bring experience and experience does not blot out memory we recall our old selves with a kind of shame wonder that we did not drop into the snare and perish miserably and presently fall to thanking god that we are rid of a fool a fortnight phillis counted the days and drew a historical record of every one jack came three times once after mrs cassilis's dinner once when he took her to the tower of london and once i have been obliged to omit this third visit when he sat for his portrait and phillis drew him full length leaning against the mantelshelf with his hands in his pockets not a graceful attitude but an easy one and new to phillis who thought it characteristic she caught jack's cheerful spirit too and fixed it by a touch in the gleam of his eye mrs cassilis came four times and on each occasion took the girl for a drive bought something for her and sent the bill to joseph jagenal on each occasion also she asked particularly for lawrence colquhoun there were the little events with the twins which we have recorded and there were walks with caesar about the square once joseph jagenal took her to a picture gallery where she wanted to stay and copy everything it was her first introduction to the higher art and she was half delighted half confused if art critics were not such humbugs and did not pretend to feel what they do not they might help the world to a better understanding of the glories of painters as it is they are the only people except preachers to whom unreal gush is allowed by gods and men after all as no art critic of the modern unintelligible gush and conceit school can paint or draw perhaps if they were not to gush and pile up alpine heaps of words they would be found out for shallow bags the ideal critic in art is the great master who sits above the fear of rivalry or the imputation of envy in literature it is the great writer from whom praise is honoured and dispraise the admonition of a teacher in the drama a man who himself has moved the house with his words and can afford to look on a new rising playwright with kindliness phillis in the art gallery was the next best critic to the calm and impartial master she was herself artist enough to understand the difficulties of art she had that intense and real feeling for form and colour which humphrey jagenal affected and her taste in art was good enough to overmaster her sympathy with the subject some people are ready to weep at a tragical subject however coarse the daub just as they weep at the fustian of an adelphi melodrama phillis was ready to weep when the treatment and the subject together were worthy of her tears it seems as if she must have had her nature chilled but it is not so time which ought to be represented as a locomotive engine moved on and brought lawrence colquhoun at length to london he went first to joseph jagenal's office and heard that his ward was in safe keeping with that very safe solicitor it was difficult joseph explained to know what to do after the funeral of mr dyson she was left alone in the place with no more responsible person than a house keeper so as soon as the arrangement could be made i brought her to my own house three old bachelors might safely i thought be trusted with the protection of a young lady i am much obliged to you said colquhoun you have removed a great weight off my mind what sort of a girl is she joseph began to describe her as he proceeded he warmed with his subject and delineated a young lady of such passing charms of person and mind that colquhoun was terrified my dear jagenal if you were not such a steady old file i should think you were in love with her my love days are over said the man of conveyances that is i never had any but you will find phillis fleming everything that you can desire except of course he added in respect to her education it certainly is awkward that she does not know how to read not know how to read and so you see said the lawyer completing the story we know already mr dyson's property will go into chancery because phillis fleming has never learnt to read and because we cannot find that chapter on the coping stone hang the coping stone ejaculated colquhoun i think i will go and see her at once will you let me dine with you to night and will you add to my obligations by letting her stay on with you till i can arrange something for her what do you think of doing i hardly know i thought on the voyage that i would do something in the very superior lady companion way for her to tell the truth i thought it was a considerable bore the whole thing but she seems very different from what i expected and perhaps i could ask my cousin mrs l'estrange to take her into her own house for a time poor old dyson it is twelve years ago since i saw him last soon after he took over the child i remember her then a solemn little thing with big eyes who behaved prettily she held up her mouth to be kissed when she went to bed but i suppose she won't do that now you can hardly expect it i think said joseph abraham dyson talked all the evening about his grand principles of female education i was not interested except that i felt sorry for the poor child who was to be an experiment perhaps i ought to have interfered as one of her trustees i left the whole thing to him you see and did not even inquire after her welfare you two were by some curious error of judgment as i take it left discretionary trustees as he is dead you have now the care of miss fleming's fifty thousand pounds mr dyson left it in the funds where he found it as your legal adviser mr colquhoun i strongly recommend you to do the same she will be entitled to the control and management of it on coming of age but it is to be settled on herself when she marries there is no stipulation as to trustees' consent so that you only have the responsibility of the young lady and her fortune for two years it was twelve o'clock in the day colquhoun left the office and made his way in the direction of carnarvon square as he ascended the steps of number fifteen the door opened and two young men appeared one was dressed in a short frock with a flower in his buttonhole the other had on a velvet coat and also had a flower one was shaven the other wore a long and silky beard both had pale faces and red noses as they looked at the stranger and passed him down the steps colquhoun saw that they were not so young and beautiful as they seemed to be there were crowsfeet round the eyes and their step had lost a little of its youthful buoyancy he wondered who they were and sent in his card to miss fleming he was come then this new guardian phillis could not read the card but jane the maid told her his name he was come and the second revolution was about to begin instinctively phillis's first thought was that there would be no more walks with jack dunquerque why she felt so it would be hard to explain but she did she stood up to welcome him she saw a handsome young looking man with blue eyes clear red and white complexion regular features a brown beard and a curious look of laziness in his eyes they were eyes which showed a repressed power of animation they lit up at sight of his ward but not much he saw a girl of nineteen tall slight shapely a girl of fine physique a girl whose eyes like her hair were brown the former were large and full but not with the fulness of short sight the latter was abundant and was tossed up in the simplest fashion which is also the most graceful lawrence the lazy felt his pulse quicken a little as this fair creature advanced with perfect grace and self possession to greet him he noticed that her dress was perfect that her hands were small and delicate and that her head was shaped save for the forehead which was low and broad like that of some greek statue the greeks knew the perfect shape of the head but they made the forehead too narrow if you think of it you will find that the venus of milo would have been more divine still had her brows been but a little broader my ward he said let us make acquaintance and try to like each other i am your new guardian phillis looked at him frankly and curiously letting her hand rest in his when i saw you last it was twelve years ago you were a little maid of seven do you remember i think i do but i am not quite sure are you really my guardian i am indeed do i not look like one to be sure it is my first appearance in the character she shook her head mr dyson was so old she said that i suppose i grew to think all guardians old men i am only getting old he sighed it is not nice to feel yourself going to get old wait twenty years and you will begin to feel the same perhaps but though i am thirty years younger than mr dyson i will try to treat you exactly as he did phillis's face fell and she drew away her hand sharply oh she cried but i am afraid that will not do any more why phillis i may call you phillis since i am your guardian may i not did he treat you badly why did you not write to me i did not write mr colquhoun if you call me phillis i ought to call you lawrence ought i not because you are not old i did not write because dear old mr dyson treated me very kindly and because you were away and never came to see me and because i i never learned to write by this time phillis had learned to feel a little shame at not being able to write besides she went on he was a dear old man and i loved him but you see lawrence he had his views jagenal calls them crotchets and he never let me go outside the house now i am free i do not like to think of being a prisoner again if you try to lock me up i am afraid i shall break the bars and run away you shall not be a prisoner phillis that is quite certain we shall find something better than that for you but it cannot be very lively in this big house all by yourself not very lively but i am quite happy here most young ladies read novels to pass away the time i know poor things phillis looked with unutterable sympathy mr dyson used to say that the sympathies which could not be quickened by history were so dull that fiction was thrown away upon them did you never i mean did he never read you novels she shook her head he said that my imagination was quite powerful enough to be a good servant and he did not wish it to become my master and then there was something else about wanting the experience of life necessary to appreciate fiction abraham dyson was a wise man phillis but what do you do all day i draw i talk to my maid antoinette i give the twins their breakfast those were the twins mr jagenal's elder brothers whom i met on the steps i suppose i have heard of them apres phillis i play and sing to myself i go out for a walk in the garden of the square i go to mr jagenal's office and walk home with him and i look after my wardrobe then i sit and think of what i have seen and heard put it all away in my memory or i repeat to my self over again some of the poetry which i learned at highgate and you know no young ladies no i wish i did i am curious to talk to young ladies quite young ladies you know of my own age i want to compare myself with them and find out my faults you will tell me my faults lawrence will you i don't quite think i can promise that phillis you see you might retaliate and if you once begin telling me my faults there would be no end oh i am sorry phillis looked curiously at her guardian for some outward sign or token of the old adam but she saw none perhaps i shall find them out some time and then i will tell you heaven forbid he said laughing now phillis i have been asked to dine here and i am going to be at your service all day it is only one o'clock what shall we do and where shall we go anywhere she replied anywhere take me into the crowded streets and let me look at the people and the shops i like that best of anything but stay and have luncheon here first they had luncheon colquhoun confessed to himself that this was a young lady calculated to do him the greatest credit she acted hostess with a certain dignity which sat curiously on so young a girl and which she had learned from presiding at many a luncheon in mr dyson's old age among his old friends when her guardian had become too infirm to take the head of his own table there was it is true something wanting colquhoun's practised eye detected that at once phillis was easy graceful and natural but she had not the man of the world noticed what jack dunquerque failed to observe she had not the unmistakable stamp of social tone which can only come by practice and time the elements however were there before him his ward was a diamond which wanted but a little polish to make her a gem of the first water after luncheon they talked again this time with a little more freedom colquhoun told her all he knew of the father who was but a dim and distant memory to her you have his eyes he said and you have his mouth i should know you for his daughter he told her how fond this straight rider this nimrod of the hunting field had been of his little phillis how one evening after mess he told colquhoun that he had made a will and appointed him lawrence with abraham dyson the trustees of his little girl i have been a poor trustee phillis lawrence concluded but i was certain you were in good hands and i let things alone now that i have to act in earnest you must regard me as your friend and adviser they had such a long talk that it was past four when they went out for their walk phillis was thoughtful and serious thinking of the father whom she lost so early somehow she had forgotten at highgate that she once had a father and the word mother had no meaning for her outside the house lawrence looked at his companion critically am i poorly dressed she asked with a smile because she knew that she was perfectly dressed at all events lawrence thought he would have no occasion to be ashamed of his companion let me look again phillis i should like to give you a little better brooch than the one you have put on my poor old brooch i cannot give up my old friend lawrence she dropped quite easily into his christian name and hesitated no more over it than she did with jack dunquerque he took her into a jeweler's shop and bought her a few trinkets there phillis you can add those to your jewel box i have no jewels no jewels where are your mother's i believe they are all in the bank locked up perhaps they are with my money phillis's idea of her fifty thousand pounds was that the money was all in sovereigns packed away in a box and put into a bank well i think you ought to have your jewels out at any rate did mr dyson give you any money to spend no and if he had i could not spend it because i never went outside the house lawrence give me some money and let me buy something all by myself he bought her a purse and filled it with two or three sovereigns and a handful of silver now you are rich phillis what will you buy pictures i think in all this great exhibition of glorious and beautiful objects there was only one thing which phillis wished to buy pictures well let us buy some photographs they were walking down oxford street and presently they came to a photograph shop proud of her newly acquired wealth phillis selected about twenty of the largest and most expensive colquhoun observed that her taste was good and that she chose the best subjects when she had all that she liked together with one or two which she bought for jack with a secret joy surpassing that of buying for herself she opened her purse and began to wonder how she was to pay do you think your slender purse will buy all these views colquhoun asked put it up phillis and keep it for another time let me give you these photographs but you said i should buy something her words and action were so childish that lawrence felt a sort of pity for her not to know how to spend money seemed to lazy lawrence who had done nothing else all his life a state of mind really deplorable it would mean in his own case absolute deprivation of the power of procuring pleasure either for himself or for any one else poor little nun not to know even the value of money but i do a sovereign is twenty shillings and a shilling is twelve pence that is certainly true now you shall know the value of money there is a beggar he is going to tell us that he is hungry he will probably add that he has a wife and twelve children all under the age of three in his humble home and that none of them have tasted food for a week what will you give him phillis paused how should she relieve so much distress by this time they were close to the beggar he was a picturesque rogue in rags and tatters and bare feet though it was a warm day he shivered in his hand he held a single box of lights but the fellow was young well fed and lusty lawrence colquhoun halted on the pavement and looked at him attentively this man he explained to phillis can get for a penny a small loaf twopence will buy him a glass of ale sixpence a dinner for ten shillings he could get a suit of working clothes which he does not want because he has no intention of doing any work at all a sovereign would lodge and feed him for a fortnight if he did not drink i should give him a sovereign said phillis then he would be happy for a week bless your ladyship murmured the beggar i would get work gawd knows if i could i remember this fellow said colquhoun for six years he is a sturdy rogue best give nothing to him at all come on phillis we must look for a more promising subject poor fellow said phillis closing her purse they passed on and the beggar man cursed audibly i believe it is mr tupper in his proverbial philosophy who explains that what a beggar most wants to make him feel happier is sympathy now that was just what phillis gave and the beggar man only swore colquhoun laughed you may keep your pity phillis for some one who deserves it better now let us take a cab and go to the park it is four years since i saw the park it was five o'clock the park was fuller than when he saw it last it grows more crowded year after year as the upward pressure of an enriched multitude makes itself felt more and more there was the usual throng about the gates of those who come to look for great people and like to tell whom they recognised and who were pointed out to them there were the pedestrians on either side the road civilians after office hours bankers and brokers from the city men up from aldershot busy men hastening home loungers leaning on the rails curious colonials gazing at the carriages frenchmen trying to think that hyde park cannot compare with the bois de boulogne germans mindful of their mighty army their great sprawling berlin the gap of a century between english prosperity and teutonic militarism and as envious as philosophy permits americans owning that new york though its women are lovelier has nothing to show beside the park at five on a spring afternoon all the bright familiar scene which colquhoun remembered so well four years since i saw it last he repeated to the girl i suppose there will be none of the faces that i used to know he was wrong the first man who greeted him was his old colonel then he came across a man he had known in india then one whom he had last seen a war correspondent inside metz he shook hands with one nodded to another and made appointments with all at his club and as each passed he told something about him to his ward that is my old colonel your father's brother officer the most gallant fellow who ever commanded a regiment as soon as you are settled i should like to bring him to see you that is macnamara of the london herald a man you can't get except in england that is lord blandish we were together up country in india he wrote a book about his adventures in cashmere i did not it was a new world to phillis all these carriages these people this crowd who were they they are not like the faces i see in the streets she said no those are faces of men who work for bread these are mostly of men who work not at all or they work for honour there are two or three classes of mankind you know phillis servants and masters not quite you belong to the class of those who need not work this class your father knew all these people it is a happy world in its way in its way he repeated thinking of certain shipwrecks he had known perhaps it is better to have to work i do not know phillis who he was going to ask her who was bowing to her when he turned pale and stopped suddenly in the carriage which was passing within a foot of where they stood was a lady whom he knew mrs cassilis he took off his hat and mrs cassilis stopped the carriage and held out her hand how do you do phillis dear mr colquhoun i am glad to see you back again come as soon as you can and see me if you can spare an afternoon as soon as you are settled give it to me for auld lang syne the last words were whispered her lips trembled and her hand shook as she spoke and lawrence's face was hard he took off his hat and drew back phillis did not hear what he said but mrs cassilis drove on and left the park immediately mrs cassilis trembled when she spoke to you lawrence it was exactly what a girl of six would have said did she phillis she was cold perhaps or perhaps she was pleased to see old friends again so you know her yes i have dined at her house and i have been shopping with her she does not like me i know but she is kind she has spoken to me about you so you know mrs cassilis he repeated she does not look as if she had any trouble on her mind does she the smooth brow of a clear conscience phillis if you have had enough of the park i think it is almost time to drive you home lawrence colquhoun dined at carnarvon square the twins dined at their club so that they had the evening to themselves and could talk i have made up my mind lawrence said to ask my cousin to take charge of you phillis agatha l'estrange is the kindest creature in the world will you try to like her if she consents yes i will try but suppose she does not like me everybody likes you miss fleming said joseph she is sure to like you said lawrence and i will come over often and see you we will ride together if you like and if you would like to have any masters or lessons in anything i think i should like to learn reading phillis remarked meditatively mr abraham dyson used to say she held up her finger and imitated the manner and fidgety dogmatism of an old man 'reading breeds a restless curiosity and engenders an irreverent spirit of carping criticism any jackanapes who can read thinks himself qualified to judge the affairs of the nation reading indeed' but i think i should like after all to do what everybody else can do chapter xiv you bear a gentle mind and heavenly blessings follow such creatures half a mile or so above teddington lock where you are quite above the low tides which leave the mud banks in long stretches and spoil the beauty of the splendid river where the stream flows on evenly between its banks only sometimes swifter and stronger sometimes slower and more sluggish where you may lie and listen a whole summer's day to the murmurous wash of the current among the lilies and the reeds there stands a house noticeable among other houses by reason of its warm red brick its many gables and its wealth of creepers its gardens and lawns slope gently down to the river's edge the willows hang over it letting their long leaves like maidens' fingers lie lightly on the cool surface of the water there is a boat house where a boat used to lie but it is empty now ivy covers it over dark ivy that contrasts with the lighter greens of the sweet may foliage the lilacs and laburnums are exulting in the transient glory of foliage and flower the wisteria hangs its purple clusters like grapes upon the wall there are greenhouses and vineries there are flower beds bright with the glories of modern gardening and there are old fashioned round plots of ground innocent of bedding out where flourish the good old fashioned flowers stocks pansies boy's love sweet william and the rest which used to be cultivated for their perfume and colour long before bedding out was thought of an old brick wall runs down to the river's edge as a boundary on either side thick and warm with peaches plums and apricots trained in formal lines and crowned with wall flowers and long grasses like the walls of some old castle behind are rooms which open upon the lawn round the windows clamber the roses waiting for the suns of june and if you step into the house from the garden you will enter a dainty drawing room light and sunny adorned with all manner of feminine things and you will find besides boudoirs studies all sorts of pretty rooms into which the occupants of the house may retire the time they feel disposed to taste the joys of solitude the house of a lady does any one ever consider what thousands of these dainty homes exist in england all about the country they stand houses where women live away their innocent and restful lives lapped from birth to death in an atmosphere of peace and warmth such luxury as they desire is theirs for they are wealthy enough to purchase all they wish chiefly they love the luxury of art and fill their portfolios with water colours but their passions even for art are apt to be languid and they mostly desire to continue in the warm air perfumed like the wind that cometh from the sweet south which they have created round themselves the echoes of the outer world fall upon their ears like the breaking of the rough sea upon a shore so far off that the wild dragging of the shingle with its long drawn cry sounds like a distant song these ladies know nothing of the fiercer joys of life and nothing of its pains the miseries of the world they understand not save that they have been made picturesque in novels they have no ambition and take no part in any battles they have not spent their strength in action and therefore feel no weariness society is understood to mean a few dinners with an occasional visit to the wilder dissipations of town and their most loved entertainments are those gatherings known as garden parties duty means following up in a steady but purposeless way some line of study which will never be mastered good works mean subscription to societies many a kind lady thinks in her heart of hearts that the annual guinea to a missionary society will be of far more avail to her future welfare than a life of purity and innocence the christian virtues naturally find their home in such a house they grow of their own accord like the daisies the buttercups and the field convolvulus love joy peace gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance all the things against which there is no law which of them is not to be seen abundantly blossoming and luxuriant in the cottages and homes of these english ladies in this house by the river lived mrs l'estrange her name was agatha and everybody who knew her called her agatha l'estrange when a woman is always called by her christian name it is a sign that she is loved and lovable if a man on the other hand gets to be known without any reason for the distinction by his christian name it is generally a sure sign that he is sympathetic but blind to his own interests she was a widow and childless she had been a widow so long her husband had been so much older than herself her married life had been so short and the current of her life so little disturbed by it that she had almost forgotten that she was once a wife she had an ample income she lived in the way that she loved she gathered her friends about her she sometimes but at rare intervals revisited society mostly she preferred her quiet life in the country girls came from london to stay with her and wondered how agatha managed to exist when the season was over leaving its regrets and its fatigues with the usual share of hollowness and dead sea fruit they came again and envied her tranquil home she was first cousin to lawrence colquhoun whom she still from force of habit regarded as a boy he was very nearly the same age as herself and they had been brought up together there was nothing about his life that she did not know except one thing the reason of his abrupt disappearance four years before she was his confidante as a boy he told her all his dreams of greatness as a young man all his dreams of love and pleasure she knew the soft and generous nature out of which great men cannot be formed which was his she saw the lofty dreams die away and she hoped for him that he would keep something of the young ideal he did lawrence colquhoun was a man about town but he retained his good nature it is not usual among the young gentlemen who pursue pleasure as a profession it is not expected of them after a few years of idleness gambling and the rest to have any good nature surviving or any thought left at all except for themselves therefore lawrence colquhoun's case was unusual and popularity proportional he tired of garrison life he sold out he remained about town the years ran on and he neither married nor talked of marrying but he used to go down to his cousin once a week and talk to her about his idle life there came a day when he left off coming or if he came at all his manner to his cousin was altered he became gloomy and one day she heard in a brief and unsatisfactory letter that he was going to travel for a lengthened period the letter came from scotland and was as brief as a dinner invitation he went he was away for four years during that time he never once wrote to her she heard nothing of him or from him one day without any notice he appeared again he was very much the same as when he left england men alter little between thirty and fifty only a little graver his beard a little touched with the grey hairs which belong to the eighth lustrum his eyes a little crows footed his form a little filled out the gloom was gone however he was again the kindly lawrence the genial lawrence lawrence the sympathetic lawrence the lazy he walked in as if he had been away a week agatha heard a step upon the gravel walk and knew it her heart beat a little although a woman may be past forty she may have a heart still and her eyes sparkled she was sitting at work some little useless prettiness on the work table lay a novel which she read in the intervals of stitching the morning was bright and sunny with only a suspicion of east wind and her windows were open flowers stood upon her table flowers in pots and vases stood in her windows such flowers as bloom in may were bright in her garden and the glass doors of her conservatory showed a wealth of flowers within a house full of flowers and herself a flower too call her a rose fully blown or call her a glory of early autumn a handsome woman still sweet and to be loved with the softness of her tranquil life in every line of her face and her warmth of heart in every passing expression she started when she heard his step because she recognised it then she sat up and smiled to herself she knew how her cousin would come back in fact he walked in at her open window and held out his hand without saying a word then he sat down and took a single glance at his cousin first and the room afterwards i have not seen you lately lawrence said agatha as if he had been away for a month or so no i have been in america really you like america she waited for him to tell her what he would yes i came back yesterday you are looking well agatha i am very well and you have got a new picture on the wall where did you buy this at agnew's three years ago it was in the exhibition now i think of it you have been away for four years lawrence i like it have you anything to tell me agatha nothing that will interest you the house is the same we have had several dreadful winters and i have been in constant fear that my shrubs would be killed some of them were my dog pheenie is dead and i never intend to have another the cat that you used to tease is well my aviary has increased my horses are the same you knew four years ago my servants are the same and my habits i am thankful to say have not deteriorated to my knowledge although i am four years older and your young ladies the traps you used to set for me when i was four years younger agatha where are they married lawrence all of them what a pity that you could not fix yourself but it is never too late to mend at one time i feared you would be attracted by victoria pengelley lawrence colquhoun visibly changed colour but agatha was not looking at him that would have been a mistake i thought so then and i know it now she is a cold and bloodless woman lawrence besides she is married thank goodness we must find you some one else my love days are over he said with a harsh and grating voice i buried them before i went abroad you will tell me all about that some day when you feel communicative meantime stay to dinner and enliven me with all your adventures you may have some tea if you like but i do not invite you because you will want to go away again directly afterwards lawrence what do you intend to do now you are home again are you going to take up the old aimless life or shall you be serious i think the aimless life suits me best and it certainly is the slowest don't you think agatha that as we have got to get old and presently to die we may as well go in for making the time go slow that is the reason why i have never done anything i never do anything myself except listen to what other people tell me but i find the days slip away all too quickly agatha i am in a difficulty that is one of the reasons why i have come to see you to day poor lawrence you always are in a difficulty this time it is not my fault but it is serious agatha i have got a i do not know why he hesitated but his cousin caught him up with a little cry not a wife lawrence not a wife without telling me no agatha he flushed crimson not a wife that would have been a great deal worse what i have got is a ward a ward do you remember dick fleming who was killed in the hunting field about fifteen years ago yes perfectly he was one of my swains ever so long ago before i married my poor dear husband agatha had used the formula of her poor dear husband for more than twenty years so long in fact that it was become a mere collocation of words and had no longer any meaning certainly no sadness he left a daughter then a child of four or five and he made me one of that child's guardians the other was a mr dyson who took her and brought her up he is dead and the young lady now nineteen years of age comes to me but lawrence what on earth are you going to do with a girl of nineteen i don't know agatha i cannot have her with me in the albany can i not very well i think i cannot take a small house in chester square and give evening parties for my ward and myself can i not very well lawrence she is staying with my lawyer jagenal a capital fellow but his house is hardly the right place for a young lady lawrence what will you do this is a very serious responsibility very what sort of a girl is she phillis fleming is what you would call i think a beautiful girl she is tall and has a good figure her eyes are brown and her hair is brown with lots of it her features are small and not too regular she has got a very sweet smile and i should say a good temper so long as she has her own way no doubt said agatha pray go on you seem to have studied her appearance with a really fatherly care she has a very agreeable voice a naivete in manner that you should like she is clever and well informed is she strong minded lawrence no said lawrence with emphasis she is not she has excellent ideas on the subject of her sex always in extremes of course though i am not certain what she wants so far as i can see nothing but the society of some amiable accomplished gentlewoman lawrence you are exactly the same as you always were you begin by flattery now i know what you came here for an amiable accomplished gentlewoman who would exercise a gradual and steady influence upon her you want her to stay with me lawrence and you are keeping something back tell me instantly you say she is beautiful it must be something else are her manners in any way unusual does she drop h's and eat with her knife no her manners are i should say perfect' temper good you say manner perfect appearance graceful what can be the reserved objection my dear cousin you pique my curiosity she is sometimes probably insane no agatha not that i know of it is only that her guardian brought her up in entire seclusion from the world and would not have her taught to read and write how very remarkable on the other hand she can draw she draws everything and everybody she has got a book full of drawings which she calls her diary they are the record of her life she will show them to you and tell you all her story you will take her for a little while agatha will you of course she said yes she had never refused lawrence colquhoun anything in her life had he been a needy man he would have been dangerous but lawrence colquhoun wanted nothing for himself my dear agatha it is very good of you you will find the most splendid material to work upon better than you ever had the girl is different from any other girl you have ever known she talks and thinks like a boy she is as strong and active as a young athlete i believe she would outrun atalanta and yet i think she is a thorough woman at heart i should not at all wonder at her being a thorough woman at heart most of us are but lawrence you must not fall in love with your own ward he laughed a little uneasily i am too old for a girl of nineteen he replied at any rate you have excited my curiosity let her come lawrence as soon as you please i want to see this paragon of girls who is more ignorant than a charity school girl on the contrary agatha she is better informed than most girls of her age if she is not well read she is well told but really lawrence think she cannot read even not if you gave her a basketful of tracts but that is rather a distinction now at least she will never want to go in for what they call the higher education will she she must learn to read but will she ever master spelling very few people do they only pretend i am weak myself in spelling phillis does not want to be a certificated mistress agatha and arithmetic too well my cousin of course the rule of three is as necessary to life as the use of the globes over which the schoolmistresses used to keep such a coil and it has been about as accessible to poor phillis as an easy seat to a tombstone cherub but she can count and multiply and add and tell you how much things ought to come to and really when you think of it a woman does not want much more does she it is the mental training lawrence think of the loss of mental training i feel that too he said with a smile of sympathy think of growing up without the discipline of vulgar fractions or genteel decimals one is appalled at imagining what our young ladies would be without it but you shall teach her what you like agatha i am half afraid of her lawrence nonsense my cousin she is sweetness itself let me bring her to morrow yes she can have the room next to mine agatha sighed a little suppose we don't get on together after all it would be such a disappointment and such a pain to part get on agatha and with you well all the world gets on with you was there ever a girl in the world that you did not get on with yes there was i never got on with victoria pengelley mrs cassilis shall you call upon her lawrence no yes i don't know agatha he replied hurriedly and went away with scant leave taking he neither took any tea nor stayed to dinner then agatha remembered of course she said how stupid of me they used to talk about lawrence and victoria can he think of her still why the woman is as cold as ice and as hard as steel besides being married a man who would fall in love with victoria pengelley would be capable of falling in love with a marble statue my cousin lawrence colquhoun she told her friends in her letters agatha spent as much time letter writing as madame du deffand has come back from his travels he is not at all changed except that he has a few grey hairs in his beard he laughs in the same pleasant way has the same soft voice thinks as little seriously about life and is as perfectly charming as he has always been he has a ward a young lady daughter of an old friend of mine she is named phillis fleming i am going to have her with me for a while and i hope you will come and make her acquaintance but not just yet not until we are used to each other i hear nothing but good of her thus did this artful woman gloss over the drawbacks of poor phillis's education her friends were to keep away till such time as phillis had been drilled inspected reviewed manoeuvred and taught the social tone no word you see of the little deficiencies which time alone could be expected to fill up agatha l'estrange in her way was a woman of the world she expected in spite of her cousin's favourable report to find an awkward rather pretty wholly unpresentable hoyden and she half repented that she had so easily acceded to lawrence colquhoun's request it was nearly six next day when phillis arrived her guardian drove her out in a dog cart her maid following behind with the luggage this mode of conveyance being rapid open and especially adapted for purposes of observation pleased phillis mightily she even preferred it to a hansom cab she said little on the road being too busy in the contemplation of men and manners also she was yet hardly at home with her new guardian he was pleasant he was thoughtful of her but she had not yet found out how to talk with him now with jack dunquerque and then she began to think how jack would look driving a dog cart and how she should look beside him lawrence colquhoun looked at his charge with eyes of admiration many a prettier girl he thought might be seen in a london ballroom or in the park but not one brighter or fresher where did it come from this piquant way phillis asked no more questions about mrs l'estrange having once made up her mind that she should rebel and return to mr jagenal in case she did not approve of mr colquhoun's cousin she rested tranquil to be sure she was perfectly prepared to like her being still in the stage of credulous curiosity in which every fresh acquaintance seemed to possess all possible virtues up to the present she had made one exception i am sorry to say it was that of the only woman she knew mrs cassilis phillis could not help feeling as if life with mrs cassilis would after a time become tedious rather she thought life with the twins they arrived at the house by the river agatha was in the garden she looked at her visitor with a little curiosity and welcomed her with both hands and a kiss mrs cassilis did not kiss phillis in fact nobody ever had kissed her at all since the day when she entered abraham dyson's house jack she remembered had proposed to commence their friendship with an imitation of the early christians but the proposal somehow came to nothing so when agatha drew her gently towards herself and kissed her softly on the forehead poor phillis changed colour and was confused agatha thought it was shyness but phillis was never shy you are in good time lawrence we shall have time for talk before dinner you may lie about in the garden if you please till we come to look for you come my dear and i will show you your room at highgate phillis's room was furnished with a massive four post bedstead and adorned with dusky hangings solidity comfort and that touch of gloom which our grandfathers always lent to their bedrooms marked the highgate apartment at carnarvon square she had the spare room and it was furnished in much the same manner only that it was larger and the curtains were of lighter colour she saw now a small room still with the afternoon sun upon it with a little iron bedstead in green and gold and white curtains there was a sofa an easy chair a table at one of the windows and one in the centre of the room there were bookshelves and there were pictures phillis turned her bright face with a grateful cry of surprise oh what a beautiful room i am glad you like it my dear i hope you will be comfortable in it phillis began to look at the pictures on the wall she was critical about pictures and these did not seem very good do you like the pictures this one is out of drawing she said standing before a water colour i like this better moving on to the next but the painting is not clear agatha remembered what she had paid for these pictures and hoped the fair critic was wrong but she was not she was right and then in her journey round the room phillis came to the open window and cried aloud with surprise and astonishment o mrs l'estrange is it it she asked in an awestruck voice turning grave eyes upon her hostess as if imploring that no mistake should be made on a matter of such importance is it really the thames why my dear of course it is i have never seen a river i have so longed to see a river and especially the thames do you know 'sweet thames run softly till i end my song' and again oh there are swans 'with that i saw two swans of goodly hue come softly swimming down along the lee two fairer birds i never yet did see' i am glad you read poetry my dear but i do not i cannot read i only remember mrs l'estrange can we get close to it quite close to the water i want to see it flowing they went back into the garden where lawrence was lying in the shade doing nothing phillis looked not at the flowers or the spring blossoms she hurried agatha across the lawn and stood at the edge gazing at the water i should like she murmured presently after a silence i should like to be in a boat and drift slowly down between the banks seeing everything as we passed until we came to the place where all the ships come up jack said he would take me to see the great ships sailing home laden with their precious things perhaps he will but o mrs l'estrange how sweet it is there is the reflection of the tree see how the swans sail up and down there are the water lilies and look there are the light and shade chasing each other up the river before the wind agatha let her stay a little longer and then led her away to show her the flowers and hothouses phillis knew all about these and discoursed learnedly but her thoughts were with the river lawrence went away soon after dinner it was a full moon and the night was warm agatha and phillis went into the garden again when lawrence left them it was still and silent and as they stood upon the walk the girl heard the low murmurous wash of the current singing an invitation among the grasses and reeds of the bank let us go and look at the river again she said if it was beautiful in the day with the evening sun upon it it was ten times as beautiful by night when the shadows made great blacknesses and the bright moon silvered all the outlines and threw a long way of light upon the rippling water presently they came in and went to bed agatha half an hour later heard phillis's window open the girl was looking at the river again in the moonlight she saw the water glimmer in the moonlight she heard the whisper of the waves her thoughts they were the long thoughts of a child went up the stream and wondered through what meadows and by what hills the stream had flowed then she followed the current down and had to picture it among the ships before it was lost in the mighty ocean as she looked there passed a boat full of people they were probably rough and common people but among them was a woman and she was singing phillis wondered who they were the woman had a sweet voice as they rowed by the house one of the men lit a lantern and the light fell upon their faces making them clear and distinct for a moment and then was reflected in the black water below two of them were rowing and the boat sped swiftly on its way down the stream phillis longed to be with them on the river when they were gone there was silence for a space and then the night became suddenly musical jug jug jug it was the nightingale but phillis's brain was excited and to her it was a song with words come come come sang the bird stay with us here and rest and rest this is better than the town here are sweetness and peace this is the home of love and gentleness here you shall find the coping stone chapter xv but if ye saw that which no eyes can see the inward beauty of her lively spright garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree much more then would you wonder at the sight i like her my dear lawrence agatha wrote a fortnight after phillis's arrival i like her not only a great deal better than i expected but more than any girl i have ever learned to know she is innocent but then innocence is very easily lost she is fresh but freshness is very often a kind of electro plating which rubs off and shows the base metal beneath still phillis's nature is pure gold of that i am quite certain and with sincere people one always feels at ease we were a little awkward at first though perhaps the awkwardness was chiefly mine because i hardly knew what to talk about it seemed as if between myself and a girl who cannot read or write there must be such a great gulf that there would be nothing in common how conceited we are over our education lawrence she is quite the best informed girl that i know she has a perfectly wonderful memory repeats pages of verse which her guardian taught her by reading it to her talks french very well because she has always had a french maid plays and sings by ear and draws like a royal academician the curious thing however is the effect which her knowledge has had upon her mind she knows what she has been told and nothing more consequently her mind is all light and shade like a moonlight landscape she wants atmosphere there is no haze about her i did not at all understand until i knew phillis what a very important part haze plays in our everyday life i thought we were all governed by clear and definite views of duty religion and politics my poor lawrence we are all in a fog it is only phillis who lives in the cloudless realms of pure conviction in politics she is a tory with distinct ideas on the necessity of hanging all radicals as for her religion but that does not concern you my cousin or perhaps like most of your class you never think about religion at all in which case you would not be interested in phillis's doctrines i took her to church on sunday before the service i read her the hymns which we were to sing and after she had criticised the words in a manner peculiarly her own i read them again and she knew those hymns i also told her to do exactly as i did in the matter of uprising and downsitting one or two things i forgot and in other one or two she made little mistakes it is usual lawrence as you may remember for worshippers to pray in silence before sitting down phillis was looking about the church and therefore did not notice my performance of this duty also i had forgotten to tell her that loud speech is forbidden by custom within the walls of a church therefore it came upon me with a shock when phillis after looking round in her quick eager way turned to me and said quite aloud 'this is a curious place some of it is pretty but some is hideous' it was very true because the church has a half a dozen styles but the speech caused a little consternation in the place i think the beadle would have turned us out had he recovered his presence of mind in time this he did not fortunately and the service began no one could have behaved better during prayers than phillis she knelt listening to every word i could have wished that her intensity of attitude had not betrayed a perfect absence of familiarity with church customs during the psalms she began by listening with a little pleasure in her face then she looked a little bored and presently she whispered to me 'dear agatha i really must go out if this tune is not changed' fortunately the psalms were not long she liked the hymns and made no remark upon them except that one of the choir boys was singing false and that she should like to take him out of the choir herself there and then it was quite true and i really feared that her sense of duty might actually impel her to take the child by the ear and lead him solemnly out of the church during the sermon i regret to say that she burst out laughing you know phillis's laugh a pretty rippling laugh without any malice in it oh how rare a sweet laugh is the curate who was in the pulpit a very nice young man and a gentleman but not i must own intellectual and i hear he was plucked repeatedly for his degree stopped puzzled and indignant and then went on with his discourse i looked i suppose so horrified that phillis saw she had done wrong and blushed there were no more contretemps in the church 'my dear agatha' she explained when we came out 'i suppose i ought not to have laughed but i really could not help it did you notice the young gentleman in the box he was trying to act but he spoke the words so badly just as if he did not understand them and i laughed without thinking i am afraid it was very rude of me' i tried to explain things to her but it is difficult because sometimes you do not quite know her point of view next day the curate called to my vexation phillis apologised without any blushes she went straight to the point 'forgive me' she said 'i laughed at you yesterday in church i am very sorry for it' he was covered with confusion and stammered something about the sacred building 'but i never was in a church before' she went on 'that is very dreadful' he replied 'mrs l'estrange do you not think it is a very dreadful state for a young lady' then she laughed again but without apologising 'mr dyson used to say' she explained to me 'that everybody's church is in his own heart he never went to church and he did not consider himself in a dreadful state at all poor dear old man' if she can fall back on an axiom of mr abraham dyson's there is no further argument possible the curate went away he has been here several times since and i am sure that i am not the attraction we have had one or two little afternoons on the lawn and it is pretty to see phillis trying to take an interest in this young man she listens to his remarks but they fail to strike her she answers his questions but they seem to bore her in fact he is much too feeble for her she has no respect for the cloth at all and i very much fear that what is sport to her is going to be death to him of course lawrence you may be quite sure that i shall not allow phillis to be compromised by the attentions of any young man yet later on we shall ask your views her guardian must have been a man of great culture he has taught her very well and everything she astonished the curate yesterday by giving him a little historical essay on his favourite laud he understood very little of it but he went away sorrowful i could read in his face a determination to get up the whole subject come back and have it out with phillis but she shall not be dragged into an argument if i can prevent it with any young man nothing more easily leads to entanglements and we must be ambitious for our phillis 'it is a beautiful thing' she said the other day after i had been talking about the theory of public worship 'a beautiful thing for the people to come together every week and pray and the hymns are sweet though i cannot understand why they keep on singing the same tune and that such a simple thing of a few notes' the next sunday i had a headache and phillis refused to go to church without me she spent the day drawing on the bank of the river mrs cassilis has been to call upon us victoria was never a great friend of mine when she was young and i really like her less now she was kind to phillis and proposed all sorts of hospitalities which we escaped for the present i quite think that phillis should be kept out of the social whirl for a few months longer victoria looked pale and anxious she asked after you in her iciest manner wished to know where you were said that you were once one of her friends and hoped to see you before long she is cold by nature but her coldness was assumed here because she suddenly lost it i am quite sure lawrence that victoria pengelley was once touched and by you there must have been something in the rumours about you two four years ago lazy lawrence it is a good thing for you that there was nothing more than rumour we were talking of other things important things such as phillis's wardrobe which wants a great many additions when victoria a propos of nothing asked me if you were changed at all i said no except that you were more confirmed in laziness then phillis opened her portfolio where she keeps her diary after her own fashion and showed the pencil sketch she has made of your countenance it is a good deal better than any photograph because it has caught your disgraceful indolence and you stand confessed for what you are how the girl contrives to put the real person into her portraits i cannot tell victoria took it and her face suddenly softened i have seen the look on many a woman's face i look for it when i suspect that one of my young friends has dropped head over ears in love it comes into her eyes when young orlando enters the room and then i know and act accordingly poor victoria i ought not to have told you lawrence but you will forget what i said she glanced at the portrait and changed colour then she asked phillis to give it to her 'you can easily make another' she said 'and i will keep this as a specimen of your skill and a likeness of an old friend' she kept it and carried it away with her i have heard all about the coping stone what a curious story it is phillis talks quite gravely of the irreparable injury to the science of female education involved in the loss of that precious chapter mr jagenal is of opinion that without it the will cannot be carried out in which case mr cassilis will get the money i sincerely hope he will i am one of those who dislike above all things notoriety for women and i should not like our phillis's education and its results made the subject of lawyers' wit and rhetoric in the court of chancery do you know mr gabriel cassilis he is said to be the cleverest man in london and has made an immense fortune i hope victoria is happy with him she has a child but does not talk much about it i have been trying to teach phillis to read it is a slow process but the poor girl is very patient how we ever managed to 'worry through' as the americans say with such a troublesome acquirement i cannot understand we spend two hours a day over the task and are still in words of one syllable needless to tell you that the lesson book 'first steps in reading' is regarded with the most profound contempt and is already covered with innumerable drawings in pencil notes in music are easier phillis can already read a little but the difficulty here is that if she learns the air from the notes she knows it once for all and further reading is superfluous now little girls have as much difficulty in playing notes as in spelling them out so that they have to be perpetually practising the art of reading i now understand why people who teach are so immeasurably conceited i am already so proud of my superiority to phillis in being able to read that i feel my moral nature deteriorating at least i can sympathise with all school masters from the young man who holds his certificated nose high in the air to dr butler of harrow who sews up the pockets of his young gentlemen's trousers are you tired of my long letter only a few words more i have got a music and a singing master for phillis they are both delighted with her taste and musical powers her voice is very sweet though not strong she will never be tempted to rival professional people and will always be sure to please when she sings i have also got an artist to give her a few lessons in the management of her colours he is an elderly artist with a wife and bairns of his own not one of the young gentlemen who wear velvet coats and want to smoke all day you must yourself get a horse for her and then you can come over and ride with her at present she is happy in the contemplation of the river which exercises an extraordinary power over her imagination she is now while i write sitting in the shade singing to herself in solitude beside her is the sketch book but she is full of thought and happy to be alone lawrence she is a great responsibility and it is sad to think that the lesson she most requires to learn is the lesson of distrust she trusts everybody and when anything is done or said which would arouse distrust in ourselves she only gets puzzled and thinks of her own ignorance why cannot we leave her in the paradise of the innocent and never let her learn that every stranger is a possible villain alas that i must teach her this lesson and yet one would not leave her to find it out by painful experience my dear lawrence i once read that it was the custom in savage times to salute the stranger with clubs and stones because he was sure to be an enemy how far have we advanced in all these years you sent phillis to me for teaching but it is i who learned from her i am a worldly woman cousin lawrence and my life is full of hollow shams sometimes i think that the world would be more tolerable were all the women as illiterate as dear phillis do not come to see her for a few days yet and you will find her changed in those few things which wanted change sitting in solitude gazing on the river singing to herself phillis was quite otherwise occupied and much more pleasantly she had been doing all these things with much contentment of soul while agatha was writing her letters she sat under the trees upon the grass a little straw hat upon her head letting the beauty of the season fill her soul with happiness the sunlit river rippled at her feet on its broad surface the white swans lazily floated the soft air of early summer fanned her cheek the birds darted across the water as if in ecstasy of joy at the return of the sun as a matter of fact they had their mouths wide open and were catching flies a lark was singing in the sky there were a blackbird and a thrush somewhere in the wood across the river away up the stream there was a fat old gentleman sitting in a punt he held an umbrella over his head because the sun was hot and he supported a fishing rod in his other hand presently he had a nibble and in his anxiety he stood up the better to manoeuvre his float it was only a nibble and he sat down again unfortunately he miscalculated the position of the chair and sat upon space so that he fell backwards all along the punt phillis heard the bump against the bottom of the boat and saw a pair of fat little legs sticking up in the most comical manner she laughed and resolved upon drawing the fat old gentleman's accident as soon as she could find time the afternoon was very still the blackbird carolled in the trees and the wise thrush repeated his cheerful philosophy the river ran with soft whispers along the bank and phillis began to look before her with eyes that saw not and from eyelids that in a little would close in sleep then something else happened a boat came suddenly up the river close to her own bank she saw the bows first naturally and then she saw the back of the man in it then the boat revealed itself in full and phillis saw that the crew consisted of jack dunquerque her heart gave a great leap and she started from the sleepy hollow of her thoughts into life jack dunquerque was not an ideal oar such as one dreams of and reads about he did not grasp his sculls with the precision of a machine and row with a grand long sweep which made the boat spring under his arms like a thing of life i quote from an author whose name i have forgotten quite the contrary jack was rather unskilful than otherwise the ship in which he was embarked was one of those crank craft consisting of a cedar lath with crossbars of iron it was a boat without outriggers and he had hired it at richmond he was not so straight in the back as an oxford stroke and he bucketed about a good deal but he got along just as he was nearing phillis he fell into difficulties in consequence of one oar catching tight in the weeds the effect of this was as may be imagined to bring her bows on straight into the bank in fact jack ran the ship ashore and sat with the bows high on the grass just a few inches off phillis's feet then he drew himself upright tried to disentangle the oar and began to think what he should do next i wish i hadn't come he said aloud phillis laughed silently then she noticed the painter in the bows though she did not know it by that name painters in london boats are sometimes longish ropes for convenience of mooring phillis noiselessly lifted the cord and tied it fast round the trunk of a small elder tree beside her then she sat down again and waited this was much better fun than watching an elderly gentleman tumbling backwards in a punt jack having extricated the scull and rested a little looked at his palms which were blistering under the rough exercise of rowing and muttered something inaudible then he seized the oars again and began to back out vigorously the boat's bows descended a few inches and then the painter being taut moved no more phillis leaned forward watching jack with a look of rapturous delight damn the ship said jack softly after three or four minutes' strenuous backing don't swear at the boat jack phillis broke in with her low laugh and musical voice jack looked round there was his goddess standing on the bank clapping her hands with delight he gave a vigorous pull which drove the boat half way up to shore and sprang out jack you must not use words that sound bad oh how glad i am to see you i think you look best in flannels jack you here phil i thought it was a mile higher up did you know where i was gone to yes i found out i asked colquhoun and he told me but he did not offer to introduce me to mrs l'estrange and so i thought i would i thought that perhaps if i rowed up the river you know i might perhaps see you o jack she replied touched by this act of friendship did you really row up in the hope of seeing me i am so glad will you come in and be introduced to agatha that is mrs l'estrange i have not yet told her about you because we had so many things to say let us sit down and talk a little first phil you look even better than when you were at carnarvon square tell me what you are doing i am learning to read for one thing and jack a much more important thing i am taking lessons in water colour drawing i have learned a great deal already quite enough to show me how ignorant i have been but jack mr stencil cannot draw so well as i can and i am glad to think so when shall we be able to go out again for another visit somewhere phil ah i do not know we shall stay here all the summer i am sure and agatha talks of going to the seaside in the autumn i do not think i shall like the sea so much as i like the river but i want to see it jack how is mr gilead beck have you seen him lately yes i very often see him we are great friends but never mind him phil go on telling me about yourself it is a whole fortnight since i saw you is it really o jack and we two promised to be friends there is pretty friendship for you i am very happy jack agatha l'estrange is so kind that i cannot tell you how i love her lawrence colquhoun is her first cousin i like my guardian too very much but i have not yet found out how to talk to him i am to have a horse as soon as he can find me one and then we shall be able to ride together jack if it is not too far for you to come out here too far phil agatha is writing letters certainly it must be pleasant to talk to your friends when they are away from you i shall learn to write as fast as i can and then we will send letters to each other i wonder if she would mind being disturbed perhaps i had better not take you in just yet will you come for a row with me phil in the boat jack on the river oh if you will only take me jack untied the painter pulled the ship's head round and laid her alongside the bank you will promise to sit perfectly still and not move yes i will not move are you afraid for me jack a little phil you see if we were to upset perhaps you would not trust yourself entirely to me yes i would jack i am sure you would bring me safe to the bank but we must not upset now phil he rowed her upstream she sat in the stern and enjoyed the situation as in every fresh experience she was silent drinking in the details she watched the transparent water beneath her and saw the yellow green weeds sloping gently downwards with the current she noticed the swans which looked so tranquil from the bank and which now followed the boat gobbling angrily they passed the old gentleman in the punt he had recovered his chair by this time and was sitting in it still fishing but phillis could not see that he had caught many fish he looked from under his umbrella and saw them youth and beauty he sighed i like to feel the river said phillis softly it is pleasant on the bank but it is so much sweeter here can there be anything in the world she murmured half to herself more pleasant than to be rowed along the river on such a day as this there was no one on the river except themselves and the old angler jack rowed up stream for half a mile or so and then turned her head and let her drift gently down with the current occasionally dipping the oars to keep way on but he left the girl to her own thoughts it is all like a dream to me this river said phillis in a low voice it comes from some unknown place and goes to some unknown place it is like life phil yes we come like the river trailing long glories behind us you know what wordsworth says but we do not go to be swallowed up in the ocean and we are not alone we have those that love us to be with us and prevent us from getting sad with thought i have you jack yes phil he could not meet her face which was so full of unselfish and passionless affection because his own eyes were brimming over with passion take me in jack she said when they reached agatha's lawn it is enough for one day she led him to the morning room cool and sheltered where agatha was writing the letter we have already read and she introduced him as jack dunquerque her friend jack explained that he was rowing up the river that he saw miss fleming by accident that he had taken her for a row up the stream and so on all in due form jack and i are old friends said phillis agatha did not ask how old which was fortunate but she put aside her letters and sent for tea into the garden jack became more amiable and more sympathetic than any young man mrs l'estrange had ever known so much did he win upon her that having ascertained that he was a friend of lawrence colquhoun she asked him to dinner jack's voyage homeward was a joyful one many is the journey begun in joy that ends in sorrow few are those which begin as jack's bucketing up the river in uncertainty and end in unexpected happiness chapter xvi souvent femme varie bien foi qui s'y fie lawrence colquhoun was not in point of fact devoting much time to his ward at this time she was pretty she was fresh she was unconventional but then he was forty for twenty years he had been moving through a panorama of pretty girls it was hardly to be expected that a girl whom he had seen but once or twice should move a tough old heart of forty phillis pleased him but lazy lawrence wanted girls if that could be managed to come to him and she necessarily stayed at twickenham anyhow she was in good and safe hands it was enough to know that agatha had her in safe charge and custody and when he could find time he would go down and see her again as he had been thirteen years trying to find time to visit phillis at highgate it was possible that he might be in the same way prevented by adverse circumstances from going to twickenham he was troubled also by other and graver matters victoria cassilis asked him in the park to call upon her for auld lang syne what he replied is not on record because if anybody heard it could only have been the lady but he did not call upon her after a day or two there came a letter from her of this he took no notice it is not usual for a man to ignore the receipt from a lady but lawrence colquhoun did do so then there came another this also he tore in small pieces and then another hang the woman said lawrence i believe she wants to have a row i begin to be sorry i came home at all his chambers were on the second floor in the albany and any one who knows lawrence colquhoun will understand that they were furnished in considerable comfort and even luxury he did not pretend to a knowledge of art but his pictures were good nor was he a dilettante about furniture but his was in good style china he abhorred like many other persons of sound and healthy taste let us leave a loophole of escape there may be some occult reason unknown to the uninitiated for finding beauty loveliness and desirability in hideous china monsters and porcelain after all we are but a flock and follow the leader why should we not go mad for china it is as sensible as going mad over rinking why should we not buy water colours at fabulous prices at least these can be sold again for something whereas books an extinct form of madness cannot and besides present their backs in a mute appeal to be read the rooms of a man with whom comfort is the first thing aimed at the chairs are low deep and comfortable there are brackets tiny tables and all sorts of appliances for saving trouble and exertion the curtains are of the right shade for softening the light the pictures are of subjects which soothe the mind the books if you look at them are books of travel and novels the place is exactly such a home as lazy lawrence would choose and yet when we saw his laziness in the prologue he was living alone in a deserted city among the bare wooden walls of a half ruined hotel but lawrence was not then at home he took what comfort he could get even there and while he indulged his whim for solitude impressed into his own service for his own comfort the two chinamen who constituted with him the population of empire city but at empire city he was all day shooting that makes a difference to the laziest of men and he would not have stayed there so long had he not been too lazy to go away if a man does not mind lonely evenings the air on the lower slope of the sierra nevada is pleasant and the game is abundant now however he was back in london where the laziest men live beside the busiest the sun streamed in at his windows which were bright with flowers and he sat in the shade doing nothing restless men take cigars men who find their own thoughts insufficient for the passing hour take books men who cannot sit still walk about lawrence colquhoun simply lay back in an easy chair watching the sunlight upon the flowers with lazy eyes he had the gift of passive and happy idleness to him there came a visitor a woman whom he did not know she was a woman about thirty years of age a hard featured sallow faced woman she looked in lawrence's face with a grim curiosity as she walked across the room and handed him a letter from mrs cassilis sir oh said lawrence and you are i am her maid sir where is janet then janet is dead she died three years ago before mrs cassilis married oh janet is dead is she ah that accounts i mean where did janet die in lodgings at ventnor sir mrs cassilis miss pengelley she was then as you know sir lawrence looked up sharply but there was no change in the woman's impassive face as she spoke miss pengelley sent me with her and janet died in my arms sir of consumption ah i am sorry and so mrs cassilis has sent you to me with this letter has she he did not open it will you tell mrs cassilis that i will send an answer by post if there is any answer required i beg your pardon sir but mrs cassilis told me expressly that if you were in town i was to wait for an answer if i had to wait all day in that case i suppose i had better read the letter he opened it and it seemed as if the contents were not pleasant because he rose from his chair and began to walk about the sallow faced woman watched him all the time as one who has fired a shot and wishes to know whether it has struck and where he held the letter in his left hand and with his right moved and altered the position of things on the mantel shelf a sign of mental agitation then he turned round brusquely and said tell your mistress that i will call upon her in the afternoon will you write that sir no i will not he replied fiercely take your answer and begone she went without a word there will be trouble she said to herself janet said it would all come up again some day he's a handsome chap and missus is a fool she's worse than a fool she's a hard hearted creature with no more blood than a stone statue if there's to be trouble it won't fall on his head but on hern and if i was him i'd go away again quiet and then maybe no one wouldn't find it out as for her she'll blow on it herself lawrence's thoughts assumed a form something like the following three notes from her in rapid succession each one more vehement than the first she must see me she insists on my calling on her she will see me she has something important to tell me it's a marvellous thing and great proof of the absence of the inventive faculty in all of them that when they want to see you they invariably pretend that they have something important to tell you from the duchess to the nursemaid by jove they are all alike and now she is coming here unless i call upon her to day it won't do to let her come here i might go down to the seaside go into the country go anywhere back to america but what would be the good of that besides i have not done anything to be afraid of or ashamed of unless a knowledge of a thing is guilt i have nothing to fear for myself remains the question ought i not to screen her but screen her from whom no one knows except janet and janet is dead perhaps that woman with a face like a horse knows that would be awkward for victoria if she were to offend her for a more damned unforgiving countenance i never set eyes upon but janet was faithful i am sure janet would not split even when she was dying and then there was very little to split about when she died victoria hadn't married mr cassilis what the deuce does she want to rake up old things for why can't she let things be it's the way of women they can't forget and hang me if i don't think she can't forgive me because she has done me a wrong why did i come back from empire city there at all events one could be safe from annoyance on a day like this too the first really fine day of the season and it's spoiled i might have dined with cousin agatha and talked to phillis the pretty little phillis i might have mooned away the afternoon in the park and dined at the club i might have gone to half a dozen places in the evening i might have gone to greenwich and renewed my youth at the ship i might have gone to richmond with old evergreen and his party but phillis for choice but now i must have it out with victoria cassilis there's a fate in it we can't be allowed to rest and be happy like the schoolboy's scrag end of the rolly polly pudding it is helped and must be eaten philosophy brings resignation but it does not bring ease of mind those unfortunate gentlemen who used to be laid upon the wheel and have their limbs broken might have contemplated the approach of inevitable suffering with resignation but never with happiness in colquhoun's mind victoria cassilis was associated with a disagreeable and painful chapter in his life he saw her marriage in the fragment of ladds's paper and thought the chapter closed he came home and found her waiting for him ready to open it again i did think he said turning over her letter in his fingers that for her own sake she would have let things be forgotten it's ruin for her if the truth comes out and not pleasant for me a pretty fool i should look explaining matters in a witness box but i must see her if only to bring her to reason reason when was a woman reasonable i am here he said standing before mrs cassilis at her own house a few hours later i am here athos parthos arimis and d'artagnan would have said exactly the same thing me voici and they would have folded their arms and thrown back their heads with a preliminary tap at the sword hilt to make sure that the trusty blade was loose in the scabbard and easy to draw in case m le mari whom the old french allegorists called danger should suddenly appear but lawrence colquhoun said it quite meekly to a woman who neither held out her hand nor rose to meet him nor looked him in the face but sat in her chair with bowed head and weeping eyes a woman of steel there are no women of steel it was in mrs cassilis's morning room an apartment sacred to herself she used it for letter writing for interviews with dressmakers for tea with ladies for all sorts of things and now she received her old friend in it but why was she crying and why did she not look up i did want to see you lawrence she murmured can you not understand why my name is colquhoun mrs cassilis and i cannot understand why my name lawrence is victoria have you forgotten that i have forgotten everything mrs cassilis it is best to forget everything but if you cannot o lawrence she looked up in his face o lawrence if you cannot her weeping eyes her tear clouded face her piteous gesture moved the man not one whit the power which she might once have had over him was gone this is mere foolishness mrs cassilis as a stranger a perfect stranger may i ask why you call me by my christian name and why these tears strangers it is ridiculous she cried starting up and standing before him it is ridiculous when all the world knows that we were once friends and half the world thought that we were going to be something nearer nearer and dearer mrs cassilis what a foolish world it was suppose we had become nearer and therefore very much less dear be kind to me lawrence i will be whatever you like mrs cassilis except what i was provided you do not call me lawrence any more come let us be reasonable the past is gone in deference to your wishes i removed myself from the scene i went abroad i transported myself for four years then i saw the announcement of your marriage in the paper by accident and i came home again because of your own free will and accord you had given me my release is this true yes she replied then in the name of heaven why seek to revive the past believe me i have forgotten the few days of madness and repentance they are gone some ghosts of the past come to me but they do not take the shape of victoria pengelley suppose we cannot forget then we must forget victoria mrs cassilis rouse yourself think of what you are what you have made yourself i do think i think every day you have a husband and a child you have your position in the world mrs cassilis you have your honour my honour she echoed what honour and if all were known lawrence don't you even pity me what is the good of pity he asked rudely pity cannot alter things pity cannot make things which are as if they are not you seem to me to have done what you have done knowing well what you were doing and knowing what you were going to get by it you have got one of the very best houses in london you have got a rich husband you have got an excellent position and you have got mrs cassilis you have got a child whose future happiness depends upon your reticence i will tell you what i have besides she burst in with passion i have the most intolerable husband the most maddening and exasperating man in all the world is he cruel to you no he is kind to me if he were cruel i should know how to treat him but he is kind heroics mrs cassilis most women could very well endure a kind husband are you not overdoing it you almost make me remember a scene call it a dream which took place in a certain glasgow hotel about four years and a half ago in the city he is the greatest financier living i am told in the house he is the king of littleness i think there was or is a bishop said lawrence meditatively who gave his gigantic intellect to a treatise on the sinfulness of little sins perhaps you had better buy that work and study it or present it to your husband very well lawrence i suppose you think you have a right to laugh at me right good god mrs cassilis he cried in the greatest alarm do you think i claim any right the smallest over you if i ever had a right it is gone now gone by your own act and my silence yes lawrence she repeated with a hard smile on her lips your silence he understood what she meant he turned from her and leaned against the window looking into the shrubs and laurels she had dealt him a blow which took effect my silence he murmured my silence what have i to do with your life since that day that day which even you would find it difficult to forget do what you like marry if you like be as happy as you like or as miserable what does it matter to me my silence am i then going to proclaim to the world my folly and your shame let us not quarrel she went on pleased with the effect of her words there are women who would rather stab a man in the heart and so make some impression on him than to see him cold and callous to what they say or think it is foolish to quarrel after four years and more of absence absence makes the heart grow fonder said lawrence yes mrs cassilis it is foolish to quarrel still i suppose it is old habit and besides when a man has nothing else to say he sneers when a woman has nothing else to say she makes a general statement at all events lawrence you are unchanged since i left you at that hotel to which you refer so often are its memories pleasing to you no they are not are they to you come mrs cassilis this is foolish you told me you had something to say to me what is it i wanted to say this when we parted oh hang it cried the man why go back to that when we two parted she set her thin lips together as if she was determined to let him off no single word you used bitter words you told me that i was heartless cold and bad tempered those were the words you used by gad i believe they were said lawrence we had a blazing row and janet stood by with her calm scotch face and 'eh sir eh madam' i remember i might retaliate on you you did then mrs cassilis you let me have it in a very superior style no need to retaliate any more i might tell you now that you are heartless and cold i might tell you it seems that you are telling me all this without any use of the potential mood that if you have any lingering kindness for me even if you have any resentment for my conduct you would pity the lonely and companionless life i lead your son is nearly a year old i believe what is a baby lawrence thought the remark wanting in maternal feeling but he said nothing come mrs cassilis it is all no use i cannot help you i would not if i could hang it it would be too ridiculous for me to interfere think of the situation here we are we three i first you in the middle and mr cassilis third you and i know and he does not suspect on the stage the man who does not suspect always looks a fool no french novel comes anywhere near this position of things make yourself miserable if you like and make me uncomfortable but for heaven's sake don't make us all ridiculous as things are so you made them tell me what did you do it for speak to me kindly lawrence and i will tell you all after that dreadful day i went back to the old life janet and i made up something never mind what janet was as secret as the grave the old life oh how stupid and dull it was two years passed away you were gone never to return as you said janet died and mr cassilis came well well i was poor with my little income i had to live with friends and be polite to people i detested i saw a chance for freedom mr cassilis offered me that at least and i accepted him say you forgive me lawrence forgive what a thing to ask or to say it was a grievous mistake i wanted a man who could feel with me and appreciate me yes he said i know appreciation appreciation perhaps you got it and at a truer estimate than you thought i have sometimes found mrs cassilis in the course of my travels people who make themselves miserable because others do not understand their own ideals if these people could only label themselves with a few simple descriptive sentences such as 'i am good i am great i am full of lofty thoughts i am noble i am wise i am too holy for this world' and so on a good deal of unhappiness might be saved perhaps you might even now try on this method with mr cassilis cold and sneering she said to herself folding her hands and laying her arms straight out before her in her lap if you think of it this is a most effective attitude provided that the head be held well back and a little to the side what astonishes me he said taking no notice of her remark is that you do not at all seem to realise the thing you have done do you it is no use realising what cannot be found out janet is in her grave lawrence colquhoun the most selfish and heartless of men is quite certain to hold his tongue he laughed good naturedly very well mrs cassilis very well if you are satisfied of course no one has the right to say a word after all no one has any cause to fear except yourself for me i certainly hold my tongue it would be all so beautifully explained by serjeant smoothtongue 'six years ago gentlemen of the jury a man no longer in the bloom of early youth was angled for and hooked by a lady who employed a kind of tackle comparatively rare in english society she was a femme incomprise she despised the little ways of women she was full of infinite possibilities she was going to lead the world if only she could get the chance and then gentlemen of the jury' here the door opened and mr gabriel cassilis appeared his wife was sitting in the window cold calm and impassive some four or five feet from her stood lawrence colquhoun he was performing his imaginary speech with great rhetorical power but stopped short at sight of m le mari whom he knew instinctively this would have been a little awkward had not mrs cassilis proved herself equal to the occasion my dear she rose and greeted her husband with the tips of her fingers you are early to day let me introduce mr colquhoun a very old friend of mine i am very glad mr colquhoun to know you i have heard of you pray sit down mr colquhoun unless you will go on with your description mr colquhoun who has just arrived from america my dear was giving me a vivid account of some american trial scene which he witnessed her manner was perfectly cold clear and calm she was an admirable actress and there was not a trace left of the weeping shamefaced woman who received lawrence colquhoun gabriel cassilis looked at his visitor with a little pang of jealousy this then was the man with whom his wife's name had been coupled to be sure it was a censorious world but then he was a handsome fellow and a quarter of a century younger than himself however he put away the thought and tapped his knuckles with his double glasses while he talked to day whether from fatigue or from care he was not quite himself not the self possessed man of clear business mind that he wished to appear perhaps something had gone wrong lawrence and mrs cassilis or rather the latter began talking about days of very long ago so that her husband found himself out of the conversation this made him uneasy and less useful when the talk came within his reach but his wife was considerate made allowances so to speak for age and fatigue and lawrence noted that he was fond and proud of her he came away in a melancholy mood i can't help it he said i wish i couldn't feel anything about it one way or the other victoria has gone off and i wonder how in the world and now she has made a fool of herself it is not my fault some day it will all come out and i am an accessory after the fact if it were not for that phillis girl i must see after her and she is pretty enough to keep any man in town i would go back to america again if it

roofed and perfect unvisited since the last stragglers of the last crusading army died of famine on the steps scoffing with their latest breath at the desecrated altar their bones lay mouldering in front of the marble columns silent monuments of a wasted enthusiasm while the fleshless fingers pointed as if in scorn in the direction of jerusalem they have been dust this many a year dust blown about the fields manure for the crops which the peasant raises in luxuriance by scratching the soil but the temples stand still sacred yet to the memory of mother earth the many breasted goddess of the ephesians why if you had that l a year you would go there sketch photograph and dig what could not one do if one had money and then one takes to thinking what is done by those who actually have it well they subscribe they give to hospitals and institutions and they save the rest happy for this country that honduras turkey and a few other places exist to plunder the british capitalists or we should indeed perish of wealth plethora thousands of things all round us wait to be done things which must be done by rich men and cannot be done by trading men because they would not pay exempli gratia here are a few out of the many they are always talking of endowment of research all the men who think they ought to be endowed are clamouring for it but think of the luxury of giving a man a thousand a year and telling him to work for the rest of his days with no necessity for doing pot boilers yet no rich man does it there was a man in scotland the other day gave half a million to the kirk for all the luxury to be got out of that impersonal gift one might just as well drop a threepenny bit into the crimson bag this is a country in which the dramatic instinct is so strong as to be second only to that of france we want a national theatre where such a thing as a nights' run would be possible and which should be a school for dramatists as well as actors a paltry l a year would pay the annual deficit in such a theatre perhaps taking year with year less than half that sum would do no rich man has yet proposed to found endow or subsidise such a theatre in this city of london thousands of boys run about the streets ragged and hungry presently they become habitual criminals then they cost the country huge sums in goals policemen and the like philanthropic people catch a few of these boys and send them to places where they are made excellent sailors yet the number does not diminish a small l a year pays for a single boy a rich man might support a thousand of them yet no rich man does in this country millions of women have to work for their living everybody who employs those women under pays them and cheats them women cannot form trade unions they are without the organ of government therefore they are downtrodden in the race they do men's work at a quarter of men's wages no trade so flourishing as that which is worked by women witness the prosperity of dress making masters the workwomen have longer hours as well as lower pay than the men at the best they get enough to keep body and soul together not enough for self respect not enough if they are young and good looking to keep them out of mischief to give them a central office and a central protecting power might cost a thousand pounds a year no rich man so far as i know has yet come forward with any such scheme for the improvement of women's labour this is a country where people read a great deal more books are printed in england than in any other country in the world reading forms the amusement of half our hours the delight of our leisure time for the whole of its reading society agrees to pay mundie smith from three to ten guineas a house here is a sum in arithmetic house bills l a year wine bill l horses l rent l travelling l dress lord knows what reading say l also spent at smith's stalls in two shilling novels say thirty shillings that is the patronage of literature successful authors make a few hundreds a year successful grocers make a few thousands and people say how well is literature rewarded mr gilead beck once told me of a party gathered together in virginia city to mourn the decease of a dear friend cut off prematurely the gentleman intrusted with the conduct of the evening's entertainment had one and forty dollars put into his hands to be laid out to the best advantage he expended it as follows whisky forty dollars bread one dollar total forty one dollars what in thunder asked the chairman made you waste all that money in bread note he had never read henry iv the modern patronage of literature is exactly like the proportion of bread observed by the gentleman of virginia city five pounds a year for the mental food of all the household enough social reform is a troublesome and an expensive thing let it be done by the societies there are plenty of people anxious to be seen on platforms and plenty of men who are rejoiced to take the salary of secretary think again of mr gilead beck's luck and what it meant the wildest flights of your fancy never reach to a fourth part of his income the yearly revenues of a grosvenor fall far short of this amazing good fortune out of the bowels of the earth was flowing for him a continuous stream of wealth that seemed inexhaustible not one well but fifty were his and all yielding when he told jack dunquerque that his income was a thousand pounds a day he was far within the limit in these weeks he was clearing fifteen hundred pounds in every twenty four hours that makes forty five thousand pounds a month five hundred and forty thousand pounds a year can a grosvenor or a dudley reach to that the first well was still the best and it showed no signs of giving out and as mr beck attributed its finding to the direct personal instigation of the golden butterfly he firmly believed that it never would give out other shafts had been sunk round it but with varying success the ground covered with derricks and machinery erected for boring fresh wells and working the old an army of men were engaged in these operations a new town had sprung up in the place of limerick city and gilead p beck its king was in london trying to learn how his money might best be spent it weighed heavily upon his mind the fact that he was by no effort of his own through no merit of his own earning a small fortune every week made him thoughtful in his rough way he took the wealth as so much trust money he was entitled he thought to live upon it according to his inclination he was to have what his soul craved for he was to use it first for his own purposes but he was to devote what he could not spend that is the great bulk of it somehow to the general good such was the will of the golden butterfly i do not know how the idea came into gilead beck's head that he was to regard himself a trustee the man's antecedents would seem against such a conception of fortune and her responsibilities born in a new england village educated till the age of twelve in a village school he had been turned upon the world to make his livelihood in it as best he could he was everything by turns there was hardly a trade that he did not attempt not a calling which he did not for a while follow ill luck attended him for thirty years yet his courage did not flag every fresh attempt to escape from poverty only seemed to throw him back deeper in the slough yet he never despaired his time would surely come he preserved his independence of soul and he preserved his hope but all the time he longed for wealth the desire for riches is an instinct with the englishman a despairing dream with the german a stimulus for hoarding with the frenchman but it is a consuming fire with the american gilead p beck breathed an atmosphere charged with the contagion of restless ambition how many great men presidents vice presidents judges orators merchants have sprung from the obscure villages of the older states gilead beck started on his career with a vague idea that he was going to be something great as the years went on he retained the belief but it ceased to take a concrete form he did not see himself in the chair of ulysses grant he did not dream of becoming a statesman or an orator but he was going to be a man of mark somehow he was bound to be great and then came the golden butterfly see mr beck now it is ten in the morning he has left the pile of letters most of them begging letters unopened opened at his elbow he has got the case of glass and gold containing the butterfly on the table the sunlight pouring in at the opened window strikes upon the yellow metal and lights up the delicately chased wings of this freak of nature poised on the wire the golden butterfly seems to hover of its own accord upon the petals of the rose it is alive as its owner sits before it the creature seems endowed with life and motion this is nonsense but mr beck thinks so at the moment on the table is a map of his canadian oil fields he sits like this nearly every morning the gilded box before him it is his way of consulting the oracle after his interview with the butterfly he rises refreshed and clear of vision this morning if his thoughts could be written down they might take this form i am rich beyond the dreams of avarice i have more than i can spend upon the indulgence of every whim that ever entered the head of sane man when i have bought all the luxuries that the world has to sell there still remains to be saved more than any other living man has to spend what am i to do with it shall i lay it up in the bank the bank might break that is possible or the well might stop no that is impossible other wells have stopped but no well has run like mine or will again for i have struck through the crust of the earth into the almighty reservoir how to work out this trust who will help me to spend the money aright how is such a mighty pile to be spent even if the butterfly were to fall and break who can deprive me of my wealth his servant threw open the door mr cassilis sir chapter xviii doubtfully it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art one of gilead beck's difficulties perhaps his greatest was his want of an adviser people in england who have large incomes pay private secretaries to advise them the post is onerous but carries with it considerable influence to be a great man's whisperer is a position coveted by many at present the only confidential adviser of the american croesus was jack dunquerque and he was unsalaried and therefore careless ladds and colquhoun were less ready to listen and gabriel cassilis showed a want of sympathy with mr beck's trusteeship which was disheartening as for jack he treated the sacred voice which was to gilead beck what his demon was to socrates with profound contempt but he enjoyed the prospect of boundless spending in which he was likely to have a disinterested share next to unlimited chucking of his own money the youthful englishman would like what he never gets the unlimited chucking of other people's so jack brought ideas and communicated them as they occurred here is one he said it will get rid of thousands it will be a blessing and a boon for you it will make a real hole in the pile and it's philanthropy itself start a new daily mr beck was looking straight before him with his hands in his pockets his face was clouded with the anxiety of his wealth who would wish to be a rich man i have been already thinking of it mr dunquerque he said let us talk it over he sat down in his largest easy chair and chewed the end of an unlighted cigar i have thought of it he went on i want a paper that shall have no advertisements and no leading articles if a man can't say what he wants to say in half a column that man may go to some other paper i shall get only live men to write for me i will have no long reports of speeches and the bunkum of life shall be cut out of the paper then it will be a very little paper no sir there is a great deal to say once you get the right man to say it i've been an editor myself and i know you will not expect the paper to pay you no sir i shall pay for that paper and there shall be no cutting up of bad books to show smart writing i shall teach some of your reviews good manners but we pride ourselves on the tone of our reviews perhaps you do sir i have remarked that englishmen pride themselves on a good many things i will back a first class british subject for bubbling around against all humanity see mr dunquerque last week i read one of your high toned reviews there was an article in it on a novel the novel was a young lady's novel when i was editing the clearville roarer i couldn't have laid it on in finer style for the rough back of a ward politician and a young lady people like it i suppose said jack i dare say they do sir they used to like to see a woman flogged at the cart tail i am not much of a company man mr dunquerque but i believe that when a young lady sings out of tune it is not considered good manners to get up and say so and it isn't thought polite to snigger and grin and in my country if a man was to invite the company to make game of that young lady he would perhaps be requested to take a header through the window let things alone and presently that young lady discovers that she is not likely to get cracked up as a vocaller i shall conduct my paper on the same polite principles if a man thinks he can sing and can't sing let him be for a bit perhaps he will find out his mistake if he doesn't tell him gently and if that won't do get your liveliest writer to lay it on once for all but to go sneakin' and pryin' around pickin' out the poor trash and cutting it up to make the people grin it's mean mr dunquerque it's mean the cart tail and the cat o' nine was no worse than this exhibition i'm told it's done regularly and paid for handsomely shall you be your own editor i don't know sir perhaps if i stay long enough in this city to get to the core of things i shall scatter my own observations around but that's uncertain he rose slowly it took him a long time to rise and extended his long arms bringing them together in a comprehensive way as if he was embracing the universe i shall have central offices in new york and london but i shall drive the english team first i shall have correspondents all over the world and i shall have information of every dodge goin' from an emperor's ambition to a tin pot company bubble he brought his fingers together with a clasp jack noticed how strong and bony those fingers were with hands whose muscles seemed of steel the countenance of the man was earnest and solemn suddenly it changed expression and that curious smile of his unlike the smile of any other man crossed his face did i ever tell you my press experiences he asked let us have some champagne and you shall hear them the champagne having been brought he told his story walking slowly up and down with his hands in his pockets and jerking out the sentences as if he was feeling for the most telling way of putting them mr gilead beck had two distinct styles of conversation generally but for his american tone the length of his sentences and a certain florid wealth of illustration you might take him for an englishman of eccentric habits of thought when he went back to his old experiences he employed the vernacular rich metaphoric and full which belongs to the western states in the rougher period of their development and this he used now i was in chicago fifteen years ago i wanted employment nobody wanted me i spent most of the dollars and thought i had better dig out for a new location when i met one day an old schoolfellow named rayner he told me he was part proprietor of a morning paper i asked him to take me on he said he was only publisher but he would take me to see the editor mr john b van cott and perhaps he would set me grinding at the locals we found the editor he was a short active man of fifty and he looked as cute as he was because you see mr dunquerque unless you are pretty sharp on a western paper you won't earn your mush he was keeled back i remember in a strong chair with his feet on the front of the table and a clip full of paper on his knee and in this position he used to write his leading articles squelchers some of them made gentlemen of opposite politics cry and drove rival editors to polishing shooting irons the floor was covered with exchanges and there was nothing else in the place but a cracked stove half a dozen chairs standing around loose and a spittoon i mention these facts mr dunquerque to show that there was good standing room for a free fight of not more than two mr van cott shook hands and passed me the tobacco pouch while rayner chanted my praises when he wound up and went away the editor began 'wal sir' he said 'you look as if you knew enough to go indoors when it rains and rayner seems powerful anxious to get you on the paper a good fellow is rayner as white a man as i ever knew and he has as many old friends as would make a good sized city he brings them all here mr beck and wants to put every one on the paper to hear him hold forth would make a camp meeting exhorter feel small but he's disinterested is rayner it's all pure goodness' i tried to feel as if i wasn't down hearted but i was 'any way' i said 'if i can't get on here i must dig out for a place nearer sundown once let me get a fair chance on a paper and i can keep my end of the stick' the editor went on to tell me what i knew already that they wanted live men on the paper fellows that would do a murder right up to the handle then he came to business offered me a triple execution just to show my style and got up to introduce me to the other boys just then there was a knock at the door 'that's poulter our local editor' he said 'come in poulter he will take you down for me' the door opened but it wasn't poulter i knew that by instinct it was a rough looking customer with a black dyed moustache a diamond pin in his shirt front and a great gold chain across his vest and he carried a heavy stick in his hand 'which is the one of you two that runs this machine' he asked looking from one to the other 'i am the editor' said mr van cott 'if you mean that' 'then you air the rooster i'm after' he went on 'i am john halkett of tenth ward i want to know what in thunder you mean by printing infernal lies about me and my party in your miserable one hoss paper' he drew a copy of the paper from his pocket and held it before the editor's eyes 'you know your remedy sir' said mr van cott quietly edging in the direction of the table where there was a drawer 'that's what i do know that's what i'm here for there's two remedies one is that you retract all the lies you have printed the other' 'you need not tell me what the other is mr halkett' as he spoke he drew open the drawer but he hadn't time to take the pistol from it when the ward politician sprang upon him and in a flash of lightning they were rolling over each other among the exchanges on the floor if they had been evenly matched i should have stood around to see fair but it wasn't equal van cott you could see at first snap was grit all through and as full of fight as a game rooster but it was bulldog and terrier so i hitched on to the stranger and pulled him off by main force 'you will allow me mr van cott' i said 'to take this contract off your hands choose a back seat sir and see fair' 'sail in' cried mr halkett as cheerful as a coot 'and send for the coroner because he'll be wanted i don't care which it is' that was the toughest job i ever had the strength of ward politicians' opinions lies in their powers of bruising and john halkett as i learned afterwards could light his weight in wild cats fortunately i was no slouch in those days he met my advances halfway in ten minutes you couldn't tell halkett from me nor me from halkett the furniture moved around cheerfully and there was a lovely racket the sub editors printers and reporters came running in it was a new scene for them poor fellows and they enjoyed it accordingly the editor they had often watched in a fight before but here were two strangers worrying each other on the floor with mr van cott out of it himself dodging around cheering us on that gave novelty the sharpest of the reporters had his flimsy up in a minute and took notes of the proceedings we fought that worry through it lasted fifteen minutes we fought out of the office we fought down the stairs and we fought on the pavement when it was over i found myself arrayed in the tattered remnants of my grey coat and nothing else john halkett hadn't so much as that he was bruised and bleeding and he was deeply moved tears stood in his eyes as he grasped me by the hand 'stranger' he said 'will you tell me where you hail from' 'air you satisfied mr halkett' i replied 'with the editorial management of this newspaper' 'i am' he answered 'you bet this is the very best edited paper that ever ran good morning sir you have took the starch out of john halkett in a way that no starch ever was took out of that man before and if ever you get into a tight place you come to me' they put him in a cab and sent him home for repairs i went back to the editor's room he was going on again with his usual occupation of manufacturing squelchers the fragments of the chairs lay around him but he wrote on unmoved 'consider yourself permanently engaged' he said 'the firm will pay for a new suit of clothes why couldn't you say at once that you were fond of fighting i never saw a visitor tackled in a more lovable style why you must have been brought up to it and just to think that one might never have discovered your points if it hadn't been for the fortunate accident of john halkett's call' i said i was too modest to mention my tastes 'most fortunate it is blevins who used to do our fighting a whole team he was at it was killed three months ago on this very floor there's the mark of his fluid still on the wall we gave blevins a first class funeral and ordered a two hundred dollar monument to commemorate his virtues we were not ungrateful to blevins 'birkett came next' he went on making corrections with a pencil stump 'but he was licked like a cur three times in a fortnight people used to step in on purpose to wallop birkett it was such an easy amusement the paper was falling into disgrace so we shunted him he drives a cab now which suits him better because he was always gentlemanly in his ways 'carter who followed was very good in some respects but he wanted judgment he's in hospital with a bullet in the shoulder which comes of his own carelessness we can't take him on again any more even if he was our style which he never was' 'and who does the work now' i ventured to ask 'we have had no regular man since carter was carried off on a shutter each one does a little just as it happens to turn up but i don't like the irregular system it's quite unprofessional' i asked if there was much of that sort of thing 'depends on the time of year it is the dull season just now but we are lively enough when the fall elections come on we sometimes have a couple a day then you won't find yourself rusting and if you want work we can stir up a few editors by judicious writing i'm powerful glad we made your acquaintance mr beck' that mr dunquerque is how i became connected with the press and did you like the position it had its good points it was a situation of great responsibility people were continually turning up who disliked our method of depicting character and so the credit of the paper mainly rested on my shoulders no sir i got to like it except when i had to go into hospital for repairs and even that had its charms for i went there so often that it became a sort of home and the surgeons and nurses were like brothers and sisters but you gave up the post said jack well sir i did the occupation after all wasn't healthy and was a little too lively the staff took a pride in me too and delighted to promote freedom of discussion if things grew dull for a week or two they would scarify some ward ruffian just to bring on a fight they would hang around there to see that ward ruffian approach the office and they would struggle who should be the man to point me out as the gentleman he wished to interview they were fond of me to such an extent that they could not bear to see a week pass without a fight and i will say this of them that they were as level a lot of boys as ever destroyed a man's character most of the business was easy they came to see mr van cott and they were shown up to me what there is of me takes up a good deal of the room and when they'd put their case i used to open the door and point 'git' i would say 'you bet' was the general reply and they would go away quite satisfied with the editorial reception but one a week or so there would be a put up thing and i knew by the look of my men which would take their persuasion fighting it gradually became clear to me that if i remained much longer there would be a first class funeral with me taking a prominent part in the procesh and i began to think of digging out while i still had my hair on one morning i read an advertisement of a paper to be sold it was in the city of clearville illinois and it seemed to suit i resolved to go and look at it and apprised mr van cott of my intention 'i'm powerful sorry' he said 'but of course we can't keep you if you will go you've hoed your row like a square man ever since you came and i had hoped to have your valuable services till the end' i attempted to thank him but he held up his hand and went on thoughtfully 'there's room in our plat at rose hill cemetery for one or two more and i had made up my mind to let you have one side of the monument all to yourself the sunny side too quite the nicest nest in the plat and we'd have given you eight lines of poetry blevins only got four and none of the other fellows any i assure you beck though you may not think it i have often turned this over in my mind when you have been in hospital and i got to look on it as a settled thing and now this is how it ends life is made up of disappointments' i said it was very good of him to take such an interest in my funeral but that i had no yearning at present for rose hill cemetery and i thought it would be a pity to disturb blevins as i had never known him and the other boys they mightn't be pleased if a total stranger were sent to join their little circle mr van cott was good enough to say that they wouldn't mind it for the sake of the paper but i had my prejudices and i resigned i don't know whether you visited illinois when you were in america mr dunquerque but if you did perhaps you went to clearville it is in that part of the state which goes by the name of egypt and is so named on account of the benighted condition of the natives it wasn't a lively place to go to but still the clearville roarer was the property of a mrs scrimmager widow of the lately defunct editor she was a fresh buxom widow of thirty five with a flow of language that would down a town council or a vestry i inferred from this that the late mr scrimmager was not probably very sorry when the time came for him to pass in his checks she occupied the upper flats of a large square building in the lower part of which were the offices of the paper i inspected the premises and having found that the books and plant were pretty well what the advertisement pretended i closed the bargain at once and entered into possession the first evening i took tea with mrs scrimmager 'it must be more than a mite lonely for you' she said as we sat over her dough nuts and flipflaps 'up at the tavern but you'll soon get to know all the leading people they're a two cent lot the best of them scrimmy we always called him scrimmy for short never cottoned to them he used to say they were too low and common mean enough to shoot a man without giving him a chance a thing which scrimmy who was honourable from his boots up would have scorned to do' i asked if it was long since her husband had taken his departure 'he started' she said 'for kingdom come two months ago if that's what you mean' 'long ill' 'ill' she replied as if surprised at the question 'scrimmy never was ill in his life he was quite the wrong man for that scrimmy was killed' 'was he' i asked 'railway accident i suppose' mrs scrimmager looked at me resentfully as if she thought i really ought to have known better then she curved her upper lip in disdain 'railway accident not much scrimmy was shot' 'terrible' i ejaculated with a nervous sensation because i guessed what was coming 'well it was rough on him' she said 'scrimmy and huggins of the scalper do you know huggins well you'll meet him soon enough for your health they hadn't been friends for a long while and each man was waiting to draw a bead on the other how they did go for one another as an ink slinger huggins wasn't a patch on my husband but huggins was a trifle handier with his irons in fact huggins has shot enough men to make a small graveyard of his own and his special weakness is editors of your paper' 'i began to think that clearville was not altogether the place for peace and rest but it was too late now the lady went on 'finally scrimmy wrote something that riled huggins awful so he sent him a civil note saying that he'd bore a hole in him first chance i've got the note in my desk there that was gentlemanlike so far but he spoiled it all by the mean sneaking way he carried it through scrimmy who was wonderful careless and never would take my advice was writing in his office when huggins crept in quiet and dropped a bullet through his neck before he had time to turn scrimmy knew it was all up but he was game to the last and finished his article giving the scalper thunder when he'd done it he came upstairs and died' 'and mr huggins' 'they tried him but lord the jury were all his friends and they brought it in justifiable homicide after the funeral huggins behaved handsome he put the scalper into deep mourning and wrote a beautiful send off notice saying what a loss the community had suffered in scrimmy's untimely end i've got the article in my desk and i'll show it to you but somehow i never could bring myself to be friends with huggins after it' 'mr scrimmager was perhaps not the only editor who has fallen a victim in clearville' 'the only one not by a long chalk' she replied 'the roarer has had six editors in five years they've all been shot except one and he died of consumption his was a very sad case a deputation of leading citizens called to interview him one evening he took refuge on the roof of the office and they kept him there all night in a storm he died in two months after it but he was a poor nervous critter quite unfit for his position' 'and this' i thought 'this is the place i have chosen for a quiet life' i debated that night with myself whether it would be better to blow the roof off my head at once instead of waiting for huggins or some other citizen to do it for me but i resolved on waiting a little next day i examined the files of the roarer and found that it had been edited with great vigor and force there was gunpowder in every article fire and brimstone in every paragraph no wonder i thought that the men who wrote those things were chopped up into sausage meat i read more and it seemed as if they might as well have set themselves up as targets at once i determined on changing the tone of the paper i would no longer call people midnight assassins and highway robbers nor would i hint that political opponents were all related to suspended criminals i would make the roarer something pure noble and good i would take washington irving for my model it should be my mission to elevate the people wal sir i begun i wrote for my first number articles as elevating as kentucky whisky every sentence was richly turned every paragraph was as gentle as if from the pen of goldsmith there was a mutiny among the compositors they were unaccustomed to such language and it made them feel small one man after swearing till the atmosphere was blue laid down his stick in despair and went and got drunk and the two apprentices fought over the meaning of a sentence in the backyard one of those boys is now a cripple for life it would have been better for me a thousand times better if i had stuck to the old lines of writing the people were accustomed to that they looked for it and they didn't want any elevating if you think of it mr dunquerque people never do the clearville roughs liked to be abused too because it gave them prominence and importance but my pure style didn't suit them and as it turned out didn't suit me either the city marshal was the earliest visitor after the issue of my first number he came to say that as the chief executive officer of the town he would not be responsible for the public peace if i persevered in that inflammatory style i told him i wouldn't change it for him or anybody else then he said it would cause a riot and he washed his hands of it and he'd done his duty next came the mayor with two town councillors 'what in thunder do you think you mean young man' his honour began pointing to my last editorial 'by bringing everlasting disgrace on our town with such mush as that' he called it mush i asked him what was wrong in it 'wrong it is all wrong of all the mean and miserable twaddle' he called it miserable twaddle 'hold on mr mayor' i said 'we must discuss this article in a different way which member of your august body does the heavy business' 'we all take a hand when it's serious' he replied 'but in ordinary cases it's generally understood that i do the municipal fighting myself' 'we'll consider this an ordinary case mr mayor' i said and i went for that chief magistrate he presently passed through the window the fight had no details of interest and then the town councillors shook hands with me congratulated me on my editorial and walked out quiet through the door nearly a dozen egyptians dropped in during the afternoon to remonstrate i disposed of them in as gentlemanlike a manner as possible towards evening i was growing a little tired and thinking of shutting up for the day when my foreman whom the day's proceedings had made young again such is the effect of joy informed me that mr huggins of the scalper was coming down the street a moment later mr huggins entered he was a medium sized man with sharp piercing eyes and a well bronzed face active as a terrier and tough as a hickory knot i was sitting in the wreck of the office desk but i rose as he came in 'don't stir' he said pleasantly 'my name is huggins but i am not going to kill you to day' i said i was much obliged to him 'i see you've been receiving visitors' he went on looking at the fragments of the chairs 'ours mr beck is an active and a responsible profession' i said i thought it was 'these people have been pressing their arguments home with unseemly haste' he said 'it is unkind to treat a stranger thus now as for me i wouldn't draw on you for your first article not to be made governor of illinois it would be most unprofessional give a man a fair show i say' 'very good mr huggins' 'at the same time mr beck i do think you've laid yourself open you are reckless not to say insulting take my case you never saw me before and you've had the weakness to speak of me as the gentlemanly editor of the scalper' 'i'm sure mr huggins if the term is offensive' 'offensive of course it is offensive but as this is our first interview i must not let my dander rise' 'let it rise by all means and stay as high as it likes we may find a way of bringing it down again' 'no no' he answered smiling 'it would be unprofessional still i must say that your sneaking snivelling city way of speaking will not go down and i have looked in to tell you that it must not be repeated' 'it shall not be repeated mr huggins i shall never again make the mistake of calling you a gentleman' he started up like a flash and moved his hand to his breast pocket 'what do mean by that' i was just in time as i sprang upon and seized him by both arms before he could draw his pistol 'i mean this' i said 'you've waked up the wrong passenger this time mr huggins you needn't wriggle i've been chucking people through the window all day and you shall end the lot but first i want that shooting iron it might go off by accident and hurt some one badly' it was a long and mighty heavy contract for he was as supple as an eel and as wicked as a cat but i got the best holt at last relieved him of his pistol and tossed him through the window 'jim' i said to the foreman as i stretched myself in a corner panting and bleeding 'you can shut up we shan't do any more business to day' i issued two more numbers of the roarer on the same refined and gentlemanly principle and i fought half the county but all to no purpose neither fighting nor writing could reform those egyptians huggins shot me through the arm one evening as i was going home from the office i shall carry his mark to the grave three nights later i was waited on by about thirty leading citizens headed by the mayor they said they thought clearville wasn't agreeing with me and they were come to remove me i was removed on a plank escorted by a torch light procesh of the local fire brigade on the platform of the railway station the mayor delivered a short address he said with tears that the interests of party were above those of individuals and that a change of residence was necessary for me then he put into my hands a purse of two hundred dollars and we parted with every expression of mutual esteem that is how i came out of the land of egypt mr dunquerque and that is the whole history of my connection with the press chapter xix we do not know how she may soften at the sight o' the child if life was pleasant at carnarvon square it was far more pleasant by the banks of the river phillis expanded like a rose in june under the sweet and gracious influences with which agatha l'estrange surrounded her her straightforward way of speaking remained the way that reminded one of a very superior schoolboy who had not been made a prig at rugby but it was rounded off by something more of what we call maidenly reserve it should not be called reserve at all it is an atmosphere with which women have learned to surround themselves so that they show to the outward world like unto the haloed moon its presence was manifested in a hundred little ways she did not answer quite so readily she did not look into the face of a stranger quite so frankly she seemed to be putting herself more upon her guard strange that the chief charm of women should be a relic of barbarous times when the stronger sex were to be feared for their strength and the way in which they often used it only with jack dunquerque there was no change with him she was still the frank free hearted girl the friend who opened all her heart the maiden who alone of womankind knew not the meaning of love phillis was perfectly at home with agatha l'estrange she carolled about the house like a bird she played and sang at her sweet will she made sketches by thousands and she worked hard at the elements of all knowledge heavens by what arid and thirsty slopes do we climb the hills of learning other young ladies had made the house by the river their temporary home but none so clever none so bright none so entirely lovable as this emancipated cloister child she was not subdued as most young women somehow contrive to become she dared to have an opinion and to assert it she did not tremble and hesitate about acting before it had been ascertained that action was correct she had not the least fear of compromising herself she hardly knew the meaning of proper and improper and she who had been a close prisoner all her life was suddenly transformed into a girl as free as any of diana's nymphs her freedom was the result of her ignorance her courage was the result of her special training which had not taught her the subjection of the sex her liberty was not license because she did not and could not use it for those purposes which schoolgirls learn in religious boarding houses she could walk with a curate and often did without flirting with the holy young man she could make jack dunquerque take her for a row upon the river and think of nothing but the beauty of the scene her own exceeding pleasure and the amiable qualities of her companion of course agatha's friends called upon her among them were several specimens of the british young lady phillis watched them with much curiosity but she could not get on with them they seemed mostly to be suffering from feeble circulation of the pulse they spoke as if they enjoyed nothing those who were very young kindled into enthusiasm in talking over things which phillis knew nothing about such as dancing phillis was learning to dance but did not yet comprehend its fiercer joys and sports in which the other sex took an equal part their interest was small in painting they cared for nothing very strongly their minds seemed for the most part as languid as their bodies this life at low ebb seemed to the girl whose blood coursed freely and tingled in her veins as it ran a poor thing and she mentally rejoiced that her own education was not such as theirs on the other hand there were points in which these ladies were clearly in advance of herself phillis felt the cold ease of their manner that was beyond her efforts a formal and mannered calm was all she could assume to veil the intensity of her interest in things and persons but what do they like agatha she asked one day after the departure of two young ladies of the highest type well dear i hardly know i should say that they have no strong likings in any direction after all phillis dear those who have the fewest desires enjoy the greatest happiness no agatha i cannot think that those who want most things can enjoy the most oh that level line what can shake them off it they are happier as they are dear you have been brought up so differently that you cannot understand some day they will marry then the equable temperament in which they have been educated will stand them in good stead with their husbands and their sons phillis was silent but she was not defeated of course the young ladies did not like her at all they were unequal to the exertion of talking to a girl who thought differently from all other girls phi to them as to all people who are weak in the imaginative faculty was impossible but bit by bit the social education was being filled in and phillis was rapidly becoming ready for the debut to which agatha looked forward with so much interest and pride there remained another kind of education brought up alone with only her maid of her own age and only an old man on whom to pour out her wealth of affection this girl would but for her generous nature have grown up cold and unsympathetic she did not the first touch of womanly love which met her in her escape from prison was the kiss which agatha l'estrange dropped unthinkingly upon her cheek it was the first of many kisses not formal and unmeaning which were interchanged between these two it is difficult to explain the great and rapid change the simple caresses of another woman worked in phillis's mind she became softer more careful of what she said more thoughtful of others she tried harder to understand people she wanted to be to them all what agatha l'estrange was to her one day agatha returning from early church whither phillis would not accompany her heard her voice in the kitchen she was singing and laughing agatha opened the door and looked in phillis was standing in the middle of a group her eyes were bright with a sort of rapture her lips were parted her long hair was tossing behind her she was singing talking and laughing all in a breath in her arms she held the most wonderful thing to a woman which can be seen on this earth a baby the child of the butter woman the mother stood before phillis her pleased red face beaming with an honest pride phillis's maid antoinette and agatha's three servants surrounded these two the principal figures in the corner grinning stood the coachman and the baby crowed and laughed oh the pretty thing oh the pretty thing cried phillis tossing the little one year old who kicked and laughed and pulled at her hair was there ever such a lovely child agatha come and see come and see he talks he laughs he dances ah madame said antoinette wiping away a sympathetic tear dire que ma'amsell n'en a jamais vu mais non mais non pas memes des poupees chapter xx go seek your fortune farther than at home lawrence colquhoun returned home to find himself famous do you remember a certain book of travels written four or five years ago by lord milton and dr cheadle in which frequent mention was made of un nomme harris an inquiring and doubting christian who wore a pair of one eyed spectacles and carried a volume of paley if that harris thus made illustrious had suddenly presented himself in a london drawing room while the book was enjoying his first run he would have met with much the same success which awaited lawrence colquhoun harris let his opportunity go and never showed up perhaps he is still wandering in the rocky mountains and pondering over paley but colquhoun appeared while the work of the dragoon and the younger son was still in the mouths of men and women the liveliest thing in that book is the account of empire city and its solitary everybody whose memory can carry him back to last year's reading will remember so much and everybody who knew colquhoun knew also that he was the solitary the hermit the man with the golden butterfly now a millionaire the golden butterfly now in a golden cage all these actually present so to speak in the flesh and ready to witness if the authors lied why each was an advertisement of the book and if the two chinamen had been added probably people might be reading the work still but they poor fellows were defunct it annoyed lawrence at first to find himself like cambuscan with his tale half told and it was monotonous to be always asked whether it was really true and if he was the original hermit but everything wears off people in a week or two began to talk of something else and when colquhoun met a man for the first time after his return he would startle and confuse that man by anticipating his question he knew the outward signs of its approach he would watch for the smile the look of curiosity and the parting of the lips before they framed the usual words by the way colquhoun is it actually true that you are the hermit in jack dunquerque's book and while the questioner was forming the sentence thinking it a perfectly original one never asked before lawrence would answer it for him it is perfectly true that i was the hermit now talk of something else for the rest he dropped into his old place time matrimony good and evil hap had made havoc among his set but there was still some left club men come and club men go but the club goes on for ever colquhoun had the character of being at once the laziest and the most good natured of men a dangerous reputation because gratitude is a heavy burden to bear if you do a man a good turn he generally finds it too irksome to be grateful and so becomes your enemy but colquhoun cared little about his reputation when he disappeared his friends for a day or two wondered where he was then they ceased to talk of him now he was come back they were glad to have him among them again he was a pleasant addition he was not altered in the least his eyes as clear from crows feet his beard as silky and his face as cheerful as ever some men's faces have got no sun in them they only light up with secret joy at a friend's misfortunes but this is an artificial fire so to speak it burns with a baleful and lurid light there are others whose faces are like the weather in may being uncertain and generally disagreeable but lawrence colquhoun's face always had a cheerful brightness it came from an easy temper a good digestion a comfortable income and a kindly heart of course he made haste to find gilead p beck jack dunquerque who forgot at the time to make any mention of phillis fleming informed him of the golden butterfly's wonderful luck and they all dined together the hermit the miner the dragoon and the younger son they ran the bear hunt over again they talked of empire city and speculated on the two chinamen had they known the fate of the two their speculations might have taken a wider range it was rough on me that time said gilead it had never been so rough before since i began bumming around they waited for more and presently he began to tell them more it was the way of the man he never intruded his personal experiences being for the most part a humble and even a retiring man but when he was among men he knew he delighted in his recollections thirty three years ago since i began twelve years old the youngest of the lot and i wonder where the rest are hiram i know sat down beside a rattle one morning he remembered he had an appointment somewhere else and got up in a hurry but too late and his constitution broke up suddenly but for the rest i never did know what became of them when i go back with that almighty pile of mine they will find me out i dare say then they will bring along all their friends and the rest of the poor relations the poorer the relations in our country the more affectionate and self denying they are what did you do first asked ladds ran messages swept out stores picked up trades went handy boy to a railway engineer read what i could and when i could when i was twenty i kept a village school at a dollar a day that was in ohio i've been many things in my pilgrimage and tried to like them all but that was most too much for me boys was gells captain ladds boys themselves are bad but boys and gells mixed they air wal it's a curious and interestin' thing that ever since that time when i see the gells snoopin' around with their eyes as soft as velvet and their sweet cheeks the colour of peach i say to myself 'shoddy it is shoddy i've seen you at school and i know you better than you think' as the poet says 'let gells delight to bark and bite for 'tis their nature to' you believe mr dunquerque because you are young and inexperienced that gells air soft air they soft as the shell of a clam and tender tender as hickory nut air they gentle unselfish and yieldin' as rattlesnakes the child is mother to the woman as the poet says and school gells grow up mostly into women they're sweet to look at but when you've tended school you feel to know them and then you don't yearn after them so much there was once a boy i liked he was eighteen stood six foot high in his stocking boots and his name was pete conkling the lessons that boy taught me were useful in my after life we began it every morning at five minutes past nine any little thing set us off he might heave a desk or a row of books or the slates of the whole class at my head i might go for him first it was uncertain how it began but the fight was bound to be fought the boys expected it and it pleased the gells sometimes it took me half an hour and sometimes the whole morning to wallop that boy when it was done pete would take his place among the little gells for he never could learn anything and school would begin to see him after it was over sitting alongside of little hepzibah and keziah as meek as if he'd never heard of a black eye and never seen the human fist was one of my few joys i was fond of pete and he was fond of me ways like his gentlemen kinder creep round the heart of the lonely teacher very fond of him i grew but i got restless and dug out for another place it was when i went on the boards and became an actor i think and it was close on fifteen years afterwards that i met him then he was lying on the slopes of gettysburg it was after the last battle and his eyes were turned up to the sky one of them i noticed was black so that he had kept up his fighting to the end for he was stark dead with a confed bullet in his heart poor pete you fought for the north asked one of his audience i was a northerner he replied simply how could he help taking his part in maintaining undivided that fair realm of america which every one of his countrymen love as queen elizabeth's yeoman loved the realm of england we have no yeomen now which is perhaps one of the reasons why we could not understand the cause of the north i worried through that war without a scratch we got wary towards the end and let the bullets drop into trunks of trees for choice and when it was over i was five and thirty and had to begin the world again but i was used to it and you enjoyed a wandering life yes i believe i did enjoy barking up a new tree there's a breed of americans who can't keep still i belong to that breed we do not like to sit by a river and watch the water flow we get tired livin' in the village lookin' in each other's faces while the seasons come round like the hands of a clock there's a mixture among us of dutch and german and english to sit quiet and till the ground they get their heels well grounded in the clay and there they stick where do you get it from the wandering blood asked colquhoun gilead p beck became solemn there air folk among us he whispered who hold that we are descended from the ten tribes i don't say those folk are right but i do say that it sometimes looks powerful like as if they were descended from the ten tribes they say and miraculously kept separate from the english among whom they lived lost their own language which if it was hebrew i take it was rather a good thing to be quit of and speakin' english like the rest what were the tribes wanderers mostly father abraham went drivin' his cows and his camels up and down the country isaac went around on the rove and jacob couldn't sit still very well then didn't their children walk about tryin' one location after another for forty years and always feelin' after a bit as if there must be a softer plank farther on and when they'd be settled down for a few hundred years didn't they get up and disappear altogether mark you they didn't want to settle and where are the ten tribes now for they never went back you may look palesteen through and through and nary a tribe he looked round asking the question generally but no one ventured to answer it our folk who have mostly gut religion point to themselves they say 'look at us we air the real original wanderers' look at us all over the world what are the hotels full of full of americans we are everywhere we eat up the milk and the honey and we tramp off on ramble again but there's more points of gen'ral resemblance we like bounce and bunkum so did those people down in syria we like to pile up the dollars so did the jews they liked to set up their kings and pull them down again we pursue the same generous and confiding policy with our presidents and if they were stiff necked and backsliding we are as stiff necked and backsliding as any generation among all the lot a very good case indeed said colquhoun i did not think so sir till lately but it's been borne in upon me with the weight and force that can't be resisted and i believe it now the lost ten tribes gentlemen air now located in the united states i am certain of it from my own case do any of you think i put it to you seriously that such an inseck as the golden butterfly would have been thrown away upon an outsider it is likely that such all fired luck as mine would have been wasted on a man who didn't belong to the chosen people no sir i am of the children of israel and i freeze to that chapter xxi animum pictura pascit inani when panurge was in that dreadful difficulty of his about marrying he took counsel of all his friends pantagruel as we know advised him alternately for and against according to the view taken at the moment by his versatile dependent gilead beck was so far in panurge's position that he asked advice of all his friends mr cassilis recommended him to wait and look about him meantime he took his money for investment and as practice makes perfect and twice or thrice makes a habit he found now no difficulty in making mr beck give him cheques without asking their amount or their object while the american fortunatus easily fell into the habit of signing them without question he was a fool no doubt the race is a common one especially common is that kind of fool which is suspicious from long experience but which having found as he thinks a fellow creature worthy of trust places entire and perfect trust in him and so like a ship riding at anchor with a single stout cable laughs at danger even while the wind is blowing beam on to a lee shore perfect faith is so beautiful a thing that neither religionists who love to contemplate it nor sharpers who profit by it would willingly let it die out lawrence colquhoun recommended pictures you may as well spend your money on artists as on any other people they are on the whole a pampered folk and get much too well paid but a good picture is generally a good investment and then you will become a patron and form a gallery of your own the beck collection to hand down to posterity i can't say colonel not with truth that i know a good picture from a bad one i once tried sign painting but the figures didn't come out right somehow looked easy to do too seems i didn't know about perspective and besides the colours got mixed sign painting is not a walk in life that i should recommend from personal experience but the idea took root in his brain jack dunquerque encouraged it you see beck he said you may as well form a gallery of paintings as anything else buy modern pictures don't buy old masters because you will be cheated the modern pictures will be old in a hundred years and then your collection will be famous i want to do my work in my own lifetime said the millionaire he was a man of many ideas but few convictions the strongest being that man ought to do what he has to do in his own lifetime and not to devise and bequeath for posthumous reputation why and so you would you buy the pictures while you are living when you go off the pictures remain a patron of art the very name flattered his vanity being a thing he had read of and his imagination leaped up to the possibilities of the thing why should he not collect for his own country he saw himself like stewart returning to new york with a shipload of precious art treasures bought in london he saw his agent ransacking the studios and shops of florence naples rome dresden wherever painters congregate and pictures are sold he imagined rich argosies coming to him across the ocean the american looks across the ocean for the luxuries and graces of life his wines his art and his literature then he saw a great building grander than the capitol at washington erected by a grateful nation for the reception of the gilead p beck collection of ancient and modern paintings now one of the earliest callers upon mr beck was a certain picture dealer named burls mr burls and his fraternity regard rich americans with peculiar favour it is said to have been bartholomew burls who invented especially for american use the now well known multiplication dodge the method is this you buy a work by a rising artist one whose pictures may be at some future time but are not yet sufficiently known to make their early wanderings matter of notoriety one of your young men he must be a safe hand and a secret make two three or four copies the number depending on the area rather than the number of your clientele you keep the artist's receipt a proof of the genuineness of the picture the copies name and all are so well done that even the painter himself would be puzzled to know his own you then proceed to place your pictures at good distances from each other representing each as genuine it is a simple beautiful and lucrative method not so profitable perhaps as cleaning oil paintings which takes half an hour apiece and is charged from ten shillings to ten pounds according to the dealer's belief in your power to pay nor is it more profitable than the manufacture of a correggio or a cuyp for a guileless cotton manufacturer and there is certainly a glow of pride to be obtained by the successful conversion of a new into an old picture by the aid of mastic varnish mixed with red and yellow lake to tone it down and the simple shaking of a door mat over it but then people have grown wary and it is difficult to catch a purchaser of a correggio for which a large sum has to be asked the multiplication dodge is the simpler and the safer mr beck as has been already shown was by no means deficient in a certain kind of culture he had read such books as fell in his way during his wandering and adventurous life his reading was thus miscellaneous he had been for a short time an actor and thus acquired a little information concerning dramatic literature he had been on a newspaper one of the rank and file as well as an editor he knew a good deal about many things arts customs and trades but of one thing he was profoundly ignorant and that was of painting he looked at burls' card however bartholomew burls and co church street city inventors of the only safe and perfect method of cleaning oil paintings and accompanied by jack dunquerque who knew about as much of pictures as himself hunted up the shop and entered it with the meekness of a pigeon about to be plucked they stood amid a mass of pictures the like of which gilead beck had never before conceived they were hanging on the walls they were piled on the floor they were stretched across the ceiling they climbed the stairs they were hiding away in dark corners a gaping doorway lit with gas showed a cellar below where they were stacked in hundreds pictures of all kinds the shop was rather dark though the sun of may was pouring a flood of light even upon the narrow city streets but you could make out something there were portraits in hundreds the effigies of dead men and women stared at you from every second frame your ancestor mr burls was very particular in ascertaining beyond a doubt that it was your own ancestor and nobody else's frowned at you in bright steel armour with a vandyke beard or he presented a shaven face with full cheeks and a ramillies wig or he smirked upon you from a voluminous white scarf and a coat collar which rose to the top of his head the ladies of your family mr burls was very particular before selling you one in ascertaining beyond a doubt that she belonged to your own branch of the house and none other smiled upon you with half closed lids like the consort of potiphar the egyptian or they frisked as shepherdesses in airy robes conscious of their charms or they brandished full blown petticoats compared with which crinolines were graceful or they blushed in robes which fell tightly about the figure and left the waist beneath the arms name any knight or mayor or court beauty or famous toast among your ancestry whose portrait is wanting to your gallery and burls the great genealogical collector will find you before many weeks that missing link in the family history besides the portraits there were landscapes nymphs bathing venuses asleep venuses with a looking glass venuses of all sorts scenes from don quixote actaeons surprising dianas battle pieces sea pieces river pieces bits of hampstead heath and boats on the thames mr beck looked round him stroked his chin and addressed the guardian of this treasure house i am going to buy pictures he began comprehensively you air the boss this gentleman means jack explained that he wants to look at your pictures with a view to buying some if he approves of them the man in the shop was used to people who would buy one picture after a whole mornings haggling but he was not accustomed to people who wanted to buy pictures generally he looked astonished and then with a circular sweep of his right hand indicated that here were pictures and all mr beck had to do was to go in and buy them look round you gentlemen he said pray look round you and the more you buy the better we shall like it then he became aware that the elder speaker was an american and he suddenly changed his front our chicer pictures he explained are up stairs i should like you to look at them first will you step up gentlemen on the stairs more pictures on the landing more pictures on the stairs mounting higher more pictures but they stopped on the first floor mr burls and his assistants never invited any visitors to the second and third floors because these rooms were sacred to the manufacture of old pictures the multiplication of new and the sacred processes of cleaning lining and restoring in the first floor rooms were fewer pictures but more light one large composition immediately caught mr beck's eye a noble picture a grand picture a picture whose greatness of conception was equalled by its boldness of treatment it occupied the whole of one side of the wall and might have measured twenty feet in length by fourteen in height the subject was scriptural the slaying of sisera by jael heber the kenite's wife the defeated general lay stretched on the couch occupying a good ten feet of the available space beside him stood the woman a majestic figure with a tent peg and a mallet about to commit that famous breach of hospitality the handle of the mallet was rendered most conscientiously and had evidently been copied from a model through the open hangings of the tent were visible portions of the army chasing the fugitives and lopping off their heads that seems a striking picture said mr beck i take that picture sir to represent george washington after the news of the surrender at saratoga or general jackson after the battle of new orleans grant after gettysburg suggested jack no sir i was at gettysburg myself and the hero asleep on the bed making every allowance for his fancy dress which i take to be allegorical is not at all like general ulysses grant nor is he like general sherman the young female i s'pose is liberty with a hammer in one hand and a dagger in the other too much limb for an american gell and the flesh is redder than one could wish but on the hull a striking picture what may be the value of this composition mister i beg your pardon sir not washington sir nor general jackson though we can procure you in a very short time fine portraits of both these 'eroes this gentlemen is a biblical subject cicero overtaken by sleep while in jail about to be slain by 'eber the wife of the kenite that is 'eber with the 'eavy 'ammer in 'er 'and the kenite belonged as i have always understood for i don't remember the incident myself to the opposite faction that splendid masterpiece gentlemen has been valued at five 'undred for a town'all or for an altar piece it would be priceless to let it go at anything under five 'undred would be a sin and a shame besides a throwing away of money look at the light and shade look at 'eber's arm and cicero's leg that leg alone has been judged by connisseers worth all the money mr beck was greatly disappointed in the subject and in the price even had it been the allegorical picture which he thought he was not yet sufficiently educated in the prices of pictures to offer five hundred for it and when mr burls's assistant spoke of pounds mr beck thought dollars so he replied five hundred dollars i will give you five and twenty that interposed jack dunquerque is a five pound note then by gad sir said the man with alacrity it's yours it's been hangin' there for ten years and never an offer yet it's yours this splendid painting thus purchased at the rate of rather more than threepence a square foot was the acquisition made by mr beck towards his great gallery of ancient and modern masters he paid for it on the spot calling jack to witness the transaction we will send it up to the hotel to morrow said the man i shall have it fixed right away along the side of my room said mr beck should it be framed i should certainly have it framed said jack yes sir we shall be happy to frame it for you i dare say you would jack went on this is a job for a house carpenter mr beck you will have to build the frame for this gigantic picture have it sent over and consider the frame afterwards this course was approved but for reasons which will subsequently appear the picture never was framed the dealer proceeded to show other pictures a beautiful nicolas pushing 'nymphs and satyrs in a bacchanalian dance' a genuine thing i don't think much of that mr dunquerque do you the nymphs haven't finished dressing and the gentlemen with the goats' legs may be satires on human nature but they are not pretty let us go on to the next show in the caravan mister this is hetty in the master's best style 'graces surprised while bathing in the river' much admired by connisseers no sir not at all said mr beck severely my gallery is going to elevate the morals of our gells and boys it's a pretty thing too mr dunquerque and i sometimes think it's a pity morality was ever invented now boss quite so sir hetty is as you say rayther what do you think of this now a lovely grooze grooze said mr beck is french i suppose for gell yes now that's a real pretty picture i call that a picture you ain't ashamed to admire there's lips you can kiss there's a chin you can chuck how about the morals asked jack wal mr dunquerque we'll buy the picture first and we'll see how it rhymes with morals afterwards there's eyes to look into a man's any more heads of pretty groozes mister i'll buy the lot this is a courage oh the exhibitor went on after expressing his sorrow that he had no more groozes and bringing out a madonna thought to be genuine by the best judges history of the picture unknown redooces the value i can't go fooling around with copies in my gallery said mr beck i must have genuine pictures or none then we will not offer you that madonna sir i think i have something here to suit you come this way a teniers gentlemen a real undoubted gem of teniers this is a picture now for any gentleman's collection it came from the gallery of a nobleman lately deceased and was bought at the sale by mr burls himself who knows a picture when he sees one mr bartholomew burls our senior partner gentlemen 'the bagpipe player' it was an excellent imitation but of a well known picture and it required consummate impudence to pretend that it was original oh said jack but i have seen this somewhere else in the louvre i believe very likely sir replied the unabashed vendor teniers painted six hundred pictures there was a good many 'bagpipe players' among them one is in the louvre this is another on the advice of jack dunquerque mr beck refrained from buying and contented himself with selecting with the option of purchase when they left the shop some twenty pictures were thus selected the seller who had a small interest or commission on sales as soon as their steps were fairly out of the shop executed a short dance indicative of joy then he called up the stairs and a man came slowly down a red nosed bibulous person by name critchett he was manufacturer of old masters in ordinary to bartholomew burls and co cleaned and restored pictures when other orders were slack and was excellent at multiplication he had worked for burls for a quarter of a century save for a few weeks when one frank melliship a young gentleman then down on his luck worked in his stead a trustworthy and faithful creature though given to drink he could lie like an echo was as incapable of blushing as the rock on which the echo plays and bore cross examination like a claimant come down critchett come down we've sold 'cicero and 'eber' 'sisera and jael' well it don't matter and i said 'cicero in jail' they've gone for five pounds the governor he always said i could take whatever was offered and keep it for myself five pounds in my pocket your last teniers that old bagpipe party i tried him but it was no go but i've sold the only one left of your groozes and you had better make a few more out of hand look here critchett it isn't right to drink in hours and the guv'nor out and all but this is an occasion this ain't a common day because i've sold the cicero i won't ask you to torse nor yet to pay but i says 'critchett come across the way my boy and put your lips to what you like best' lord lord on'y give me an american and give him to me green never mind your hat critchett 'it's limp in the brim and it's gone in the rim' as the poet says and you look more respectable without it critchett that's a good beginning beck observed after luncheon they were in jack dunquerque's club in the smoking room that's a first rate beginning how many pictures go to a gallery it depends on the size of it about five hundred for a moderate sized one mr beck whistled never mind the ile pays for all a patron of art yes sir that seems the right end of the stick for a rich man to keep up but i've been thinking it over it isn't enough to go to shops and buy pictures we must go in for sculpting too and a patron ought to get hold of a struggling artist and lend him a helping hand he should advance unknown talent that's my idea i think i can help you there said jack his eyes twinkling i know just such a man an artist unknown without friends with slender means of great genius who has long languished in obscurity bring him to me mr dunquerque bring that young man to me let me be the means of pushing the young gentleman holy thunder what is money if it isn't used tell me his name i think i ought to have spoken to him first said jack in some confusion and a little taken aback by mr beck's determination but however you can only try his name is humphrey jagenal i will if you please go and see him to day and i will ask him to call upon you to morrow morning i would rather call upon him said mr beck it might look like the pride of patronage asking him to call at the langham i don't want him to start with a feeling of shame not at all at least of course it will be patronage and i believe he will prefer it there is no shame in taking a commission to execute a picture mr dunquerque every day you confer fresh obligations upon me and i can do nothing for you nothing at all at this time it was gilead beck's worst misfortune that he was not taken seriously by any one except gabriel cassilis who literally and liberally interpreted his permission to receive all his money for safe investment but as for his schemes vague and shadowy as they were for using his vast income for some practically philanthropic and benevolent objects none of his friends sympathised with him because none of them understood him yet the man was deeply in earnest he meant what he said and more when he told gabriel cassilis that a voice urged him by day and by night not to save his money but to use for others what he could not use himself he had been two months in england on purpose to learn a way but saw no way yet and every way seemed barred he would not give money to societies because they were societies he wanted to strike out something new for himself nor would he elaborate a scheme to be carried out after his death let every man he repeated every day do what he has to do in his lifetime how was he to spend his great revenues a patron of art it was the first tangible method that he had struck upon he would be that to begin with art has the great advantage too of swallowing up any conceivable quantity of money and on the way from the burls's depot of real and genuine art he hit upon the idea of advancing artists as well as art he was in thorough earnest when he raised his grave and now solemn eyes to jack dunquerque and thanked him for his kindness and jack's conscience smote him i must tell you jack explained that i have never seen any of mr humphrey jagenal's pictures miss fleming the young lady whom you met at mrs cassilis's told me once that he was a great artist bring him to me bring him to me and we will talk i hope that i may be able to speak clearly to him without hurting his feelin's if i brag about my pile mr dunquerque you just whisper 'shoddy' and i'll sing small there will be no hurting of feelings when you come to a question of buying and selling an artist is about the same as everybody else give him a big commission let him have time to work it out and send him a cheque in advance i believe that would be the method employed by patrons whom artists love at least i should love such a patron beck he went on after a pause both were seated in the long deep easy chairs of the club smoking room with the chairs pretty close together so that they could talk in low tones beck if you talk about artists there's phil i mean miss fleming by jove she only wants a little training to knock the heads off half the ras come out with me and call upon her she will show us her sketches i remember her said gilead beck slowly a tall young lady a lovely grooze as the man who grinds that picture mill would say she had large brown eyes that looked as if they could be nothing but tender and true and a rosebud mouth all sweetness and smiles and lips that trembled when she thought i remember her a head like a queen's piled up with her own brown hair and flowers an' a figure like like a mexican half caste at fourteen you talk of her as if you were in love with her said jack jealously no mr dunquerque no sir that is i may be but it won't come between you and her what i feel you air a most fortunate man go down on your knees when you get home and say so for or'nary blessin's you may use the plan of joshua mixer the man who had the biggest claim in empire city before it busted up he got his petitions and his thanksgivin's printed out neat on a card together and then he hung that card over his bed 'my sentiments' he used to say jerkin' his thumb to the card when he got in at night never omitted his prayers never forgot that jerk drunk or sober joshua mixer was the most religious man in all that camp but for special providences for ile for a lucky shot for a sweet pure heavenly gracious creature like miss fleming i say go on your knees and own to it as a man should well mr dunquerque he continued i wish you success and if there's anything i can do to promote your success let me know now there's another thing what i want to do is to unlock the door which keeps me from the society of men of genius i can get into good houses they all seem open to me because i've got money london is the most hospitable city in this wide world for those who have the stamps republican republican ain't the word for it do they ask who a man is not they they ask about his dollars and they welcome him with smiles it's a beautiful thing to look at and it makes an amer'can sigh when he thinks of his own country where they inquire into a stranger's antecedents but there's exceptions and artists and authors i cannot get to and i want to meet your great men not to interview them sir not at all they may talk a donkey's hind leg off and i wouldn't send a single line to the new york papers to tell them what was said nor what they wore but i should like just for one evening to meet and talk with the great writers whom we respect across the water again jack dunquerque's eyes began to twinkle he could not enter into the earnestness of this man and an idea occurred to him at which his face lit up with smiles it requires thinking over suppose i was to be able to get half a dozen or so of our greatest writers how should we manage to entertain them i should like if they would only come i should like to give them a dinner at the langham a square meal the very best dinner that the hotel can serve i should like to make them feel like being at the guildhall i will think about it said jack and let you know in a day or two what i can do for you chapter xxii ambition should be made of sterner stuff a patron at last cornelius said humphrey jagenal partly recovering from the shock of jack dunquerque's communication a patron patronage is after all the breath of life in art let others pander to the vitiated public taste and cater for a gaping crowd round the walls of the royal academy i would paint for a lorenzo only and so work for the highest interests of art we will call brother upon this mr beck to morrow we will said cornelius with enthusiasm it was in the studio both brothers simultaneously fired with ardour started to their feet and threw back their heads with a gesture of confidence and determination the light of high resolve flashed from their eyes which were exactly alike the half opened lips expressed their delight in the contemplation of immortal fame their chance had arrived their youth was come back to them true that gilead beck at present only proposed to become a patron to the artist but while it did not enter into humphrey's head for one moment that he could make that visit unsupported by his brother so the thought lay in either's brain that a poet wanted patronage as much as an artist they were both excited to humphrey it was clear that the contemplation of his great work in which he had basked so many years was to be changed for days of active labour no longer could he resolve to carry it into execution the day after to morrow as the arabs say this was difficult to realise but as yet the thought was like the first shock of ice cold water for it set his veins tingling and braced his nerves he felt within him once more the strength felt by every young man at first which is the strength of michael angelo he saw in imagination his great work the first of many great works finished a glorious canvas glowing with the realization of a painter's dream of colour crowded with graceful figures warm with the thought of genius and rich with the fancy of an artist scholar a work for all time and he gasped but for his beard he might have been a boy waiting for the morrow when he should receive the highest prize in the school or an undergraduate the favourite of his year after the examination looking confidently to the senior wranglership in the morning they took no walk but retired silently each to his own room in the studio the artist opened his portfolios and spread out the drawings made years ago when he was studying in rome they were good drawings there was feeling in every line but they were copies there was not one scrap of original work and his conscience began to whisper only he refused at first to listen that the skill of hand and touch was gone then conscience which gets angry if disregarded took to whispering more loudly and presently he heard he took crayon and paper and began feverishly and in haste to copy one of his old drawings he worked for a quarter of an hour and then looking at the thing he had once done beside the thing he was then doing he dashed the pencil from him and tore up the miserable replica in disgust his spirit which had flown so high sank dull and heavy as lead he threw himself back in his chair and began to think gazing hopelessly into space it was the opportunity of conscience who presently began to sing as loudly as any skylark but not so cheerfully you are fifty said that voice which seldom lies you have wasted the last twenty years of your life you have become a wind bag and a shallow humbug you cannot now paint or draw at all what little power was in you has departed your brother the poet has been steadily working while you have slept and it will be perceived that conscience spoke from imperfect information he will produce a great book and live you will die the grave will close over you and you will be forgotten it was a hard saying and the artist groaned as he listened to it in the workshop cornelius also startled into action spread out upon the table a bundle of papers which had been lying undisturbed in his desk for a dozen years or more they were poems he had written in his youth unpublished verses thoughts in rhyme such as an imaginative young man easily pours forth reproducing the fashion of the time and the thoughts of others he began to read these over again with mingled pleasure and pain for the thoughts seemed strange to him he felt that they were good and lofty thoughts but the conviction forced itself upon him that the brain which had produced them was changed no more of such good matter was left within it the lines of thought were changed the poetic faculty a delicate plant which droops unless it is watered and carefully tended was dead within him and the whole of the epic to be written not a line done not a single episode on paper though to phillis he claimed to have done so much he seized a pen and with trembling fingers and agitated brain forced himself to write in half an hour he tore the paper into shreds and with a groan threw down the pen the result was too feeble then he too began to meditate like his brother in the studio presently his guardian angel who very seldom got such a chance began to admonish him even as the dean admonishes an erring undergraduate you are fifty said the invisible censor what have you done with yourself for twenty years and more your best thoughts have passed away the poetical eye is dim you will write no more your brother the artist is busy with pencil and brain he will produce a great work and live for ever you will do nothing you will go down into the pit and be forgotten it was too much for the poet his lips trembled his hand shook he could no more rest in his chair he walked backwards and forwards the voice pursuing him wasted years wasted energies wasted gifts your chance is gone you cannot write now poets are more susceptible than artists that is the reason why cornelius rushed out of the workshop to escape this torture and sought his brother humphrey humphrey started like a guilty person his face was pale his eye was restless cornelius do not me disturb you my dear brother you are happy you are at work your soul is at peace and you cornelius i am not at peace i am restless this morning i am nervous and agitated so am i cornelius i cannot work my pencil refuses to obey my brain my own case my pen will not write what i wish the link between the brain and the nerves is for the moment severed let us go out brother it is now three we will walk slowly in the direction of the langham hotel as they put on their hats cornelius stopped and said reflectively the nervous system is a little shaken with both of us can you suggest anything brother humphrey the best thing for a shaken nervous system replied humphrey promptly is a glass of champagne i will get some champagne for you brother cornelius he returned presently with a modest pint bottle which they drank together humphrey remarking in italics that in such a case it is not a question of what a man wants so much as of what he needs a pint of champagne is not much between two men but it produced an excellent effect upon the twins before it they were downcast they looked around with the furtive eyes of conscious imposture their hands trembled after it they raised their heads laughed and looked boldly in each other's eyes assumed a gay and confident air and presently marched off arm in arm to call upon the patron gilead beck unprepared to see both brethren welcomed them with a respect almost overwhelming it was his first interview with genius they introduced each other mr beck said cornelius allow me to introduce my brother humphrey jagenal in his case the world is satisfied with the christian name alone without the ceremonial prefix he is as you know the artist if his brother had been titian or correggio he could not have said more sir said mr beck shaking humphrey's hand warmly i am proud indeed to make your acquaintance i am but a rough man myself sir but i respect genius then said humphrey with admirable presence of mind allow me to introduce my brother cornelius jagenal as you doubtless know mr beck is the poet mr beck did not know it and said so but he shook hands with cornelius none the less cordially sir i have been knocking about the world and have not read any poetry since i was a boy then i read alexander pope you know pope mr jagenal cornelius smiled as if he might allow some merit to pope though small in comparison with his own i have never met with your poem mr cornelius jagenal or your pictures mr humphrey but i hope you will now enable me to do so my brother is engaged said cornelius my brother is engaged began humphrey pardon brother sit down gentlemen will you take anything in california up country we always begin with a drink call for what you please gentlemen sail in as we say they took champagne for the second time that day and then their eyes began to glisten mr beck observed that they were both alike small and fragile looking men with bright eyes and delicate features he made a mental note to the effect that they would never advance their own fortunes he also concluded from their red noses and from the way in which they straightened their backs after placing themselves outside the champagne that they loved the goblet and habitually handled it too often now gentlemen he began after making these observations may i be allowed to talk business they both bowed genius gentlemen is apt to be careless of the main chance it don't care for the almighty dollar it lets fellows like me heap up the stamps what can we do but ask genius to dig into our pile humphrey poured out another glass of champagne for his brother and one for himself then he turned to cornelius and nodded gravely cornelius so far as i understand him mr beck speaks the strongest common sense we agree with you so far mr beck said cornelius critically because he was there to give moral support to his brother why should i have any delicacy in saying to a young man or a man of any age he added doubtfully for the years of the twins seemed uncertain 'you sir are an artist and a genius take a cheque and carry out your ideas' what reason indeed asked cornelius the offer does honour to both or to another man 'you sir are a poet why should the cares of the world interfere with your thoughts take a cheque and make the world rejoice' humphrey clapped his hands the world lies in travail for such a patron of poetry he said why then we are agreed said mr beck gentlemen i say to you both collectively let me usher into the world those works of genius which you are bound to produce you sir are painting a picture when can you finish me that picture in six months said humphrey his brain suffused with a rosy warmth of colour which made him see things in an impossibly favourable light i buy that picture sir at your own price said the patron i shall exhibit it in london and it shall then go to new york with me and you mr cornelius jagenal are engaged upon poems when would you wish to publish your verses my epic the upheaval of aelfred will be ready for publication about the end of november said cornelius humphrey felt a passing pang of jealousy as he perceived that his brother would be before the world a month in advance of himself but what is a month compared with immortality i charge myself sir if you will allow me said the american with the production of that work it shall be printed in the best style possible on the thickest paper made and illustrated by the best artist that can be found you perhaps mr humphrey jagenal it shall be bound in russian leather its exterior shall be worthy of its contents and as for business arrangements gentlemen you will please consider them at your leisure and let me know what you think we shall be sure to agree because if you will not think it shoddy in me to say so i have my pile to dig into and i shall send you if you will allow me gentlemen a small cheque each in advance they murmured assent and rose to go if you would favor me further gentlemen by dining with me say this day week i should take it as a great distinction i hope with the assistance of mr dunquerque to have a few prominent men of letters to meet you i want to have my table full of genius can we brother humphrey accept mr beck's invitation cornelius asked as if they were weeks deep in engagements as it was nobody ever asked them anywhere and they had no engagements at all humphrey consulted a pocket book with grave face we can mr beck and if you know any one else gentlemen any men of literature and art who will come too bring them along with you and i shall feel it an honour they knew no one connected with literature and art not even a printer's devil but they did not say so at twelve o'clock toward the close of this fatiguing day cornelius asked humphrey with a little hesitation if he really thought he should have finished his great work in six months art cannot be forced cornelius said the painter airily if i am not ready i shall not hesitate to consider the pledge conditional my work must be perfect ere it leaves my hands and mine too said the poet i will never consent to let a poem of mine go forth unfinished to the world the work must be polished ad unguem this is a memorable day brother the tumblers are empty allow me and cornelius i really do think that considering the way in which we have been treated by phillis fleming and her remarks about afternoon work we ought to call and let her understand the reality of our reputation we will humphrey but it is not enough to recover lost ground we must advance farther the fortress shall be made to surrender let us drink to your success brother and couple with the toast the name of phillis phillis phillis jagenal brother they drank that toast smiling unutterable things chapter xxiii call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune when jack dunquerque communicated to lawrence colquhoun the fact of having made the acquaintance of miss fleming and subsequently that of mrs l'estrange lawrence expressed no surprise and felt no suspicions probably had he felt any they would have been at once set aside because colquhoun was not a man given to calculate the future chances and to disquiet himself about possible events also at this time he was taking little interest in phillis a pretty piquante girl he devoted a whole day to her drove her to twickenham and placed her in perfect safety under the charge of his cousin what more was wanted agatha wrote to him twice a week or so and when he had time he read the letters they were all about phillis and most of them contained the assurance that he had no entanglements to fear entanglements he murmured impatiently as if a man cannot dine with a girl without falling in love with her women are always thinking that men want to be married he was forgetting after the fashion of men who have gone through the battle how hot is the fight for those who are just beginning it jack dunquerque was four and twenty he was therefore so to speak in the thick of it phillis's eyes were like two quivers filled with darts and when she turned them innocently upon her friend the enemy the darts flew straight at him and transfixed him as if he were another sebastian colquhoun's time was past he was clothed in the armour of indifference which comes with the years and he was forgetting the past still had he known of the visit to the tower of london the rowing on the river the luncheons in carnarvon square it is possible that even he might have seen the propriety of requesting jack dunquerque to keep out of danger for the future he had no plans for phillis except of the simplest kind she was to remain in charge of agatha for a year and then she would come out he hoped that she would marry well because her father had he lived would have wished it and that was all he hoped about her he had his private worries at this time those already indicated connected with victoria cassilis the ice once broken that lady allowed him no rest she wrote to him on some pretence nearly every day she sent her maid the unlovely one with three cornered notes all about nothing she made him meet her in society she made him dine with her it seemed as if she was spreading a sort of net about him through the meshes of which he could not escape with the knowledge of what had been it was an unrighteous thing for colquhoun to go to the house of gabriel cassilis he ought not to be there he felt it was the one house in all london in which he had no business and yet how to avoid it and gabriel cassilis seemed to like him evidently liked to talk to him singled him out this great financier and talked with him as if colquhoun too was interested in stock called upon him at his chambers and told him in a dry but convincing way something of his successes and his projects it was after many talks of this kind that lawrence colquhoun forgetful of the past and not remembering that of all men in the world gabriel cassilis was the last who should have charge of his money put it all in his hands with power of attorney to sell out and reinvest for him but that was nothing colquhoun was not the man to trouble about money he was safe in the hands of this great and successful capitalist he gave no thought to any risk he congratulated himself on his cleverness in persuading the financier to take the money for him and he continued to see victoria cassilis nearly every day they quarrelled when they did meet there was not a conversation between them in which she did not say something bitter and he something savage and yet he did not have the courage to refuse the invitations which were almost commands nor could she resign the sweet joys of making him feel her power a secret you see has a fatal fascination about it schoolgirls i am told are given to invent little secrets which mean nothing and to whisper them in the ears of their dearest friends to the exclusion of the rest the possession of this unknown and invaluable fact brings them together whispering and conspiring at every possible moment freemasons again how are they kept together except by the possession of secrets which are said to have been published over and over again and when two people have a secret which means all that the secret between colquhoun and mrs cassilis meant they can no more help being drawn together than the waters can cease to find their own level to be together to feel that the only other person in the world who knows that secret is with you is a kind of safety yet what did it matter to colquhoun simply nothing the secret was his as well as hers but the reasons for keeping it a secret were not his at all but hers entirely so phillis was neglected by her guardian and left to agatha and jack dunquerque with such results as we shall see so lawrence colquhoun fell into the power of this man of stocks about the mouth of whose city den the footsteps pointed all one way he congratulated himself he found out gilead beck and they congratulated each other i don't see said colquhoun who had already enough for four bachelors why one's income should not be doubled with mr cassilis said gilead beck you sign cheques and he gives you dividends it's like ile because you can go on pumping he understands more than any other living man said lawrence he is in the inner track sir said mr beck and a man said lawrence ready to take in his friends with himself a high toned and a whole souled man said gilead beck with enthusiasm that man sir i do believe would take in the hull world chapter xxiv i had rather hear a brazen candlestick turn'd or a dry wheel grate on an axle tree and that would set my teeth nothing on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry jack dunquerque repaired to the langham the day after the call on the twins with a face in which cheerful anticipation and anxiety were curiously blended he was serious with his lips but he laughed with his eyes and he spoke with a little hesitation not often observed in him i think your dinner will come off next wednesday he said and i have been getting together your party for you that is so mr dunquerque asked gilead beck with a solemnity which hardly disguised his pride and joy that is so and those great men your friends are actually coming i have seen them all personally and i put the case before each of them i said 'here is an american gentleman most anxious to make your acquaintance he has no letters of introduction to you but he is a sincere admirer of your genius he appreciates you better than any other living man' heap it up mr dunquerque said the man of oil heap it up tell them i am death on appreciation that is in substance what i did tell them then i explained that you deputed me or gave me permission to ask them to dinner 'the honour' i said 'is mutual on the one hand my friend mr gilead p beck' i ventured to say 'my friend mr gilead p beck' if you hadn't said that you should have been scalped and gouged go on mr dunquerque go on sir 'on the one hand my friend mr gilead p beck' that is so that is so 'will feel himself honoured by your company on the other hand it will be a genuine source of pleasure for you to know that you are as well known and as thoroughly appreciated on the other side of the water as you are here' i am not much of a speechmaker and i assure you that little effort cost me a good deal of thought however the end of it is all you care about most of the writing swells will come either on wednesday next or on any other day you please mr dunquerque not a day passes but you load me with obligations tell me if you please who they are well you will say i have done pretty well i think jack pulled out a paper and you will know most of the names first of all you would like to see the old philosopher of cheyne walk thomas carlyle as your guest carlyle sir is a name to conjure with in the states when i was editor of the clearville roarer i had an odd volume of carlyle and i used to quote him as long as the book lasted it perished in a fight and to think that i shall meet the man who wrote that work an account of the dinner must be written for the rockoleaville gazette we'll have a special reporter mr dunquerque we'll get a man who'll do it up to the handle jack looked at his list again what do you say of professor huxley and mr darwin mr beck shook his head these two writers began to flourish that is to be read in the states after his editorial days and he knew them not i should say they were prominent citizens likely if i knew what they'd written is professor huxley a professing christian there was a professor habukkuk huckster once down empire city way in the moody and sankey business with an interest in the organs and a percentage on the hymn books but they're not relations i suppose not probable and the other genius what is his name darwin grinds novels perhaps historical works of fiction great in genealogy is darwin never mind my ignorance mr dunquerque and go on sir i'm powerful interested ruskin is coming and i had thought of robert browning the poet but i am afraid he may not be able to be present you see browning is so much sought after by the younger men of the day they used to play polo and billiards and other frivolous things till he came into fashion with his light and graceful verse so simple that all may understand it his last poem i believe is now sung about the streets however there are tennyson and swinburne they are both coming buchanan i would ask if i knew him but i don't george eliot of course i could not invite to a stag party trollope we might get perhaps give me charles reade sir said gilead beck he is the novelist they like on our side i am afraid i could not persuade him to come though he might be pleased to see you if you would call at his house perhaps however beck the great thing is he folded up his list and placed it in his pocket book that you shall have a dinner of authors as good as any that sat down to the lord mayor's spread last year authors of all sorts and the very best none of your unknown little hungry anonymous beggars who write novels in instalments for weekly papers big men sir with big names men you'll be proud to know and they shall be asked for next wednesday that gives only four days it's terrible sudden said gilead beck he shook his head with as much gravity as if he was going to be hanged in four days then he sat down and began to write the names of his guests professor huxley he said looking up i suppose i can buy that clergyman's sermons and the universal genius who reels out the historical romances mr darwin i shall get his works too and there's mr ruskin mr robert browning what are you going to do well mr dunquerque i am going to devote the next four days from morning till night to solid preparation for that evening i shall go out right away and i shall buy every darned book those great men have written and if i sit up every night over the job i'm bound to read every word oh said jack then i advise you to begin with robert browning the light and graceful verse that everybody can understand i will said gilead beck they shall not find me unacquainted with their poems mr dunquerque for the lord's sake don't tell them it was all crammed up in four days not i but i say you know authors don't like to talk about their own books that's the modesty of real genius said the american with admiration it will be perceived that jack spoke with a certain rashness most authors i have myself known do love very much to talk about their own books that is their modesty but they will talk about each other's books and it is as well to be prepared what i'm bound to make them feel somehow is that they have a man before them who has gone in for the hull lot and survived a tough contract mr dunquerque but you trust me very well said jack putting on his hat only don't ask them questions authors don't like being questioned why i shouldn't wonder if next wednesday some of them pretended not to know the names of their own books don't you know that shakespeare when he went down to stratford to live like a retired grocer at leytonstone used to pretend not to know what a play meant and when a strolling company came round and the manager asked permission to play hamlet he was the first to sign a petition to the mayor not to allow immoral exhibitions in the borough is that so sir it may be so said jack because i never heard it contradicted as soon he was gone gilead beck sought the nearest bookseller's shop and gave an extensive order he requested to be furnished with all the works of carlyle ruskin tennyson swinburne browning buchanan huxley darwin and a few more then he returned to the langham gave orders that he was at home to no one except mr dunquerque took off his coat lit a cigar ordered more champagne and began the first of the three most awful days he ever spent in all his life the books presently came in a great box and he spread them on the table with a heart that sank at the mere contemplation of their numbers about three hundred volumes in all and only four days to get through them seventy five volumes a day say at the rate of fifteen hours' daily work five an hour one every twelve minutes he laid his watch upon the table took the first volume of robert browning that was uppermost sat down in his long chair with his feet up and began the book was fifine at the fair gilead beck read cheerfully and with great ease the first eight or ten pages then he discovered with a little annoyance that he understood nothing whatever of the author's meaning that comes of too rapid reading he said so he turned back to the beginning and began with more deliberation ten minutes clean wasted and not even half a volume got through when he had got to tenth page for the second time he questioned himself once more and found that he understood less than ever were things right could it be browning or some impostor yes the name of robert browning was on the title page also it was english and the words held together and were not sprinkled out of a pepper pot he began a third time same result he threw away his cigar and wiped his brow on which the cold dews of trouble were gathering thickly this is the beginning of the end gilead p beck he murmured the lord to try you sent his blessed ile and you've received it with a proud stomach now you air going off your head plain english and you can't take in a single sentence it was in grievous distress of mind that he sprang to his feet and began to walk about the room there was no softenin' yesterday he murmured trying to reassure himself why should there be to day softenin' comes by degrees let us try again great jehoshaphat he stood up to his work leaning against a window post and took two pages first which he read very slowly and then he dropped the volume in dismay because he understood less than nothing it was the most disheartening thing he had ever attempted i'd rather fight john halkett over again he said i'd rather sit with my finger on a trigger for a week expecting mr huggins to call upon me then he began to construe it line by line thinking every now and then that he saw daylight it is considered rather a mark of distinction a separating seal upon the brow by that poet's admirers to reverence his later works their creed is that because a poem is rough harsh ungrammatical and dark it must have a meaning as deep as its black obscurity it's like the texts of a copybook said gilead pretty things all of them separate put them together and where are they i guess this book would read better upsy down he poured cold water on his head for a quarter of an hour or so and then tried reading it aloud this was worse than any previous method because he comprehended no more of the poet's meaning and the rough hard words made his front teeth crack and fly about the room in splinters caesar's ghost he exclaimed thinking what he should do if robert browning talked as he wrote the human jaw isn't built that could stand it two hours were gone there ought to have been ten volumes got through and not ten pages finished of a single one he hurled fifine to the other end of the room and took another work by the same poet it was red cotton nightcap country and the title looked promising no doubt a light and pretty fairy story also the beginning reeled itself off with a fatal facility which allured the reader onwards when the clock struck six he was sitting among the volumes on the table with red cotton nightcap country still in his hand his eyes were bloodshot his hair was pushed in disorder about his head his cheeks were flushed his hands were trembling the nerves in his face were twitching he looked about him wildly and tried to collect his faculties then he arose and cursed robert browning he cursed him eating drinking and sleeping and then he took all his volumes and disposing them carefully in the fire place he set light to them i wish he said that i could put the poet there too i think he would have done it this mild and gentle hearted stranger so strongly was his spirit moved to wrath he could not stay any longer in the room it seemed to be haunted with ghosts of unintelligible sentences things in familiar garb which floated before his eyes and presented faces of inscrutable mystery he seized his hat and fled he went straight to jack dunquerque's club and found that hero in the reading room i have a favour to ask you he began in a hurried and nervous manner if you have not yet asked mr robert browning to the little spread next week don't certainly not if you wish it why because sir i have spent eight hours over his works jack laughed and you think you have gone off your head i'll tell you a secret everybody does at first and then we all fall into the dodge and go about pretending to understand him but the meaning mr dunquerque the meaning hush he hasn't got any only no one dares to say so and it's intellectual to admire him well mr dunquerque i guess i don't want to see that writer at my dinner anyhow very well then he shall not be asked another day like this and you may bury me with my boots on come with me somewhere and have dinner as far away from those volumes of mr browning as we can get in the time they dined at greenwich in the course of the next three days gilead beck read diligently he did not master the three hundred volumes but he got through some of the works of every writer taking them in turn the result was a glorious and inextricable mess carlyle swinburne huxley darwin tennyson and all of them were hopelessly jumbled in his brains he mixed up the sartor resartus with the missing link confounded the history of frederick the great with that of queen elizabeth and thought that maud and atalanta in calydon were written by the same poet but time went on and the wednesday evening to which he looked forward with so much anxiety and pride rapidly drew near chapter xxv why she is cold to all the world and while gilead beck was setting himself to repair in a week the defects of his early education jack dunquerque was spending his days hovering round the light of phillis's eyes the infatuated youth frequented the house as if it was his own he liked it mrs l'estrange liked it and phillis liked it agatha looked with matronly suspicion for indications and proofs of love in her ward's face she saw none because phillis was not in love at all jack to her was the first friend she made on coming out of her shell very far indeed from being in love jack looked too for any of those signs of mental agitation which accompany or are supposed to accompany the birth of love there were none her face lit up when she saw him she treated him with the frankness of a girl who tells her brother everything but she did not blush when she saw him nor was she ever otherwise than the sweetest and lightest hearted of sisters he knew it and he groaned to think of it the slightest sign would have encouraged him to speak the smallest indication that phillis felt something for him of what he felt for her would have been to him a command to tell what was in his heart but she made no sign it was jack's experience perhaps which taught him that he is a fool who gives his happiness to a woman before he has learned to divine her heart those ever make the most foolish marriages who are most ignorant of the sex hooker the judicious is a case in point and many a ghostly man could from his country parsonage tell the same tale jack was not like the judicious divine he was wary though susceptible he had his share of craft and subtlety and yet he was in love in spite of all that craft with a girl who only liked him in return had he possessed greater power of imagination he would have understood that he was expecting what was impossible you cannot get wine out of an empty bottle nor reap corn without first sowing the seed and he forgot that phillis who was unable to read novels knew nothing positively nothing of that great passion of love which makes its victims half divine it was always necessary in thinking of this girl to remember her thirteen years of captivity jack more than any other person not excepting agatha l'estrange knew what she would say and think on most things only in this matter of love he was at fault here he did not know because here he was selfish to all the world except jack and agatha she was an impossible girl she said things that no other girl would have said she thought as no one else thought to all those who live in a tight little island of their own fortified by triple batteries of dogma she was impossible but to those who accepted and comprehended the conditions of phillis's education she was possible real charming and full of interest jack continually thought what phillis would say and what she would think for her sake he noticed the little things around him the things among which we grow up unobservant we see so little for the most part things to eat and drink interest us things that please the eye fair women and rare wine we are like cattle grazing on the slopes of the alps around us rise the mountains with their ever changing marvels of light and colour the sunlight flashes from their peaks the snow slopes stretch away and upwards to the deep blues beyond in curves as graceful as the line of woman's beauty at our feet is the belt of pines perfumed and warmed by the summer air the mountain stream leaps bubbles and laughs rushing from the prison of its glacier cave high overhead soars the alpine eagle the shepherds yodel in the valleys the rapid echoes roll the song up into the immeasurable silence of the hills and amid all this we browse and feed eyes downward turned so this young man awakened by the quick sympathies of the girl he loved lifted his head taught by her and tried to catch he too something of the childlike wonder the appreciative admiration the curious enthusiasm with which she saw everything most men's thoughts are bound by the limits of their club at night and their chambers or their offices by day the suns rise and set and the outward world is unregarded jack learned from phillis to look at these unregarded things such simple pleasures as a sunset the light upon the river the wild flowers on the bank he actually tasted with delight provided that she was beside him and after a day of such arcadian joys he would return to town and find the club a thirsty desert if phillis had known anything about love she would have fallen in love with jack long before but she did not yet he made headway with her because he became almost necessary to her life she looked for his coming he brought her things he had collected in his globe trotting he told her stories of adventure he ruined himself in pictures and then he looked for the love softening of her eyes and it came not at all yet jack was a lovable sort of young man in maidens' eyes everybody liked him to begin with he was like david a youth of a cheerful if not of a ruddy countenance agatha l'estrange remarked of him that it did her good to meet cheerful young men they were so scarce i know quantities of young men phillis my dear and i assure you that most of them are enough to break a woman's heart even to think of there is the athletic young man he is dreadful indeed only his time soon goes by and there is the young man who talks about getting more brain power to be sure he generally looks as if he wants it there is the young man who ought to turn red and hot when the word prig is used there is the bad young man who keeps betting books and the miserable young man who grovels and flops in a ritualist church i know young men who are envious and backbite their friends and young men who aspire to be somebody else and young men who pose as infidels and would rather be held up to execration in a paper than not to be mentioned at all but my dear i don't know anybody who is so cheerful and contented as jack he isn't clever and learned but he doesn't want to be he isn't sharp and will never make money but he is better without it and he is true i am sure agatha unconsciously used the word in the sense which most women mean when they speak of a man's truth phillis understood it to mean that jack dunquerque did not habitually tell fibs and thought the remark superfluous but it will be observed that agatha was fighting jack's battle for him after all jack might have taken heart had he thought that all these visits and all this interest in himself were but the laying of the seed which might grow into a goodly tree if only she would look as if she cared for me tommy he bemoaned to ladds hang it can't expect a girl to begin making eyes at you eyes phillis make eyes tommy as you grow older you grow coarser it's a great pity that comes of this club life always smoking and playing cards tommy grinned virtue was as yet a flower new to jack dunquerque's buttonhole and he wore it with a pride difficult to dissemble better go and have it out with colquhoun tommy advised he won't care he's taken up with his old flame mrs cassilis again always dangling at her heels i'm told got no time to think of miss fleming great fool colquhoun always was a fool i believe might have gone after flesh and blood instead of a marble statue wonder how cassilis likes it there you go cried jack impatiently men are worse than women at twickenham one never hears this foolish sort of gossip suppose not flowers and music muffins tea and spoons well the girl's worth it jack the more flowers and music you get the better it will be for you but go on and square it with colquhoun chapter xxvi a right royal banquet at seven o'clock on the great wednesday gilead beck was pacing restlessly in his inner room the small apartment which formed his sanctum waiting to receive his guests all the preparations were complete a quartette of singers was in readiness with a piano to discourse sweet music after the dinner the noblest bouquet ever ordered at the langham was timed for a quarter to eight punctually the wine was in ice the waiters were adding the last touches to the artistic decorations of a table which laid for thirteen only might have been prepared for the prince of wales in fact when the bill came up a few days later even gilead beck man of millions quailed for a moment before its total think of the biggest bill you ever had at vefour's for francs read pounds and then multiply by ten think of the famous lord warden bill for the emperor napoleon when he landed in all his glory and then consider that the management of the langham is in no way behind that of the dover hostelry but this was to come and when it did come was received lightly gilead beck took a last look at the dinner table the few special injunctions he had given were carried out they were not many only that the shutters should be partly closed and the curtains drawn so that they might dine by artificial light that the table and the room should be entirely illuminated by wax candles save for one central light in which should be burning like the sacred flame of vesta his own rock oil he also stipulated that the flowers on the table should be disposed in shallow vessels so as to lie low and not interfere with the freedom of the eyes across the table thus there was no central tower of flowers and fruit to compensate for this he allowed a whole bower of exotics to be erected round the room the long wall opposite the window was decorated with his famous piece by an unknown master bought of bartholomew burls known as sisera and jael as the frame had not yet been made it was wreathed about for its whole length and breadth with flowers the other pictures also wreathed with flowers were genuine originals bought of the same famous collector for the end of the room gilead beck had himself designed and partly erected with his own hands an allegorical trophy from a pile of books neatly worked in cork there sprang a jet of water illuminated on either side by a hidden lamp burning rock oil he had wished to have the fountain itself of oil but was overruled by jack dunquerque above by an invisible wire hovered a golden butterfly in gilded paper and on either side hung a flag that on the right displaying the stars and stripes that on the left the equally illustrious union jack at every man's place lay a copy of the menu in green and gold elaborately decorated a masterpiece of illumination gilead beck after making quite sure that nothing was neglected took his own and retiring to the inner room read it for the fiftieth time with a pleasure as intense as that of the young author who reads his first proof sheet it consisted of a large double card on the top of the left hand side was painted in colours and gold a butterfly and that side read as follows i regret that the splendours of the original cannot be here reproduced langham hotel may dinner in honour of literature science and art given by gilead p beck an obscure american citizen raised at lexington who struck ile in a most surprising manner by the help of the golden butterfly but who despises shoddy and respects genius representatives of literature art and science thomas carlyle alfred tennyson john ruskin algernon swinburne george augustus sala charles darwin professor huxley frederick leighton ra cornelius jagenal and humphrey jagenal with captain ladds the hon ronald dunquerque and gilead p beck after this preamble which occupied a whole side of the double card followed the menu itself i unwillingly suppress this there are weaker brethren who might on reading it feel dissatisfied with the plain lamb and rhubarb tart of the sweet spring season as a present dignitary of the church now a colonial bishop once a curate observed to me many years ago a propos of thirst university reminiscences a neighbouring public house a craving for tobacco and the fear of being observed these weaker brethren are a great nuisance let it suffice that at the langham they still speak of gilead beck's great dinner with tears in their eyes i believe a copy of the green and gold card is framed and hung in the office so as to catch the eye of poorer men when they are ordering dinners it makes those of lower nature feel envious and even takes the conceit out of the nobler kind gilead beck dressed for the banquet was nervous and restless it seemed as if for the first time his wealth was about to bring him something worth having his face always grave was as solemn as if he were fixing it for his own funeral from time to time he drew a paper from his pocket and read it over then he replaced it and with lips and arms went through the action of speaking it was his speech of the evening which he had carefully written and imperfectly committed to memory like a famous american lawyer the attitude he assumed was to stand bent a little forward the feet together the left hand hanging loosely at his side while he brandished the right above his head in this attitude he was surprised by the twins who came a quarter of an hour before the time they were dressed with great care having each the sweetest little eighteenpenny bouquet bought from the little shop at the right hand of the market as you go in where the young lady makes it up before your eyes sticks the wire into it and pins it at your buttonhole with her own fair hands each brother in turn winked at her during the operation a harmless wink but it suggested no end of possible devilries should these two young gentlemen of fifty find themselves loose upon the town those who saw it thought of mohocks and praised the lord for the new police they both looked very nice they entered with a jaunty step a careless backward toss of the head parted lips and bright eyes which faced fearlessly a critical but reverent world nothing but the crow's feet showed that the first glow of youth was over nothing but a few streaks of grey in humphrey's beard and in cornelius's hair showed that they were nearing the indian summer of life mr beck seeing them enter so fresh so bright and so beaming was more than ever puzzled at their age he was waiting for them in a nervous and rather excitable state of mind as becomes one who is about to find himself face to face with the greatest men of his time you gentlemen he said will sit near me one each side if you will be so kind just to lend a helping hand to the talk when it flags phew it will be a rasper the talk of to day i've read all their works if i can only remember them and i bought the history of english literature yesterday to get a grip of the hull subject no use i haven't got farther than chaucer do you think they can talk about chaucer he wrote the canterbury tales cornelius said humphrey you will be able to lead the conversation to the anglo saxon period that period is too early brother humphrey said cornelius we shall trust to you to turn the steam in the direction of the renaissance humphrey shifted in his seat uneasily why this unwillingness in either twin to assume the lead on a topic which had engaged his attention for twenty years mr beck shook his head i most wish now he said that i hadn't asked them but it's a thundering great honour mr dunquerque did it all for me that young gentleman met these great writers i suppose in the baronial halls of his brother the earl of isleworth do we know lord isleworth asked cornelius of humphrey lord isleworth cornelius no i rather think we have never met him said humphrey to cornelius none of your small names to night said gilead beck with serious and even pious joy the lord mayor may have them at guildhall mine are the big guns i did want to get a special report for my own gazette but mr dunquerque thought it better not to have it p'r'aps 'twould have seemed kind o' shoddy i ought to be satisfied with the private honour and not want the public glory of it what would they say in boston if they knew or even in new york you should have a dinner for poets alone said humphrey anxious for his brother or for artists only said cornelius wal gentlemen we shall get on as there's five minutes to spare would you like to give an opinion on the wine list and oblige me by your advice the twins perused the latter document with sparkling eyes it was a noble list gilead beck's plan was simple he just ordered the best of everything for sauterne he read chateau iquem for burgundy he took chambertin for claret chateau lafite for champagne heidsieck for sherry montilla a box boutel wine for hock and for port the ' never before in all its experiences of americans russians and returned colonials had the management of the langham so thorough a wine bill to make out as for this dinner is that satisfactory gentlemen cornelius what do you think humphrey i think as you do and that is that this princely selection shows mr beck's true appreciation of literature and art it is kind of you gentlemen to say so i talked over the dinner with the chef and i have had the menou printed as you see it in gilt and colours which i am given to understand is the correct thing at the guildhall would you like to look at that they showed the greatest desire to look at it humphrey read it aloud with emphasis while he read and while his brother listened mr beck thought they seemed a good deal older than before perhaps that was before their faces were turned to the light and the reflection through an open window of the sinking sun showed up the crow's feet round their eyes humph plovers' eggs clear mulligatawny clear cornelius turtle fins salmon i translate the french turbot lochleven trout very good indeed so far said cornelius with a palpable smack of his lips lamb cutlets with peas a simple but excellent dish aspic of foie gras ah two or three things which i cannot translate a preparation of pigeon haunch of venison yes an excellent dinner indeed said cornelius pray go on humphrey he began to feel like sancho in barataria so good a dinner seemed really impossible duckling cabob curry of chicken liver with bombay ducks really mr beck this dinner is worth a dukedom it is indeed said cornelius feelingly canvas back ah from baltimore cornelius this is almost too much apricots in jelly ice pudding grated parmesan strawberries melons peaches nectarines and only may cornelius pines west india bananas custard apples from jamaica and dried litchis from china cornelius humphrey handed the document to his brother with a look of appeal which said volumes one sentence in the volumes was clearly say something appropriate quoth cornelius deeply moved this new maecenas ransacks the corners of the earth to find a fitting entertainment for men of genius humphrey you shall paint him cornelius you shall sing his praises by a simultaneous impulse the twins turned to their patron and presented each a right hand gilead beck had only one right hand to give he gave that to cornelius and the left to humphrey while this sacrament of friendship was proceeding was heard a sound as of many men simultaneously stifling much laughter the door opened and the other guests arrived in a body they were preceded by jack dunquerque and on entering the room dropped as if by word of command into line like soldiers on parade eight of them were strangers but captain ladds brought up the rear they were as might be expected of such great men a remarkable assemblage at the extreme right stood a tall well set up old man with tangled grey locks long grey eye brows and an immense grey beard his vigorous bearing belied the look of age and what part of his face could be seen had a remarkably youthful appearance next to him were other two aged men one of whom was bent and bowed by the weight of years they also had large eyebrows and long grey beards and mr beck remarked at once that so far as could be judged from the brightness of their eyes they had wonderfully preserved their mental strength the others were younger men one of them being apparently a boy of eighteen or so then followed a ceremony like a levee gilead beck stood in the centre of the room the table having been pushed back into the corner he was supported right and left by the twins who formed a kind of court and above whom he towered grandly with his height of six feet two he held himself as erect and looked as solemn as if he were the president of the united states the twins for their part looked a little as if they were his sons jack dunquerque acted as lord chamberlain or master of the ceremonies he wore an anxious face and looked round among the great men whom he preceded as soon as they had all filed in with a glance which might have meant admonition had that been possible and indeed a broad smile which was hovering like the sunlight upon their venerable faces disappeared at the frown of this young gentleman it was very curious it was in the grand manner that peculiar to courts in which jack dunquerque presented the first of the distinguished guests to mr beck sir he said with low and awe struck voice before you stands thomas carlyle a thrill ran through the american's veins as he grasped the hand which had written so many splendid things and looked into the eyes which harboured such splendid thought then he said in softened tones because his soul was moved this is a proud moment sir for gilead p beck i never thought to have shaken by the hand the author of the french revolution and the stones of venice it really was unfortunate that his reading had been so miscellaneous during the four days preceding the dinner the venerable philosopher opened his mouth and spake his tones were deep and his utterance slow you are proud mr beck the only pride should be the pride of work beautiful the meanest thing that works even the rusty and unmusical meatjack all else belongs to the outlook of him whom men call beelzebub the brief day passes with its poor paper crowns in tinsel gilt night is at hand with her silences and her veracities what hast thou done all the rest is phantasmal work only remains say brother what is thy work i have struck ile replied gilead proudly feeling that his work with a capital w had been well and thoroughly done the philosopher stepped aside jack dunquerque brought up the next mr beck alfred tennyson the poet laureate this time it was a man with robust frame and strongly marked features he wore a long black beard streaked with grey and rather ragged with a ragged mass of black hair looking as he did at oxford when they made him an honorary dcl and an undergraduate from the gallery asked him politely did they wake and call you early mr tennyson said mr beck i do assure you sir that this is the kindest thing that has been done to me since i came to england i hope i see you well sir i read your fifine at the fair sir no that was the other man's i mean sir your songs before sunrise and i congratulate you we've got some poets on our side of the water sir i've written poetry myself for the papers we've got longfellow and lowell and take out you and mr swinburne with them we'll meet your lot mr tennyson opened his mouth to speak but shut it again in silence and looking at jack mournfully as if he had forgotten something he stepped aside jack presented another mr john ruskin a sharp featured clever looking man with grey locks and shaven face he seized mr beck by the hand and spoke first not giving his host time to utter his little set speech i welcome he said one of our fellow workers from the other side of the atlantic i cannot utter to you what i would we all see too dimly as yet what are our great world duties for we try and outline their enlarging shadows you in america do not seek peace as menahem sought it when he gave the king of assyria a thousand pieces of silver you fight for your peace and have it you do not buy what you want you take it that is strength that is harmony you do not sit at home lisping comfortable prayers you go out and work for many a year to come sir the sword of your nation shall be whetted to save and to subdue he stopped suddenly and closed his lips with a snap mr beck turned rather helplessly to the twins he wanted a diversion to this utterly unintelligible harangue they stared straight before them and pretended to be absorbed in meditation mr beck mr swinburne deaf people think mr browning is musical sir but all people allow mr swinburne to be the most musical of poets it was the very young man he stood before his host and laughed aloud sir said mr beck i have read some of your verses i can't say what they were about but i took to singin' them softly as i read them and i seemed to be in a green field lyin' out among the flowers while the bees were bummin' around and the larks were liftin' their hymns in the sky mr swinburne laughed again and made way for the next comer mr beck let me introduce mr george augustus sala this said the man of oil is indeed a pleasure mr sala when i say that i am an old and personal friend of colonel quagg you will be glad to meet me contrary to reasonable expectation the face of mr sala showed no sign of joy at the reminiscence he only looked rather helplessly at jack dunquerque who turned red and brought up the rest of his men together as if to get the introductions over quickly mr beck these gentlemen are mr darwin professor huxley and mr frederick leighton ladds you know well enough already step up tommy gilead beck shook hands with each and then drawing himself up to his full height laid his left hand within his waistcoat brandished his right above his head with a preliminary flourish and began his speech gentlemen all he said i am more than proud to make your acquaintance across the foaming waves of the mighty atlantic there is a land whose institootions known to mr sala air not unlike your own whose literature is your own up to a hundred years ago hear hear from cornelius whose language is the same as yours we say hard things of each other gentlemen but the hard things are said on the low levels not on the heights where you and your kindred spirits dwell no gentlemen here he raised both arms and prepared for a rhetorical burst when the american eagle proudly bearing the stars and stripes dinner on the table sir bawled the head waiter throwing open the doors with the grandest flourish and standing in the open doorway hear hear cried humphrey a little late because he meant the cheer for the speech and it sounded like a joy bell ringing for the announcement of dinner mr beck thought it rather rude but he did not say so and vented his wrath upon the waiter great jehoshaphat he cried can't you see when a gentleman is on the stump who the devil asked you to shove in never mind said jack irreverently spout the rest after dinner a sigh of relief escaped the lips of all and the party headed after some demur by the host who was escorted one on each side like a great man with his private secretary by the twins passed into the dining room oddly enough when their host passed on before them the guests turned to each other and the same extraordinary smile which jack dunquerque checked on their first appearance passed from one to the other why should alfred tennyson look in the face of thomas carlyle and laugh what secret relationship is there between john ruskin swinburne and george augustus sala that they should snigger and grin on catching each other's eyes and if one is to go on asking questions why did jack dunquerque whisper in an agitated tone for heaven's sake tom and you fellows keep it up there was some little difficulty in seating the guests because they all showed a bashful reluctance to sitting near their host and crowded together to the lower end at last however they were settled down mr carlyle who with a modesty worthy of his great name seized the lowest chair of all on the left of jack dunquerque who was to occupy the end of the table was promptly dragged out and forcibly led to the right of the host facing him was alfred tennyson the twins one on each side came next mr sala faced john ruskin the others disposed themselves as they pleased a little awkwardness was caused at the outset by the host who firm in the belief that professor huxley was in the moody and sankey line called upon him to say grace the invitation was warmly seconded by all the rest but the professor greatly confused blushed and after a few moments of reflection was fain to own that he knew no grace it was a strange confession gilead beck thought for a clergyman the singers however miss claribelle signors altotenoro bassoprofondo and mr plantagenet simpkins performed non nobis with great feeling and power and dinner began it was then that gilead beck first conceived against his will suspicion of the twins so far from being the backbone and stay of the whole party so far from giving a lead to the conversation and leading up to the topics loved by the guests they gave themselves unreservedly and from the very first to tucking in they went at the dinner with the go of a rugby boy a young gentleman of eton very soon teaches himself that the stomach is not to be trifled with so did the rest considering the overwhelming amount of genius at the table and the number of years represented by the guests collectively it was really wonderful to contemplate the vigour with which all including the octogenarian attacked the courses sparing none could it have been believed by an outsider that the author of maud was so passionately critical over the wine it is sad to be disillusioned but pleasant on the other hand to think that you are no longer an outsider individually the party would have disappointed their host but he did not allow himself to be disappointed mr beck expected a battery of wit he heard nothing but laudation of the wine and remarks upon the cookery no anecdotes no criticism no literary talk no poetical enthusiasm in my country sir he began glancing reproachfully at the twins whose noses were over their plates and feeling his way feebly to a conversation with carlyle in my country sir i hope we know how to appreciate what we cannot do ourselves mr carlyle stared for a moment then he replied hope you do mr beck i'm sure didn't know you'd got so good a chef at the langham this was disheartening and for a space no one spoke presently mr carlyle looked round the table as if he was about to make an utterance humphrey jagenal who happened at the moment to have nothing before him raised his hand and said solemnly hush cornelius bent forward in an attitude of respectful attention said the teacher clear mulligatawny's about the best thing i know to begin a dinner upon some fellows like palestine soup that's a mistake the greatest minds said cornelius to the poet laureate condescend to the meanest things 'gad said tennyson if you call such a dinner as this mean i wonder what you'd call respectable cornelius felt snubbed but he presently rallied and went on again it was between the courses pray mr carlyle he asked with the sweetest smile what was the favourite soup of herr teufelsdroeckh who asked the philosopher beg your pardon herr how much from your own work mr carlyle jack sang out from his end it was remarkable to notice how anxiously he followed the conversation oh ah quite so said mr carlyle well you see the fact is that jack dunquerque knows this was disconcerting too and the more because everybody began to laugh what did they laugh at the dinner went on gilead beck silent and grave sat at the head of the table watching his guests he ought he said to himself to be a proud man that day but there were one or two crumpled rose leaves in his bed one thing was that he could not for the life of him remember each man's works so as to address him in honeyed tones of adulation and he also rightly judged that the higher a man's position in the world of letters the more you must pile up the praise no doubt the lamented george the fourth the fourteenth louis and john stuart mill grew at last to believe in the worth of the praise painting which surrounded their names and then the twins were provoking only one attempt on the part of cornelius at which everybody laughed and nothing at all from humphrey carlyle and tennyson for their part sat perfectly silent lower down below the twins that is sala huxley and the others were conversing freely but in a low tone and when gilead beck caught a few words it seemed to him as if they talked of horse racing presently to his relief john ruskin leaned forward and spoke to him i have been studying lately mr beck the art growth of america is that so sir and perhaps you have got something to tell my countrymen perhaps mr beck you doubtless know my principle that art should interpret not create you also know that i have preached all my life the doctrine that where art is followed for art's own sake there infallibly ensues a distinction of intellectual and moral principles while devoted honestly and self forgetfully to the clear statement and record of the facts of the universe art is always helpful and beneficial to mankind so much you know mr beck i'm sure well sir if you would not mind saying that over again slow i might be able to say i know it i have sometimes gone on to say pursued mr ruskin that a time has always hitherto come when having reached a singular perfection art begins to contemplate that perfection and to deduce rules from it now all this has nothing to do with the relations between art and mental development in the united states of america i am glad to hear that sir said gilead beck a little relieved he looked for help to the twins but he leaned upon a slender reed for they were both engaged upon the duckling and proffered no help at all they did not even seem to listen the dinner was far advanced their cheeks were red and their eyes were sparkling what is it all about mr carlyle murmured across the table to tennyson don't know replied the maker didn't think he had it in him could these two great men be jealous of mr ruskin's fame your remarks mr ruskin said the host sound very pretty but i should like to have them before me in black and white so i could tackle them quietly for an hour then i'd tell you what i think i was reading last week all your works all my works in a week cried ruskin sir my works require loving thought and lingering tender care you must get up early in the morning with them you must watch the drapery of the clouds at sunrise when you read them you must take them into the fields at spring time and mark as you meditate on the words of the printed page the young leaflets breathing low in the sunshine then as the thoughts grow and glow in the pure ether of your mind hock if you please you will rise above the things of the earth your wings will expand you will care for nothing of the mean and practical i will take a little more duckling your faculties will be woven into a cunning subordination with the wondrous works of nature and all will be beautiful alike from a blade of grass to a south american forest there are very good forests in the sierra nevada said mr beck who had just understood the last words we needn't go to south america for forests i guess that mr beck is what you will get from a study of my works but a week a week mr beck he shook his head with a whole library of reproach my time was limited mr ruskin and i hope to go through your books with more study now i have had the pleasure of meeting you what i was going to say was that i am sorry not to be able to talk with you gentlemen on the subjects you like best because things have got mixed and i find i can't rightly remember who wrote what thank goodness murmured mr tennyson under his breath presently the diners began to thaw and something like general conversation set in about the grated parmesan period mr beck observed with satisfaction that they were all talking together the twins were the loudest with flushed faces and bright eyes they were laying down the law to their neighbours in poetry and art cornelius gave mr tennyson some home truths on his later style which the poet laureate received without so much as an attempt to defend himself humphrey from the depth of his roman experiences treated mr ruskin to a brief treatise on his imperfections as a critic and mr leighton to some remarks on his paintings which those great men heard with a polite stare gilead beck observed also that jack dunquerque was trying hard to keep the talk in literary grooves though with small measure of success for as the dinner went on the conversation resolved itself into a general discussion on horses events aldershot prince's polo the drama from its lightest point of view and such topics as might perhaps be looked for at a regimental mess but hardly at a dinner of literature it was strange that the two greatest men among them all carlyle and tennyson appeared as interested as any in this light talk the twins were out of it altogether if there was one thing about which they were absolutely ignorant it was the turf probably they had never seen a race in their lives they talked fast and a little at random but chiefly to each other because no one mr beck observed took any notice of what they said also they drank continuously and their host remarked that to the flushed cheeks and the bright eyes was rapidly being added thickness of speech mr beck rose solemnly at the right moment and asked his guests to allow him two or three toasts only the first he said was england and america ile he said briefly had not yet been found in the old country and so far she was behind america but she did her best she bought what she could not dig by special request of the host mademoiselle claribelle sang old john brown lies a mouldering in his grave the next toast mr beck said was one due to the peculiar position of himself he would not waste their time in telling his own story but he would only say that until the golden butterfly brought him to limerick city and showed him ile he was but a poor galoot therefore he asked them to join him in a sentiment he would give them more ile signor altotenoro an englishman who had adopted an italian name sang the light of other days then mr beck rose for the third time and begged the indulgence of his friends he spoke slowly and with a certain sadness i am not he said going to orate you did not come here i guess to hear me pay out chin music not at all you came to do honour to an american gentlemen i am an obscure american i am half educated i am a man lifted out of the ranks in our country and i think in yours as well though some of you have got handles to your names that is not a thing to apologise for no gentlemen i only mention it because it does me the greater honour to have received you but i can read and i can think i see here to night some of the most honoured names in england and i can tell you all what i was goin' to say before dinner only the misbegotten cuss of a waiter took the words out of my mouth that i feel this kindness greatly and i shall never forget it i did think gentlemen that you would have been too many for me in the matter of tall talk but exceptin' mr ruskin to whom i am grateful for his beautiful language though it didn't all get in not one of you has made me feel my own uneducated ignorance that is kind of you and i thank you for it it was true feeling mr carlyle which prompted you sir to give the conversation such a turn that i might join in without bein' ashamed or makin' myself feel or'nary gentlemen what a man like me has to guard against is shoddy if i talk literature it's shoddy if i talk art it's shoddy because i know neither literature nor art if i pretend to be what i am not it's shoddy therefore gentlemen i thank you for leavin' the tall talk at home and tellin' me about your races and your amusements and i'll not ask you either to make any speeches but if you'll allow me i will drink your healths mr carlyle sir the english speaking race is proud of you mr tennyson our gells i'm told love your poems more than any others in this wide world what an american gell loves is generally worth lovin' because she's no fool mr ruskin if you'd come across the water you might learn a wrinkle yet in the matter of plain speech mr sala we know you already over thar and i shall be glad to tell the reverend colonel quagg of your welfare when i see him mr swinburne you air young but you air getting on professor huxley and mr darwin i shall read your sermons and your novels and i shall be proud to have seen you at my table mr cornelius and mr humphrey jagenal i would drink your healths too if you were not sound asleep this was unfortunately the case the twins having succumbed to the mixture and quantity of the drinks almost before the wine went round once were now leaning back in their chairs slumbering with the sweetest of smiles captain ladds you know sir that you are always welcome mr dunquerque you have done me another favour gentlemen all i drink your health jack whispered mr swinburne i call this a burning shame he's a rattling good fellow this and you must tell him i will some time not now said jack looking remorseful i haven't the heart i thought he would have found us out long ago i wonder how he'll take it they had coffee and cigars and presently gilead beck began telling about american trotting matches which was interesting to everybody it was nearly twelve when mr beck's guests departed mr carlyle in right of his seniority solemnly up and spake mr beck he said you are a trump come down to the derby with me and we will show you a race worth twenty of your trotting good night sir you've treated us like a prince he grasped his hand with a grip which had all its youthful vigour and strode out of the room with the step of early manhood a wonderful man said mr beck who would have thought it the rest shook hands in silence except mr ruskin i am sorry mr beck he said meekly that the nonsense i talked at dinner annoyed you it's always the way if a fellow tries to be clever he overdoes it and makes himself an ass good night sir and i hope we shall meet on the racecourse next wednesday mr beck was left alone with jack dunquerque the waiter and the twins still sleeping what am i to do with these gentlemen sir asked the waiter mr beck looked at them with a little disdain get john and yank them both to bed and leave a brandy and soda at their elbows in case they're thirsty in the night mr dunquerque and captain ladds don't go yet let us have a cigar together in the little room they sat in silence for a while then jack said with a good deal of hesitation i've got something to tell you beck then don't tell it to night replied the american i'm thinking over the evening and i can't get out of my mind that i might have made a better speech seems as if i wasn't nigh grateful enough wal it's done mr dunquerque there is one thing which pleases me great authors are like the rest of us they are powerful fond of racing they shoot they ride and they hunt they know how to tackle a dinner and all of 'em from carlyle to young mr swinburne seem to love the gells alike that's a healthy sign sir it shows that their hearts air in the right place the world's bound to go on well somehow so long as its leaders like to talk of a pretty woman's eyes because it's human and then for me to hear these great men actually doing it why captain ladds it adds six inches to my stature to feel sure that they like what i like and that after all said and done alfred tennyson and gilead p beck are men and brothers chapter xxvii greater humanity the world largely as it had unfolded itself to phillis consisted as yet to her wholly of the easy classes that there were poor people in the country was a matter of hearsay that is she had caught a glimpse during a certain walk with caesar of a class whose ways were clearly not her ways nor their manner of thought hers she had now to learn as a step to that wider sympathy first awakened by the butter woman's baby that there is a kind of folk who are more dangerous than picturesque to be pitied rather than to be painted to be schooled and disciplined rather than to be looked at she learned this lesson through mrs l'estrange whose laudable custom it was to pay periodical visits to a certain row of cottages they were not nice cottages but nasty they faced an unrelenting ditch noisome green and putrid they were slatternly and out at elbows the people who lived in them were unpleasant to look at or to think of the men belonged to the riverside they were boat cads and touts and if there is any one pursuit more demoralising than another it is that of launching boats into the river handing the oars and helping out the crew in the daytime the cottages were in the hands of the wives towards nightfall the men returned those who had money enough were drunk those who were sober envied those who were drunk both drunk and sober found scolding wives squalid homes and crying children both drunk and sober lay down with curses and slept till the morning when they awoke and went forth again with the jocund curse of dawn nothing so beautiful as the civilisation of the period half a mile from agatha l'estrange and phillis fleming were these cottages almost within earshot of a house where vice was unknown or only dimly seen like a ghost at twilight stood the hovels where virtue was impossible and goodness a dream of an unknown land what notion do they have of the gentle life these dwellers in misery and squalor what fond ideas of wealth's power to procure unlimited gratification for the throat do they conceive these men and women whose only pleasure is to drink beer till they drop one day phillis went there with agatha it was such a bright warm morning the river was so sparkling the skies were so blue the gardens were so sunny the song of the birds so loud the laburnums so golden and the lilacs so glorious to behold that the girl's heart was full of all the sweet thoughts which she had learned of others or framed for herself thoughts of poets which echoed in her brain and flowed down the current of her thoughts like the swans upon the river happy thoughts of youth and innocence she walked beside her companion with light and elastic tread she looked about her with the fresh unconscious grace that belongs to childhood it was her greatest charm but the contentment of her soul was rudely shaken the beauty went out of the day when mrs l'estrange only led her away from the leafy road and took her into her row there the long arms of the green trees were changed into protruding sticks on which linen was hanging out to dry the songs of the birds became the cry of children and the scolding of women for flowers there was the iridescence on the puddles of soap suds for greenhouse were dirty windows and open doors which looked into squalid interiors i am going to see old mr medlicott said mrs l'estrange cheerfully picking her accustomed way among the cabbage stalks wash tubs and other evidences of human habitation the women looked out of their houses and retired hastily presently they came out again and stood every one at her door with a clean apron on each prepared to lie like an ambassador for the good of the family in a great chair by a fire there sat an old woman a malignant old woman she looked up and scowled at the ladies then she looked at the fire and scowled then she pointed to the corner and scowled again look at him she growled in a hoarse crescendo look at him lying like a pig like a pig do you hear i hear the voice came from what phillis took at first to be a heap of rags she was right because she could not see beneath the rags the supine form of a man mrs l'estrange took no notice of the old woman's introduction to the human pig that phenomenon repeated his answer i hear i'm her beloved grandson ladies i'm jack in the water get up and work go down to your river comes home and lies down he does yah ye lazy pig says he's goin' to have the horrors he does yah ye drunken pig prigs my money for drink yah ye thievin' pig get up and go out of the place leave me and the ladies to talk go i say jack in the water arose slowly he was a long legged creature with shaky limbs and when he stood upright his head nearly touched the rafters of the low unceiled room and he had a face at sight of which phillis shuddered an animal face with no forehead a cruel bad selfish face all jowl and no front his eyes were bloodshot and his lips were thick he twitched and trembled all over his legs trembled his hands trembled his cheeks twitched 'orrors he said in a husky voice and should ha' had the 'orrors if i hadn't a took the money two and tuppence he pushed past phillis who shrank in alarm and disappeared well mrs medlicott and how are we asked mrs l'estrange in a cheerful voice she took no manner of notice of the man worse what have you got for me money i want money flannel i want flannel physic i want physic brandy i want brandy very bad i never wanted it so bad what have you got gimme brandy and you shall read me a tract you forget said agatha that i never read to you let the young lady read then come here missy lord lord don'tee be afraid of an old woman as has got no teeth come now gimme your hand ay ay ay eh eh eh here's a pretty little hand now mrs medlicott you said you would not do that any more you know it is all foolish wickedness foolish wickedness echoed the witch of endor never after to day my lady come my pretty lass take off the glove and gimme the hand without knowing what she did phillis drew off the glove from her left hand the old woman leaned forward in her chair and looked at the lines she was a fierce and eager old woman life was strong in her yet despite her fourscore years her eyes were bright and fiery her toothless gums chattered without speaking her long lean fingers shook as they seized on the girl's dainty palm ay ah eh eh the line of life is long a silent childhood a love knot hindered go on girl go on wife and mother happy life and happy age but far away not here far away a lucky lot with him you love to sleep by his side for fifty years and more to see your children and your grandchildren to watch the sun rise and set from your door a happy life but far away she dropped the girl's hand as quickly as she had seized it and fell back in her chair mumbling and moaning gimme brandy mrs l'estrange you are a charitable woman gimme brandy and port wine ah lemme have some port wine tea don't forget the tea and jack in the water drinks awful he does worse than his father worse than his grandfather and they all went off at five and thirty i will send you up a basket mrs medlicott come phillis i have got to go to the next cottage but phillis stayed behind a moment she touched the old woman on the forehead with her fingers and said softly tell me are you happy do you suffer happy only the rich are happy suffer of course i suffer all the pore suffers poor thing may i come and see you and bring you things of course you may and you will tell me about yourself child child cried the old woman impatiently tell you about myself there there you're one of them the lord loves wife and mother happy life and happy death childer and grandchilder but far away far away mrs medlicott gave phillis her first insight into that life so near and yet so distant from us she should have been introduced to the ideal cottage where the stalwart husband supports the smiling wife and both do honour to the intellectual curate with the long coat and the lofty brow where are they lofty brow of priest and stalwart form of virtuous peasant remark that phillis was a child the first effect of the years upon a child is to sadden it philemon and baucis in their cot would have rejoiced her that of old mrs medlicott set her thinking and while she drew from memory the old fortune teller in her cottage certain words of abraham dyson's came back to her life is a joy to one and a burden to ninety nine remember in your joy as many as you can of the ninety nine learn that you cannot be entirely happy because of the ninety nine who are entirely wretched when you reach this knowledge phillis be sure that the coping stone is not far off chapter xxviii non possidentem multa vocaveris recte beatum the manner in which mr cassilis conveyed his advice or rather instructions to gilead beck inspired the american with a blind confidence he spoke slowly grimly and with deliberation he spoke as one who knew most men speak as those who only half know like the frenchman who said ce que je sais je le sais mal ce que j'ignore je l'ignore parfaitement mr cassilis weighed each word while he spoke his eyes sought those of his friend and looked straight in them not defiantly but meditatively he brought mr beck bills which he made him accept and he brought prospectuses in which the american finding they were english schemes invested money at his adviser's suggestion you have now said mr cassilis a very large sum invested in different companies you must consider now how long to hold the shares when to sell out in fact can't i sell my shares at once if i please you certainly can and so ruin the companies consider my undertaking to my friends on the allotment committees yes sir you forget mr beck that you are a wealthy man we do not manage matters in a hole and corner the bears have sold on expectation of an allotment now as they have not got an allotment and we have they must buy when such men as you buy largely the effect is to run shares up when you sell largely you run them down mr cassilis did not explain that he had himself greatly profited by this tidal influence and proposed to profit still more many companies perfectly sound in principle may be ruined by a sudden decrease in the price of shares a panic sets in and in a few hours the shareholders may lose all and if you bring this about by selling without concert with the other favoured allottees you'll be called a black sheep mr beck hesitated it's a hard thing he began his adviser went on you have thus two things to think of not to lose your own profit and not to spread disaster over a number of other people by the very magnitude of your transactions this was a new light to gilead then why sell at all why not keep the shares and secure the dividend it's a hard hank all this money and this was a new light for the financier hold the shares when they were scores of them at premium you can certainly do that if you please he said slowly that however puts you in the simple position of investor i thought i was that mr cassilis not at all mr beck the wise man distrusts all companies but puts his hope in a rise or fall you are not conversant with the way business is done a company is formed the a b c let us say before any allotment of shares is made influential brokers acting in the interest of the promoters go on to the stock exchange and make a market how is that sir they purchase as many shares as they can get persons technically called 'bears' in london or in new york sell these shares on the chance of allotment well to their astonishment they don't get any shares allotted millions of money in a year are allotted to clerks mr beck to anybody in fact a market is established and our shares figure at a pretty premium then begins the game of backing and filling to and fro backward and forward and all this time we are gradually unloading the shares on the public the real holders of every thing i begin to see said mr beck slowly by this time you will perceive mr cassilis continued the bears are at the mercy of the favoured allottees then up go the shares the public have come in i recollect an old friend of mine who made a fortune on 'change small compared with yours mr beck but a great fortune used to say talking of shares in his rather homely style 'when they rise the people buys when they fa's they lets 'em goes' ha ha it's so true i have but a very poor opinion of the isle of holyhead inland navigation company but i thought their shares would go up and i bought for you you hold twenty out of fifty thousand wait till 'the people buys' and then unload cautiously and leave the rest in the lurch no sir i can't do that then mr beck i can advise you no more i hold twenty thousand shares and if i sell out that company will bust up i do not say so much i say that if you sell out gradually you take advantage of the premium and the company is left exactly where it was before you joined to stand or fall upon its merits but if you will sell your shares without concert with our colleagues in these companies you are in we shall be very properly called black sheep then mr cassilis said gilead in god's name let us have done with companies very well as you please you have only to give me a power of attorney and i will dispose of all your shares in the best way possible for your interests will you give me that power of attorney sir i am deeply obliged to you for all the trouble you are taking a power of attorney conveys large powers it will put into my hands the management of your great revenues this is not a thing to be done in a moment think well mr beck before you sign such a document i have thought sir said gilead and i will sign it with gratitude in that case i will have the document it is only a printed form filled up and sent on to you for signature immediately thank you mr cassilis and as for the shares in the various companies which you have acquired by my advice i will if you please take them all over one with another at the price you gave for them without considering which have gone up and which down they had all gone up a fact which mr cassilis might have remembered had he given the thing a moment's thought the companies on paper were doing extremely well sir said mr beck starting to his feet you heap coals of fire on my head when a gentleman like you advises me i ought to be thankful and not go worrying around like a hen in a farmyard the english nation are the only people who can raise a man like you sir honour is your birthright duty is your instinct truth is your nature we americans sir come next to you english in that respect the rest of the world are nowhere he was walking backwards and forwards with his hands in his pockets while mr cassilis looked at him through his gold eyeglasses as if he was a little amused at the outburst nowhere sir truth lives only among us the french lie to please you the germans lie to get something for themselves the russians lie because they imitate the french and have caught the bad tricks of the germans sir no one but an englishman would have made me the generous offer you have just made and i respect you for it mr cassilis i respect you sir gabriel cassilis looked a little a very little confused at all these compliments then he held out his hand my dear friend the respect is mutual he said with a forced smile do not however act always upon your belief in the honesty of englishmen it may lead you into mischief as for the shares said beck they will stay as they are if you please or they will be sold as you will and no more companies mr cassilis for me you shall have no more said his adviser in his pocket was a beautiful prospectus brand new of a company about to be formed for the purpose of lighting the town of la concepcion immaculata on the amazon river in brazil with gas a concession of land had been obtained engineers had been out to survey the place and their prospects were most bright now he felt that project must be released he turned the paper in his fingers nervously round and round and the muscles of his cheek twitched then he looked up and smiled but in a joyless way mr beck did not smile he was growing more serious you shall have no more shares said the adviser those that you have already shall be disposed of as soon as possible remains the question what am i to do with the money you have placed yourself he went on in my hands by means of that promised power of attorney i advised first of all certain shares my influence enabled me to get allotted to you you have scruples about selling shares at a profit let us respect your scruples mr beck instead of shares you will invest your money in government stocks that sir said mr beck would meet my wishes i am glad of it there are two or three ways of investing money in stocks the first your way is to buy in and take the interest the next my way is to buy in when they are low and sell out when they go up you may buy in low and sell out lower said the astute beck not if you can afford to wait this game mr beck as played by the few who understand it is one which calls into play all the really valuable qualities of the human intellect mr cassilis rose as he spoke and drew himself up to his full height then he began to walk backwards and forwards turning occasionally to jerk a word straight in the face of his client who was now leaning against the window with an unlighted cigar between his lips listening gravely foolish people think it a game of gambling so it is for them what is it to us it is the forecasting of events it is the pitting of our experience our sagacity against what some outsiders call chance and some providence we anticipate events we read the future by the light of the present then it isn't true about malachi said mr beck and he wasn't the last prophet mr cassilis went on without regarding this observation there is no game in the world so well worth playing politics you stake your reputation on the breath of the mob war you throw away your life at the stockade of savages before you can learn it trade it is the lower branch of the game of speculation in this game those who have cool heads and iron nerve win to lose your head for a moment is to lose the results of a lifetime unless he murmured as if to himself unless you can wait well sir said gilead i am a scholar and i learn something new every day do you wish me to learn this game it seems to me you contempt that could not be repressed flashed for a moment across the thin features of the speculator you no perhaps mr beck i do not interest you he resumed his habitually cold manner and went on i propose however to give you my assistance in investing your money to such advantage as i can in english and foreign stocks including railway companies but not in the shares of newly formed trading companies sir that is very kind you trust me then mr beck again the joyless smile which gleamed for a moment on his lips and disappeared that is satisfactory to both of us he said and i will send up the power of attorney to day mr cassilis departed by the morning's work he had acquired absolute control over a quarter of a million of money before this he had influence but he required persuasion for each separate transaction now he had this great fortune entirely in his own control it was to be the same as his own and by its means he had the power which every financier wants that of waiting he could wait and gilead beck this man of unparalleled sharpness and unequalled experience was a fool we have been christians for nearly two thousand years and yet he who trusts another man is a fool it seems odd mr cassilis felt young again he held his head erect as he walked down the steps of the langham hotel he lost his likeness to old father time or at least resembled that potentate in his younger days when he used to accommodate himself to people moving slowly for the happy sometimes sitting down for a few weeks in the case of young lovers and galloping for the miserable he strode across the hall with the gait of a field marshal commanding in chief and drove off to the city with the courage of five and twenty and the wisdom of sixty before him stretched an endless row of successes bigger than anything he had ever yet tried for him the glory of the coup and the profit for gilead beck the interest on his money in his inner room after glancing at the pile of letters and telegrams noting instructions and reserving a few for private reply he rang his bell the private secretary of mr gabriel cassilis did not disdain personally to answer that bell he was a middle aged man with a sleek appearance and a face which being fat shiny and graced only with a slight fringe of whisker lying well behind somehow conveyed the impression of a particular baptist who was also in the oil trade that was not the case because mr mowll was a member of the church of england and a sidesman he lived at tulse hill and was a highly respectable man mr cassilis gave him a fair salary and a small amount a very small amount of his confidence he also when anything good in a humble way offered tossed the information to his secretary who was thus enabled to add materially to his salary in the outer world mr mowll was the right hand man of gabriel cassilis his factotum and the man according to some by whose advice he walked gabriel cassilis walked by no man's advice save his own for you mowll said his employer briefly these i will attend to telegraph to wherever his address is to the man wylie the writing man newspaper people and writers of articles were writing men to gabriel cassilis i want him at once then he absorbed himself again in his papers when he was left alone he pulled some printed documents out of a drawer and compared them with letters which had the new york post mark upon them he read carefully and made notes at various points with a stump of a blue crayon pencil and he was still engaged on them when half an hour later his secretary asked him through a tube whether he would see mr wylie mr wylie was an elderly man a man of sixty and he was a man on whose face many years of rum and water were beginning to tell he was a man of letters as he said himself he had some kind of name in virtue of certain good things he had written in his early manhood before the rum and water period set in now he went up and down doing odd jobs of literary work such as are always wanting some one to do them in this great city he was a kind of literary cab you are free to day mr wylie i am mr cassilis good do you remember last year writing a short political pamphlet i think at my suggestion on the prospects of patagonian bond holders you gave me all the information you know that is you found the papers in my outer office to which all the world has access and on them you based your opinion quite so said the pamphleteer i also found five and twenty pounds in gold on your secretary's table the day after the pamphlet appeared ah possibly perhaps my secretary had private reasons of his own for let us talk business mr cassilis said the author a little roughly you want me to do something what is it do you know the affairs of eldorado i have heard of eldorado bonds of course i have no bonds either of eldorado or any other stock i have here certain papers published papers on the resources of the country said mr cassilis i think it might pay a clever man to read them he would probably arrive at the conclusion that the republic with its present income cannot hope to pay its dividends must smash up in short do not interrupt but with any assurance of activity and honesty in the application of its borrowed money there seems if this paper is correct it is published in new york no doubt that the internal resources would be more than sufficient to carry the state triumphantly through any difficulty is it a quick job or a job that may wait i dislike calling things jobs mr wylie i give you a suggestion which may or may not be useful if it is useful it is now half past twelve o'clock the pamphlet should be advertised in to morrow's papers in the printer's hand by four and ready on every counter by ten o'clock in the morning make your own arrangements with printers and call on me to morrow with the pamphlet on me mind not mr mowll yes and and and perhaps if the pamphlet is clever and expresses a just view of eldorado and its obligations there may be double the sum that you once found on my secretary's table mr wylie grasped the papers and departed the country of eldorado is one of the many free happy virtuous and enlightened republics of central america it was constituted in the year after the confederation broke up during the thirty years which form its history it has enjoyed the rule of fifteen presidents don rufiano grechyto its present able administrator a half blood indian by birth has sat upon the chair of state for nearly a year and a half and approaches the period of two years beyond which no previous president has reigned he is accordingly ill at ease those who survive of his fourteen predecessors await his deposition and expect him shortly in their own happy circle where they sit like richard ii and talk of royal misfortunes eldorado is a richly endowed country to look at it has mountains where a few inches of soil separate the feet of the rare wayfarer from rich lodes of silver forests of mahogany cover its plains indigo and tobacco flourish in its valleys everywhere roam cattle waiting to be caught and sent to the london market palms and giant tree ferns rise in its woods creepers of surpassing beauty hang from tree to tree in its silent recesses stand covered with inscriptions which no man can read the ruins of a perished civilization among these ruins roam the half savage indians who form nine tenths of the population and in the hot seaboard towns loll and lie the languid whites and half castes who form the governing class they never do govern at all they never improve they never work they are a worthless hopeless race they hoard their energies for the excitement of a pronunciamiento their favourite occupation is a game of monte they consider thought a wicked waste of energy save for purposes of cheating they ought all and without exception to be rubbed out and it is most unfortunate in the interests of humanity that their only strong feeling is an objection to be rubbed out otherwise we could plant in eldorado a colony of germans kill the pythons alligators jaguars and other impediments to free civilisation open up the mines and make it a country green with sugar canes and as sweet as rimmel's shop by reason of its spicy breezes there are about five thousand of the dominant class they possess altogether a revenue of about l a year a good deal less than a first class fortune in england as every man of the five thousand likes to have his share of the l there is not much saved in the year consequently when one reads that the republic of eldorado owes the people of great britain and france the only two european states which have money to lend the sum of six millions one feels sorry for the people of eldorado it must be a dreadful thing for a high minded republican to have so little and to owe so much fancy a man with l a year in debt to the tune of l it all grew by degrees formerly the eldoradians owed nothing in those days champagne was unknown claret never seen and the native drink was rum nothing can be better for the natives than their rum because it kills them quickly and so rids the earth of a pestilent race in an evil moment it came into the head of an enterprising eldoradian president to get up a loan he asked for a million which is of course a trifle to a nation which has nothing does nothing and saves nothing they got so much of their million as enabled them to raise everybody's salary and the pay of the standing army also to make the dividend certain for a few years after this satisfactory transaction somebody boldly ordered the importation of a few cases of brandy the descent of avernus is easy and pleasant next year they asked for two millions and a half they got this small trifle conceded to them on advantageous terms per cent which is nothing to a republic with l a year and the stock at the pay of every official was doubled the army had new shirts issued and there were fireworks at san mercurio the principal town they promised to build railways leading from nowhere into continental space to carry passengers who did not exist and goods not yet invented the same innovator who had introduced the brandy now went farther and sent for claret and champagne then they asked for more loans and went ahead quite like a first class power when there was no more money to pay the dividends with and no more loans to be raised eldorado busted up the gallant officers who commanded the standing army are now shirtless and bootless the men of the standing army have disappeared grass grows around the house of the importer of european luxuries but content has not returned to san mercurio the empty bottles remain to remind the populace of lost luxuries the national taste in drink is hopelessly perverted san mercurio is ill at ease and don rufiano trembles in his marble palace but a year ago the country was not quite played out there seemed a chance yet to those who had not the materials at hand for a simple sum in arithmetic the next morning saw the appearance of the pamphlet a short but telling pamphlet of thirty two pages called eldorado and her resources addressed to the holders of eldorado stock by oliver st george wylie the author took a gloomy but not a despairing view he mentioned that where there was no revenue there could be no dividends therefore he said it behooved eldorado stock holders to be sure that something was being done with their money then he gave pages of facts and figures which proved the utter insolvency of the state unless something could be done and he then proceeded to point out the amazing resources of the country could only a little energy be introduced into the council he drew a lively picture of millions of acres the finest ground in the world planted with sugar cane forests of mahogany silver mines worked by contented and laborious indians ports crowded with merchant fleets each returning home with rich argosies and a luxurious capital of marble made beautiful by countless palaces at eleven mr wylie called on gabriel cassilis again he brought with him his pamphlet i have read it already said mr cassilis it is on the whole well done and expresses my own view in part but i think you have piled it up too much towards the end why did you not give me clearer instructions then i dare say it will have a success meantime said the financier pushing over a little bag you can count that there ought to be fifty sovereigns good morning mr wylie good morning mr cassilis i don't know he turned the bag of gold over in his hands i don't know thirty years ago i should have looked with suspicion on such a job as this thirty years ago good morning mr wylie thirty years ago i should have thought that a man who could afford fifty pounds for a pamphlet well well that he had his little game and i should have left that man to play it by himself good morning again mr cassilis you know my address i believe in case of any other little job turning up that afternoon eldorado stock went down it was lucky for mr gabriel cassilis because he wished to buy and did largely chapter xxix it is my lady oh it is my love would that she knew she were jack is late said phillis she was making the prettiest picture that painter ever drew standing in the sunlight with the laburnums and lilacs behind her in their fresh spring glory her slender and shapely figure clad in its black riding habit stood out in relief against the light and shade of the newly born foliage she wore one of the pretty hats of last year's fashion and in her hand she carried the flowers she had just been gathering her face was in repose and in its clear straight lines might have served for a model diana chaste and fair it was habitually rather a grave face that came of much solitude and long companionship with an old man and the contrast was all the greater when she lit up with a smile that was like a touch of tender sunshine upon her face and gave the statue a soul but now she stood waiting and her eyes were grave agatha l'estrange watched her from her shady garden seat the girl's mind was full of the hidden possibilities of things for herself the elder lady to whom life had given as she thought all it had to give was thinking of these possibilities too for her charge only they approached the subject from different points of view to the girl an eager looking forward to new joys which were yet not the ordinary joys of london maidenhood each successive day was to reveal to her more secrets of life she was born for happiness and sunshine the future was brighter in some dim and misty fashion far brighter than the present it was like a picture by claude where the untrained eye sees nothing but mist and vapour rich with gorgeous colour blurring the outlines which lie behind but the elder lady saw the present and feared the future every man thinks he will succeed till he finds out his own weakness every woman thinks she is born for the best of this world's gifts to happiness to be lapped in warmth and comfort to be clothed with the love of husband and children as with a garment some women get it agatha had not received this great happiness a short two years of colourless wedded life with a man old enough to be her father and twenty years of widowhood it was not the lot she might have chosen not the lot she wished for phillis and then she thought of jack dunquerque oddly enough the future in whatever shape it was present to the brain of phillis was never without the figure of jack dunquerque jack is late said phillis come here dear out of the sun we must take a little care of our complexion sit down and let us talk agatha took phillis's hand in hers as the girl sat upon the grass at her feet let us talk tell me dear phillis don't you think a little too much about mr dunquerque about jack how can i agatha is he not my first friend she did not blush she did not hesitate she looked frankly in agatha's face the light of love which the elder lady expected was not there yet changed as you are my dear in some things you are only a child still said agatha am i only a child asked phillis tell me why you say so now dear agatha is it because i am fond of jack no dear mrs l'estrange laughed what was to be said to this jeune ingenue not quite that i have learned a great deal oh a great deal since i came here how ignorant i was how foolish what have you learned phillis well about people they are not all so interesting as they seemed at first agatha it seems like a loss not to think so much of people as i did some are foolish like the poor curate are all curates foolish i wonder some seem to say one thing and mean another like mr cassilis some do not seem to care for anything in the world except dancing some talk as if china was the only thing worth living for but some are altogether lovely and charming like yourself my dear go on phillis and tell me more shall i i am foolish perhaps but most of our visitors have disappointed me how can people talk about china as if the thing could be felt like a picture what is it they like so much in dancing and skating rinks and they prefer them to music and painting and and the beautiful river wait till you come out dear phillis said agatha for all the things in which young ladies do most delight were to her a vanity and foolishness she heard them talk and she could not understand she was to wait till she came out and was her coming out to be the putting on of the coping stone jack is late said phillis it was a little expedition mrs l'estrange and gilead beck were to drive to hampton court while jack and phillis rode it was the first of such expeditions in late may and early june the greater london as the registrar calls it is a marvel and a miracle of loveliness in all the world there are no such meadows of buttercups with fragrant hedges of thorn there are no such generous and luxuriant growths of wisteria with purple clusters there are no such woods of horse chestnuts with massive pyramids of white blossom there are no such apple orchards and snow clad forests of white blossomed plum trees as are to be seen around this great city of ours colonials returned from exile shed tears when they see them and think of arid aden and thirsty indian plains the american owns that though lake george with its hundred islets is lovely and the hudson river a thing to dream of there is nothing in the states to place beside the incomparable result of wealth and loving care which the outlying suburbs of south and western london show if it was new to phillis if every new journey made her pulses bound and every new place seen was another revelation it was also new to the american who looked so grave and smiled so kindly and sometimes made such funny observations gilead beck was more silent with the ladies than with jack which was natural because his only experience of the sex was that uncomfortable episode in his life when he taught school and fought poor pete conkling and to this adventurer this man who had been at all trades who had roamed about the world for thirty years who had habitually consorted with miners and adventurers whom the comic american books have taught us to regard as a compound of drunkard gambler buccaneer blasphemer and weeping sentimentalist his manner of life had not been able to destroy the chivalrous respect for women with which an american begins life only he had never known a lady at all until now never any lady in america in spite of his life this man was neither coarse nor vulgar he was modest knowing his defects and he was humble nevertheless he had the self respect which none of his countrymen are without he was an undeniable ranker a fact of which he was proud because if he had a weakness it was to regard himself as another cromwell singled out and chosen he had two languages of one of which he made sparing use save when he narrated his american experiences this as we have seen was a highly ornamental tongue a gallery of imagery a painted chamber of decorated metaphor the language of wild california an argot which on occasions he handled with astounding vigour the other was the tongue of the cultivated american in england we bark in the states they speak we fling out our conversation in jerks the man of the states shapes his carefully in his brain before he speaks gilead beck spoke like a gentleman of boston save that his defective education did not allow him to speak so well his great terror was the word shoddy he looked at shoddy full in the face he made up his mind what shoddy was the thing which pretends to be what it is not a branch of the great family which has the prig at one end and the snob at the other and he was resolute in avoiding the slightest suspicion of shoddy if he was of obscure birth with antecedents which left him nothing to boast of but honesty he was also soft hearted as a girl quick in sympathy which adam smith teaches us is the groundwork of all morals and refined in thought after many years a man's habitual thoughts are stamped upon his face the face of gilead beck was a record of purity and integrity such a man in england would by the power of circumstances have been forced into taprooms and slowly dragged downwards into that beery morass in which as in another malebolge the british workman lies stupefied and helpless some wicked cynic was it thackeray said that below a certain class no english woman knows the meaning of virtue he might have said with greater truth that below a certain class no englishman knows the meaning of self respect to go into that orderly house at twickenham where the higher uses of wealth were practically illustrated by a refinement new to the good ex miner was to this american in itself an education and none the less useful because it came late in life to be with the ladies to see the tender graces of the elder and the sweetness of the younger filled his heart with emotion the luck of the golden butterfly mrs l'estrange he said is more than what the old squaw thought it began in dollars but it has brought me this they were sitting in the garden agatha and gilead beck while jack dunquerque and phillis were watering flowers or gathering them or always doing something which would keep jack close to the girl if by 'this' you mean friendship mr beck said agatha i am very glad of it dollars as you call money may take to themselves wings and fly away but friends do not it will be observed that agatha l'estrange had never seen reason to abandon the old fashioned rules invented by those philosophers who lived before rochefoucauld i sometimes think i should like to try said gilead beck poor men have no friends they have mates on our side of the water and pals on yours mates and pals cried phillis laughing jack do you know mates and pals i ought to said jack because i'm poor enough friends come to rich folk naturally like the fruit to the tree or or the flower to the rose gilead added poetically or the mud to the wheel said jack suppose all my dollars were suddenly to vamose i mean to vanish away gilead beck went on solemnly would the friends vanish away too jack would not said phillis promptly and agatha would not nor should i she held out her hand in the free frank manner which was her greatest charm gilead beck took the little fingers in his big rough hand the bones of which seemed to stick out all over it so rugged and hard it was and looked in her face with the solemn smile which made phillis trust in him and raised her fingers to his lips then she blushed with a pretty confusion which drove poor jack to the verge of madness indeed the ardour of his passion and the necessity for keeping silence were together making the young man thin and pale they were gradually exploring this party of four the outside gardens parks castles and views of london of course they were as new to jack and mrs l'estrange as they were to phillis and the american jack knew greenwich where he had dined and richmond where he had dined and the crystal palace where he had also dined revealed to him one summer evening an unknown stretch of fair country more than that he knew not perhaps more exciting pleasures might have been found but this simple party found their own unsophisticated delight in driving and riding through green lanes phillis will have to come out next year said agatha half apologising to herself for enjoying such things we must amuse her while we can they went to virginia water where mr beck made some excellent observations on the ruins and on the flight of time insomuch that it was really sad to discover that they were only so to speak new ruins they went to hampton court where they strolled through the picture galleries and looked at the lely beauties walked up the long avenues and saw that quaint old mediaeval garden which lies hidden away at the side of the palace marked by few gilead beck said that if he was the queen and had such a place he should sometimes live in it if only for the sake of giving a dinner in the great hall but phillis liked best the gardens with their old fashioned flowers and the peace which reigns perpetually in the quaint old courts and gilead beck asked jack privately if he thought the palace might be bought and if so for how much they visited windsor mr beck said that if he had such a location he should always live there he speculated on the probable cost of erecting such a fortress on the banks of the hudson river and then he cast his imagination backwards up the stream of time and plunged into history phillis allowed him to go on while he jumbled kings mixed up cardinals and tried by the recovery of old associations to connect the venerable pile with the past from one of those windows i guess he said pointing his long arm vaguely round the narrow lattices charles came out to be beheaded while oliver cromwell spurted ink in his face it was rough on the poor king seems to me kings very often do have a rough time and perhaps too that cardinal thomas a beckett when he told henry iv that he wished he'd served his country as well as he'd loved his god it was on this very terrace perhaps o mr beck when did you learn english history cried phillis then like a little pedant as she was she began to unfold all that she knew about the old fortress and its history its history is not so grim as that of the tower of london which she had once narrated to jack dunquerque but it has a picturesque story of its own which the girl somehow made out from the bare facts of english history all she knew but these her imagination converted into living and indisputable truths pictures whose only fault was that the lights were too bright and the shadows too intense alas this is the way with posterity the dead are to be judged as they seem from such acts as have remained on record the force of circumstances the mixture of motives the general muddle of good and bad together are lost in the summing up and history which after all only does what phillis did but takes longer to do it paints nero black and titus white with the clear and hard outline of an etching gilead beck after the lecture looked round the place with renewed interest i am more ignorant than i thought he said humbly but i am trying to read miss fleming are you she cried with a real delight in finding as she thought one other person in the world as ignorant of that art as herself and how far have you got i've got so far he said that i've lost my way and shall have to go back again it was all through robert browning my dear young lady he said this in his most impressive tones if you should chance upon one of his books with a pretty title such as red cotton nightcap country or fifine at the fair don't read it don't try it it isn't a fairy story nor a love story it's a story without an end it's a story told upsy down it's like wandering in a forest without a path it gets into your brain and makes it go round it gets into your eyes and makes you see ghosts don't you look at that book reading in a general way and if you don't take too much of it is a fine thing he continued the difficulty is to keep the volumes separate in your head anybody can write a book i've written columns enough in the clearville roarer for a dozen books but it takes a man to read one ah but it is different with you said phillis i am only in words of two syllables i've just got through the first reading book 'the cat has drunk up all the milk' i suppose i must go on with it but i think it is better to have some one to read for you i am sure jack would read for me whenever i asked him i never thought of that said gilead beck why not keep a clerk to read for you and pay out the information in small chunks i should like to tackle mr carlyle that way agatha is reading a novel to me now phillis went on there is a girl in it but somehow i think my own life is more interesting than hers she belongs to a part of the country where the common people say clever things oh very clever things and she herself says all sorts of clever things mr dunquerque interrupted gilead beck who was not listening would read to you all the days of his life i think if you would let him phillis made no reply as she neither blushed nor smiled nor gave any of the ordinary signs of apprehension with which most young ladies would have received this speech it is to be presumed that she did not take in the full meaning of it there is one thing about mr dunquerque gilead beck went on that belongs i reckon to you english people only he is not a young man jack not a young man why mr beck not what we call a young man our young men are sixteen and seventeen mr dunquerque is five and twenty our men of five and twenty are grave and full of care mr dunquerque is light hearted and laughs that is what i like him for yes jack laughs i should not like to see jack grave she spoke of him as if he were her own property to be sure he was her first and principal friend she could talk to him as she could talk to no one else and she loved him with the deep and passionless love as yet of a sister yes said gilead beck looking round him england is a great country its young men are not all mad for dollars they can laugh and be happy and the land is one great garden miss fleming that is the happiest country i guess whose people the longest keep their youth she only half understood him but she looked in his face with her sweet smile it is like a dream that i should be walking here with you such as you in this grand place i gilead p beck to be with you and mr dunquerque is like getting back the youth i never had youth that isn't always thinkin' about the next day youth that isn't always plannin' for the future youth that has time to enjoy the sunshine to look into a sweet gell's eyes and fall in love like you my pretty and mr dunquerque who saved my life he added these last words as an after thought and as if he was reminded of some duty forgotten phillis was silent because his words fell upon her heart and made her think it was not her youth that was prolonged it was her childhood and that was dropping from her now like the shell of the chrysalis she thought how somewhere in the world there were people born to be unhappy and she felt humiliated when she was selfishly enjoying what they could not somewhere in the world and where close to her in the cottages where mrs l'estrange had taken her for until then the poor who are always with us were not unhappy to phillis nor hungry nor deserving of pity and sympathy they were only picturesque they went to st george's chapel after over ruling gilead beck's objections to attending divine service for he said he hadn't been to meetin' for more than thirty years also that he had not yet got religion and when he stood in the stall under the banner of its rightful owner he looked on from an outsider's point of view the ceremonial of the ancient church of england was to him a pageant and a scenic display the picture however was very fine the grand chapel with its splendor of ornamentation the banners and heraldry the surpliced sweet voiced boys the dignified white robed clergy men the roll of the organ the sunlight through the painted glass even the young subaltern who came clanking into the chapel as the service began there was nothing he said in america which could be reckoned a patch upon it church in avenue new york was painted and gilded in imitation of the alhambra that was considered fine but could not be compared with st george's windsor and the performance of the service he said was so good as to have merited a larger audience jack dunquerque i grieve to say did not attend to the service he was standing beside phillis and he watched her with hungry eyes for she was looking before her in a sort of trance the beauty of the place intoxicated her she listened with soft eyes and parted lips all was artistic and beautiful the chapel was peopled again with mailed knights the voices of the anthem sang the greatness and the glory of england the sunshine through the painted glass gave colour to the picture in her brain and when the service was over she came out with dazed look as one who is snatched too suddenly from a dream of heaven this too like everything else was part of her education she had learned the beauty of the world and its splendours she was to see the things she had only dreamed of but by dreaming had wrapped in a cloud of coloured mist when was it to be completed her education phillis waited for that coping stone for which joseph jagenal was vainly searching she laughed when she thought of it the mysterious completion of abraham dyson's great fabric what was it she had not long to wait i love her mrs l'estrange said jack dunquerque passionately on the evening of the last of their expeditions i love her i have seen it for some time agatha replied and i wanted to speak to you before but i did not like to i am afraid i have been very wrong in encouraging you to come here so often who could help loving her he cried tell me mrs l'estrange you who have known so many was there ever a girl like phillis so sweet so fresh so pretty and so good indeed she is all that you say agatha acknowledged and will you be my friend with colquhoun i am going to see him to morrow about it because i cannot stand it any longer he knows that you visit me he will be prepared in a way and oh mr dunquerque why are you in such a hurry phillis is so nice and you are so young i am five and twenty and phillis is nineteen then phillis is so inexperienced yes she is inexperienced jack repeated and if experience comes she may learn to love another man that is what all the men say why you silly boy if phillis were to love you first do you think a thousand men could make her give you up you are right but she does not love me she only likes me she does not know what love means that is bad enough to think of but even that isn't the worst what more is there i am so horribly so abominably poor my brother isleworth is the poorest peer in the kingdom and i am about the poorest younger son and colquhoun will think i am coming after phillis's money as you are poor it will be a great comfort for everybody concerned said agatha with good sense to think that should you marry phillis she has some money to help you with go and see lawrence colquhoun mr dunquerque and and if i can help your cause i will there now let us have no more they will make a pretty pair said mr gilead beck presently to mrs l'estrange o mr beck you are all in a plot and perhaps after all and mr dunquerque is so poor is that so mr beck asked eagerly will the young lady's guardian refuse the best man in the world because he is poor no mrs l'estrange there's only one way out of this muss and perhaps you will take that way for me what is it mr beck i can't say myself to mr dunquerque 'what is mine is yours' and i can't say to mr colquhoun not with the delicacy that you would put into it that mr dunquerque shall have all i've got to make him happy i want you to say that for me tell him there is no two ways about it that jack dunquerque must marry miss fleming lord lord why they are made for each other look at him now mrs l'estrange leanin' towards her with a look half respectful and half hungry and look at her with her sweet innocent eyes she doesn't understand it she doesn't know what he's beatin' down with all his might the strong honest love of a man the best thing he's got to give wait till you give the word and she feels his arms about her waist and his lips close to hers it's a beautiful thing love i've never been in love myself but i've watched those that were and i venture to tell you mrs l'estrange that from the queen down to the kitchen maid there isn't a woman among them all that isn't the better for being loved and they know it too all of them except that pretty creature chapter xxx pictoribus atque poetis quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas with commissions cornelius jagenal spoke as if gilead beck was a man of multitude signifying many and as if one commission was a thousand with commissions pouring in as they should brother humphrey and the great epic the masterpiece of the century about to be published in the grand style brother cornelius the only style which is worthy of its merits something definite should be attempted humphrey you mean brother with regard to with regard to phillis fleming they looked at each other meaningly and firmly the little table was between them it was past twelve o'clock already two or three soda water bottles were lying on it empty and the world looked rosy to the poetic pair humphrey was the first to speak after the young lady's name was mentioned he removed the pipe from his mouth threw back his head stroked his long brown beard and addressed the ceiling she is he said she is indeed a charming girl her outlines finely but firmly drawn her colouring delicate but strongly accentuated the grouping to which she lends herself always differentiated artistically her single attitudes designed naturally and with freedom her flesh tints remarkably pure and sweet her draperies falling in artistic folds her atmosphere softened as by the perfumed mists of morning her hair tied in the simple knot which is the admiration and despair of many painters you agree with my rendering brother cornelius he turned his reflective gaze from the ceiling and fixed his lustrous eyes perhaps with the least little look of triumph upon his brother my rendering of this incomparable work he spoke of the young lady as if she were a picture this was because immediately after receiving his commission he bethought him of reading a little modern criticism and so bought the academy for a few weeks in that clear bubbling fount of modern english undefiled the art criticisms are done with such entire freedom from cant and affectation that they are a pleasure to read and from its pages every prig is so jealously kept out that the paper is as widely circulated and as popular as punch thus humphrey jagenal acquired a new jargon of art criticism which he developed and made his own cornelius had been profiting by the same delightful and genial enemy to mutual admiration societies he was a little taken aback for a moment by the eloquence and fidelity of his brother's word picture but stimulated to rivalry he made answer gazing into the black and hollow depths of the empty fireplace and speaking slowly as if he enjoyed his words too much to let them slip out too fast she is all that you say humphrey from your standpoint nothing could be better i judge her however from my own platform i look on her as one of nature's sweetest poems such a poem as defies the highest effort of the greatest creative genius where the cadenced lines are sunlit and as they ripple on make music in your soul you are rapt with their beauty you are saddened with the unapproachable magic of their charm you feel the deepest emotions of the heart awakened and beating in responsive harmony and when after long and patient watching the searcher after the truth of beauty feels each verse sink deeper and deeper within him till it becomes a part of his own nature there arises before him clad in mystic and transparent coan robe the spirit of subtle wisdom long lying perdu in those magic utterances she is a lyric she is a sonnet she is an epigram at least interrupted humphrey unkindly cutting short his brother's freest flow at least she doesn't carry a sting then let us say an idyl cornelius make an idyl yourself for her humphrey interrupted again because really his brother was taking an unfair advantage of a paltry verbal superiority now that we have both described her and i am sure brother he added out of the kindness of his heart no description could be more poetically true than your own it would make even a stranger see phillis standing in a vision before his eyes but let us see what had better be done we must act at once humphrey we must call upon her at her guardian's mrs l'estrange at twickenham perhaps that lady does not know so many men of genius as to render the accession of two more to her circle anything but a pleasure and an honour and as for our next steps they must be guided by our finesse by our knowledge of the world our insight into a woman's heart our shall i say our power of intrigue humphrey then the artist positively winked it is not a gesture to be commended from an artistic point of view but he did it then he chuckled and wagged his head then the poet in his turn also winked chuckled and wagged his head too we understand each other humphrey we always do we must make our own opportunity said the artist thoughtfully not together but separately surely separately together would never do we will go to bed early to night in order to be fresh to morrow have you did you can you give me any of your own experiences in this way cornelius the poet shook his head i may have been wooed he said men of genius are always run after but as i am a bachelor you see it is clear that i never proposed humphrey had much the same idea in his own mind and felt as if the wind was a little taken out of his sails this often happens when two sister craft cruise so very close alongside of each other do not let us be nervous humphrey the elder brother went on kindly it is the simplest thing in the world i dare say when you come to do it love finds out a way when i was in rome humphrey said casting his thoughts backwards thirty years when i was in heidelberg said cornelius in the same mood of retrospective meditation there was a model a young artist's model there was a little country girl with the darkest eyes and hair of a deep blue black the kind of colour one seems only to read of or to see in a picture with blue eyes as limpid as the waters of the neckar and light brown hair which caught the sunshine in a way that one seldom seems to see but which we poets sometimes sing of then they both started and looked at each other guiltily cornelius said humphrey i think that phillis would not like these reminiscences we must offer virgin hearts true brother said cornelius with a sigh we must yet the recollection is not unpleasant they went to bed early only concentrating into two hours the brandy and soda of four it was a wonderful thing that neither gave the other the least hint of a separate and individual preference for phillis they were running together as usual in double harness and so far as might be gathered from their conversation they were proposing to themselves that both should marry phillis they dressed with more than usual care in the morning and without taking their customary walk sat each in his own room till two o'clock when humphrey sought cornelius in the workshop they surveyed each other with admiration they were certainly a remarkable pair and save for that little redness of the nose already alluded to they were more youthful than one could conceive possible at the age of fifty their step was elastic their eyes were bright humphrey's beard was as brown and silky cornelius's cheek as smooth as twenty years before this it is to lead a life unclouded and devoted to contemplation of art this it is to have a younger brother successful and never tired of working for his seniors we are not nervous brother asked cornelius with a little hesitation not at all said humphrey sturdily not at all still to steady the system perhaps yes said cornelius you are quite right brother we will there was no need of words the reader knows already what was implied humphrey led the way to the dining room where he speedily found a pint of champagne with this modest pick me up which no one surely will grudge the brethren they started on their way what we need cornelius said humphrey putting himself outside the last drop what we need not what we wish for then he straightened his back smote his chest stamped lustily with his right foot and looked like a war horse before the battle unconscious of the approaching attack of these two conquering heroes phillis and agatha l'estrange were sitting in the shade and on the grass the elder lady with some work the younger doing nothing it was a special characteristic with her that she could sit for hours doing nothing so the modern arabs the gipsies niggerdom in general and all that large section of humanity which has never learned to read and write are contented to fold their hands lie down and think away the golden hours what they think about these untutored tribes the lord only knows whether by degrees and as they grow old some faint intelligence of the divine order sinks into their souls or whether they become slowly enwrapped in the beauty of the world or whether their thoughts always turned in the bacon and cabbage direction are wholly gross and earthly i cannot tell phillis's thoughts were still as the thoughts of a child but as those of a child passing into womanhood partly selfish inasmuch as she consciously placed her own individuality as every child does in the centre of the universe and made the sun the moon the planets and all the minor stars revolve around her partly unselfish because they hovered about the forms of two or three people she loved and took the shape of devising means of pleasing these people partly artistic because the beauty of the june afternoon cried aloud for admiration while the sunshine lay on the lawns and the flower beds threw up the light leaves and blossoms of the passion flower on the house side and made darker shadows in the gables while the glorious river ran swiftly at her feet the river of which she never tired other things lost their novelty but the river never i wish jack dunquerque were here she said at last i wish so too said agatha why did we not invite him phillis then they were silent again i wish mr beck would call remarked phillis my dear we do nothing but wish but here is somebody two young gentlemen who are they i wonder o agatha they are the twins phillis sprang from her seat and ran to meet them with a most unaffected pleasure this is mr cornelius jagenal she said introducing them to agatha the poet you know and here she laughed because agatha did not know and cornelius perked up his head and tried to look unconscious of his fame and this is mr humphrey the artist and then she laughed again because humphrey did exactly the same as cornelius only with an air of deprecation as one who would say never mind my fame for the present it was embarrassing for mrs l'estrange because she could not for her life recollect any poet or artist named jagenal the men and their work were alike unknown to her and why did phillis laugh and what did the pair before her look so solemn about they were solemn partly from vanity which is the cause of most of the grave solemnity we so much admire in the world and partly because finding themselves face to face with phillis they became suddenly and painfully aware that they had come on a delicate errand cornelius looked furtively at humphrey and the artist glanced at the poet but neither found any help from his brother their courage as evanescent as that of mr robert acres was rapidly oozing out at their boots phillis noted their embarrassment and tried to put them at their ease this was difficult they were so inordinately vain so self conscious so unused to anything beyond their daily experience that they were as awkward as a pair of fantoccini people who live alone get into the habit of thinking and talking about themselves the twins were literally unable to think or speak on any other subject phillis they saw to begin with was altered somehow she looked older certainly more formidable and it was awkward to feel that she was taking them in a manner under her own protection before a stranger and why did she laugh the task which they discussed with such an airy confidence over the brandy and soda assumed in the presence of the young lady herself dimensions quite out of proportion to their midnight estimate all these considerations made them feel and look ill at ease also it was vexatious that neither of the ladies turned the conversation upon the subject nearest to each man's heart his own work on the contrary phillis asked after joseph and sent him an invitation to come and see her mrs l'estrange talked timidly about the weather and tried them on the opera on the academy and on the last volume of browning it was odd in so great an artist as humphrey that he had not yet seen the academy and in so great a poet as cornelius that he had not read any recent poetry then they tried to talk about flowers the two city bred artists knew a wall flower from a cabbage and a rose from a sprig of asparagus and that was all phillis would not help either the twins or agatha so that the former grew more helpless every moment in fact the girl was staring at them and wondering to feel how differently she regarded men and manners since that first evening in carnarvon square when they produced champagne in her honour and drank it all up themselves she remembered how she had looked at them with awe how after a day or two this reverence vanished how she found them to be mere shallow wind bags and humbugs and regarded them with contempt how she made fun of them with jack dunquerque and how she drew their portraits and now it was a mark of her advanced education she looked at them with pity they were so dependent on each other for admiration they were so childishly vain they were so full of themselves and their daily life of sleep drink and boastful pretension showed itself to her experienced head as so mean and sordid a thing she came to the help of the whole party and took the twins for a walk among the flowers flattering them asking how work got on congratulating them on their good looks and generally making things comfortable for them presently she found herself on the sloping bank of the river where she was wont to sit with jack cornelius jagenal alone was by her side she looked round and saw humphrey standing before mrs l'estrange and occasionally glancing over his shoulder and she noticed then a curiously nervous motion of her companion's hand also that his cheek was twitching with some secret emotion he looked older too she thought perhaps that was the bright sunlight which brought out the dells and valleys and the crow's feet round his eyes he cleared his voice with an effort and opened his mouth to speak but shut it again silent you were going to say mr cornelius yes will you sit down miss fleming he is going to tell me about the upheaving of aelfred thought phillis and how does the workshop get on she asked fairly well he replied modestly we publish in the autumn the work is to be brought out you will be glad to learn with all the luxury of the best illustrations paper print and binding that money can procure so that all you want is the poem itself said phillis with a mischievous light in her eyes ye es he winced a little as you say the epic itself alone is wanting and that advances with mighty strides my brother humphrey a noble creature is humphrey miss fleming she bowed and smiled is he still hard at work always hard at work she laughed as she asked the question his work is crushing him miss fleming may i call you phillis he spoke very solemnly his work is crushing him of course you may mr cornelius we are quite old friends but i am sorry to hear that your brother is being crushed yesterday phillis i feel to you already like a brother pursued the poet yesterday i discovered the secret of humphrey's life may i tell it to you if you please she began to be a little bored also she noticed that agatha wore a look of mute suffering as if the artist was getting altogether too much for her if you please but be quick because i think mrs l'estrange wants me i will tell you the secret in a few words my brother humphrey adores you with all the simplicity and strength of a noble artistic nature does he you mean he likes me very much how good he his i am glad to hear it mr cornelius though why it need be a secret i do not know then my poor brother he is all loyalty and brings you a virgin heart o cornelius and the model with the blue black hair an unsullied name and the bright prospects of requited genius my brother may hope phillis did not understand one word certainly she said i am sure i would like to see him hoping i will tell him sister phillis said cornelius nodding with a sunny smile you have made two men happy and one at least grateful his mission was accomplished his task done it will hardly be believed that this treacherous bard growing more and more nervous as he reflected on the uncertainty of the wedded life actually came to a sudden resolution to plead his brother's cause humphrey was the younger let him bear off the winsome bride it will be a change in our lives he said you will allow me to have my share in his happiness phillis made no reply decidedly the poet was gone distraught with overmuch reading and thought cornelius smiling crowing and laughing almost like a child pressed her hand and left her stepping with a youthful elasticity across the lawn humphrey sitting beside mrs l'estrange was bewildering that good lady with a dissertation on colour a propos of a flower which he held in his hand agatha could not understand this strange pair who looked so youthful until you came to see them closely and then they seemed to be of any age you pleased to name nor could she understand their talk which was pedantic affected and continually involved the theory that the speaker was next to his brother the greatest of living men if it was awkward and stupid sitting with humphrey on a bench while he discoursed on colour it was still more awkward when the other one appeared with a countenance wreathed with smiles and sat on the other side nor did there appear any reason why the one with the beard should suddenly break off his oration turn very red in the face get up and walk slowly across the lawn to take his brother's place but that is what he did and cornelius took up the running humphrey sat down beside phillis without speaking she noticed in him the same characteristics of nervousness as in his brother twice he attempted to speak and twice his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth he is going to tell me that cornelius adores me she thought it was instinct that was exactly what humphrey the treacherous humphrey had determined on doing matrimony contemplated at close quarters and in the presence of the enemy so to speak lost all its charms humphrey thought of the pleasant life in carnarvon square and determined at the very last moment that if either of them was to marry it should not be himself cornelius was the elder let him be married first you are peaceful and happy here miss fleming may i call you phillis certainly mr humphrey we are old friends you know and i am very happy here i am glad he sighed heavily i am very glad indeed to hear that are you not happy mr humphrey why do you look so gloomy and how is the great picture getting on the 'birth of the renaissance' is advancing rapidly rapidly he said it will occupy a canvas fourteen feet long by six high if you have got the canvas and the frame and the purchaser all you want now is the picture true as you say the picture it is all that i want and that is striding literally striding i am happy dear miss fleming dear phillis since i may call you by your pretty christian name it is of my brother that i think it is on his account that i feel unhappy what is the matter with him she tried very hard not to laugh but would not trust herself to look in his face so that he thought she was modestly guessing his secret he is a great a noble fellow his life is made up of sacrifices and devoted to hard work no one works so conscientiously as cornelius now at length the prospect opens up and he will take immediately his true position among english poets indeed i am glad of it thank you yet he is not happy there is a secret sorrow in his life oh dear phillis cried impatiently do let me know it and at once was there ever such a pair of devoted brothers humphrey was disconcerted for the moment but went on again a secret which no one has guessed but myself i know what it is she laughed and clapped her hands has he told you phillis the secret of his life is that my brother cornelius is attached to you with all the devotion of his grand poetic soul why that was what i thought you were going to say you knew it humphrey was as solemn as an eight day clock while phillis's eyes danced with mirth and you feel the response of a passionate nature he shall be your petrarch you shall read his very soul but cornelius brings you a virgin heart a virgin heart phillis o humphrey and after what you know about gretchen may he hope that certainly he may hope and so may you and now we have had quite enough of devotion and secrets and great poetic souls come mr humphrey she rose from the grass and looked him in the face laughing for a moment the thought crossed the artist's brain that he had made a mess of it somehow now she said joining the other two let us have some tea and be real neither of them understood her desire to be real and the twins declined tea that beverage they considered worthy only of late breakfast and to be taken as a morning pick me up so they departed taking leave with a multitudinous smile and many tender hand pressures as they left the garden together arm in arm they straightened their backs held up their heads and stuck out their legs like the knave of spades and they looked so exactly like a pair of triumphant cocks that phillis almost expected them to crow au revoir said cornelius taking off his hat with a whole wreath of smiles for a final parting at the gate sans dire adieu said humphrey doing the same with a light in his eyes which played upon his beard like sunshine phillis my dear said agatha they really are the most wonderful pair i ever saw they are so funny said phillis laughing they sleep all day and when they wake up they pretend to have been working and they sit up all night and o agatha each one came to me just now and told me he had a secret to impart to me what was that my dear that the other one adored me and might he hope but phillis this is beyond a joke and actually here before my very eyes i said they might both hope though i don't know what they are to hope it seems to me that if those two lazy men who never do anything but pretend to be exhausted with work were only to hope for anything at all it might wake them up a little and they each said that the other would bring me a virgin heart agatha what did they mean agatha laughed well my dear it is a most uncommon thing to find in a man of fifty and i should say if it were true which i don't believe that it argued extreme insensibility such an offering is desirable at five and twenty but very very rare my dear at any age and at their time of life i should think that it was like an apple in may kept too long phillis and tasting of the straw but then you don't understand phillis thought that a virgin heart might be one of the things to be understood when the coping stone was achieved and asked no more at the richmond railway station the brothers who had not spoken a word to each other since leaving the house turned into the refreshment room by common consent and without consultation they had as usual a brandy and soda and on taking the glasses in their hands they looked at each other and smiled cornelius humphrey shall we the artist dropped his voice so that the attendant damsel might not hear shall we drink the health and happiness of phillis we will humphrey replied the poet with enthusiasm when they got into the train and found themselves alone in the carriage they dug each other in the ribs once with great meaning she knows said the poet with a grin worthy of mephistopheles that she has found a virgin heart she does said humphrey o cornelius and the little gretchen and the milkpails byronic rover ah humphrey shall i tell her of the contadina the black eyed model and the old wild days in rome eh don giovanni then they both laughed and then they fell asleep in the carriage because it was long past their regular hour for the afternoon nap and slept till the guard took their tickets at vauxhall chapter xxxi this fellow's of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities it was the night of the derby of the great race had been run and the partisans of galopin were triumphant those who had set their affections on other names had finished their weeping because by this time lamentation especially among those of the baser sort was changed for a cheerful resignation begotten of much beer the busy road was deserted save for the tramps who plodded their weary way homeward the moon now in its third quarter looked with sympathetic eye upon the sleeping forms which dotted the silent downs these lay strewn like unto the bodies on a battle field they lay in rows they lay singly they were protected from the night dews by canvas tents or they were exposed to the moon light and the wind all day long these people had plied the weary trade of amusing a mob the derby when most hearts are open is the harvest day of those who play instruments those who dance those who tumble those who tell fortunes among these honest artists sleeps the 'prentice who is going to rob the till to pay his debt of honour the seedy betting man in a drunken stupor the boy who has tramped all the way from town to pick up a sixpence somehow the rustic who loves a race and the sharp fingered lad with the restless eye and a pocketful of handkerchiefs the holiday is over and few are the heads which will awake in the morning clear and untroubled with regrets remorse or hot coppers it is two in the morning and most of the revellers are asleep a few still awake are at the burleigh club and among these are gilead beck ladds and jack dunquerque they have been to epsom on the course the two englishmen seemed not unnaturally to know a good many men some whose voices were oddly enough familiar to gilead beck shook hands with him and laughed one voice it belonged to a man in a light coat and a white hat reminded him of thomas carlyle the owner of the voice laughed cheerfully when beck told him so another made him mindful of john ruskin and the owner of that voice too laughed and changed the subject they were all cheerful these friends of jack dunquerque they partook with affability of the luncheon and drank freely of the champagne also there was a good deal of quiet betting jack dunquerque gilead beck observed was the least adventurous betting and gambling were luxuries which jack's income would not allow him most other things he could share in but betting was beyond him gilead beck plunged and won it was a part of his luck that he should win but nevertheless when galopin carried his owner's colours past the winning post gilead gave a great shout of triumph and felt for once the pleasures of the turf now it was all over jack and he were together in the smoking room where half a dozen lingered ladds was somewhere in the club but not with them it was a fine sight said gilead beck on the subject of the race generally a fine sight in the matter of crowds you beat us that i allow and the horses were good that i allow too but let me show you a trotting race where the sweet little winner goes his measured mile in two minutes and a half that seems to me better sport but the derby is a fine race and i admit it when i go back to america he went on i shall institute races of my own with a great national dunquerque cup and we will have an american derby with trotting thrown in there's room for both sports what do you think mr dunquerque of having sports from all countries seems a bright idea take your bull fights from spain your fencing from france your racing from england what will you have from germany playing at soldiers i guess they don't seem to care for any other game and russia a great green table with a pack of cards and a roulette we can get a few egyptian bonds for the greeks to exhibit their favourite game with we may import a band of brigands for the italian sports imitation murder will represent turkish delights and the performers shall camp in central park it wouldn't be bad fun to go out at night and hunt them say mr dunquerque we'll do it a permanent exhibition of the amusements of all nations you shall come over if you like and show them english fox hunting where is captain ladds i left him hovering round the card tables i will bring him up presently jack returned ladds is hard at work at ecarte with a villainous looking stranger and i should think from the way tommy is sticking at it that tommy is dropping pretty heavily it's an american he's playing with said one of the other men in the room don't know who brought him not a member a major hamilton ruggles don't know what service mr beck looked up quietly and reflected a moment then he said softly to jack mr dunquerque i think we can have a little amusement out of this if you were to go now to captain ladds and if you were to bring him up to this same identical room with major hamilton ruggles i think sir i do think you would see something pleasant there was a sweet and winning smile on the face of mr beck when he spoke these words jack immediately understood that there was going to be a row and went at once on his errand in order to promote it to the best of his power you know major ruggles asked the first speaker no sir no i can hardly say that i know major ruggles but i think he knows me in ten minutes ladds and his adversary at ecarte came upstairs ladds wore the heavy impenetrable look in which as in a mask he always played the other who had a limp in one leg and a heavy scar across his face came with him he was laughing in a high pitched voice after them came jack at sight of mr beck major ruggles stopped suddenly i beg your pardon captain ladds he said i find i have forgotten my handkerchief he turned to go but jack the awkward was in his way handkerchief sticking out of your pocket said ladds so it is so it is by a sort of instinct the half dozen men in the smoking room seemed to draw their chairs and to close in together there was evidently something going to happen mr beck rose solemnly surely nobody ever had so grave a face as gilead p beck and advanced to major ruggles major ruggles he said i gave you to understand two days ago that i didn't remember you i found out afterwards that i was wrong i remember you perfectly well you used words mr beck which ay ay i know you want satisfaction major you shall have it sit down now sit down sir we are all among gentlemen here and this is a happy meeting for both of us what will you drink i beg your pardon mr dunquerque but i thought we were at the langham perhaps you would yourself ask major ruggles what he will put himself outside of the major who did not seem quite at his ease took a seltzer and brandy and a cigarette then he looked furtively at gilead beck he understood what the man was going to say and why he was going to say it satisfaction major wal these gentlemen shall be witnesses yesterday mornin' as i was walkin' down the steps of the langham hotel this gentleman this high toned whole souled pride of the american army met me and offered his hand 'hope you are well mr beck' were his affable words 'hope you are quite well met you last at delmonico's in with boss calderon' now gentlemen you'll hardly believe me when i tell you i answered this politeness by askin' the major if he had ever heard of a banco steerer and if he knew the meanin' of a roper he did not reply doubtless because he was wounded in his feelin's being above all things a man of honour and the boast of his native country i then left him with a scriptural reference which p'r'aps he's overhauled since and now understands what i meant when i said that if i was to meet him goin' around arm in arm with ananias and sapphira i'd say he was in good company here the major jumped in his chair and put his right hand to his shirt front no sir said beck unmoved i can tackle more'n one wild cat at once if you mean fightin' which you do not and it's no use no manner o' use feelin' in that breast pocket of yours because the shootin' irons in this country are always left at home you sit still major and take it quiet i'm goin' to be more improvin' presently perhaps beck said jack you would explain what a banco steerer and a roper are i was comin' to that sir they air one and the same animal the roper or the banco steerer gentlemen will find you out the morning after you land in chicago or saint louis he will accost you very friendly wonderful friendly when you come out of your hotel by your name and he will remind you which is most surprising considerin' you never set eyes on his face before how you have dined together in cincinnati or it may be orleans or perhaps francisco because he finds out where you came from last and he will shake hands with you and he will propose a drink and he will pay for that drink and presently he will take you somewhere else among his pals and he will strip you so clean that there won't be left the price of a four cent paper to throw around your face and hide your blushes in london gentlemen they do i believe the confidence trick perhaps major ruggles will explain his own method presently but major ruggles preserved silence so gentlemen after i'd shown my familiarity with the ax of the apostles i went down town thinkin' how mighty clever i was that's a way of mine gentlemen which generally takes me after i've made a durned fool of myself all of a sudden i recollected the face of major ruggles and where i'd seen him last yes major you did know me you were quite right and i ought to have kept ananias out of the muss you did know me and i'd forgotten it those words of mine major required explanation as you said just now satisfaction i said objected the major trying to recover himself a little sir you air a whole souled gentleman and your sense of honour is as keen as a quarter dollar razor satisfaction you shall have and if you are not satisfied when i have done with you ask these gentlemen around what an american nobleman one of the noblemen like yourself that we do sometimes show the world wants more and the more you shall git you did know me major but you made a little mistake it was not with boss calderon that you met me because i do not know boss calderon nor was it at delmonico's and where it was i am about to tell this company he hesitated a moment gentlemen i believe it is a rule that strangers in your clubs must be introduced by members i was introduced by my friend mr dunquerque and i hope i shall not disgrace that introduction may i ask who introduced major ruggles nobody knew in fact he had passed in with an acquaintance picked up somehow and stayed there the major tried again to get away this is fooling he said captain ladds do you wish me to be insulted if you do sir say so you will find that an american officer silence sir said mr beck an american officer say that again and i will teach you to respect the name of an american officer i've been a private soldier myself in that army he added by way of explanation now major ruggles i am going to invite you to remain while i tell these gentlemen a little story a very little story but it concerns you and if captain ladds likes when that story is finished i will apologise to you and to him and to all this honourable company let us hear the story said jack nothing could be fairer nothing echoed the little circle of listeners beck addressed the room in general occasionally pointing the finger of emphasis at the unfortunate major his victim showed every sign of bodily discomfort and mental agitation first he fidgeted in the chair then he threw away his cigarette then he folded his arms and stared defiantly at the speaker then he got up again what have i to do with you and your story let me go captain ladds you have my address and as for you sir you shall hear from me to morrow sit down major gilead beck invited him to resume his chair with a sweet smile sit down the night's young may be captain ladds wants his revenge not i said ladds had enough go to bed not a revengeful man then said gilead beck his face darkening and his manner suddenly changing i will take your revenge for you sit down sir it was an order he gave this time not an invitation and the stranger obeyed with an uneasy smile it is not gambling major ruggles beck went on captain ladds' revenge is going to be of another sort i reckon he drew close to major ruggles and sitting on the table placed one foot on a chair which was between the stranger and the door delmonico's was it where we met last and with joe calderon boss calderon really major ruggles i was a great fool not to remember that at once but i always am weak over faces even such a striking face as yours so we met last when you were dining with boss calderon eh then mr beck began his little story six years ago gentlemen long before i found my butterfly of which you may have heard i ran up and down the great pacific railway between chicago and francisco for close upon six months i did not choose that way of spendin' the golden hours because if one had a choice at all a pullman's sleeping car on the pacific railway would be just one of the last places you would choose to pass your life in i should class it as a permanent home with a first class saloon in a cunard steamer no gentlemen i was on board those cars in an official capacity i was conductor it is not a proud position not an office which you care to magnify it doesn't lift your chin in the air and stick out your toes like the proud title of major does for our friend squirmin' in the chair before us squirm on major but listen because this is interestin' on those cars and on that railway there is a deal of time to be got through i am bound to say that time kind of hangs heavy on the hands you can't be always outside smokin' you can't sleep more'n a certain time because the nigger turns you out and folds up the beds and you oughtn't to drink more'n your proper whack also you get tired watchin' the scenery you may make notes if you like but you get tired o' that and you get mortal tired of settin' on end mostly therefore you stand around the conductor and you listen to his talk but six years ago the dullness of that long journey was enlivened by the presence of a few sportsmen like our friend the major here they were so fond of the beauties of nature they were so wrapped up in the pride of bein' american citizens and ownin' the biggest railway in the world that they would travel all the way from new york to san francisco stay there a day and then travel all the way back again and the most remarkable thing was that when they got to new york again they would take a through ticket all the way back to san fran this attachment to the line pleased the company at first it did seem as if good deeds was going to meet their recompense at last even in this world and the spirited conduct of the gentlemen when it first became known filled everybody with admiration you remember major the very handsome remarks made by you yourself on the new york platform lord is it six years ago why it seems to me but yesterday major ruggles that i saw you standin' erect and bold lookin' like a senator in a stove pipe hat store boots and go to meetin' coat shakin' hands with the chairman 'sir' you said with tears in your eyes 'you represent the advance of civilisation we air now indeed ahead of the hull creation you have united the pacific and the atlantic and sir by the iron road the west and the east may jine hands and defy the tyranny of europe' those gentlemen were the noble sentiments of major hamilton ruggles did i say major that i would give you satisfaction wait till i have done and you shall bust with satisfaction the major did not look at all events like being satisfied so far one day an ugly rumor got about you know how rumours spread that the great pacific railroad was a big gamblin' shop the enthusiastic travellers up and down that line were one mighty confederated gang they were up to every dodge they travelled together and they travelled separate they had dice and those dice were loaded they had cards and those cards were marked they played on the square but behind every man's hand was a confederate and he gave signs so that the honest sportsman knew how to play and by these simple contrivances gentlemen they always won so much did they win that i have conducted a through train in which when we got to chicago there wasn't a five dollar piece left among the lot and all the time strangers to each other the gang never by so much as a wink let out that they had met before and no one could tell them from ordinary passengers but i knew and i had a long conversation with the directors one day the result of which major ruggles perhaps you can tell these gentlemen what was the result of that conversation the man was sallow his sharp eyes gleamed with an angry light as he looked from one to the other as if in the hope of finding an associate there was none only ladds his adversary moved quietly around the room and sat near to gilead beck on the table but nearer the door the major saw this manoeuvre with a sinking heart because his pockets were heavy with the proceeds of the evening game well gentlemen a general order came for all the conductors it was 'no play' we were to stop that and another general order was an imperative order major so that i am sure you will not bear malice 'if they won't leave off chuck 'em out' that was the order major 'chuck 'em out' it was on the journey back from san francisco that the first trouble began you were an upright man to look at then major you hadn't got the limp you've got now and you hadn't received that unfort'nate scar across your handsome face you were a most charmin' companion for a long railway journey but you had that little weakness that you would play i warned you at the time i said 'cap'en this must stop' you were only a cap'en then but you would go on 'cap'en' i said 'if you will not stop you will be chucked out' you will acknowledge major that i gave you fair warnin' you laughed that was all you did you laughed and you shuffled the cards but the man who was playing with you got up he saw reason then you drew out a revolver and used bad language so i made for you gentlemen it was not a fair fight but orders had to be observed in half a minute i had his pistol from him and in two minutes more he was flyin' from the end of the train we were goin' twenty miles an hour and we hadn't time to stop to see if he was likely to get along somehow and the last i saw of captain ruggles i beg your pardon major was his two heels in the air as he left the end of the train i s'pose major it was stoppin' so sudden gave you that limp and ornamented your face with that beautiful scar the ground was gritty i believe everybody's eyes were turned on the major whose face was livid gentlemen mr beck continued that aerial flight of captain ruggles improved the moral tone of the pacific railroad to a degree that you would hardly believe i don't think there has been a single sportsman chucked out since major ruggles sir you were the blessed means under providence and gilead p beck conjointly of commencing a new and moral era for the great pacific railroad and now major that my little story is told may i ask if you are satisfied because if there is any other satisfaction in my power you shall have that too have i done enough for honour gentlemen all the men laughed now for a word with me ladds began cap'en said gilead beck let me work through this contract if you have no objection major ruggles you will clear out all your pockets the miserable man made no reply clear out every one and turn them inside out right away he neither moved nor spoke gentlemen mr beck said calmly you will be kind enough not to interfere he pulled a penknife out of his pocket and laid it on a chair open he then seized major ruggles by the collar and arm the man fought like a wild cat but beck's grasp was like a vice it seemed incredible to the bystanders that a man should be so strong so active and so skilled he tossed rather than laid his victim on the table and then holding both his hands in one grip of his own enormous fist he deliberately ripped open the major's trousers waistcoat and coat pockets and took out the contents when he was satisfied that nothing more was left in them he dragged him to the ground on the table lay the things which he had taken possession of take up those dice he said to ladds try them if they are not loaded i will ask the major's pardon they were loaded look at these cards he went on they are the cards you have been playing with when you thought you had a new pack of club cards if they are not marked i will ask the major to change places with me they were marked and now gentlemen i think i may ask captain ladds what he has lost and invite him to take it out of that heap there was a murmur of assent i lost twenty pounds in notes and gold said ladds and i gave an i o u for sixty more there were other i o u's in the heap and more gold when ladds had recovered his own the paper was solemnly torn up but the coin restored to the major who now stood abject white and trembling but with the look of a devil in his eyes such men as you major said gilead the moralist are the curse of our country you see gentlemen we travel about we make money fast we are sometimes a reckless lot the miners have got pockets full there's everything to encourage such a crew as major ruggles belonged to and when we find them out we lynch them lynch is the word isn't it major do you want to know the end of this man gentlemen i am not much in the prophetic line but i think i see a crowd of men in a minin' city and i see a thick branch with a rope over it and at the end of that rope is major ruggles's neck tightened in a most unpleasant and ungentlemanly manner it's inhospitable but what can you expect major we like play but we like playin' on the square now major you may go and you may thank the lord on your knees before you go to sleep that this providential interference has taken place in london instead of the states for had i told my interestin' anecdote at a bar in any city of the western states run up you would have been you may go major ruggles and i daresay cap'en ladds in consideration of the damage done to those bright and shinin' store clothes of yours will forego the british kicking which i see tremblin' at the point of his toes ladds did forego that revenge and the major slunk away chapter xxxii nulla fere causa est in qua non femina litem moverit when mr wylie the pamphleteer left gabriel cassilis the latter resumed with undisturbed countenance his previous occupation of reading the letters and telegrams he had laid aside among them was one which he took up gingerly as if it were a torpedo pshaw he cried impatiently tossing it from him another of those anonymous letters the third he looked at it with disgust and then half involuntarily his hand reached out and took it up again the third and all in the same handwriting 'i have written you two letters and you have taken no notice this is the third beware your wife was with mr colquhoun yesterday she will be with him again to day and to morrow ask her if you dare what is her secret with him ask him what hold he has over her watch her and caution her lest something evil befall you your well wisher' i am a fool he said to be disquieted about an anonymous slander what does it matter to me as if victoria she did know colquhoun before her marriage their names were mentioned i remember hearing that there had been flirtation flirtation as if victoria could ever flirt she was no frivolous silly girl no one who knows victoria could for a moment suspect suspect the word is intolerable one would say i was jealous he pushed forward his papers and leaned back in his chair casting his thoughts behind him to the days of his stiff and formal wooing he remembered how he said sitting opposite to her in her cousin's drawing room there was no wandering by the river bank or in pleasant gardens on summer evenings for those two lovers you bring me fewer springs than i can offer you victoria which was his pretty poetical way of telling her that he was nearly forty years older than herself but we shall begin life with no trammels of previous attachments on either hand he called it and thought it at sixty five beginning life and it was quite true that he had never before conceived an attachment for any woman no mr cassilis she replied we are both free quite free and the disparity of age is only a disadvantage on my side which a few years will remedy this cold stately woman conducting a flirtation before her marriage this juno among young matrons causing a scandal after her marriage it was ridiculous he said to himself that it was ridiculous so often that he succeeded at last in persuading himself that it really was and when he had quite done that he folded up the anonymous document docketed it and placed it in one of the numerous pigeon holes of his desk which was one of those which shut up completely covering over papers pigeon holes and everything then he addressed himself again to business and but for an occasional twinge of uneasiness like the first throb which presages the coming gout he got through an important day's work with his accustomed ease and power the situation as lawrence colquhoun told victoria was strained there they were as he put it all three himself for some reason of his own put first the lady and gabriel cassilis the last was the one who did not know there was no reason none in the world why things should not remain as they were only that the lady would not let sleeping dangers sleep and lawrence was too indolent to resist in other words victoria cassilis having once succeeded in making him visit her spared no pains to bring him constantly to her house and to make it seem as if he was that innocent sort of cicisbeo whom english society allows why the investigation of motives is a delicate thing at the best and apt to lead the analyst into strange paths it may be discovered that the philanthropist acts for love of notoriety that the preacher does not believe in the truths he proclaims that the woman of self sacrifice and good works is consciously posing before an admiring world this is disheartening because it makes the cynic and the worldly minded man to chuckle and chortle with an open joy st paul who was versed in the ways of the world knew this perfectly when he proclaimed the insufficiency of good works it is at all times best to accept the deed and never ask the motive and after all good deeds are something practical and as for a foolish or a bad deed the difficulty of ascertaining an adequate motive only becomes more complicated with its folly or its villainy mrs cassilis had everything to gain by keeping her old friend on the respectful level of a former acquaintance she had everything to lose by treating him as a friend and yet she forced her friendship upon him kindly people who find in the affairs of other people sufficient occupation for themselves and whose activity of intellect obtains a useful vent in observation and comment watched them the man was always the same indolent careless unmoved by any kind of passion for any other man's wife or for any maid that was a just conclusion lawrence colquhoun was not in love with this lady and yet he suffered himself to obey orders dropped easily in the position allowed himself to be led by her invitations went where she told him to go and all the time half laughed at himself and was half angry to think that he was thus enthralled by a siren who charmed him not to have once loved a woman to love her no longer to go about the town behaving as if you did this it was evident to him was not a position to be envied or desired few false positions are perhaps he did not know that mrs grundy talked perhaps he was only amused when he heard of remarks that had been made by sir benjamin backbite and although the brief sunshine of passion which he only felt for this woman was long since past and gone nipped in its very bud by the lady herself perhaps he still liked her cold and cynical talk colquhoun habitually chose the most pleasant paths for his lounge through life from eighteen to forty there had been but one disagreeable episode which he would fain have forgotten mrs cassilis revived it but in her presence the memory was robbed somehow of half its sting sir benjamin backbite remarked that though the gentleman was languid the lady was shaken out of her habitual coldness she was changed what could change her asked the baronet but passion for this old friend of her youth why it was only four years since he had followed her after a london season down to scotland and everybody said it would be a match she received his attentions coldly then as she received the attentions of every man now the tables were turned it was the man who was cold these social observers are always right but they never rise out of themselves therefore their conclusions are generally wrong victoria cassilis was not as they charitably thought running after colquhoun through the fancy of a wayward heart not at all she was simply wondering where it had gone that old power of hers by which she once twisted him round her finger and why it was gone a woman cannot believe that she has lost her power over a man it is an intolerable thought her power is born of her beauty and her grace these may vanish but the old attractiveness remains she thinks if only as a tradition when she is no longer beautiful she loves to believe that her lovers are faithful still now victoria cassilis remembered this man as a lover and a slave his was the only pleading she had ever heard which could make her understand the meaning of man's passion he was the only suitor whom a word could make wretched or a look happy for he had once loved her with all his power and all his might between them there was the knowledge of a thing which if any knowledge could should have crushed out and beaten down the memory of this love she had made it by her own act and deed a crime to remember it and yet in spite of all she could not bring herself to remember that the old power was dead she tried to bring him again under influence she failed but she succeeded in making him come back to her as if nothing had ever happened and then she said to herself that there must be another woman and she set herself to find out who that woman was formerly many men had hovered marriageable men excellent partis round the cold and statuesque beauty of victoria pengelley she was an acknowledged beauty she brought an atmosphere of perfect taste and grace into a room with her men looked at her and wondered foolish girls who knew no better envied her presently the foolish girls who had soft faces and eyes which could melt in love or sorrow envied her no longer because they got engaged and married and of all the men who came and went there was but one who loved her so that his pulse beat quicker when she came who trembled when he took her hand whose nerves tingled and whose blood ran swifter through his veins when he asked her down in that quiet scotch village with no one to know it but her maid to be his wife the man was lawrence colquhoun the passion had been his now love and passion were buried in the ashes of the past the man was impassable and the woman madly kicking against the fetters which she had bound around herself was angry and jealous it is by some mistake of nature that women who cannot love can yet be jealous victoria pengelley's pulse never once moved the faster for all the impetuosity of her lover she liked to watch it this curious yearning after her beauty this eminently masculine weakness because it was a tribute to her power it is always pleasant for a woman to feel that she is loved as women are loved in novels men's novels not the pseudo passionate school girls' novels or the calmly respectable feminine tales where the young gentlemen and the young ladies are superior to the instincts of common humanity victoria played with this giant as an engineer will play with the wheels of a mighty engine she could do what she liked with it samson was not more pliable to delilah and delilah was not more unresponsive to that guileless strong man she soon got tired of her toy however scarcely were the morning and the evening of the fifth day when by pressing some unknown spring she smashed it altogether now when it was quite too late when the thing was utterly smashed when she had a husband and child she was actually trying to reconstruct it some philosopher probing more deeply than usual the mysteries of mankind once discovered that it was at all times impossible to know what a woman wants he laid that down as a general axiom and presented it as an irrefragable truth for the universal use of humanity one may sometimes however guess what a woman does not want victoria cassilis one may be sure did not want to sacrifice her honour her social standing or her future she was not intending to go off for instance with her old lover even if he should propose the step which seemed unlikely and yet she would have liked him to propose it because then she would have felt the recovery of her power now her sex as chaucer and others before him pointed out love power beyond all other earthly things and the history of queens from semiramis to isabella shows what a mess they always make of it when they do get power a curious problem given a woman no longer in the first bloom of youth married well and clinging with the instincts of her class to her reputation and social position she has everything to lose and nothing to gain she cannot hope even for the love of the man for whom she is incurring the suspicions of the world and exciting the jealousy of her husband yet it is true in her case what the race of evil speakers liars and slanderers say of her she is running after lawrence colquhoun he is too much with her she has given the enemy occasion to blaspheme as for colquhoun when he thought seriously over the situation he laughed when it was a fine day and swore if it was raining the english generally take a sombre view of things because it is so constantly raining we proclaim our impotence the lack of national spirit and our poverty until other nations actually begin to believe us but colquhoun though he might swear made no effort to release himself when a word would have done it you may use harsh language to me lawrence said mrs cassilis he never had used harsh language to any woman you may sneer at me and laugh in your cold and cruelly impassive manner but one thing i can say for you that you understand me i have seen all your moods mrs cassilis and i have a good memory if you will show your husband that the surface of the ocean may be stormy sometimes he will understand you a good deal better get up a little breeze for him i am certainly not going to have a vulgar quarrel with mr cassilis a vulgar quarrel vulgar ah vulgarity changes every five years or so what a pity that vulgar quarrels were in fashion six years ago mrs cassilis some men are not worth losing your temper about thank you i was i suppose it was very kind of you indeed to remind me of it as you then did in a manner at once forcible and not to be forgotten mr cassilis gets nothing i suppose but east wind with a cloudless sky which has the sun in it but only the semblance of warmth i got a good sou' wester but take care take care mrs cassilis you have wantonly thrown away once what most women would have kept kept mrs cassilis i remember when i was kneeling at your feet years ago talking the usual nonsense about being unworthy of you rubbish i was more than worthy of you because i could give myself to you loyally and you you could only pretend go on lawrence it is something that you regret the past and something to see that you can feel after all she stopped and laughed carelessly prick me and i sing out that is natural but we will have no heroics what i mean is that i am well out of it and that you victoria cassilis are forgive the plain speaking a foolish woman lawrence colquhoun has the right to insult me as he pleases and i must bear it it was in her own room colquhoun was leaning on the window she was sitting on a chair before him she was agitated and excited he save for the brief moments when he spoke as if with emotion was languid and calm i have no right he replied and you know it let us finish mrs cassilis keep what you have and be thankful what i have what have i one of the best houses in london an excellent social position a husband said to be the ablest man in the city an income which gives you all that a woman can ask for the confidence and esteem of your husband and a child do these things mean nothing my husband oh my husband he is insufferable sometimes when i remember lawrence he is a man who gives his trust after a great deal of doubt and hesitation then he gives it wholly to take it back would be a greater blow a far greater blow than it would ever be to a younger man to such a man as myself gabriel cassilis only suffers when he loses money that is not the case you cannot afford to make another great mistake success isn't on the cards after two such blunders mrs cassilis what do i want with success let me have happiness take it it is at your feet said lawrence it is in this house it is the commonest secret every simple country woman knows it no one will ever understand me she sighed no one it is simply to give up for ever thinking about yourself go and look after your baby and find happiness there why superior women are always so angry if they are asked to look after their babies i cannot understand there is no blinking the fact that they have them the maternal instinct makes women who cannot write or talk fine language about the domestic affections take to the tiny creatures with a passion of devotion which is the loveliest thing to look upon in all this earth the femme incomprise alone feels no anguish if her baby cries no joy if he laughs and flies into a divine rage if you remind her that she is a mother my baby cried victoria springing to her feet you see me yearning for sympathy looking to you as my oldest once my dearest friend for a little only a little interest and pity and you send me to my baby the world is all selfish and cold hearted but the most selfish man in it is lawrence colquhoun he laughed again after all he had said his say i am glad you think so because it simplifies matters now mrs cassilis we have had our little confidential talk and i think under the circumstances that it had better be the last so for a time we will not meet if you please i do take a certain amount of interest in you that is i am always curious to see what line you will take next and if you are at all concerned to have my opinion and counsel it is this that you've got your chance and if you give that man who loves you and trusts you any unhappiness through your folly you will be a much more heartless and wicked woman than even i have ever thought you and by gad i ought to know he left her mrs cassilis heard his step in the hall and the door close behind him then she ran to the window and watched him strolling in his leisurely careless way down the road it made her mad to think that she could not make him unhappy and made her jealous to think that she could no longer touch his heart not in love with him at all she never had been but jealous because her old power was gone jealous there must be another girl doubtless phillis fleming she ordered her carriage and drove straight to twickenham agatha was having one of her little garden parties jack dunquerque was there with gilead beck also captain ladds but lawrence colquhoun was not she stayed an hour she ascertained from phillis that her guardian seldom came to see her and went home again in a worse temper than before because she felt herself on the wrong track tomlinson her maid had a very bad time of it while she was dressing her mistress for dinner nothing went right somehow tomlinson the hard featured was long suffering and patient she made no reply to the torrent which flowed from her superior's angry lips but when respite came with the dinner bell and her mistress was safely downstairs the maid sat down to the table and wrote a letter very carefully this she read and re read and being finally satisfied with it she took it out to the post herself after that as she would not be wanted till midnight at least she took a cab and went to the marylebone theatre where she wept over the distresses of a lady ruined by the secret voice of calumny it was at the end of may and the season was at its height mrs cassilis had two or three engagements but she came home early and was even sharper with the unfortunate tomlinson than before dinner but tomlinson was very good and bore all in patience it is christian to endure next morning gabriel cassilis found among his letters another in the same handwriting as that of the three anonymous communications he had already received he tore it open with a groan this is the fourth letter you will have to take notice of my communications and to act upon them sooner or later all this morning mr colquhoun was locked up with your wife in her boudoir he came at eleven and went away at half past one no one was admitted they talked of many things of their scotch secret especially and how to hide it from you i shall keep you informed of what they do at half past two mrs cassilis ordered the carriage and drove to twickenham mr colquhoun has got his ward there miss fleming so that doubtless she went to meet him again in the evening she came home in a very bad temper because she had failed to meet him she had hoped to see him three times at least this very day surely surely even your blind confidence cannot stand a continuation of this kind of thing all the world knows it except yourself you may be rich and generous to her but she doesn't love you and she doesn't care for her child she hasn't asked to see it for three days think of that there is a pretty mother for you she ill treats her maid who is a most faithful person and devoted to your interests she is hated by every servant in the house she is a cold hearted cruel woman and even if she loves mr colquhoun it can only be through jealousy and because she won't let him marry anybody else even if he wanted to but things are coming to a crisis wait mr mowll came in with a packet of papers and found his master staring straight before him into space he spoke to him but received no answer then he touched him gently on the arm mr cassilis started and looked round hastily his first movement was to lay his hand upon a letter on the desk what is it mowll what is it i was thinking i was thinking i am not very well to day mowll you have been working too hard sir said his secretary yes yes it is nothing now then let us look at what you have brought for two hours mr cassilis worked with his secretary he had the faculty of rapid and decisive work and he had the eye of a hawk they were two hours of good work and the secretary's notes were voluminous suddenly the financier stopped the work half done it was as if the machinery of a clock were to go wrong without warning so he said with an effort i think we will stop for to day put all these matters at work mowll i shall go home and rest a thing he had never done before in all his life he went back to his house his wife was at home and alone they had luncheon together and drove out in the afternoon her calm and stately pride drove the jealous doubts from his troubled mind as the sun chases away the mists of morning chapter xxxiii an excellent play such things as dinners to literature were the relaxations of gilead beck's serious life his real business was to find an object worthy of that enormous income of which he found himself the trustee the most sympathetic man of his acquaintance although it was difficult to make him regard any subject seriously was jack dunquerque and to him he confided his anxieties and difficulties i can't fix it he groaned i can't fix it anyhow jack knew what he meant but waited for further light like him who readeth an acrostic the more i look at that growin' pile there's enough now to build the white house over again the more i misdoubt myself where have you got it all in government stocks by the help of mr cassilis no more of the unholy traffic in shares which you buy to sell again no sir that means makin' the widow weep and the minister swear an' i don't know which spectacle of those two is the more melancholy for a christian man all in stocks government stocks safe and easy to draw out with the interest comin' in regular as the chant of the cuckoo clock well can't you let it stay there no mr dunquerque i can't there's the voice of that blessed inseck in the box there night and day in my ears and it says plain as speech can make it 'do something with the money' you have bought a few pictures yes sir i have begun the great gilead p beck collection and when that is finished i guess there'll be no collection on this airth to show a candle to it but that's personal vanity that's not what the golden butterfly wants would he like you to have a yacht a good deal may be chucked over a yacht that is a good deal for what we englishmen call a rich man when i go home again i mean to build a yacht and sail her over here and race you people at cowes all the same as the america twenty years ago but not yet there are a few trifles going about which run away with money polo now if you play polo hard enough you may knock up a pony every game but i suppose that would not be expensive enough for you you couldn't ride two ponies at once i suppose like a circus fellow selfish luxury mr dunquerque said gilead with an almost prayerful twang is not the platform of the golden butterfly i should like to ride two ponies at once but it's not to be thought of and my legs are too long for any but a kentucky pony is the turf selfish luxury i wonder asked jack a good deal of money can be got through on the turf nothing of course compared with your pile but still you might make a sensible hole in it by judicious backing gilead beck was as free from ostentation vanity and the desire to have his ears tickled as any man but still he did like to feel that by the act of providence he was separated from other men an income of fifteen hundred pounds a day which does not depend upon harvests or on coal or on iron or anything to eat and drink but only on the demand for rock oil which increases as he often said with the march of civilisation does certainly separate a man from his fellows this feeling of division saddened him it imparted something of the greatness of soul which belongs even to the most unworthy emperors he felt himself bound to do something for the good of mankind while life and strength were in him and it was not unpleasant to know that others recognised the vastness of his luck therefore when jack dunquerque spoke as if the turf were a gulf which might be filled up with his fortune while it swallowed without growing sensibly more shallow all the smaller fortunes yearly shot into it like the rubbish on the future site of a suburban villa gilead beck smiled such recognition from this young man was doubly pleasant to him on account of his unbounded affection for him jack dunquerque had saved his life jack dunquerque treated him as an equal and a friend jack dunquerque wanted nothing of him and poor as he was would accept nothing of him jack dunquerque was the first as he was also the most favourable specimen he had met of the class which may be poor but does not seem to care for more money the class which no longer works for increase of fortune no sir said gilead i do not understand the turf when i go home i shall rear horses and improve the breed maybe i may run a horse in a trotting match at saratoga in the mornings this american in search of a worthy object devoted his time to making the round of hospitals london societies and charities of all kinds he asked what they did and why they did it he made remarks which were generally unpleasant to the employes of the societies he went away without offering the smallest donation and he returned moodily to the langham hotel the english he said after a fortnight of these investigations air the most kind hearted people in the hull world we are charitable and i believe the germans when they are not officers in their own army are a well disposed folk but in america when a man tumbles down the ladder he falls hard here there's every contrivance for makin' him fall soft a man don't feel handsome when he's on the broad of his back but it must be a comfort for him to feel that his backbone isn't broke lord mr dunquerque to look at the hospitals and refuges one would think the hull bible had got nothin' but the story of the prodigal son and that every other englishman was that misbehaved boy i reckon if the young man had lived in london he'd have gone home very slow most as slow as ever he could travel there'd be the hospitals comfortable and warm when his constitootion had broke down with too many drinks there'd have been the convalescent home for him to enjoy six months of happy meditation by the seaside when he was pickin' up again and when he got well would he take to the swine herdin' or would he tramp it home to the old man not he sir he would go back to the old courses and become a roper then more hospitals p'r'aps when he'd got quite tired and seen the inside of a state prison and been without his little comforts for a spell he'd have gone home at last just as i did for i was the prodigal son without the riotous livin' and found the old man gone leavin' him his blessin' the elder one would hand him the blessin' cheerfully and stick to the old man's farm then the poor broken down sportsman he'd tramp it back to london get into an almshouse with an allowance from a city charity and die happy there's another kind o' prodigal mr beck went on being in a mood for moralising she's of the other sex formerly she used to repent when she thought of what was before her there's a refuge before her now and kind women to take her by the hand and cry over her she isn't in any hurry for the cryin' to begin but it's comfortable to look forward to and so she goes on until she's ready twenty years fling maybe with nothing to do for her daily bread and then to start fair on the same level as the woman who has kept her self respect and worked i can't see my way clear mr dunquerque i can't it wouldn't do any kind of honour to the golden butterfly to lay out all of these dollars in helpin' up them who are bound to fall bound to fall there's only two classes of people in this world those who are goin' up and those who are goin' down it's no use tryin' to stop those who are on their way down let them go let them slide give them a shove down if you like and all the better because they will the sooner get to the bottom and then go up again till they find their own level it was in the evening at nine o'clock when gilead beck made the oration he was in his smaller room which was lit only by the twilight of the may evening and by the gas lamp in the street below he walked up and down talking with his hands in his pockets and silencing jack dunquerque who had never thought seriously about these or any other things by his earnestness every now and then he went to the window and looked into the street below the cabs rattled up and down and on the pavement the customary sight of a west end street after dark perhaps gave him inspiration their own level he repeated it yes sir there's a proper level for every one of us somewhere if only we can find it at the lowest depth of all there's the airth to be ploughed the hogs to be drove and the corn to be reaped i read the other day when i was studying for the great dinner that formerly if a man took refuge in a town he might stay there for a year and a day if then he could not keep himself they opened the gates and they ran him out on a plank same way as i left clearville city back to the soil he went back to the plough let those who are going down hill get down as fast as they can and go back to the soil i've sometimes thought he went on that there's a kind of work lower than agriculture it is to wear a black coat and do copying you take a boy and you make him a machine tell him to copy that is all why sir the rustic who feeds the pigs is a solomon beside that poor critter make your poor helpless paupers into clerks and make the men who've got arms and legs and no brains into farm labourers perhaps i shall build a city and conduct it on those principles then he stopped because he had run himself down and they began to talk of phillis but it seemed to jack a new and singular idea the weak must go to the wall but they might be helped to find their level he was glad for once that he had that small four hundred a year of his own because as he reflected his own level might be somewhere on the stage where the manufacture by hand say of upper leathers represents the proper occupation of the class a good many other fellows he thought among his own acquaintance might find themselves accommodated with boards for the cobbling business near himself and he looked at gilead beck with increased admiration as a man who had struck all this as well as ile out of his own head jack dunquerque suggested educational endowments mr beck made deliberate inquiries into the endowments of oxford and cambridge with a view of founding a grand national american university on the old lines to be endowed in perpetuity with the proceeds of his perennial oil fountains but there were things about these ancient seats of learning which did not commend themselves to him in his unscholastic ignorance he asked what was the good of pitting young men against each other like the gladiators in the arena to fight like them with weapons of no earthly modern use and when he was told of fellowships given to men for life as a prize for a single battle he laughed aloud he went down to eton he was mean enough to say of the masters that they made their incomes by over charging the butchers' and the grocers' bills and he said that ministers as he called them ought not to be grocers and of the boys he said that he thought it unwholesome for them that some should have unlimited pocket money and all should have unlimited tick also some one told him that eton boys no longer fight because they funk one another so that he came home sorrowful and scornful in my country he said we have got no scholarships and if the young men can't pay their professors they do without them and educate themselves and in my country the boys fight yes mr dunquerque you bet they do fight it was after an evening at the lyceum that gilead beck hit upon the grand idea of his life the idea struck him as they walked home it fell upon him like an inspiration and for the moment stunned him he was silent until he reached the hotel then he called a waiter get mr dunquerque a key he said he will sleep here that means mr dunquerque that we can talk all night if you please i want advice jack laughed he always did laugh it is a great privilege he said advising fortunatus it is a great privilege mr dunquerque returned fortunatus having an adviser who wants nothing for himself see that pile of letters every one a begging letter except that blue one on the top which is from a clergyman he's a powerful generous man sir he offers to conduct my charities at a salary of three hundred pounds a year mr beck then proceeded to unfold the great idea which had sprung up full grown in his brain that man sir he said meaning henry irving is a grand actor and they are using him up he wants rest i was an actor myself once and i've loved the boards ever since i was not a great actor i am bound to say that i did not act like mr henry irving quite the contrary once i was the hind legs of an elephant perhaps mr irving himself when he was a 'prentice was the fore legs i was on the boards for a month when the company busted up most things did bust up that i had to do with in those days i was the lawyer in flowers of the forest i was the demon with the keg to mr jefferson's rip van winkle once i played horatio that was when the mayor of constantinople city inaugurated his year of office by playin' hamlet he'd always been fond of the stage that mayor but through bein' in the soft goods line never could find time to go on so when he got the chance bein' then a matter of four and fifty of course he took it and he elected to play hamlet just to show the citizens what a whole souled mayor they'd got and the people in general what good play actin' meant the corporation attended in a body and sat in the front row of what you would call the dress circle all in store clothes and go to meetin' gloves it was a majestic and an imposing spectacle behind them was the fire brigade in uniform the citizens of constantinople and their wives and daughters crowded out the house wal sir we began whether it was they felt jealous or whether they felt envious that corporation laughed they laughed at the sentinels and they laughed at the moon they laughed at the ghost and they laughed at me horatio and then they laughed at hamlet i watched the mayor gettin' gradually riz any man's dander would presently he rose to that height that he went to the footlights and stood there facin' his own town council like a bull behind a gate they left off laughing for a minute and then they began again we are a grave people mr dunquerque i am told and the sight of those town councillors all laughin' together like so many free niggers before the war was most too much for any one the mayor made a speech that wasn't in the play 'hyar' he said lookin' solemn 'you jest gether up your traps and skin out of this i've got the say about this house and i arn't a goin' to have the folks incited to make game of their mayor so you kin jist light' they hesitated the mayor pointed to the back of the theatre 'git' he said again one of the town councillors rose and spoke 'mr mayor' he began 'or hamlet prince of denmark' 'wal sir' said the mayor 'didn't nero play in his own theaytre' 'mr mayor or hamlet or nero' e went on 'we came here on the presumption that we were paying for our places and bound to laugh if we were amused at the performance now sir this performance does amuse us considerable' 'you may presump' said the mayor 'what you dam please but git git at once or i'll turn on the pumps' it was the ghost who came to the front with the hose in his hands ready to begin the town council disappeared before he had time to play on them and we went on with the tragedy but it was spoiled sir completely spoiled and i have never acted since then so you see mr dunquerque i know somethin' about actin 'tisn't as if i was a raw youngster starting a theatrical idea all at once i thought of it to night while i saw a man actin who has the real stuff in him and only wants rest i mean to try an experiment in london and if it succeeds i shall take it to new york and make the american drama the greatest in all the world what will you do i said to myself in that theatre 'we want a place where we can have a different piece acted every week we want to give time for rehearsals and for alteration we want to bring up the level of the second rate actors we want more intelligence and we want more care' now mr dunquerque how would you tackle that problem i cannot say then i will tell you sir you must have three full companies you must give up expecting that theatre to pay its expenses you must find a rich man to pay for that theatre and he must pay up pretty handsome lord de molleteste took the royal hemisphere last year had he three companies sir no he only had one and that was a bad one wanted to bring out a new actress and no one went to see her cost him a hundred pounds a week till he shut it up well we will bring along new actresses too but in a different fashion they will have to work their way up from the bottom of the ladder my theatre will cost me a good deal more than a hundred pounds a week i expect but i am bound to run it the idea's in my head strong it's the thing to do a year or two in london and then for the states we shall have a grand national drama and the ile shall pay for it he took paper and pen and began to write three companies all complete for tragedy and comedy i've been to every theatre in london and i'm ready with my list now mr dunquerque you listen while i write them down i say first company not that there's any better or worse but because one must begin with something in the first i will have mr irving mr henry neville mr william farren mr toole mr emery miss bateman and miss nelly farren in the second mr george rignold i saw him in henry v last winter in the states mr hare mr kendal mr lionel brough mrs kendal and that clever little lady miss angelina claude in the third i will have mr phelps mr charles matthews mr w j hill mr arthur cecil mr kelly mr and mrs bancroft and mrs scott siddons if you could only get her i should ask mr alfred wigan to be a stage manager and general director and i would give him absolute power every company will play for a week and rehearse for a fortnight the principal parts shall not always be played by the best actors and i will not have any piece run for more than a week at a time and how do you think your teams would run together sir it would be a distinction to belong to that theatre and they would be well paid they will run together just for the very same reason as everybody runs together for their own interest i believe said jack that you have at last hit upon a plan for getting rid even of your superfluous cash it will cost a powerful lot i believe but lord mr dunquerque what better object can there be than to improve the stage think what it would mean the house properly managed no loafin' around behind the scenes every actor doing his darn best and taking time for study and rehearsal people comin' down to a quiet evening with the best artists to entertain them and the best pieces to play the stage would revive sir we should hear no more about the decay of the drama the drama decay that's bunkum sir that's the invention of the priests and the ministers who go about down cryin' what they can't have their own fingers in but i don't see how your scheme will encourage authors i shall pay them too sir i should say to mr byron 'sir you air a clever and a witty man go right away sir sit down for a twelvemonth and do nothin' at all then write me a play put your own situations in it not old jokes put your own situations in it not old ones give me somethin' better' then i should say to mr gilbert 'your pieces have got the real grit young gentleman but you write too fast go away too for six months and do nothin' then sit down for six months more and write a piece that will be pretty and sweet and won't be thin' and there's more dramatists behind only give them a chance they shall have it at my house and what will the other houses do the other houses sir may go on playing pieces for four hundred nights if they like i leave them plenty of men to stump their boards and my theatre won't hold more than a certain number i shall only take a small house to begin with such a house as the lyceum and we shall gradually get along but no profit can be made by such a stage and i am ready to give half my ile to keep it goin' of course he added when it is a success in london i shall carry it away company and all to new york he rose in a burst of enthusiasm gilead p beck shall be known for his collection of pictures he shall be known for his golden butterfly and the luck it brought him but he shall be best known mr dunquerque because he will be the first man to take the stage out of the mud of commercial enterprise and raise it to be the great educator of the people he shall be known as the founder of the grand national american drama and his bust shall be planted on the top of every american stage chapter xxxiv in such a cause who would not give what heart but leaps at such a name people of rank and position are apt to complain of begging letters surely england must be a happy country since its rich people complain mostly of begging letters for they are so easily dropped into the waste paper basket a country squire any man with a handle to his name and place for a permanent address is the natural prey and victim of the beggars the lithographed letter comes with every post trying in vain to look like a written letter and though in fervid sentences it shows the danger to your immortal soul if you refuse the pleading most men have the courage to resist the fact is that the letter is not a nuisance at all because it is never read on the other hand a new and very tangible nuisance is springing up it is that of the people who go round and call sir roger de coverly in his secluded village is free from the women who give you the alternative of a day with moody and sankey or an eternity of repentance he never sees the pair of sisters got up like roman catholic nuns who stand meekly before you arms crossed mutely refusing to go without five shillings at least for their ritualist hot house but he who lives in chambers he who puts up at a great hotel and becomes known he who has a house in any address from chester square to notting hill understands this trouble in some mysterious way gilead beck had become known perhaps this was partly in consequence of his habit of going to institutions charities and the like and wanting to find out everything in some vague and misty way it became known that there was at the langham hotel an american named gilead p beck who was asking questions philanthropically then all the people who live on philanthropists with all those who work for their pleasure among philanthropists began to tackle gilead p beck letters came in the morning which he read but did not answer circulars were sent to him of which he perhaps made a note telegrams were even delivered to him people somehow must read telegrams asking him for money those wonderful people who address the affluent in the times and ask for l on the security of an honest man's word those unhappy ladies whose father was a gentleman and an officer on the strength of which fact they ask the benevolent to help them in their undeserved distress poor things those disinterested advertisers who want a few hundreds and who will give fifteen per cent on the security of a splendid piano a small gallery of undoubted pictures and some unique china those tradesmen who try to stave off bankruptcy by asking the world generally for a loan on the strength of a simple reference to the clergyman of st tinpot hammersmith those artful dodgers mr ally sloper and his friends when they have devised a new and ingenious method of screwing money out of the rich all these people got hold of our gilead and pelted him with letters did they know the ingenious and the needy how the business is overdone they would change their tactics and go round calling it requires a front of brass entire absence of self respect and an epidermis like that of the rhinoceros for toughness to undertake this work yet ladies do it you want a temperament off which insults gibes sneers and blank refusals fall like water off a nasturtium leaf to go the begging round yet women do it they do it not only for themselves but also for their cause from ritualism down to atheism from the fashionable enthusiasm to the nihilism which the british workman is being taught to regard as the hidden knowledge there are women who will brave anything dare anything say anything and endure anything they love to be martyred so long especially as it does not hurt they are angry with the lukewarm zeal of their male supporters forgetting that a man sees the two sides of a question while a woman never sees more than one they mistake notoriety for fame and contempt for jealous admiration and here in the very heart of london was a man who seemed simply born for the polite beggar a man restless because he could not part with his money not seeking profitable investments not asking for ten and twenty per cent but anxious to use his money for the best purposes a man who was a philanthropist in the abstract who considered himself the trustee of a gigantic gift to the human race and was desirous of exercising that trust to the best advantage in london and at the same time in the same city thousands of people not only representing their individual distresses or their society's wants but also plans schemes and ideas for the promotion of civilisation in the abstract do we not all know the projectors i myself know at this moment six men who want each to establish a daily paper at least a dozen who would like a weekly fifty who see a way by the formation of a new society to check immorality kill infidelity once for all make men sober and women clean prevent strikes and destroy republicanism there is one man who would save the church of england by establishing the preaching order one who knows how to restore england to her place among the nations without a single additional soldier one who burns to abolish bishops' aprons and would make it penal to preach in a black gown the land teems with idea'd men they yearn pray and sigh daily for the capitalist who will reduce their idea to practice and besides the projectors there are the inventors i once knew a man who claimed to have invented a means for embarking and setting down passengers and goods on a railway without stopping the trains think of the convenience why no railways have taken up the invention i cannot explain then there are men who have inventions which will reform the whole system of domestic appliances there are others who are prepared on encouragement to reform the whole conduct of life by new inventions there are men by thousands brooding over experiments which they have no money to carry out there are men longing to carry on experiments whose previous failure they can now account for all these men are looking for a capitalist as for a messiah had they known had they but dimly suspected that such a capitalist was in june of last year staying at the langham hotel they would have sought that hotel with one consent and besieged its portals the world in general did not know mr beck's resources but they were beginning to find him out the voice of rumour was spreading abroad his reputation and the people wrote letters sent circulars and called twenty three of them came yesterday morning gilead beck complained to jack dunquerque three and twenty and all with a tale to tell no sir his voice rose in indignation i did not give one of them so much as a quarter dollar the luck of the golden butterfly is not to be squandered among the well dressed beggars of great britain three and twenty counting one little boy who came by himself his mother was a widow he said and he sat on the chair and sniffed and they all wanted money there was one man in a white choker who had found out a new channel for doing good and one man who wished to recommend a list of orphans the rest were women and talk there's no name for it with little books and pencils and bundles of tracts while he spoke there was a gentle tap at the door there's another of them he groaned stand by me mr dunquerque see me through with it come in come in good lord he whispered a brace this time will you tackle the young one mr dunquerque a pair of ladies one of them a lady tall and thin stern of aspect sharp of feature eager of expression she wore spectacles she was apparently careless of her dress which was of black silk a little rusty with her was a girl of about eighteen perhaps her daughter perhaps her niece a girl of rather sharp but pretty features marked by a look of determination as if she meant to see the bottom of this business or know the reason why you are mr beck sir the elder lady began i am gilead p beck madam he replied he was standing before the fireplace with his long hands thrust into his pocket one foot on an adjacent chair and his head thrown a little back defiantly you have received two letters from me mr beck written by my own hand and how many circulars child' twenty said the girl and i have had no answer i am come for your answer mr beck we will sit down if you please while you consider your answer mr beck took up a waste paper basket which stood at his feet and tossed out the whole contents upon the table those are the letters of yesterday and to day he said what was yours madam was it a letter asking for money it was yesterday there were seventy four letters asking for money to day there are only fifty two may i ask madam if you air the widow who wants money to run a mangle sir i am unmarried a mangle he dug his hand into the pile and took out one at random you air perhaps the young lady who writes to know if i want a housekeeper and encloses her carte de visite no that won't do is it possible you are the daughter of the confederate general who lost his life in the cause really sir then madam we come to the lady who here he read from another letter who was once a governess and now is reduced to sell her last remaining garments sir there was a withering scorn on the lady's lips i represent a cause mr beck i am not a beggar for myself my cause is the sacred one of womanhood you sir in your free and happy republic mr beck bowed have seen woman partially restored to her proper place on a level with man a higher level murmured the girl who had far off eyes and a sweet voice the higher level reached by the purer heart only partially restored at present but the good work goes on here we are only beginning mr beck the cause wants help your help he said nothing and she went on we want our rights we want suffrage we want to be elected for the houses of parliament we insist on equality in following the professions and in enjoying the endowments of education we shall prove that we are no whit inferior to men we want no privileges let us stand by ourselves wal madam their air helpers who shove up and i guess there air helpers who shove down she did not understand him and went on with increasing volubility the subjection of the sex is the most monstrous injustice of all those which blot the fair fame of manhood what is there in man's physical strength that he should use it to lord over the weaker half of humanity why has not our sex produced a shakespeare it has madam said mr beck gravely it has produced all our greatest men she was staggered your answer if you please mr beck i have no answer madam i have written you two letters and sent you twenty circulars urging upon you the claims of the woman's rights association i have the right to ask for a reply i expect one you will be kind enough sir to give categorically your answer to the several heads this you will do of your courtesy to a lady we can wait here while you write it i shall probably i ought to tell you publish it we can wait said the young lady they sat with folded hands in silence mr beck shifted his foot from the chair to the carpet then he took his hands out of his pockets and stroked his chin then he gazed at the ladies steadily jack dunquerque sat in the background and rendered no help whatever did you ever ladies asked mr beck after a few moments of reflection hear of paul deroon of memphis he was the wickedest man in that city which was allowed he kept a bar where the whisky was straight and the language was free and where paul would tell stories once you set him on calculated to raise on end the hair of your best sofa when the crusade began i mean the whisky crusade the ladies naturally began with paul deroon's saloon this is very tedious my dear said the elder lady in a loud whisper how did paul deroon behave some barkeepers came out and cursed while the whisky war went on some gave in and poured away the bourbon some shut up shop and took to preachin' paul just did nothing you couldn't tell from paul's face that he even knew of the forty women around him prayin' all together if he stepped outside he walked through as if they weren't there and they made a lane for him if he'd been blind and deaf and dumb paul deroon couldn't have taken less notice we shall not keep our appointment i fear the younger lady remarked they prayed preached and sang hymns for a whole week on sunday they sang eighty strong and on the seventh day paul took no more notice than on the first once they asked him if he heard the singin' he said he did and it was very soothin' and pleasant said too that he liked music to his drink then they asked him if he heard the prayers he said he did said too that it was cool work sittin' in the shade and listenin' also that it kinder seemed as if it was bound to do somebody or other good some day then they told him that the ladies were waitin' to see him converted he said it was very kind of them and for his own part he didn't mind meetin' their wishes half way and would wait as long as they did the ladies rose said the elder lady viciously you are unworthy sir to represent your great country you are a common scoffer general schenck represents my country madam you are unworthy of being associated with a great cause we have wasted our time upon you their departure was less dignified than their entry as they left the room another visitor arrived it was a tall and handsome man with a full flowing beard and a genial presence he had a loud voice and a commanding manner mr beck i thought so i wrote to you yesterday mr beck and i am come in person in person sir for your reply you air the gentleman sir interested in the orphan children of a colonial bishop no sir i am not nothing of the kind then you air perhaps the gentleman who wrote to say that unless i sent him a ten pound note by return of post he would blow out his brains i am major borington i wrote to you sir on behalf of the grand national movement for erecting international statues what is that movement sir a series of monuments to all our great men mr beck america and england have ancestors in common we have our shakespeare sir our milton yes sir so i have heard i did not know those ancestors myself having been born too late and therefore i do not take that interest in their stone figures you do positively mr beck you must join us it is your idea colonel is it mine mr beck i am proud to say it is my own i knew a man once colonel in my country who wanted to be a great man he had that ambition sir he wasn't particular how he got his greatness but he scorned to die and be forgotten and he yearned to go down to posterity his name sir was hiram turtle first of all he ambitioned military greatness we went into bull's run together and we came out of it together we came away from that field side by side we left our guns there too if we had had shields we should have left them as well hiram concluded sir after that experience to leave military greatness to others major borington interposed a gesture one moment brigadier the connection is coming hiram turtle thought the ministry opened up a field so he became a preacher yes he preached once but he forgot that a preacher must have something to say and so the elders concluded not to ask hiram turtle any more then he became clerk in a store while he looked about him for a year or two he wrote poetry but the papers in america he found were in a league against genius so he gave up that lay politics was his next move and he went for stump orating with the presidency in his eye stumpin' offers amusement as well as gentle exercise but it doesn't pay unless you get more than one brace of niggers and a bubbly jock to listen wal sir how do you think hiram turtle made his greatness he figured around sir with a list and his own name a top for a grand national monument to the memory of the great men who fell in the civil war they air still subscribing and hiram turtle is the great patriot now general you see the connection if you mean sir cried major borington to imply that my motives are interested not at all sir said mr beck i have told you a little story hiram turtle's was a remarkable case perhaps you might ponder on it your language is insulting sir colonel this is not a country where men have to take care what they say but if you should ever pay a visit out west and if you should happen to be about where tar and feathers are cheap you would really be astonished at the consideration you would receive no sir i shall not subscribe to your grand national association but go on captain go on this is a charitable country and the people haven't all heard the story of hiram turtle and what'll you take major but major borington clapping on his hat stalked out of the room the visits of the strong minded female and major borington which were typical took place on the day which was the first and only occasion on which phillis went to the theatre gilead beck took the box and they went jack dunquerque being himself the fourth as they say in greek exercise books to the lyceum and saw henry irving play hamlet phillis brought to the play none of the reverence with which english people habitually approach shakespeare insomuch that while we make superhuman efforts to understand him we have lost the power of criticism to her george iii's remark that there was a great deal of rubbish in shakspeare would have seemed a perfectly legitimate conclusion but she knew nothing about the great dramatist the house with its decorations lights and crowd pleased her she liked the overture and she waited with patience for the first scene she was going to see a representation of life done in show so much she understood instead of telling a story the players would act the story the ghost perhaps because the lyceum ghost was so palpably flesh and blood inspired her with no terror at all but gradually the story grew into her and she watched the unfortunate prince of denmark torn by his conflicting emotions distraught with the horror of the deed that had been done and the deed that was to do with a beating heart and trembling lip when hamlet with that wild cry threw himself upon his uncle's throne she gasped and caught agatha by the hand when the play upon the stage showed the king how much of the truth was known she trembled and looked to see him immediately confess his crime and go out to be hanged she was indignant with hamlet for the slaughter of polonius she was contemptuous of ophelia whom she did not understand and she was impatient when the two gravediggers came to the front resolute to spare the audience none of their somewhat musty old jokes and to abate nothing of the stage business when they left the theatre phillis moved and spoke as in a dream war battle conspiracy murder crime all these things of which her guardian had told her she saw presented before her on the stage she had too much to think of she had to fit all these new surroundings in her mind with the stories of the past as for the actors she had no power whatever of distinguishing between them and the parts they played irving was hamlet miss bateman was ophelia and they were all like the figures of a dream because she did not understand how they could be anything but hamlet ophelia and the court of denmark and this too was part of her education chapter xxxv love in her eyes lay hiding his time in patience biding square it with colquhoun before you go any farther said ladds square it with the guardian speak to the young lady's father make it all right with the authorities what excellent advice to give and how easy to follow it up who does not look forward with pleasure or backward as to an agreeable reminiscence to that half hour spent in a confidential talk with dear papa how calmly critical how severely judicial was his summing up with what a determined air did he follow up the trail elicited in cross examination of former sins with how keen a scent did he disinter forgotten follies call attention to bygone extravagances or place the finger of censure upon debts which never ought to have been incurred and economies which ought to have been made remember his finally a word which from childhood has been associated with sweet memories because it brings the sermon to an end but which henceforth will awake in your brain the ghost of that mauvais quart d'heure in that brief peroration he tore the veil from the last cherished morsel of self illusion he showed you that the furnishing of a house was a costly business that he was not going to do it for you that servants require an annual income of considerable extent that his daughter had been brought up a lady that lady's dress is a serious affair that wedlock in due season brings babies and that he was not so rich as he seemed well perhaps he said yes reluctantly in spite of drawbacks then you felt that you were regarded by the rest of the family as the means of preventing dear annabella from making a brilliant match that humbled you for life or perhaps he said no in that case you went away sadly and meditated suicide and whether you got over the fit or whether you didn't though of course you did the chances were that annabella never married at all and you are still regarded by the family as the cause of that sweet creature not making the exceptionally splendid alliance which but for you the disturbing influence would have been her lot however the thing is necessary unless people run away a good old fashion by which such interviews together with wedding breakfasts wedding garments and wedding presents were avoided running away is out of fashion it would have been the worst form possible in jack dunquerque even to propose such a thing to phillis and i am not at all certain that he would ever have made her understand either the necessity or the romance of the thing and i am quite sure that she would never understand that jack dunquerque was asking her to do a wrong thing certainly it was not likely that this young man would proceed further in the path of irregularity which leads to repentance than he had hitherto done he had now to confess before the young lady's guardian something of the part he played looked at dispassionately and unsoftened by the haze of illusion this part had as he acknowledged with groans an appearance far from pleasing to the christian moralist he had taken advantage of the girl's total ignorance to introduce himself at the house where she was practically alone for the whole day he found her like a child in the absence of the reserve which girls are trained to he stepped at once into the position of a confidential friend he took her about for walks and drives a thing which might have compromised her seriously he allowed joseph jagenal without it is true stating it in so many words to believe him an old friend of phillis's he followed her to twickenham and installed himself at mrs l'estrange's as an ami de famille he had done so much to make the girl's life bright and happy he was so dear to her that he felt there was but one step to be taken to pass from a brother to a lover it was a black record to look at and it was poor consolation to think that any other man would have done the same jack dunquerque like phillis herself was changed within a month somehow the fun and carelessness which struck gilead beck as so remarkable in a man of five and twenty were a good deal damped for the first time in his life he was serious for the first time he had a serious and definite object before him he was perfectly serious in an unbounded love for phillis day by day the sweet beauty of the girl her grace her simple faith her child like affection sank into his heart and softened him day after day as he rowed along the meadows of the thames or lazied under the hanging willows by the shore or sat with her in the garden or rode along the leafy roads by her side the sincerity of her nature as clear and cloudless as the blue depths of heaven its purity like the bright water that leaps and bubbles and flows beneath the shade of lebanon its perfect truthfulness like the midday sunshine in june the innocence with which even as another eve she bared her very soul for him to read these things when he thought of them brought the unaccustomed tears to his eyes and made his spirit rise and bound within him as to unheard of heights for love to an honest man is like nature to a poet or colour to an artist it makes him see great depths and gives him if only for once in his life a pisgah view of a land far far holier a life far far higher a condition far far sweeter and nobler than anything in this world can give us except the love of a good woman in such a vision the ordinary course of our life is suspended we move on air we see men as trees walking and regard them not happy the man who once in his life has been so lifted out of the present and knows not afterwards whether he was in the flesh or out of the flesh jack with the influence of this great passion upon him was transformed fortunately for us this emotion had its ebb and flow else that great dinner to literature had never come off but at all times he was under its sobering influence and it was in a penitent and humble mood that he sought lawrence colquhoun in the hope of squaring it with him as ladds advised good fellow tommy none better but wanting in the higher delicacy somehow the common words and phrases of every day use applied to phillis jarred upon him after all one feels a difficulty in offering a princess the change for a shilling in coppers if i had to do it i should fall back on a draught upon the cheque bank lawrence was full of his own annoyances most of us always are and it is one of the less understood ills of life that one can never get even for five minutes a monopoly of complaint but he listened patiently while jack jack of the rueful countenance poured out his tale of repentance woe and prayer you see he said winding up i never thought what it would come to i dropped into it by accident and then then when people come to flirt they stay to spoon said lawrence in other words my dear fellow you are in love ah jack wondered what was meant by the interjection in all the list of interjections given by lindley murray or the new light dr morris such as pish phaw alas humph and the rest which are in everybody's mouth there is none which blows with such an uncertain sound as this impossible to tell whether it means encouragement sympathy or cold distrust ah said lawrence sit down and be comfortable jack when one is really worried nothing like a perfect chair take my own now then let us talk it over it doesn't look well thought jack always face the situation said lawrence he had got an uncommonly awkward situation of his own to face and it was a little relief to turn to some one else's nothing done by blinking facts here we are young lady of eighteen or so just released from a convent ignorant of the world pretty attractive ways rich as girls go on the one hand on the other you good looking as my cousin agatha l'estrange says though i can't see it of a cheerful disposition aptus ludere fit to play cum puella all the day don't chaff colquhoun it's too serious but colquhoun went on an inflammable young man well with any other girl the danger would have been seen at once poor phillis is so innocent that she is supposed to be quite safe so you go on calling my cousin agatha writes me word that she has been looking for the light of love as she calls it in phillis's eyes and it isn't there she is a sentimentalist and therefore silly why didn't she look in your eyes jack that would have been very much more to the purpose she has now i told her yesterday that i i loved phillis did she ask you to take the young lady's hand and a blessing at once come jack look at the thing sensibly there are two or three very strong reasons why it can't be why it can't be echoed jack dolefully first the girl hasn't come out now i ask you would it not be simply sinful not to give her a fair run in any case you could not be engaged till after she has had one season then her father who did not forget that he was grandson of a peer wanted his daughter to make a good match and always spoke of the fortune he was to leave her as a guarantee that she would marry well he never thought he was going to die of course but all events i know so much of his wishes lastly my dear jack dunquerque you are the best fellow in the world but you know but but i am not lord isleworth that is just it you are his lordship's younger brother with one or two between you and the title now don't you see need we talk about it any more i suppose phil i mean miss fleming will be allowed to choose for herself you are not going to make her marry a man because he happens to have a title and an estate and offers himself i suppose said lawrence laughing that i am going to lock phillis up in a tower until the right man comes no no jack there shall be no compulsion if she sets her heart upon marrying you she is a downright young lady why she must do it but after she has had her run among the ball rooms not before let her take a look round first there will be other jack dunquerques ready to look at be sure of that perhaps she will think them fairer to outward view than you if she does you will have to give her up in the end you know i have said no word of love to her colquhoun i give you my honour said jack hotly i don't think she would understand it if i did i am glad of that at least if i am to give her up and go away i dare say the poor youth went on with a little choking in his throat that she will regret me at first and for a day or two but she will get over that and as you say there are plenty of fellows in the world better than myself and my dear jack there will be no going away you tell me you have not told her all the effect that her beaux yeux have produced upon you well then and there has been nothing to compromise her at all nothing that is once we went to the tower in a hansom cab oh that is all is it jack dunquerque jack dunquerque and we have been up the river a good many times in a boat i see the river is pleasant at this time of the year and we have been riding together a good deal phil rides very well you know does she it seems to me jack that my cousin agatha is a fool and that you have been having rather a high time in consequence surely you can't complain if i ask you to consider the innings over for the present no i can't complain if one may hope let us hope nothing sufficient for the day he who hopes nothing gets everything come out of it at once jack before you get hit too hard i think no one was ever hit so hard before said jack colquhoun you don't know your ward it is impossible for any one to be with her without falling in love with her she is here he stopped because he could not go any farther anybody who did not know the manly nature of jack dunquerque might have thought he was stopped by emotion we all get the fever some time or other but we worry through look at me jack i am forty and as you see a comparatively hale and hearty man despite my years it doesn't shorten life that kind of fever it doesn't take away appetite it doesn't interfere with your powers of enjoyment there is even a luxury about it you can't remember geraldine arundale now lady newladegge when she came out of course you were getting ready for eton about that time well she and i carried on for a whole season people talked then she got engaged to her present husband after seeing him twice she wanted a title you see i was very bad that journey and i remember that agatha who was in my confidence had a hot time of it over the faithlessness of shallow hearts but i got over the attack and i have not been dangerously ill so to speak since that is i have made a contemptible ass of myself on several occasions and i dare say i shall go on making an ass of myself as long as i live because the older you grow somehow the sweeter do the flowers smell jack only groaned it really is no kind of consolation to tell a suffering man that you have gone through it yourself gilead beck told me once of a man who lived in one of the southern states of america he was a mild and placid creature inoffensive as a canary bird quiet as a mongoose and much esteemed for his unusual meekness this harmless being once got ear ache very bad ear ache boyhood's ear aches are awful things to remember but those of manhood when they do come which is seldom are the devil to him in agony came a friend who sat down beside him like eliphaz the temanite and sighed this the harmless being who had the ear ache put up with though it was irritating presently the friend began to relate how he once had the ear ache himself then the harmless creature rose up suddenly and seizing an adjacent chunk of wood gave that friend a token of friendship on the head with such effect that he ceased the telling of that and all other stories and has remained quite dumb ever since the jury acquitted that inoffensive and meek creature who wept when the ear ache was gone and often laid flowers on the grave of his departed friend jack did not heave chunks of wood at colquhoun he only looked at him with ineffable contempt lady newladegge why she's five and thirty and she's fat she wasn't always five and thirty nor was she always fat on the contrary when she was twenty and i was in love with her she was slender and if one may so speak of a peeress she was cuddlesome cuddlesome jack cried his deepest feelings outraged good heavens to think of comparing phil with a woman who was once cuddlesome lawrence colquhoun laughed in fifteen years or thereabouts perhaps you will take much the same view of things as i do meantime jack let things remain as they are you shall have a fair chance with the rest and you must remember that you have had a much better chance than anybody else because you have had the first running leave off going to twickenham quite so much but don't stop going altogether or phillis may be led to suspect can't you contrive to slack off by degrees jack breathed a little more freely the house then was not shut to him the young lady will have her first season next year i don't say i hope she will marry anybody else jack but i am bound to give her the chance as soon as she really understands a little more of life she will find out for herself what is best for her perhaps now we've talked enough about it jack dunquerque went away sorrowful he expected some such result of this endeavour to square it with colquhoun but yet he was disappointed hang it all jack said ladds what can you want more you are told to wait a year no one will step in between you and the young lady till she comes out you are not told to discontinue your visits only not to go too often and not to compromise her what more does the man want you are a very good fellow tommy sighed the lover a very good fellow in the main but you see you don't know phil let me call her phil to you old man there's not another man in the world that i could talk about her to not one by jove it would seem a desecration go on jack talk away and i'll give you good advice he did talk away what says solomon ointment and perfume rejoice the soul so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel the wise man might have expressed himself more clearly but his meaning can be made out meantime lawrence colquhoun pulling himself together after jack went away remembered that he had not once gone near his ward since he drove her to twickenham it is too bad said conscience a whole month it is all that woman's fault he pleaded i have been dangling about in obedience to her like a fool like a fool echoed conscience he went that very day and was easily persuaded to stay and dine with the two ladies he said very little but agatha observed him watching his ward closely after dinner she got a chance it was a pleasant evening early in june they had strawberries on a garden table phillis presently grew tired of sitting under the shade and strolled down to the river side where she sat on the grass and threw biscuits to the swans what do you think lawrence he was watching her in silence i don't understand it agatha what have you done to her nothing are you pleased you are a witch i believe you must have a familiar somewhere she is wonderful wonderful is she a ward to be proud of and to love lawrence is she the sweetest and prettiest girl you ever saw my dear cousin i declare to you that i think her faultless at least her very faults are attractive she is impetuous and self willed but she is full of sympathy and that seems to have grown up in her altogether in the last few months her manner appears to be more perfect than anything i have ever seen it is because she has no self consciousness she is like a child still my dear phillis so far i wonder if it is because she cannot read why should we not prohibit the whole sex from learning to read nonsense lawrence what would the novelists do besides she is learning to read fast i put her this morning into the third lesson book two syllables and it is not as if she were ignorant because she knows a great deal then why is it i think her sweet nature has something to do with it and besides she has been shielded from many bad influences we send girls to school and and well lawrence we cannot all be angels any more than men if girls learn about love and establishments and flirtations and the rest of it why they naturally want their share of these good things then they get self conscious what about jack dunquerque asked lawrence abruptly he has been to me about her agatha blushed as prettily as any self conscious young girl he loves phillis she said but phillis only regards him as a brother agatha you are no wiser than little red riding hood jack dunquerque is a wolf i am sure he is a most honourable good young man as for good goodness knows honourable no doubt and a wolf you are a matchmaker you bad bad woman i believe you want him to marry that young princess over there and what did you tell poor jack told him to wait acted the stern guardian won't have an engagement must let phillis have her run mustn't come here perpetually trying to gobble up my dainty heiress think upon that now cousin agatha she could not marry into a better family very true the dunquerques had an ark of their own i believe at the deluge but then jack is not lord isleworth and he isn't ambitious and he isn't clever and he isn't rich go on lawrence it is charming to see you in a new character lawrence the prudent charmed to charm la belle cousine he is in love and he is hit as hard as any man i ever saw but phillis shall not be snapped up in this hasty and inconsiderate manner there are lots of better partis in the field then phillis came back dangling her hat by its ribbons the setting sun made a glory of her hair lit up the splendour of her eyes and made a clear outline of her delicate features and tall shapely figure come and sit by me phillis said her guardian i have neglected you agatha will tell you that i am a worthless youth of forty who neglects all his duties you are so much improved my child that i hardly knew you prettier and and everything how goes on the education reading and writing said phillis do not make education really lawrence you ought to know better a year or two with mr dyson would have done you much good i am in words of two syllables and agatha thinks i am getting on very nicely i am in despair about my painting since we have been to picture galleries and to think how conceited i was once over it but i can draw lawrence i shall not give up my drawing and you liked your galleries some of them the academy was tiring why don't they put all the portraits in one room together so that we need not waste time over them what did you look at i looked at what all the other people pressed to see first of all there was a picture of waterloo with the french and english crowded together so that they could shake hands it was drawn beautifully but somehow it made me feel as if war was a little thing mr dyson used to say that women take the grandeur and strength out of art then there was a brown man with a sling on a platform the platform rested on stalks of corn and if the man were to throw the stone he would topple over and tumble off his platform and there was another one of a row of women going to be sold for slaves a curious picture and beautifully painted but i did not like it what did you like i liked some that told their own story and made me think there was a picture of a moor take me to see a moor lawrence with a windy sky and a wooden fence and a light upon oh i liked all the landscapes i think our artists feel trees and sunshine but what is my opinion worth come with me to morrow phillis we will go through the pictures together and you shall teach me what to like your opinion worth why child all the opinions of all the critics together are not worth yours chapter xxxvi what is it that has been done these anonymous letters and this fit of jealousy the more dangerous because it was a new thing came at an awkward time for gabriel cassilis he had got big things in hand and the eyes of the city he felt were on him it was all important that he should keep his clearness of vision and unclouded activity of brain for the first time in his life his operations equalled or nearly approached his ambition for the first time he had what he called a considerable sum in his hands that is to say there was his own money he was reported to be worth three hundred thousand pounds gilead beck's little pile with his unlimited credit and smaller sums placed in his hands for investment by private friends such as colquhoun ladds and others a total which enabled him to wait and the share market oscillating and telegrams in cipher reaching him from all quarters and gabriel cassilis unable to work tormented by the one thought like io by her gad fly attacked by fits of giddiness which made him cling to the arms of his chair and relying on a brain which was active indeed because it was filled with a never ending succession of pictures in which his wife and colquhoun always formed the principal figures but which refused steady work gabriel cassilis was a gamester who played to win his game was not the roulette table where the bank holds one chance out of thirty and must win in the long run it was a game in which he staked his foresight knowledge of events financial connections and calm judgment against greed panic enthusiasm and ignorance it was his business to be prepared against any turn of the tide he would have stood calmly in the rue quincampoix buying in and selling out up to an hour before the smash and that would have found him without a single share in law's great scheme a great game but a difficult one it requires many qualities and when you have got these it requires a steady watchfulness and attention to the smallest cloud appearing on the horizon there were many clouds on the horizon his grand coup was to be in eldorado stock thanks to mr wylie's pamphlet they went down and gabriel cassilis bought in bought all he could and the stock went up there was a fortnight before settling day they went up higher and yet higher el senor don bellaco de la carambola minister of the eldorado republic at st james's wrote a strong letter to the daily papers in reply to mr wylie's pamphlet he called attention to the rapid the enormous advance made in the state as no one had seen the place it was quite safe to speak of buildings banks commercial prosperity and openings up it appeared indeed from his letter that the time of universal wealth long looked for by mankind was actually arrived for eldorado the stock went higher half the country clergy who had a few hundreds in the bank wanted to put them in eldorado stock still gabriel cassilis made no move but held on and every day to get another of those accursed letters with some new fact every day to groan under fresh torture of suspicion every day to go home and dine with the calm cold creature whose beauty had been his pride and try to think that this impassive woman could be faithless this torture lasted for weeks it began when colquhoun first went to his house and continued through may into june his mental sufferings were so great that his speech became affected he found himself saying wrong words or not being able to hit upon the right word at all so he grew silent when he returned home which was now early he hovered about the house or he crept up to his nursery and played with his year old child and the nurses noticed how while he laughed and crowed to please the baby the tears came into his eyes the letters grew more savage he would take them out and look at them some of the sentences burned into his brain like fire as mr lawrence colquhoun is the only man she ever loved ask her for the secret they think no one knows it does she care for the child your child ask tomlinson how often she sees it when you go to your office mr colquhoun comes to your house when you come home he goes out of it then they meet somewhere else ask him for the secret then ask her and compare what they say five years ago mr lawrence colquhoun and miss pengelley were going to be married everybody said so she went to scotland he went after her ask him why you are an old fool with a young wife she loves your money not you she despises you because you are a city man and she loves mr colquhoun he sat alone in his study after dinner reading these wretched things in misery of soul and a thought came across him i will go and see colquhoun he said i will talk to him and ask him what is this secret it was about ten o'clock he put on his hat and took a cab to colquhoun's chambers on that day lawrence colquhoun was ill at ease it was borne in upon him with especial force probably because it was one of the sultry and thunderous days when conscience has it all her own disagreeable way that he was and had been an enormous ass by some accident he was acquainted with the fact that he had given rise to talk by his frequent visits to victoria cassilis and to think he said to himself that i only went there at her own special request and because she likes quarrelling he began to think of possible dangers not to himself but to her and to her husband even old stories revived and things forgotten and brought to light and the thing which she had done came before him in its real shape and ghastliness a bad and ugly thing a thing for whose sake he should have fled from her presence and avoided her a thing which he was guilty in hiding no possible danger to himself well in some sense none in every other sense all dangers he had known of this thing and yet he sat at her table he was conscious of the crime and yet he was seen with her in public places he was almost particeps criminis because he did not tell what he knew and yet he went day after day to her house for the pleasure of quarrelling with her he sat down and wrote to her he told her that perhaps she did not wholly understand him when he told her that the renewed acquaintance between them must cease that considering the past and with an eye to the future he was going to put it out of her power to compromise herself by seeing her no more he reminded her that she had a great secret to keep unknown and a great position to lose and then he begged her to give up her wild attempts at renewing the old ties of friendship the letter considering what the secret really was seemed a wretched mockery to the writer but he signed it and sent it by his servant then he strolled to his club and read the papers before dinner but he was not easy there was upon him the weight of impending misfortune he dined and tried to drown care in claret but with poor success then he issued forth it was nine o'clock and still light and walked gently homewards he walked so slowly that it was half past nine when he let himself into his chambers in the albany his servant was out and the rooms looked dismal and lonely they were not dismal being on the second floor where it is light and airy and being furnished as mediaeval bachelorhood with plenty of money alone understands furniture but he was nervous to night and grim stories came into his mind of spectres and strange visitors to lonely men in chambers such things happen mostly he remembered on twilight evenings in midsummer he was quite right the only ghost i ever saw myself was in one of the inns of court in chambers at nine o'clock on a june evening he made haste to light a lamp no such abomination as gas was permitted in lawrence colquhoun's chambers it was one of the silver reading lamps good for small tables and provided with a green shade so that the light might fall in a bright circle which was cimmertian blackness shading off into the sepia of twilight it was his habit too to have lighted candles on the mantelshelf and on a table but to night he forgot them so that except for the light cast upwards by the gas in the court and an opposite window illuminated and for the half darkness of the june evening the room was dark it was very quiet too there was no footsteps in the court below and no voices or steps in the room near him his nearest neighbour young lord orlebar would certainly not be home much before one or two when he might return with a few friends connected with the twin services of the army and the ballet for a little cheerful supper below him was old sir richard de counterpane who was by this time certainly in bed and perhaps sound asleep very quiet he had never known it more quiet and he began to feel as if it would be a relief to his nerves were something or somebody to make a little noise he took a novel one that he had begun a week ago whether the novel of the day is inferior to the novel of colquhoun's youth or whether he was a bad reader of fiction certainly he had been more than a week over the first volume alone now it interested him less than ever he threw it away and lit a cigar and then his thoughts went back to victoria what was the devil which possessed the woman that she could not rest quiet what was the meaning of this madness upon her a cold an arctic woman lawrence murmured cold when i told her how much i loved her cold when she engaged herself to me cold in her crime and yet she follows me about as if she was devoured by the ardour of love like another sappho it was not that lawrence colquhoun it was the spretae injuria formae the jealousy and hatred caused by the lost power i wish he said starting to his feet and walking like the polar bear across his den and back again i wish to heaven i had gone on living in the empire city with my pair of villainous chinamen at least i was free from her over there and when i saw her marriage by gad i thought it was a finisher then i came home again he stopped in his retrospection because he heard a foot upon the stairs a woman's foot a light step and a quick step may be de counterpane's nurse too early for one of young orlebar's friends can't be anybody for me but it was and a woman stopped at his doorway and seeing him alone stepped in she had a hooded cloak thrown about an evening dress the hood was drawn completely over her face so that you could see nothing of it in the dim light and she came in without a word then colquhoun who was no coward felt his blood run cold because he knew by her figure and by her step that it was victoria cassilis she threw back the hood with a gesture almost theatrical and stood before him with parted lips and flashing eyes his spirits rallied a little then because he saw that her face was white and that she was in a royal rage lawrence colquhoun could tackle a woman in a rage that is indeed elementary and nothing at all to be proud of the really difficult thing is to tackle a woman in tears and distress the stoutest heart quails before such an enterprise what is this she began with a rush as of the liberated whirlwind what does this letter mean lawrence exactly what it says mrs cassilis may i ask is it customary for married ladies to visit single gentlemen in their chambers and at night it is not usual for married ladies to visit single gentlemen lawrence do not ask foolish questions tell me what this means i say it means that my visits to your house have been too frequent and that they will be discontinued in other words mrs cassilis the thing has gone too far and i shall cease to be seen with you i suppose you know that people will talk let them talk what do i care how people talk lawrence if you think that i am going to let you go like this you are mistaken i believe this poor lady has gone mad said lawrence quietly it was not the best way to quiet and soothe her but he could not help himself you think you are going to play fast and loose with me twice in my life and you are mistaken you shall not years ago you showed me what you are cold treacherous and crafty go on victoria i like that kind of thing because now i know that you are not mad quite in your best style and i forgave you when you returned and allowed you once more to visit me what other woman would have acted so to such a man yet she must be mad said lawrence how else could she talk such frightful rubbish once more we have been friends again you have drawn me on until i have learned to look to you for the second time for the appreciation denied to me by my mr cassilis no sir this second desertion must not and shall not be one would think said lawrence helplessly that we had not quarrelled every time we met now mrs cassilis you have my resolution what you please in your sweet romantic way to call second desertion must be and shall be then i will know the reason why i have told you the reason why don't be a fool mrs cassilis ask yourself what you want do you want me to run away with you i am a lazy man i know and i generally do what people ask me to do but as for that thing i am damned if i do it insult me lawrence she cried sinking into a chair swear at me as you will do you wish me to philander about your house like a ridiculous tame cat till all the world cries out she started to her feet no she cried i care nothing about your coming and going but i know why oh i know why you make up this lame excuse about my good name my good name as if you cared about that more than you cared about it yourself he retorted but pray go on it is phillis fleming i saw it from the very first you began by taking her away from me and placing her with your cousin where you could have her completely under your own influence you let jack dunquerque hang about her at first just to show the ignorant creature what was meant by flirtation and then you send him about his business lawrence you are more wicked than i thought you jealousy by gad he cried did ever mortal man hear of such a thing jealousy and after all that she has done i warn you you may do a good many things you may deceive and insult me in any way except one but you shall never never marry phillis fleming colquhoun was about to reply that he never thought of marrying phillis fleming but it occurred to him that there was no reason for making that assertion so he replied nothing i escaped she said under pretence of being ill and i made them fetch me a cab to come away in my cab is at the burlington gardens end of the court now before i go you shall make me a promise lawrence you used to keep your promises to act as if this miserable letter had not been written i shall promise nothing of the kind then remember lawrence you shall never marry phillis fleming not if i have to stop it by proclaiming my own disgrace you shall not marry that girl or any other girl i have that power over you at any rate now i shall go there is some one on the stairs said lawrence quietly perhaps he is coming here you had better not be seen best go into the other room and wait there was only one objection to her waiting in the other room and that was that the door was on the opposite side that the outer oak was wide open that the step upon the stairs was already the step upon the landing and that the owner of the step was already entering the room mrs cassilis instinctively shrank back into the darkest corner that near the window the curtains were of some light coloured stuff she drew them closely round her and cowered down covering her head with the hood like guinevere before her injured lord for the late caller was no other than her own husband gabriel cassilis as he stood in the doorway the light of the reading lamp mrs cassilis in one of her gestures had tilted up the shade fell upon his pale face and stooping form colquhoun noticed that he stooped more than usual and that his grave face bore an anxious look such a look as one sees sometimes in the faces of men who have long suffered grievous bodily pain he hesitated for a moment tapping his knuckles with his double eyeglasses his habitual gesture i came up this evening colquhoun are you quite alone as you see mr cassilis said colquhoun he looked hastily round the room in the corner he saw the dim outline of the crouching form he adjusted the shade and turned the lamp a little lower the gas in the chambers on the other side of the narrow court was put out and the room was almost dark as you see mr cassilis and what gives me the pleasure of this late call from you i thought i would come i came to say he stopped helplessly and threw himself into a chair it was a chair standing near the corner in which his wife was crouching and he pushed it back until he might have heard her breathing close to his ear and if he had put forth his hand might have touched her glad to see you always mr cassilis you came to speak about some money matters i have an engagement in five minutes but we shall have time i dare say an engagement ah a lady perhaps this with a forced laugh because he was thinking of his wife a lady yes yes a lady young men young men said gabriel cassilis well i will not keep you i came here to speak to you about about my wife o lord cried lawrence i beg your pardon about mrs cassilis yes it is a very stupid business you have known her for a long time i have mr cassilis for nearly eight years ah old friends and once i believe people thought once mr cassilis i myself thought i cannot tell you what i thought victoria pengelley might be to me but that is over long since one for her thought lawrence whose nerves were steady in danger his two listeners trembled and shook but from different causes over long since repeated gabriel cassilis there was nothing in it then we were two persons entirely dissimilar in disposition mr cassilis lawrence replied evasively perhaps i was not worthy of her her calm clear judgment another for her he thought with a chuckle the situation would have pleased him but that he felt sorry for the poor man victoria is outwardly cold yet capable of the deepest emotions it is on her account colquhoun that i come here foolish gossip has been at work connecting your names i think it the best thing without saying anything to victoria who must never suspect never suspect echoed colquhoun that i ever heard this absurdity but we must guard her from calumny colquhoun caesar's wife you know and and i think that perhaps if you were to be a little less frequent in your calls and i quite understand mr cassilis and i am not in the least offended i assure you most sincerely i wish mrs cassilis were here to listen that i am deeply sorry for having innocently put you to the pain of saying this however the world shall have no further cause of gossip no motion or sign from the dark corner where the hiding woman crouched mr cassilis rose and tapped his knuckles with his glasses thank you colquhoun it is good of you to take this most unusual request so kindly with such a wife as mine jealousy would be absurd but i have to keep her name from even a breath even a breath quite right mr cassilis he looked round the room snug quarters for a bachelor ah i lived in lodgings always myself i thought i heard a woman's voice as i came up stairs from sir richard de counterpane's rooms down stairs perhaps his nurses i suppose the poor old man is getting infirm ay ay and your bedroom is there i suppose lawrence took the lamp and opened the door it was a bare badly furnished room with a little camp bedstead and nothing else hardly for lawrence kept his luxurious habits for the day was it pure curiosity that made gabriel cassilis look all round the room ah hermit like now i like a large bed however i am very glad i came one word colquhoun is better than a thousand letters and you are sure you do not misunderstand me quite said lawrence taking his hat i am going out too no jealousy at all said gabriel cassilis going down the stairs certainly not nothing but a desire to to i understand perfectly said lawrence as they descended lawrence heard steps on the stairs behind them they were not yet then out of danger very odd said mr cassilis coming up i heard a woman's voice now it seems as if there were a woman's feet nerves perhaps said colquhoun the steps above them stopped i hear nothing nor do i nerves ah yes nerves mr cassilis turned to the left colquhoun with him behind them he saw the cloaked and hooded figure of victoria cassilis at the burlington gardens end a cab was waiting near the horse's head stood a woman's figure which lawrence thought he knew as they passed her this woman whoever she was covered her face with a handkerchief and at the same moment the cab drove by rapidly gabriel cassilis saw neither woman nor cab he was too happy to notice anything there was nothing in it nothing at all except mischievous gossip and he had laid the ghost dear me he said to himself presently i forgot to ask about the secret but of course there is none how should there be next morning there came another letter you have been fooled worse than ever it said your wife was in mr colquhoun's chambers the whole time that you were there she came down the stairs after you she passed through the gate almost touching you and she drove past you in a hansom cab i know the number and will give it to you when the time comes mr colquhoun lied to you how long how long it should have been a busy day in the city to begin with it only wanted four days to settling day telegrams and letters poured in and they lay unopened on the desk at which gabriel cassilis sat with this letter before him mad with jealousy and rage chapter xxxvii 'come now' the master builder cried 'the twenty years of work are done flaunt forth the flag and crown with pride the glory of the coping stone' jack dunquerque was to slack off his visits to twickenham that is to say as he interpreted the injunction he was not wholly to discontinue them in order not to excite suspicion but he was not to haunt the house he was to make less frequent voyages up the silver thames he was not to ride in leafy lanes side by side with phillis without having phillis by his side he cared little about leafy lanes and would rather be at the club further by these absences he was to leave off being necessary to the brightness of her life it was a hard saying nevertheless the young man felt that he had little reason for complaint other fellows he knew going after other heiresses had been quite peremptorily sent about their business for good particularly needy young men like himself all that colquhoun extorted of him was that he should slack off he felt in a manner grateful although had he been a youth of quicker perception he would have remembered that the lover who slacks off can be no other than the lover who wishes he had not begun but nobody ever called jack a clever young man he was not to give her up altogether he was not even to give up hoping he was to have his chance with the rest but he was warned that no chance was to be open to him until the young lady should enter upon her first season not to give up seeing her that was everything jack dunquerque had hitherto lived the life of all young men careless and insouciant with its little round of daily pleasures he was only different from other young men that he had learned partly from a sympathetic nature and partly by travel not to put all his pleasure in that life about town and in country houses which seems to so many the one thing which the world has to offer he who has lived out on the prairies for weeks has found that there are other pleasures besides the gas light joys of town but his life had been without thought and purposeless a very chaos of a life and now he felt vaguely that his whole being was changed to be with phillis day after day to listen to the outpourings of her freshness and innocence brought to him the same sort of refreshment as sitting under the little cataract of a mountain stream brings to one who rambles in a hot west indian island things for which he once cared greatly he now cared for no more the club life the cards and the billiards ceased to interest him he took no delight in them perhaps it was a proof of a certain weakness of nature in jack dunquerque that he could not at the same time love things in which phillis took no part and the things which made the simple pleasures of her every day life he might have been weak and yet whether he was weak or strong he knew that she leaned upon him he was so sympathetic he seemed to know so much he decided so quickly he was in his way so masterful that the girl looked up to him as a paragon of wisdom and strength i think she will always so regard him because the knowledge of her respect raises jack daily in moral and spiritual strength and so her hero approaches daily to her ideal what is the highest love worth if it have not the power of lifting man and woman together up to the higher levels where the air is purer the sunshine brighter the vision clearer but colquhoun's commands had wrought a further change in him that ugly good looking face of his which agatha l'estrange admired so much and which was wont to be wreathed with a multitudinous smile was now doleful to the world of mankind male mankind the chief charm of jack dunquerque the main cause of his popularity his unvarying cheerfulness was vanished you ought to be called doleful jack said ladds jack of rueful countenance you don't know tommy replied the lover sorrowfully wagging his head i've seen colquhoun and he won't have it says i must wait he's waited till forty i've waited to five and thirty and we're both pretty jolly come young un you may take courage by our examples you never met phil when you were five and twenty said jack nobody ever saw a girl like phillis five and thirty seems so great an age to five and twenty and at five and thirty one feels so young that it comes upon the possessor of so many years like a shock of cold water to be reminded that he is really no longer young one good thing lawrence colquhoun did not reproach him partly perhaps because as a guardian he did not thoroughly realize jack's flagitious conduct partly because he was an easy going man with a notion in his head that he had nothing to do with the work of duennas and keepers of the gynaeceum he treated the confessions of the remorseful lover with a cheery contempt passed them by no great harm had been done and the girl was but a child his own conscience it was which bullied jack so tremendously one day he rounded on his accuser like the poor worm in the proverb who might perhaps have got safe back to its hole but for that ill advised turning he met the charges like a man he pleaded that criminal as he had been nefarious and inexcusable as his action was this action had given him a very high time and that if it was all to do over again he should probably alter his conduct only in degree but not in kind that is to say he would see phillis oftener and stay with her longer conscience knocked him out of time in a couple of rounds but still he did have the satisfaction of showing fight of course he would do the same thing again there has never been found by duenna by guardian by despotic parent or by interested relation any law of restraint strong enough to keep apart two young people of the opposite sex and like age after they have once become attracted towards each other prudence and prudery jealousy and interest never have much chance the ancient dames of duennadom may purse their withered lips and wrinkle their crow's footed eyes love the unconquered laughs and conquers again it is of no use to repeat long explanations about phillis such as she was we know her a law unto herself careless of prohibitions and unsuspicious of danger like una she wandered unprotected and fearless among whatever two legged wolves bears eagles lions vultures and other beasts and birds of prey might be anxiously waiting to snap her up jack was the great hearted lion who was to bear her safely through the wistful growls of the meaner beasts the lion is not clever like the fox or the beaver but one always conceives of him as a gentleman and therefore fit to be entrusted with such a beautiful maiden as una or phillis and if jack was quietly allowed to carry off his treasure it was agatha l'estrange who was chiefly to blame and she falling in love with jack herself quite in a motherly way allowed the wooing to go on under her very nose a bad bad woman as lawrence colquhoun called her but such a wooing miss ethel citybredde when she sees amandus making a steady but not an eagerly impetuous advance in her direction at a ball feels her languid pulses beat a little faster he is coming after me she says to herself with pride they snatch a few moments to sit together in a conservatory he offers no remark worthy of repetition nor does she yet she thinks to herself he is going to ask me to marry him he will kiss me there will be a grand wedding everybody will be pleased other girls will be envious and i shall be delighted papa knows that he is well off and well connected how charming now phillis allowed her lover to woo her without one thought of love or marriage of which indeed she knew nothing but if the passion was all on one side the affection was equally divided and when jack truly said that phillis did not love him he forgot that she had given him already all that she knew of love in that her thoughts which on her first emancipation leaped forth bounding and running in all directions with a wild yearning to behold the great unknown were now returning to herself and mostly flowed steadily like streams of electric influence in the direction of jack inasmuch as she referred unconsciously everything to jack as she dressed for him drew for him pored diligently over hated reading books for him and told him all her thoughts i have not told nor can i tell of the many walks and talks these two young people had together day after day jack's boat that comfortable old tub in which he could and often did cut a crab without spilling the contents into the river lay moored off agatha's lawn or rolled slowly up and down the river jack rowing while phillis steered sang talked and laughed this was pleasant in the morning but it was far more pleasant in the evening when the river was so quiet so still and so black and when thoughts crowded into the girl's brain which fled like spirits when she tried to put them into words or they rode together along the leafy roads through richmond park and down by that unknown region far away from the world where heron rise up from the water's edge where the wild fowl fly above the lake in figures which remind one of euclid's definitions and the deer collect in herds among great ferns half as high as themselves there they would let the horses walk while phillis with the slender curving lines of her figure her dainty dress which fitted it so well and her sweet face made the heart of her lover hungry and when she turned to speak to him and he saw in the clear depths of her eyes his own face reflected his passion grew almost too much for him to bear a delicate dainty maiden who was yet of strong and healthy physique one who did not disdain to own a love for cake and strawberries cream and ices and other pleasant things who had no young ladyish affectations who took life eagerly not languidly and not a coward as many maidens boast to be she ruled her horse with a rein as firm as jack dunquerque and sat him as steadily she clinched her little fingers and set her lips hard when she heard a tale of wrong her eyes lit up and her bosom heaved when she heard of heroic gest she was strong to endure and to do not every girl would as phillis did rise in the morning at five to train her untaught eyes and hand over those little symbols by which we read and write not every girl would patiently begin at nineteen the mechanical drudgery of the music lesson and she did this in confidence because jack asked her every day about her lessons and agatha l'estrange was pleased the emotion which is the next after and worse than that of love is sympathy phillis passed through the stages of curiosity and knowledge before she arrived at the stage of sympathy perhaps she was not far from the highest stage of all she learned something every day and told jack what it was sometimes it was an increase in her knowledge of evil jack who was by no means so clever as his biographer thought that a pity his idea was the common one that a maiden should be kept innocent of the knowledge of evil i think jack took a prejudiced even a philistine view of the case he put himself on the same level as the frenchman who keeps his daughter out of mischief by locking her up in a convent it is not the knowledge of evil that hurts any more than the knowledge of black beetles earwigs slugs and other crawling things the pure in spirit cast it off just as the gardener who digs and delves among his plants washes his hands and is clean the thing that hurts is the suspicion and constant thought of evil the loveliest and most divine creature in the world is she who neither commits any ill nor thinks any nor suspects others of ill who has a perfect pity for backsliders and a perfect trust in the people around her unfortunate it is that experience of life turns pity to anger and trust into hesitation or they would be out upon agatha's lawn playing croquet to which that good lady still adhered or lawn tennis which she tolerated there would be the curate he had abandoned that design of getting up all about laud but was madly ecclesiastically madly in love with phillis there would be occasionally ladds who in his heavy kindly way pleased this young may queen besides ladds was fond of jack there would be gilead beck in the straightest of frock coats and on the most careful behaviour there would be also two or three young ladies compared with whom phillis was as rosalind at the court of her uncle or as esther among the damsels of the persian king's seraglio so fresh and so incomparably fair mrs l'estrange jack whispered one day i am going to say a rude thing did you pick out the other girls on purpose to set off phillis what a shame jack said agatha who like the rest of the world called him by what was not his christian name the girls are very nice not so pretty as phillis but good looking all of them i call them as pretty a set of girls as you would be likely to see on any lawn this season yes said jack only you see they are all alike and phillis is different that was it phillis was different the girls were graceful pleasant and well bred but phillis was all this and more the others followed the beaten track in which the strength of life is subdued and its intensity forbidden phillis was in earnest about everything quietly in earnest not openly bent on enjoyment like the young ladies who run down greenwich hill for instance but in her way making others feel something of what she felt herself her intensity was visible in the eager face the mobile flashes of her sensitive lips and her brightening eyes and most unlike her neighbours she even forgot her own dress much as she loved the theory and practice of dress when once she was interested and was careless about theirs it was not pleasant for the minor stars they felt in a vague uncomfortable way that phillis was far more attractive they said to each other that she was strange one who pretended to know more french than the others said that she was farouche she was not in the least farouche and the young lady her calumniator did not understand the adjective but farouche she continued to be among the maidens of twickenham and richmond jack dunquerque heard the epithet applied on one occasion and burst out laughing phillis farouche phillis without fear and without suspicion but then they do teach french so badly at girls' schools and so poor phillis remained ticketed with the adjective which least of any belonged to her a pleasant six weeks from april to june while the late spring blossomed and flowered into summer a time to remember all his life afterwards with the saddened joy which despite dante's observation does still belong to the memory of past pleasures but every pleasant time passes and the six weeks were over jack was to slack off the phrase struck him applied to himself and phillis as simply in bad taste but the meaning was plain he was to present himself at twickenham with less frequency accordingly he began well by going there the very next day the new regime has to be commenced somehow and jack began his at once he pulled up in his tub it was a cloudy and windy day drops of rain fell from time to time the river was swept by sudden gusts which came driving down the stream marked by broad black patches there were no other boats out and jack struggled upwards against the current the exercise at least was a relief to the oppression of his thoughts what was he to do with himself after the slacking off had begun after that day in fact the visits might drop to twice a week then once a week and then but surely colquhoun would be satisfied with such a measure of self denial in the intervals say from saturday to saturday he could occupy himself in thinking about her he might write to her would that be against the letter of the law it was clearly against the spirit and another consideration it was no use writing unless he wrote in printed characters and in words of not more than two syllables he thought of such a love letter and of phillis gravely spelling it out word by word to mrs l'estrange for poor phillis had not as yet accustomed herself to look on the printed page as a vehicle for thought although agatha read to her every day she regarded it as the means of conveying to the reader facts such as the elementary reading book delights to set forth so dry that the adult reader if a woman presently feels the dust in her eyes and if a man is fain to get up and call wildly for quarts of bitter beer no phillis was not educated up to the reception of a letter he would he thought sit in the least frequented room of his club the drawing room and with a book of some kind before him just for a pretence would pass the leaden hours in thinking of phillis's perfections heavens when was there a moment by day or by night that he did not think of them bump it was the bow of the ship which knew by experience very well when to stop and grounded herself without any conscious volition on his part at the accustomed spot jack jumped out and fastened the painter to the tree to which phillis had once tied him then he strode across the lawns and flower beds and made for the little morning room where he hoped to find the ladies he found one of them fortune sometimes favors lovers it was the younger one phillis herself she was bending over her work with brush and colour box looking as serious as if all her future depended on the success of that particular picture beside her tossed contemptuously aside lay the much despised lesson book in reading for she had done her daily task she did not hear jack step in at the open window and went on with her painting she wore a dress made of that stuff which looks like brown holland till you come close to it and then you think it is silk but are not quite certain and i believe they call it indian tussore round her dainty waist was a leathern belt set in silver with a chatelaine like a small armoury of deadly weapons and for colour she had a crimson ribbon about her neck to show that the ribbon was not entirely meant for vanity but had its uses phillis had slung upon it a cross of maltese silver work which i fear jack had given her himself and below the cross where her rounded figure showed it off she had placed a little bunch of sweet peas such a dainty damsel not content with the flower in her dress she had stuck a white jasamine blossom in her hair all these things jack noted with speechless admiration then she began to sing in a low voice all to herself a little french ballad which mrs l'estrange had taught her one of the sweet old french songs she was painting in the other window at a table drawn up to face it the curtains were partly pulled together and the blind was half drawn down so that she sat in a subdued light in which only her face was lit up like the faces in a certain kind of photograph while her hair and figure lay in shadow the hangings were of some light rose hue which tinted the whole room and threw a warm colouring over the old fashioned furniture the pictures the books the flowers on the tables and the ferns in their glasses mrs l'estrange was no follower after the new school neutral tints had small charms for her she liked the warmth and glow of the older fashion in which she had been brought up it looked to jack dunquerque like some shrine dedicated to peace and love with phillis for its priestess or even its goddess outside the skies were grey the wind swept down the river with driving rain here was warmth colour and brightness so he stood still and watched and as he waited an overwhelming passion of love seized him if the world was well lost for antony when he threw it all away for a queen no longer young and the mother of one son at least almost grown up what would it have been had his cleopatra welcomed him in all the splendour of her white greek beauty at sweet seventeen there was no world to be lost for this obscure cadet of a noble house but all the world to be won his world was before his eyes it was an unconscious maid ignorant of her own surpassing worth and of the power of her beauty to win her was to be the lord of all the world he cared for presently she laid down her brush and raised her head then she pushed aside the curtains and looked out upon the gardens the rain drove against the windows and the wind beat about the branches of the lilacs on the lawn she shivered and pulled the curtains together again i wish jack were here she said to herself he is here phil jack replied she looked round and darted across the room catching him by both hands jack oh i am glad there is nobody at home agatha has gone up to town and i am quite alone what shall we do this afternoon clearly the right thing for him to propose was that he should instantly leave the young lady and row himself back to richmond this however was not what he did propose on the contrary he kept phillis's hands in his and held them tight looking in her upturned face where he saw nothing but undisguised joy at his appearance shall we talk shall i play to you shall i draw you a picture what shall we do jack well phil i think perhaps we had better talk something in his voice struck her she looked at him sharply what has happened jack you do not look happy nothing phil nothing but what i might have expected but he looked so dismal that it was quite certain he had not expected it tell me jack he shook his head jack what is the good of being friends if you won't tell me what makes you unhappy i don't know how to tell you phil i don't see a way to begin sit down and begin somehow she placed him comfortably in the largest chair in the room and then she stood in front of him and looked in his face with compassionate eyes the sight of those deep brown orbs so full of light and pity smote her lover with a kind of madness what is it makes people unhappy are you ill he shook his head and laughed no phil i am never ill you see i am not exactly unhappy but jack you look so dismal yes that is it i am a little dismal no phil no i am really unhappy and you are the cause i the cause but jack why i had a talk with your guardian lawrence colquhoun yesterday it was all about you and he wants me not to come here so often in fact and i musn't come but why not what does lawrence mean that is just what i cannot explain to you you must try to forgive me forgive you jack you see phil i have behaved badly from the beginning i ought not to have called upon you as i did in carnarvon square i ought not to have let you call me jack nor should i have called you phil it is altogether improper in the eyes of the world she was silent for a while perhaps i have known jack that it was a little unusual other girls haven't got a jack dunquerque have they poor things that is all you mean isn't it jack phil don't look at me like that you don't know you can't understand no it is more than unusual it is quite wrong i have done nothing wrong the girl said proudly if i had my conscience would make me unhappy but i do begin to understand what you mean last week agatha asked me if i was not thinking too much about you and the curate made me laugh because he said quite by himself in a corner you know that mr dunquerque was a happy man and when i asked him why he turned very red and said it was because i had given to him what all the world would long to have he meant jack i wish he was here jack cried hotly for me to wring his neck and one day laura herries that's the girl who said you were farouche phil go on was talking to agatha about some young lady who had got compromised by a gentleman's attentions i asked why and she replied quite sharply that if i did not know no one could know then she got up and went away agatha was angry about it i could see but she only said something about understanding when i come out miss herries ought to have her neck wrung too as well as the curate said jack compromise improper phil beat her little foot on the floor what does it all mean jack tell me what is this wrong thing that you and i have done not you phil a thousand times not you then i do not care much what other people say she replied simply do you know jack it seems to me as if we never ought to care for what people besides people we love say about us but it is i who have done wrong said jack have you jack oh then i forgive you i think i know you you should have come to me with an unreal smile on your face and pretended the greatest deference to my opinion even when you knew it wasn't worth having that is what the curate does to young ladies i saw him yesterday taking miss herries's opinion on holman hunt's picture she said it was 'sweetly pretty' he said 'do you really think so' in such a solemn voice as if he wasn't quite sure that the phrase summed up the whole picture but was going to think it over quietly don't laugh jack because i cannot read like other people and all i have to go by is what mr dyson told me and agatha tells me and what i see and and what you tell me jack which is worth all the rest to me the tears came into her eyes but only for a moment and she brushed them aside and i forgive you jack all the more because you did not treat me as you would have treated the girls who seem to me so lifeless and languid and jack it may be wrong to say it but oh so small what compliment could you have paid me better than to single me out for your friend you who have seen so much and done so much my friend mine we were friends from the first were we not and i have never since hidden anything from you jack and never will he kept it down still this mighty yearning that filled his heart but he could not bear to look her in the face every word that she said stabbed him like a knife because it showed her childish innocence and her utter unconsciousness of what her words might mean and then she laid her little hand in his and now you have compromised me as they would say what does it matter jack we can go on always just the same as we have been doing can we not he shook his head and answered huskily no phil your guardian will not allow it you must obey him he says that i am to come here less frequently that i must not do you he is quite right phil any more mischief and that you are to have your first season in london without any ties or entanglements my guardian leaves me alone here with agatha it is you who have been my real guardian jack i shall do what you tell me to do i want to do what is best for you phil but child he caught her by the hands and she half fell half knelt at his feet and looked up in his eyes with her face full of trouble and emotion child must i tell you could not agatha l'estrange tell you that there is something in the world very different from friendship is it left for me to teach you they call it love phil he whispered the last words love but i know all about it jack no phil you know nothing it isn't the love that you bear to agatha that i mean is it the love i have for you jack she asked in all innocence it may be phil tell me only he was reckless now and spoke fast and fiercely tell me if you love me as i love you try to tell me i love you so much that i cannot sleep for thinking of you and i think of you all day long it seems as if my life must have been a long blank before i saw you all my happiness is to be with you to think of going on without you maddens me poor jack she said softly she did not offer to withdraw her hands but let them lie in his warm and tender grasp my dear my darling my queen and pearl of girls who can help loving you and even to be with you to have you close to me to hold your hands in mine that isn't enough what more o jack jack what more she began to tremble and she tried to take back her hands he let them go but before she could change her position he bent down threw his arms about her and held her face close to his while he kissed it a thousand times what more my darling my angel this and this phil phil wake at last from your long childhood leave the garden of eden where you have wandered so many years and come out into the other world the world of love my dear my dear can you love me a little only a little in return we are all so different from what you thought us you will find out some day that i am not clever and good at all that i have only one thing to give you my love phil phil answer me speak to me forgive me he let her go for she tore herself from him and sprang to her feet burying her face in her hands and sobbing aloud forgive me forgive me it was all that he could say jack what is it what does it mean o jack she lifted her face and looked about her with hands outstretched as one who feels in the darkness her cheeks were white and her eyes wild what does it mean what is it you have said what is it you have done phil yes hush don't speak to me not yet jack wait a moment my brain is full of strange thoughts she put out trembling hands before her like one who wakes suddenly in a dream and spoke with short quick breath something seems to have come upon me help me jack oh help me i am frightened he took her in his arms and soothed and caressed her like a child while she sobbed and cried look at me jack she said presently tell me am i the same is there any change in me yes phil yes my darling you are changed your sweet eyes are full of tears like the skies in april and your cheeks are pale and white let me kiss them till they get their own colour again he did kiss them and she stood unresisting but she trembled i know jack now she said softly it all came upon me in a moment when your lips touched mine o jack jack it was as if something snapped as if a veil fell from my eyes i know now what you meant when you said just now that you loved me do you phil and can you love me too yes jack i will tell you when i am able to talk again let me sit down sit with me jack she drew him beside her on the sofa and murmured low while he held her hands do you like to sit just so holding my hands are you better now jack do you think jack that i can have always loved you without knowing it all just as you love me o my poor jack my heart beats so fast and i am so happy what have you said to me jack that i should be so happy see the sun has come out and the showers are over and gone and the birds are singing all the sweet birds they are singing for me jack for you and me oh for you and me her voice broke down again and she hid her face upon her lover's shoulder crying happy tears he called her a thousand endearing names he told her that they would be always together that she had made him the happiest man in all the world that he loved her more than any girl ever had been loved in the history of mankind that she was the crown and pearl and queen of all the women who ever lived and then she looked up smiling through her tears ah happy happy day ah day for ever to be remembered even when if ever the years shall bring its fiftieth anniversary to an aged pair whose children and grandchildren stand around their trembling feet ah moments that live for ever in the memory of a life they die but are immortal they perish all too quickly but they bring forth the precious fruits of love and constancy of trust affection good works peace and joy which never perish take me on the river jack she said presently i want to think it all over again and try to understand it better he fetched cushion and wrapper for the boat was wet and placed her tenderly in the boat and then he began to pull gently up the stream the day had suddenly changed the morning had been gloomy and dull but the afternoon was bright the strong wind was dropped for a light cool breeze the swans were cruising about with their lordly pretence of not caring for things external and the river ran clear and bright they were very silent now the girl sat in her place looking with full soft eyes on the wet and dripping branches or in the cool depths of the stream presently they passed an old gentleman fishing in a punt he was the same old gentleman whom phillis saw one morning now so long ago when he had that little misfortune we have narrated and tumbled backwards in his ark he saw them coming and adjusted his spectacles youth and beauty again he murmured and she's been crying that young fellow has said something cruel to her wish i could break his head for him the pretty creature he'll come to a bad end that young man then he impaled an immense worm savagely and went on fishing a very foolish old gentleman this i am trying to make it all out quite clearly jack phillis presently began and it is so difficult her eyes were still bright with tears but she did not tremble now and the smile was back upon her lips my darling let it remain difficult only tell me now if you can that you love me yes jack she said not in the frank and childish unconsciousness of yesterday but with the soft blush of a woman who is wooed yes jack i know now that i do love you as you love me because my heart beat when you kissed me and i felt all of a sudden that you were all the world to me phil i don't deserve it i don't deserve you not deserve me o jack you make me feel humble when you say that and i am so proud so proud and so happy she went on after a pause and the girls who know all along how do they find it out want every one for herself this great happiness too i have heard them talk and never understood till now poor girls i wish they had their their own jack not my jack her lover had no words to reply poor boy and you went about with your secret so long tell me how long jack since the very first day i saw you in carnarvon square phil all that time did you love me on that day not the first day of all jack oh surely not the very first day yes not as i love you now now that i know you so well my phillis mine but only then because you were so pretty do men always fall in love with a girl because she is pretty yes phil they begin because she is pretty and they love her more every day when she is so sweet and so good as my darling phil all this time jack had been leaning on his oars and the boat was drifting slowly down the current it was now close to the punt where the old gentleman sat watching them they have made it up he said that's right and he chuckled she looked dreamy and contented the tears were gone out of her eyes and a sweet softness lay there like the sunshine on a field of grass she is a rose of sharon and a lily of the valley said this old gentleman that young fellow ought to be banished from the state for making other people envious of his luck looks a good tempered rogue too he observed with delight that they were thinking of each other while the boat drifted nearer to his punt presently bump bump jack seized his sculls and looked up guiltily the old gentleman was nodding and smiling to phillis made it up he asked most impertinently that is right that is right give you joy sir give you joy wish you both happiness wish i had it to do all over again god bless you my dear his jolly red face beamed like the setting sun under his big straw hat and he wagged his head and laughed jack laughed too at other times he would have thought the old angler an extremely impertinent person now he only laughed then he turned the boat's head and rowed his bride swiftly homewards phil i am like jason bringing home medea he said with a faint reminiscence of classical tradition i have explained that jack was not clever i hope not said phil medea was a dreadful person then paris bringing home helen no phil only your lover bringing home the sweetest girl that ever was and worth five and thirty helens when they landed agatha l'estrange was on the lawn waiting for them to her surprise phillis on disembarking took jack by the arm and his hand closed over hers mrs l'estrange gasped and in phillis's tear bright eyes she saw at last the light and glow of love and in phillis's blushing face she saw the happy pride of the celestial venus who has met her only love children children she said what is this phillis made answer in words which abraham dyson used to read to her from a certain book but which she never understood till now made answer with her face upturned to her lover i am my beloved's and his desire is toward me they were a quiet party that evening jack did not want to talk he asked phillis to sing he sat by in a sort of rapture while her voice in the songs she most affected whispered and sang to his soul not words but suggestions of every innocent delight she recovered something of her gaiety but their usual laughter was hushed as if by some unexpressed thought it will never come back to her again that old mirth and light heart of childhood she felt while she played as if she was in some great cathedral the fancies of her brain built over her head a pile more mystic and wonderful than any she had seen its arches towered to the sky its aisles led far away into dim space she was walking slowly up the church hand in hand with jack towards a great rose light in the east an anthem of praise and thanksgiving echoed along the corridors and pealed like thunder among the million rafters of the roof round them floated faces which looked and smiled and she heard the voice of abraham dyson in her ear life should be two fold not single that phillis is the great secret of the world every man is a priest every woman is a priestess it is a sacrament which you have learned of jack this day go on with him in faith and hope love is the universal church and heaven is everywhere live in it die in it and dying begin your life of love again phil cried jack what is it you look as if you had seen a vision i have heard the voice of abraham dyson she said solemnly he is satisfied and pleased with us jack that was nothing to what followed for presently there occurred a really wonderful thing on phillis's table they were all three sitting in the pleasant morning room lay among her lesson books and drawing materials a portfolio jack turned it over carelessly there was nothing at all in it except a single sheet of white paper partly written over but there had been other sheets and these were torn off it is an old book full of writing said phillis carelessly i have torn out all the leaves to make rough sketches at the back there is only one left now jack took it up and read the scanty remnant good heavens he cried have you really destroyed all these pages phil then he laughed what is it jack yes i have torn them all out drawn rough things on them and then burnt them every one is it anything important asked mrs l'estrange i should think it was important said jack ho ho phillis has destroyed the whole of mr dyson's lost chapter on the coping stone and now his will is not worth the paper it is written on it was actually so bit by bit while joseph jagenal was leaving no corner unturned in the old house at highgate in search of the precious document without which mr dyson's will was so much waste paper this young lady was contentedly cutting out the sheets one by one and using them up for her first unfinished groups of course she could not read one word of what was written it was a fitting nemesis to the old man's plans that they were frustrated through the very means by which he wished to regenerate the world and now nothing at all left but a tag end a bit of the peroration the last words of the final summing up and this was what jack read aloud these provisions and no other thus will i have my college for the better education of women founded and maintained thus shall it grow and develop till the land is full of the gracious influence of womankind at her best and noblest the coping stone of a girl's education should be and must be love when phillis fleming my ward whose example shall be taken as the model for my college feels the passion of love her education is finally completed she will have much afterwards to learn but self denial sympathy and faith come best through love woman is born to be loved that woman only approaches the higher state who has been wooed and who has loved when phillis loves she will give herself without distrust and wholly to the man who wins her it is my prayer my last prayer for her that he may be worthy of her here jack's voice faltered for a moment her education has occupied my whole thoughts for thirteen years it has been the business of my later years now i send her out into the world prepared for all except treachery neglect and ill treatment perhaps her character would pass through these and come out the brighter but we do not know we cannot tell beforehand lord lead her not into temptation and so deal with her lover as he shall deal with her amen said agatha l'estrange but phillis sprang to her feet and threw up her arms i have found it she cried oh how often did he talk to me about the coping stone now i have nothing more to learn o jack jack she fell into his arms and lay there as if it was her proper place we have found the coping stone you and i between us and it is here it is here chapter xxxviii 'tis well to be off with the old love though you never get on with a new during the two of three weeks following their success with gilead beck the twins were conspicuous had any one noticed them for a recklessness of expenditure quite without parallel in their previous history they plunged as regarded hansoms paying whatever was asked with an airy prodigality they dined at the club every day and drank champagne at all hours they took half guinea stalls at theatres they went down to greenwich and had fish dinners they appeared with new chains and rings they even changed their regular hours of sleep and sometimes passed the whole day broad awake in the pursuit of youthful pleasures they winked and nodded at each other in a way which suggested all kinds of delirious delights and cornelius even talked of adding an episode to the epic based on his own later experiences which he would call he said the jubilee of joy the funds for this fling all too short were provided by their american patron gilead beck had no objection to advance them something on account the young gentlemen found it so pleasant to spend money that they quickly overcame scruples about asking for more perhaps they would have gone on getting more but for a word of caution spoken by jack dunquerque in consequence of this unkindness they met each other one evening in the studio with melancholy faces i had a letter to day from mr gilead beck said cornelius to humphrey so had i said humphrey to cornelius in answer to a note from me said cornelius in reply to a letter of mine said humphrey it is sometimes a little awkward brother humphrey cornelius remarked with a little temper that our inclinations so often prompt us to do the same thing at the same time said humphrey i suppose then cornelius that you asked him for money i did humphrey how much has the patron advanced you already on the great picture two hundred only a mere trifle and now he refuses to advance any more until the picture is completed some enemy some jealous brother artist must have corrupted his mind my case too i asked for a simple fifty pounds it is the end of may and the country would be delightful if one could go there i have already drawn four or five cheques of fifty each on account of the epic he says this mercenary and mechanical patron that he will not lend me any more until the poem is brought to him finished some carping critic has been talking to him how much of the poem is finished how much of the picture is done the questions were asked simultaneously but no answer was returned by either then each sat for a few moments in gloomy silence the end of may murmured humphrey we have to be ready by the beginning of october june july only four months my painting is designed for many hundreds of figures your poem for how many lines brother twenty cantos of about five hundred lines each twenty times five hundred is ten thousand then they relapsed into silence again brother cornelius the artist went on this has been a most eventful year for us we have been rudely disturbed from the artistic life of contemplation and patient work into which we had gradually dropped we have been hurried hurried i say brother into action perhaps prematurely cornelius grasped his brother's hand but said nothing you cornelius have engaged yourself to be married cornelius dropped his brother's hand pardon me humphrey it is you that is engaged to phillis fleming i am nothing of the sort cornelius the other returned sharply i am astonished that you should make such a statement one of us certainly is engaged to the young lady and as certainly it is not i 'let your brother humphrey hope' she said those were her very words i do think brother that it is a little ungenerous a little ungenerous of you after all the trouble i took on your behalf to try to force this young lady on me humphrey's cheek turned pallid he plunged his hands into his silky beard and walked up and down the room gesticulating i went down on purpose to tell phillis about him i spoke to her of his ardour she said she appreciated said she appreciated it cornelius i even went so far as to say that you offered her a virgin heart perilling my own soul by those very words a virgin heart he laughed melodramatically and after that german milkmaid ha ha the poet and the milkmaid cornelius by this time was red with anger the brothers alike in so many things differed in this that when roused to passion while humphrey grew white cornelius grew crimson and what did i do for you he cried out the brothers were now on opposite sides of the table walking backwards and forwards with agitated strides i told her that you brought her a heart which had never beat for another that after your miserable little roman model an artist not able to resist the charms of his own model cornelius cried humphrey suddenly stopping and bringing his fist with a bang upon the table humphrey cried his brother exactly imitating his gesture their faces glared into each other's cornelius as usual wrapped in his long dressing gown his shaven cheeks purple with passion humphrey in his loose velvet jacket his white lips and cheeks and his long silken beard trembling to every hair it was the first time the brothers had ever quarrelled in all their lives and like a tempest on lake windermere it sprang up without the slightest warning they glared in a steady way for a few minutes and then drew back and renewed their quick and angry walk side by side with the table between them to bring up the old german business said cornelius to taunt me with the roman girl said humphrey will you keep your engagement like a gentleman and marry the girl cried the poet will you behave as a man of honour and go to the altar with phillis fleming asked the artist i will not said cornelius nothing shall induce me to get married nor will i said humphrey i will see myself drawn and quartered first then said cornelius go and break it to her yourself for i will not break what asked humphrey passionately break her heart when i tell her if i must that my brother repudiates his most sacred promises cornelius was touched he relented he softened can it be that she loves us both they were at the end of the table near the chairs which as usual were side by side can that be so cornelius they drew nearer the chairs they sat down they turned by force of habit lovingly towards each other and their faces cleared brother humphrey said cornelius i see that we have mismanaged this affair it will be a wrench to the poor girl but it will have to be done i thought you wanted to marry her i thought you did and so we each pleaded the other's cause and the poor girl loves us both good heavens what a dreadful thing for her i remember nothing in fiction so startling to be sure there is some excuse for her but she can't marry us both n n no i suppose not no certainly not heaven forbid and as you will not marry her humphrey shook his head in a decided manner and i will not marry interrupted humphrey what and give up this have to get up early to take breakfast at nine to be chained to work to be inspected and interfered with while at work phillis drew me once and pinned the portrait on my easel to be restricted in the matter of port to have to go to bed at eleven perhaps cornelius to have babies and beside if they should be twins fancy being shaken out of your poetic dream by the cries of twins no sitting up at night with pipes and brandy and water echoed the poet and humphrey here he chuckled and his face quite returned to its brotherly form should we go abroad no flirting with roman models eh eh eh ho ho ho laughed the artist melodiously and no carrying milk pails up the heidelberg hills eh eh eh marriage be hanged cried the poet starting up again we will preserve our independence humphrey we will be free to woo but not to wed was there ever a more unprincipled bard it is sad to relate that the artist echoed his brother we will cornelius we will vive la liberte he snapped his fingers and began to sing quand on est a paris on ecrit a son pere qui fait reponse 'brigand tu n'en as ' he broke short off and clapped his hands like a school boy we will go to paris next week brother we will humphrey if we can get any more money and now how to get out of the mess do you think mrs l'estrange will interfere or colquhoun or joseph the best way would be to pretend it was all a mistake let us go to morrow and cry off as well as we can we will cornelius the quarrel and its settlement made them thirsty and they drank a whole potash and brandy each before proceeding with the interrupted conversation poor little phillis said the artist filling his pipe i hope she won't pine much ariadne you know said the poet and then he forgot what ariadne did and broke off short it isn't our fault after all men of genius are always run after women are made to love men and men are made to break their hearts law of nature dear cornelius law of nature perhaps the man is a fool who binds himself to one art alone should be our mistress glorious art yes said cornelius you are quite right and what about mr gilead beck this was a delicate question and the artist's face grew grave what are we to do cornelius i don't know humphrey will the poem be finished no will the picture not a chance had we not better humphrey considering all the circumstances make up our minds to throw over the engagement tell me cornelius how much of your poem remains to be done well you see there is not much actually written will you show it to me what there is of it it is all in my head humphrey nothing is written he blushed prettily as he made the confession but the artist met him half way with a frank smile it is curious cornelius that up to the present i have not actually drawn any of the groups my figures are still in my head both were surprised each spending his own afternoons in sleep had given the other credit for working during that part of the day but they were too much accustomed to keep up appearances to make any remark upon this curious coincidence then brother said the poet with a sigh of relief there really is not the slightest use in leading mr beck to believe that the works will be finished by october and we had better ask for a longer term a year longer would do for me a year longer would i think do for me said humphrey stroking his beard as if he was calculating how long each figure would take to put in we will go and see mr beck to morrow better not said the sagacious poet why not he might ask for the money back true brother he must be capable of that meanness or he would have given us that cheque we asked for very true we will write what excuse shall we make we will state the exact truth brother no excuse need be invented we will tell our patron that art cannot must not be forced this settled cornelius declared that a weight was off his mind which had oppressed him since the engagement with mr beck was first entered into nothing he said so much obstructed the avenues of fancy checked the flow of ideas and destroyed grasp of language as a slavish time engagement now he went on to explain he felt free already his mind like a garden in may was blossoming in a thousand sweet flowers now he was at peace with mankind before this relief he had been humphrey would bear him out inclined to lose his temper over trifles and the feeling of thraldom caused him only that very evening to use harsh words even to his twin brother here he held out his hand which humphrey grasped with effusion they wrote their letters next day not early in the day because they prolonged their evening parliament till late and it was one o'clock when they took breakfast but they wrote the letters after breakfast and at two they took the train to twickenham phillis received them in her morning room they appeared almost as nervous and agitated as when they called a week before so shaky were their hands that phillis began by prescribing for them a glass of wine each which they took and said they felt better we come for a few words of serious explanation said the poet yes said phillis will mrs l'estrange do on the contrary it is with you that we would speak very well she replied pray go on they were sitting side by side on the sofa looking as grave as a pair of owls there was something gog and magogish too in their proximity phillis found herself smiling when she looked at them so to prevent laughing in their very faces she changed her place and went to the open window now she said cornelius with the gravest face in the world began again it is a delicate and i fear a painful business he said miss fleming you doubtless remember a conversation i had with you last week on your lawn certainly you told me that your brother mr humphrey adored me you also said that he brought me a virgin heart i remember perfectly i did not understand your meaning then but i do now i understand it now she spoke the last words with softened voice because she was thinking of the coping stone and jack dunquerque humphrey looked indignantly at his brother here was a position to be placed in but cornelius lifted his hand with a gesture which meant patience i will see you through this affair and went on you see miss fleming i was under a mistake my brother who has the highest respect in the abstract for womanhood which is the incarnation and embodiment of all that is graceful and beautiful in this fair world of ours does not does not after all phillis looked at humphrey he sat by his brother trembling with a mixture of shame and terror they were not brave men these twins and they certainly drank habitually more than is good for the nervous system she began to laugh not loudly but with a little ripple of mirth which terrified them both because in their vanity they thought it the first symptoms of hysterical grief then she stepped to the sofa and placed both her hands on the unfortunate artist's shoulder he thought that she was going to shake him and his soul sank into his boots you mean that he does not after all adore me o mr humphrey mr humphrey was it for this that you offered me a virgin heart is this your gratitude to me for drawing your likeness when you were hard at work in the studio what shall i say to your brother joseph and what will he say to you my dear young lady cornelius interposed hastily there is not the slightest reason to bring joseph into the business at all he must not be told of this unfortunate mistake humphrey does adore you speak brother do you not adore miss fleming humphrey was gasping and panting i do he ejaculated i do oh most certainly then phillis left him and turned to his brother but there is yourself mr cornelius you are not an artist you are a poet you spend your days in the workshop where jack dunquerque and i found you rapt in so poetic a dream that your eyes were closed and your mouth open if you made a mistake about humphrey it is impossible that he could have made a mistake about you this is terrible said cornelius explain brother humphrey miss fleming we no you as well are victims of a dreadful error he wiped his brow and appealed to his brother released from the terror of phillis's hands upon his shoulder the artist recovered some of his courage and spoke but his voice was faltering i too he said mistook the respectful admiration of my brother for something dearer miss fleming he is already wedded wedded are you a married man mr cornelius oh and where is the virgin heart wedded to his art humphrey explained then he went a little off his head i suppose in the excitement of this crisis because he continued in broken words wedded long ago object of his life's love with milk pails on the hills of heidelberg and light blue eyes the muse of song but he regards you with respectful admiration most respectful said cornelius as petrarch regarded the wife of the count de sade will you forgive us miss fleming and and try to forget us so gentlemen the young lady said with sparkling eyes you come to say that you would rather not marry me i wonder if that is usual with men no no they both cried together happy is the man you may be the happy man humphrey said cornelius no you brother you never had wedlock seemed so dreadful a thing as it did now with a possible bride standing before them apparently only waiting for the groom to make up his mind i will forgive you both she said so go away happy but i am afraid i shall never never be able to forget you and if i send you a sketch of yourselves just as you look now so ashamed and so foolish perhaps you will hang it up in the workshop or the studio to be looked at when you are awake that is when you are not at work they looked guiltily at each other and drew a little apart it was the most cruel speech that phillis had ever made but she was a little angry with this vain and conceited pair of windbags i shall not tell mr joseph jagenal because he is a sensible man and would take it ill i am sure and i shall not tell my guardian lawrence colquhoun because i do not know what he might say or do and i shall not tell mrs l'estrange that is i shall not tell her the whole of it for your sakes but i must tell jack dunquerque because i am engaged to be married to jack and because i love him and must tell him everything they cowered before her as they thought of the possible consequences of this information you need not be frightened she went on jack will not call to see you and disturb you at your work her eyes that began by dancing with fun now flashed indignation it was not that she felt angry at what most girls would have regarded as a deliberate insult but the unmanliness of the two filled her with contempt they looked so small and so mean go she said pointing to the door i forgive you but never again dare to offer a girl each other's virgin heart they literally slunk away like a pair of beaten hounds then phillis suddenly felt sorry for them as they crept out of the door one after the other she ran after them and called them back stop she cried we must not part like that shake hands cornelius shake hands humphrey come back and take another glass of wine indeed you want it you are shaking all over come she led them back one in each hand and poured out a glass of sherry for each you could not have married me you know she said laughing because i am going to marry jack there forgive me for speaking unkindly and we will remain friends they took her hand but they did not speak and something like a tear stood in their eyes when they left her phillis observed that they did not take each other's arm as usual but walked separate and they looked older chapter xxxix what is it you see a nameless thing a creeping snake in the grass who was the writer of the letters they were all in one hand and that a feigned hand gabriel cassilis sat with these anonymous accusations against his wife spread out upon the table before him he compared one with another he held them up to the light he looked for chance indications which a careless moment might leave behind there were none not a stroke of the pen not even the name of the shop where the paper was sold they were all posted at the same place but that was nothing the handwriting was large upright and perhaps designedly ill formed it appeared to be the writing of a woman but of this mr cassilis was not sure always the same tale always reference to a secret between colquhoun and his wife what was that secret in colquhoun's room alone with him almost under his hand but where he went into the bedroom which was lighted by the gas of the court an open room furnished without curtains there was certainly no one concealed because concealment was impossible and in the sitting room then he remembered that the room was dimly lighted curtains kept out the gas light of the court colquhoun had on his entrance lowered the silver lamp there was a heavy green shade on this it was possible that she might have been in the room while he was there and listening to every word the thought was maddening he tried to put it all before himself in logical sequence but could not he tried to fence with the question but it would not be evaded he tried to persuade himself that suspicions resting on an anonymous slander were baseless but every time his mind fell back upon the voice which proclaimed his wife's dishonour a man on the rack might as well try to dream of soft beds and luxurious dreamless sleep a man being flogged at the cart tail might as well try to transport his thoughts to boyhood's games upon a village green a man at the stake might as well try to think of deep delicious draughts of ice cold water from a shady brook the agony and shame of the present are too much for any imagination it was so to gabriel cassilis the one thing which he trusted in after all the villainies and rogueries he had learned during sixty five years mostly spent among men trying to make money was his wife's fidelity it was like the gospel a thing to be accepted and acted upon with unquestioning belief good heavens if a man cannot believe in his wife's honesty in what is he to believe gabriel cassilis was not a violent man he could not find relief in angry words and desperate deeds like a moor of venice his jealousy was a smouldering fire a flame which burned with a dull fierce heat a disease which crept over body and mind alike crushing energy vitality and life out of both everything might go to ruin round him he was no longer capable of thought and action telegrams and letters lay piled before him on the table and he left them unopened outside his secretary was in dismay his employer would receive no one and would attend to nothing he signed mechanically such papers as were brought him to sign and then he motioned the secretary to the door this apathy lasted for four days the four days most important of any in the lives of himself of gilead beck and of lawrence colquhoun for the fortunes of all hung upon his shaking it off and he did not shake it off on the second day the day when he got the letter telling him that his wife had been in colquhoun's chambers while he was there he sent for a private detective he put into his hands all the letters written by a woman said the officer have you any clue sir none none whatever i want you to watch you will watch my wife and you will watch mr colquhoun get every movement watched and report to me every morning can you do this good then go and spare neither pains nor money the next morning's report was unsatisfactory colquhoun had gone to the park in the afternoon dined at his club and gone home to his chambers at eleven mrs cassilis after dining at home went out at ten and returned early at half past eleven but there came a letter from the anonymous correspondent you are having a watch set on them good but that won't find out the scotch secret she was in his room while you were there hidden somewhere but i do not know where he went home to watch his wife with his own eyes he might as well have watched a marble statue she met his eyes with the calm cold look to which he was accustomed there was nothing in her manner to show that she was other than she had always been he tried in her presence to realise the fact if it was a fact this woman he said to himself has been lying hidden in colquhoun's chambers listening while i talked to him she was there before i went she was there when i came away what is her secret what indeed she seemed a woman who could have no secrets a woman whose life from her cradle might have been exposed to the whole world who would have found nothing but cause of admiration and respect in her presence under her influence his jealousy lost something of its fierceness he feared her too much to suspect her while in his sight it was at night in his office away from her that he gave full swing to the bitterness of his thoughts in the hours when he should have been sleeping he paced his room wrapped in his dressing gown a long lean figure with eyes aflame and thoughts that tore him asunder and in the hours when he should have been waking he sat with bent shoulders glowering at the letters of her accuser gazing into a future which seemed as black as ink his life he knew was drawing to its close yet a few more brief years and the summons would come for him to cross the river of that he had no fear but it was dreadful to think that his age was to be dishonoured success was his the respect which men give to success was his no one inquired very curiously into the means by which success was commanded he was a name and a power now that name was to be tarnished by no act of his own by no fault of his by the treachery of the only creature in the world except his infant child in whom he trusted he would have perhaps to face the publicity of an open court to hear his wrongs set forth to a jury to read his case in the daily papers and he would have to alter his will oddly enough of all the evil things which seemed about to fall on him not one troubled him more than the last his detective brought him no news on the next day but his unknown correspondent did she is tired the letter said of not seeing mr colquhoun for three whole days she will see him to morrow there is to be a garden party at mrs l'estrange's twickenham villa mr colquhoun will be there and she is going too to meet him if you dared if you had the heart of a mouse you would be there too you would arrive late you would watch and see for yourself unseen if possible how they meet and what they say to each other an invitation lies for you as well as your wife upon the table go while he was reading this document his secretary came in uncalled the eldorado stock he said in his usual whisper have you decided what to do settling day on friday have you forgotten what you hold sir i have forgotten nothing gabriel cassilis replied eldorado stock i never forget anything leave me i shall see no one to day no one is to be admitted i am very busy i don't understand it the secretary said to himself has he got information that he keeps to himself has he got a deeper game on than i ever gave him credit for what does it mean is he going off his head more letters and more telegrams came they were sent in to the inner office but nothing came out of it that night gabriel cassilis left his chair at ten o'clock he had eaten nothing all day he was faint and weak he took something at a city railway station and drove home in a cab his wife was out in the hall he saw her woman the tall woman with the unprepossessing face you are mrs cassilis's maid he asked i am sir come with me he took her to his own study and sat down now he had the woman with him he did not know what to ask her you called me sir she said do you want to know anything how long have you been with your mistress i came to her when her former maid janet died sir janet was with her for many years before she married janet janet a scotch name janet was with my mistress in scotland yes mrs cassilis was in scotland yes and and janet was in your confidence we had no secrets from each other sir janet told me everything what was there to tell nothing sir what should there be this was idle fencing you may go he said stay let them send me up something a cup of tea a slice of meat anything then he recommenced his dreary walk up and down the room later on a curious feeling came over him quite a strange and novel feeling it was as if while he thought or rather while his fancies like so many devils played riot in his brain he could not find the right words in which to clothe his thoughts he struggled against the feeling he tried to talk but the wrong words came from his lips then he took a book yes he could read it was nonsense he shook off the feeling but he shrank from speaking to any servant and went to bed that night he slept better and in the morning was less agitated he breakfasted in his study and then he went down to his office it was the fourth day since he had opened no letters and attended to no business he remembered this and tried to shake off the gloomy fit and then he thought of the coming coup and tried to bring his thoughts back to their usual channel how much did he hold of eldorado stock rising higher day by day but three days three short days before settling day the largest stake he had ever ventured a stake so large that when he thought of it his spirit and nerve came back to him for once for the last time he entered his office holding himself erect and looking brighter than he had done for days and he sat down to his letters with an air of resolution unfortunately the first letter was from the anonymous correspondent she wrote to him to day she told him that she could bear her life no longer she threatened to tell the secret right out she will have an explanation with him to morrow at mrs l'estrange's do you go down and you will hear the explanation be quiet and the secret he started from his chair the letter in his hand and looked straight before him was it then all true would that very day give him a chance of finding out the secret between lawrence colquhoun and his wife he put up his glasses and read the letter the last of a long series every one of which had been a fresh arrow in his heart again and again then he sat down and burst into tears a young man's tears may be forced from him by many a passing sorrow but an old man's only by the reality of a sorrow which cannot be put aside the deaths of those who are dear to the old man fall on him as so many reminders that his own time will soon arrive but it is not for such things as death that he laments i loved her moaned gabriel cassilis i loved her and i trusted her and this the end he did not curse her nor colquhoun nor himself it was all the hand of fate it was hard upon him harder than he expected or knew but he bore it in silence he sat so still and quiet a long while then he put together all the letters which the detective had brought back and placed them in his pocket then he dallied and played with the paper and pencils before him just as one who is restless and uncertain in his mind then he looked at his watch it was past three the garden party was for four and then he rose suddenly put on his hat and passed out his secretary asked him as he went through his office if he would return and at what time mr cassilis made a motion with his hand as if to put the matter off for a few moments and replied nothing when he got into the street it occurred to him that he could not answer the secretary because that same curious feeling was upon him again and he had lost the power of speech it was strange and he laughed then the power of speech as suddenly returned to him he called a cab and told the driver where to go it is a long drive to twickenham he was absorbed in his thoughts and as he sat back gazing straight before him the sensation of not being able to speak kept coming and going in his brain this made him uneasy but not much because he had graver things to think about at half past four he arrived within a few yards of mrs l'estrange's house where he alighted and dismissed his cab the cabman touched his hat and said it was a fine day and seasonable weather for the time of the year ay replied gabriel cassilis mechanically a fine day and seasonable weather for the time of the year and as he walked along under the lime trees he found himself saying over again as if it was the burden of a song a fine day and seasonable weather for the time of the year chapter xl how green are you and fresh in this old world on the morning of the garden party joseph jagenal called on lawrence colquhoun i have two or three things to say he began if you can give me five minutes twenty said lawrence now then he threw himself back in his easiest chair and prepared to listen i am in the way of hearing things sometimes joseph said and i heard a good deal yesterday about mr gabriel cassilis what said lawrence aghast he surely has not been telling all the world about it i think we are talking of different things joseph answered after a pause don't tell me what you mean but what i mean is that there is an uneasy feeling about gabriel cassilis ay in what way well they say he is strange does not see people does not open letters and is evidently suffering from some mental distress yes and when such a man as gabriel cassilis is in mental distress money is at the bottom of it generally not always it was against my advice that you invested any of your money by his direction i invested the whole of it and all phillis's too mr cassilis has the investment of our little all lawrence added laughing but the lawyer looked grave don't do it he said get it in your own hands again let it lie safely in the three per cents what has a pigeon like you to do among the city hawks and miss fleming's money too let it be put away safely and give her what she wants a modest and sufficient income without risk i believe you are right jagenal in fact i am sure you are right but cassilis would have it he talked me into an ambition for good investments which i never felt before i will ask him to sell out for me and go back to the old three per cents and railway shares which is what i have been brought up to on the other hand you are quite wrong about his mental distress that is i happen to know you are a lawyer and will not talk it is not due to money matters and gabriel cassilis is for what i know as keen a hand as ever at piling up the dollars the money is all safe of that i am quite certain well if you think so but don't let him keep it said joseph the doubter after all why not get eight and nine per cent if you can because it isn't safe and because you ought not to expect it what do you want with more money than you have got however i have told you what men say there is another thing i am sorry to say that my brothers have made fools of themselves and i am come to apologise for them don't if it is disagreeable my dear fellow it is not very disagreeable and i would rather they are fifty but they are not wise in fact they have lived so much out of the world that they do not understand things and so they went down and proposed for the hand of your ward phillis fleming oh both of them and did she accept the absurd thing is that i cannot discover which of them wished to be the bridegroom nor which phillis thought it was she is quite confused about the whole matter however they went away and thought one of them was accepted which explains a great deal of innuendo and reference to some unknown subject of mirth which i have observed lately i say one of them because i find it impossible to ascertain which of them was the man well whether they were conscience stricken or whether they repented i do not know but they went back to twickenham and solemnly repudiated the engagement and phillis she laughed at them of course do not fear she wasn't in the least annoyed i shall speak to my brothers this evening colquhoun thought of the small fragile looking pair and inwardly hoped that their brother would be gentle with them and there is another thing colquhoun do you want to see your ward married to jack dunquerque yes not yet i want her to have her little fling first why the poor child is only just out of the nursery and he wants to marry her off hand it's cruel let her see the world for a year and then we will consider it jagenal i wish i could marry the girl myself so do i said joseph with a sigh i fell in love with her said lawrence at first sight that is why he added in his laziest tones i suppose that is why i told jack dunquerque not to go there any more but he has gone there again and he has proposed to her i hear and she has accepted him so that i can't marry her and you can't and we are a brace of fogies and what have you said to mr dunquerque i acted the jealous guardian and i ordered him not to call on my ward any more for the present i shall see how phillis takes it and give in of course if she makes a fuss then beck has been here offering to hand over all his money to jack because he loves the young man quixotic said the lawyer yes the end of it will be a wedding of course you and i may shake a leg at it if we like as for me i never can marry any one and as for you as for me i never thought of marrying her i only remarked that i had fallen in love as you say with her that's no matter to anybody well things go on as they like not as we like what nonsense it is to say that man is master of his fate now what i should like would be to get rid of the reason that prevents my marrying to put jack dunquerque into the water butt and sit on the lid and then for phillis to fall in love with me after that strawberries and cream with a little champagne for the rest of my methuselah like career and i can't get any of these things master of his fate have you heard of the coping stone chapter it is found agatha told me something in a disjointed way what is the effect of it joseph laughed it is all torn up but the last page a righteous retribution because if phillis had been taught to read this would not have happened now i suspect the will must be set aside and the money will mostly go to gabriel cassilis the nearest of kin who doesn't want it chapter xli la langue des femmes est leur epee et elles ne la laissent pas rouiller the grounds of the house formed a parallelogram of which the longer sides were parallel with the river in the north east corner stood the house itself its front facing west it was not a large house as has been explained a conservatory was built against nearly the whole length of the front the lawns and flower beds spread to west and south sloping down to the river's edge the opposite angle was occupied by stables kitchen garden and boat house gabriel cassilis approached it from the east an iron railing and a low hedge along which were planted limes laburnums and lilacs separated the place from the road but before reaching the gate in fact at the corner of the kitchen garden he could himself unseen look through the trees and observe the party they were all there he saw mrs l'estrange phillis his own wife heavens how calm and cold she looked and how beautiful he thought her with half a dozen other ladies the men were few there was the curate he was dangling round phillis and wore an expression of holiness out for a holiday which is always so charming in these young men gabriel cassilis also noticed that he was casting eyes of longing at the young lady there was lawrence colquhoun gabriel cassilis looked everywhere for him till he saw him lying beneath a tree his head on his hand he was not talking to victoria nor was he looking at her on the contrary he was watching phillis there was captain ladds he was talking to one of the young ladies and he was looking at phillis the young lady evidently did not like this and there was gilead beck he was standing apart talking to mrs l'estrange with his hands in his pockets leaning against a tree but he too was casting furtive glances at phillis they all seemed somehow looking at the girl there was no special reason why they should look at her except that she was so bright so fresh and so charming for the eye to rest upon the other girls were as well dressed but they were nowhere compared with phillis the lines of their figures perhaps were not so fine the shape of their heads more commonplace their features not so delicate their pose less graceful there are some girls who go well together helena and hermia are a foil to each other but when desdemona shows all other beauties pale like lesser lights and the other beauties do not like it said one of the fair guests to another what do they see in her i cannot tell replied her friend she seems to me more farouche than ever for having decided that farouche was the word to express poor phillis's distinguishing quality there was no longer any room for question and farouche she continued to be if there is anything that phillis never was it is that quality of fierce shy wildness which requires the adjective farouche but the word stuck because it sounded well to this day to be sure it is only a twelvemonth since the girls say still oh yes phillis fleming she was pretty but extremely farouche gabriel cassilis stood by the hedge and looked through the trees he has come all the way from town to attend this party and now he hesitated at the very gates for he became conscious of two things first that the old feeling of not finding his words was upon him again and secondly that he was not exactly dressed for a festive occasion like most city men who have long remained bachelors gabriel cassilis was careful of his personal appearance he considered a garden party as an occasion demanding something special now he not only wore his habitual pepper and salt suit but the coat in which he wrote at his office a comfortable easy old frock a little baggy at the elbows his mind was strung to such an intense pitch that such a trifling objection as his dress because gabriel cassilis never looked other than a gentleman appeared to him insuperable he withdrew from the hedge and retraced his steps presently he came to a lane he left the road and turned down the path he found himself by the river he sat down under a tree and began to think he thought of the time when his lonely life was wearisome to him when he longed for a wife and a house of his own he remembered how he pictured a girl who would be his darling who would return his caresses and love him for his own sake and how when he met victoria pengelley his thoughts changed and he pictured that girl stately and statuesque at the head of the table there would be no pettings and caressings from her that was quite certain on the other hand there would be a woman of whom he would be proud one who would wear his wealth properly and a woman of good family well connected all round there were no caresses he remembered now there was the coldest acceptance of him and there had been no caresses since but he had been proud of her and as for her honour how was it possible that the doubt should arise that man must be himself distinctly of the lower order of men who would begin by doubting or suspecting his wife to end in this doubt so strong as to be almost certainty suspicion like a knife cutting at his heart his brain clouded and he himself driven to creep down clandestinely to watch his wife he sat there till the june sun began to sink in the west the river was covered with the evening craft they were manned by the young city men but just beginning the worship of mammon who would have looked with envy upon the figure sitting motionless in the shade by the river's edge had they known who he was presently he roused himself and looked at his watch it was past seven perhaps the party would be over by this time he could go home with his wife it would be something at least to be with her to keep her from that other man he rose his brain in a tumult and repaired once more to his point of vantage at the hedge the lawn was empty there was no one there but he saw his own carriage in the yard and therefore his wife was not yet gone in the garden no one he crept in softly and looked round him no one saw him enter the place and he felt something like a burglar as he walked with a stealthy step which he vainly tried to make confident across the lawn two ways of entrance stood open before him one was the porch of the house covered with creepers and hung with flowers the door stood open and beyond it was the hall looking dark from the bright light outside he heard voices within another way was by the conservatory the door of which was also open he looked in among the flowers and vines there stood a figure he knew his wife's but she was alone and she was listening on her face was an expression which he had never seen there and never dreamed of her features were distorted her hands were closed in a tight clutch her arms were stiffened but she was trembling what was she doing to whom was she listening he hesitated a moment and then he stepped through the porch into the hall the voices came from the right in fact from the morning room phillis's room which opened by its single window upon the lawn and by its two doors into the hall on one side and the conservatory on the other and gabriel cassilis like his wife listened he put off his hat placed his umbrella in the stand and stood in attitude in case he should be observed to push open the door and step in he was so abject in his jealousy that he actually did not feel the disgrace and degradation of the act he was so keen and eager to lose no word that he leaned his head to the half open door and stood his long thin figure trembling with excitement like some listener in a melodrama of the transpontine stage there were two persons in the room and one was a woman and they were talking together one was lawrence colquhoun and the other was phillis fleming colquhoun was not according to his wont lying on a sofa nor sitting in the easiest of the chairs he was standing and he was speaking in an earnest voice when i saw you first he said you were little phillis a wee toddler of six or seven i went away and forgot all about you almost forgot your very existence phillis till the news of mr dyson's death met me on my way home again i fear that i have neglected you since i came home but i have been worried what has worried you lawrence asked the girl she was sitting on the music stool before the piano and as she spoke she turned from the piano her fingers resting silently on the notes she was dressed for the party which was over now and the guests departed in a simple muslin costume light and airy which became her well and in her hair she had placed a flower there were flowers all about the room flowers at the open window flowers in the conservatory beyond flowers on the bright green lawns beyond how pretty you are phillis answered her guardian he touched her cheek with his finger as she sat i am your guardian he said as if in apology and you have been worried about things she persisted agatha says you never care what happens agatha is right as a rule in one case of which she knows nothing she is wrong tell me phillis is there anything you want in the world that i can get for you i think i have everything she said laughing and what you will not give me i shall wait for till i am twenty one you mean i mean jack dunquerque lawrence only a short month ago and jack dunquerque was her friend she could speak of him openly and friendly without change of voice or face now she blushed and her voice trembled as she uttered his name that is one of the outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual state known to the most elementary observers i wanted to speak about him phillis you are very young you have seen nothing of the world you know no other men all i ask you is to wait do not give your promise to this man till you have at least had an opportunity of of comparing of learning your own mind she shook her head i have already given my promise she said but it is a promise that may be recalled he urged dunquerque is a gentleman he will not hold you to your word when he feels that he ought not to have taken it from you phillis you do not know yourself you have no idea of what it is that you have given or its value how can i tell you the truth i think you mean the best for me lawrence she said but the best is jack then she began to speak quite low so that the listeners heard nothing see lawrence you are kind and i can tell you all without being ashamed i think of jack all day long and all night i pray for him in the morning and in the evening when he comes near me i tremble i feel that i must obey him if he were to order me in anything i have no more command of myself when he is with me stop phillis lawrence interposed you must not tell me any more i was trying to act for the best but i will make no further opposition see my dear he took her hand in his in a tender and kindly way if i write to jack dunquerque to day and tell the villain he may come and see you whenever he likes and that he shall marry you whenever you like will that do for you she started to her feet and threw her left hand lawrence still holding the right upon his shoulder looking him full in the face will it do o lawrence agatha always said you were the kindest man in the world and i forgive me i did not believe it i could not understand it o jack jack we shall be so happy so happy he loves me lawrence as much as i love him the listeners in the greenhouse and the hall craned their necks but they could hear little because the girl spoke low does he love you as much as you love him phillis does he love you a thousand times better than you can understand why child you do not know what love means perhaps women never do quite realise what it means only go on believing that he loves you and love him in return and all will be well with you i do believe it lawrence and i love him too looking through the flowers and the leaves of the conservatory glared a face upon the pair strangely out of harmony with the peace which breathed in the atmosphere of the place a face violently distorted by passion a face in which every evil feeling was at work a face dark with rage phillis might have seen the face had she looked in that direction but she did not she held lawrence's hand and she was shyly pressing it in gratitude phillis said lawrence hoarsely jack dunquerque is a lucky man we all love you my dear and i almost as much as jack but i am too old for you and besides besides he cleared his throat and spoke more distinctly i do love you however phillis a man could not be long beside you without loving you there was a movement and a rustle in the leaves the man at the door stood bewildered what was it all about colquhoun and a woman not his wife talking of love what love what woman and his wife in the conservatory looking as he never saw her look before and listening what did it all mean what thing was coming over him he pressed his hand to his forehead trying to make out what it all meant for he seemed to be in a dream and as before while he tried to shape the words in his mind for some sort of an excuse or a reassurance to himself he found that no words came or if any then the wrong words the house was very quiet no sounds came from any part of it the servants were resting in the kitchen the mistress of the house was resting in her room after the party no voices but the gentle talk of the girl and her guardian kiss me phillis said lawrence then let me hold you in my arms for once because you are so sweet and and i am your guardian you know and we all love you he drew her gently by the hands she made no resistance it seemed to her right that her guardian should kiss her if he wished she did not know how the touch of her hand the light in her eyes the sound of her voice were stirring in the man before her depths that he thought long ago buried and put away awakening once more the possibilities at forty of a youthful love his lips were touching her forehead her face was close to his he held her two hands tight when the crash of a falling flower pot startled him and victoria cassilis stood before him panting gasping for breath with hands clenched and eyes distended a living statue of the femina demens for a moment she paused to take breath and then with a wave of her hand which was grand because it was natural and worthy of rachel because you may see it any day among the untutored beauties of whitechapel among the gipsy camps or in the villages where hindoo women live and quarrel victoria cassilis for once in her life was herself and acted superbly because she did not act at all victoria the word came from lawrence phillis with a little cry of terror clung tightly to her guardian's arm leave him cried the angry woman do you hear leave him better go phillis said lawrence at the prospect of battle the real nature of the man asserted itself he drew himself erect and met her wild eyes with a steady gaze which had neither terror nor surprise in it a gaze such as a mad doctor might practise upon his patients a look which calms the wildest outbreaks because it sees in them nothing but what it expected to find and is only sorry no she shall not go said victoria sweeping her skirts behind her with a splendid movement from her feet she shall not go until she has heard me first you dare to make love to this girl this schoolgirl before my very eyes she shall know she shall know our secret victoria said lawrence calmly you do not understand what you are saying our secret say your secret and be careful the door moved an inch or two the man standing behind it was shaking in every limb their secret her secret he was going to learn at last he was going to find the truth he was going and here a sudden thought struck him that he had neglected his affairs of late and that this business once got through he must look into things again a thought without words because somehow just then he had no words he had forgotten them all the writer of the anonymous letters had done much mischief as she hoped to do people who write anonymous letters generally contrive so much unhappily the beginning of mischief is like the boring of a hole in a dam or dyke because very soon instead of a trickling rivulet of water you get a gigantic inundation nothing is easier than to have your revenge only it is so very difficult to calculate the after consequences of revenge if the writer of the letters had known what was going to happen in consequence most likely they would never have been written their secret her secret he listened with all his might but victoria his wife victoria spoke out clearly he could hear without straining his ears be careful repeated lawrence i shall not be careful the time is past for care you have sneered and scoffed at me you have insulted me you have refused almost to know me all that i have borne but this i will not bear phillis fleming she turned to the girl phillis did not shrink or cower before her on the contrary she stood like lawrence calm and quiet to face the storm whatever storm might be brewing this man takes you in his arms and kisses you he says he loves you he dares to tell you he loves you no doubt you are flattered you have had the men round you all day long and now you have the best of them at your feet alone when they are gone well the man you want to catch the excellent parti you and agatha would like to trap the man who stands there victoria there is still time to stop said lawrence calmly that man is my husband phillis looked from one to the other understanding nothing the man stood quietly stroking his great beard with his fingers and looking straight at mrs cassilis my husband we were married six years ago and more we were married in scotland privately but he is my husband and five days after our wedding he left me is that true perfectly you have forgotten nothing except the reason of my departure if you think it worth while troubling phillis with that why we quarrelled that was the reason he used cruel and bitter language he gave me back my liberty we separated phillis after a row the like of which you may conceive by remembering that mrs cassilis was then six years younger and even more ready for such encounters than at present we separated we agreed that things should go on as if the marriage which was no marriage had never taken place janet the maid was to be trusted she stayed with her mistress i went abroad and then i heard by accident that my wife had taken the liberty i gave her in its fullest sense by marrying again then i came home because i thought that chapter was closed but it was not you see and for her sake i wish i had stayed in america mrs cassilis listened as if she did not hear a word then she went on he is my husband still i can claim him when i want him and i claim him now i say lawrence so long as i live you shall marry no other woman you are mine whatever happens you are mine the sight of the man callous immovable suddenly seemed to terrify her she sank weeping at his knees lawrence forgive me forgive me take me away i never loved any one but you forgive me he made no answer or any sign let me go with you somewhere out of this place let us go away together we two i have never loved any one but you never any one but you but you she broke into a passion of sobs when she looked up it was to meet the white face of gabriel cassilis he was stooping over her his hands spread out helplessly his form quivering his lips trying to utter something but no sound came through them beyond stood lawrence still with the look of watchful determination which had broken down her rage then she sprang to her feet you here then you know all it is true that is my legal husband for two years and more my life has been a lie stand back and let me go to my husband but he stood between colquhoun and herself lawrence saw with a sudden terror that something had happened to the man he expected an outburst of wrath but no wrath came gabriel cassilis turned his head from one to the other and presently said in a trembling voice a fine day and seasonable weather for the time of year good god cried lawrence you have destroyed his reason gabriel cassilis shook his head and began again a fine day and seasonable here he threw himself upon the nearest chair and buried his face in his hands chapter xlii then a babbled of green fields and then there was silence which of them was to speak not the woman who had wrought this mischief not the man who knew of the wickedness but had not spoken not the innocent girl who only perceived that something dreadful something beyond the ordinary run of dreadful events had happened and that victoria cassilis looked out of her senses lawrence colquhoun stood unmoved by her tears his face was hardened it bore a look beneath which the guilty woman cowered yet she looked at him and not at her husband presently colquhoun spoke his voice was harsh and his words were a command go home he said to victoria there is no more mischief for you to do go she obeyed without a word she threw the light wrapper which she carried on her arm round her slender neck and walked away restored to outward seeming to all her calm and stately coldness the coachman and the footman noticed nothing if any of her acquaintances passed her on the road they saw no change in her the woman was impassive and impenetrable did she love colquhoun no one knows she loved to feel that she had him in her power she was driven to a mad jealousy when that power slipped quite away and although she had broken the vows which both once swore to keep she could not bear even to think that he should do the same and she did despise her husband the man of shares companies and stocks but could she love colquhoun such a woman may feel the passion of jealousy she may rejoice in the admiration which gratifies her vanity but she is far too cold and selfish for love it is an artful fable of the ancients which makes narcissus pine away and die for the loss of his own image for thereby they teach the great lesson that he who loves himself destroys himself the carriage wheels crunched over the gravel and gabriel cassilis raised a pale and trembling face a face with so much desolation and horror such a piteous gaze of questioning reproach at colquhoun that the man's heart melted within him he seemed to have grown old suddenly his hair looked whiter he trembled as one who has the palsy and his eyes mutely asked the question is this thing true lawrence colquhoun made answer his voice was low and gentle his eyes were filled with tears it is true mr cassilis god knows i would have spared you the knowledge but it is true gabriel cassilis opened his lips as if to speak but he refrained stopping suddenly because he recollected that he could no longer utter what he wished to say then he touched his mouth with his fingers like a dumb man he was worse than a dumb man who cannot speak at all because his tongue if he allowed it uttered words which had no connection with his thoughts men that have been called possessed of the devil have knelt at altars uttering blasphemous impieties when their souls were full of prayer do you understand me mr cassilis do you comprehend what i am saying he nodded his head colquhoun took a piece of notepaper from the writing table and laid it before him with a pencil mr cassilis grasped the pencil eagerly and began to write from his fingers as from his tongue came the sentence which he did not wish to write a fine day and seasonable weather for the time of year he looked at this result with sorrowful heart and showed it to colquhoun shaking his head good heavens cried colquhoun his mind is gone gabriel cassilis touched him on the arm and shook his head he understands you lawrence said phillis but he cannot explain himself something has gone wrong with him which we do not know gabriel cassilis nodded gratefully to phillis then mr cassilis colquhoun began it is right that you should know all six years ago i followed victoria pengelley into scotland we were married privately at a registrar's office under assumed names if you ever want to know where and by what names you have only to ask me and i will tell you there were reasons she said i never quite understood what they were but she chose to be a fille romanesque at the time why the marriage should be kept secret after the wedding ceremony such as it was she left the office with her maid who was the only witness and returned to the friends with whom she was staying i met her every day but always in that house and among other people a few days passed she would not for some whim of her own allow the marriage to be disclosed we quarrelled for that and other reasons my fault possibly good god what a honeymoon to meet the woman you love your bride in society if for half an hour alone then in the solitude of open observation to quarrel like people who have been married for forty years well perhaps it was my fault on the fifth day we agreed to let things be as if they had never been i left my bride who was not my wife in anger we used bitter words perhaps i the bitterest and when we parted i bade her go back to her old life as if nothing had been promised on either side i said she should be free that i would never claim the power and the rights given me by a form of words that she might marry again that to leave her the more free i would go away and never return till she was married or till she gave me leave i was away for four years and then i saw the announcement of her marriage in the paper and i returned that is the bare history mr cassilis since my return on my honour as a gentleman you have had no cause for jealousy in my own behaviour towards your wife not mine remember mr cassilis whatever else may be said she never was my wife and yet in the eye of the law i suppose she is my wife still and with all my heart i pity you he stopped and looked at the victim of the crime gabriel cassilis was staring helplessly from him to phillis did he understand not entirely i think yet the words which he had heard fell upon his heart softly and soothed him in his trouble at last his eyes rested on phillis as if asking as men do in times of trouble for the quick comprehension of a woman what can i do mr cassilis asked the girl if you cannot speak will you make some sign any little sign that i can understand she remembered that among her lesson books was a dictionary she put that into his hand and asked him to show her in the dictionary what he wished to say he took the book in his trembling hands turned over the leaves and presently finding the page he wanted ran his fingers down the lines till they rested on a word phillis read it spelling it out in her pretty little school girl fashion s i si l e n c lame duck lence silence is that what you wish to say mr cassilis he nodded silence repeated lawrence for all our sakes it is the best the only thing phillis tell no one what you have heard not even agatha not even jack dunquerque or if you tell jack dunquerque send him to me directly afterwards do you promise child i promise lawrence i will tell no one but jack and i shall ask him first if he thinks i ought to tell him another person's secret thank you phillis mr cassilis there are only we three and and one more you may trust phillis when she promises a thing you may trust me for my own sake you may i hope trust that other person and as for me it is my intention to leave england in a week i deeply regret that i ever came back to this country a week was too far ahead for mr cassilis to look forward to in his agitation clearly the one thing in his mind at the moment the one possible thing was concealment he took the dictionary again and found the word home will you let me take you home sir lawrence asked he nodded again there was no resentment in his face and none in his feeble confiding manner when he took lawrence's arm and leaned upon it as he crawled out to the carriage only one sign of feeling he took phillis by the hand and kissed her when he had kissed her he laid his finger on her lips and she understood his wish that no one should learn this thing not even agatha phillis said lawrence forget if you can and if you cannot keep silence they drove into town together these men with a secret between them lawrence made no further explanations what was there to explain the one who suffered the most sat upright looking straight before him in mute suffering it is a long drive from twickenham to kensington palace gardens when they arrived mr cassilis was too weak to step out of the carriage they helped him lawrence colquhoun and a footman into the hall he was feeble with long fasting as much as from the effects of this dreadful shock they carried him to his study among the servants who looked on was tomlinson the middle aged maid with the harsh face she knew that her bolt had fallen at last and she saw too that it had fallen upon the wrong person for up stairs sat her mistress calm cold and collected she came home looking pale and a little worn fatigued perhaps with the constant round of engagements though the season was little more than half over she dressed in gentle silence which tomlinson could not understand she went down to dinner alone and presently went to her drawing room where she sat in a window and thought there colquhoun found her i have told him all he said your words told him only half and yet too much you were never my wife as you know and never will be though the law may make you take my name cruel and heartless woman to gratify an insensate jealousy you have destroyed your husband is he is he dead she cried almost as if she wished he were no he is not dead he is struck with some fit he cannot speak learn now that your jealousy was without foundation phillis will marry dunquerque as for me i can never marry as you know he is not dead she echoed taking no notice of the last words indeed phillis was quite out of her thoughts now does he wish to see me no you must not at present attempt to see him what will they do to me lawrence she asked again what can they do i did not mean him to hear it was all to frighten you to frighten me what they can do mrs cassilis is to put you in the prisoner's box and me in the witness box what he wants to do so far as we can yet understand is to keep silence what is the good of that he will cry his wrongs all over the town and phillis will tell everybody phillis will tell no one no one not even agatha it was lucky that agatha heard nothing she was upstairs lying down after her party will you keep silence of course i shall what else is there for me to do for the sake of your husband for the sake of your boy it is for my own sake lawrence she interrupted coldly i beg your pardon i ought to have known by this time that you would have acted for your own sake only victoria it was an evil day for me when i met you it was a worse day when i consented to a secret marriage which was no marriage when there was no reason for any secrecy it was the worst day of all when i answered your letter and came here to see you every day we have met has produced more recrimination that would not have mattered but for the mischief our meeting has wrought upon your husband i pray that we may never in this world meet again he was gone and victoria cassilis has not met him since nor do i think now that she ever will meet him again the summer night closed in the moonlight came up and shone upon the park before her laying silvery patches of light in ten of thousands upon the young leaves of the trees and darkening the shadows a deeper black by way of contrast they brought her tea and lights then they came for orders there were none she would not go out that night at eleven tomlinson came i want nothing tomlinson you need not wait up i shall not want you this evening yes madam no madam mr cassilis is asleep madam let some one sit up with him see to that tomlinson and don't let him be disturbed i will sit up with him myself madam tomlinson was anxious to get to the bottom of the thing what mischief had been done and how far was it her own doing to persons who want revenge these are very important questions when mischief has actually been perpetrated then victoria was left alone in that great house with its troop of servants and nurses with her husband and child there was no one who cared to know what she was doing the master was not popular because he simply regarded every servant as a machine but at least he was just and he paid well and the house from the point of view likely to be taken by mr plush and miss hairpin was a comfortable one the mistress of the house was unpopular her temper at times was intolerable her treatment of servants showed no consideration and the women folk regarded the neglect of her own child with the horror of such neglect in which the englishwoman of all ranks is trained so she was alone and remained alone the hands of the clock went round and round the moon went down and over the garden lay the soft sepia twilight of june the lamp on the little table at her elbow went out but she sat still hands crossed in her lap looking out of window and thinking she saw but she did not feel the wickedness of it a cold and selfish girl ripening into a cold and selfish woman one to whom the outer world was as a panorama of moving objects meaning nothing and having no connection with herself like one blind deaf and dumb she moved among the mobs who danced and sang or who grovelled and wept she had no tears to help the sufferers and no smiles to encourage the happy she had never been able to sympathise with the acting of a theatre or the puppets of a novel she was so cold that she was not even critical it seems odd but it is really true that a critic may be actually too cold she saw a mind that like the indian devotee was occupied for ever in contemplating itself she saw beauty which would have been irresistible had there been one gleam just one gleam of womanly tenderness she saw one man after the other first attracted and then repelled and then she came to the one man who was not repelled there was once an unfortunate creature who dared to make love to diana his fate is recorded in lempriere's dictionary also in dr smith's later and more expensive work lawrence colquhoun resembled that swain and his fate was not unlike the classical punishment she went through the form of marriage with him and then she drove him from her by the cold wind of her own intense selfishness a very mistral when he was gone she began to regret a slave of such uncomplaining slavishness well no one knew except janet janet did not talk it was rather a struggle she remembered to take gabriel cassilis rather a struggle because lawrence colquhoun might come home and tell the story not because there was anything morally wrong she was most anxious to see him when he did come home out of curiosity out of jealousy out of a desire to know whether her old power was gone out of fear out of that reason which makes a criminal seek out from time to time the scene and accomplices of his crime and for the thousand reasons which make up a selfish woman's code of conduct it was three o'clock and daylight when she discovered that she had really thought the whole thing over from the beginning and that there was nothing more to think about except the future a distasteful subject to all sinners after all she summed up as she rose to go to bed it is as well lawrence and i should never have got along he is too selfish much too selfish down stairs they were watching over the stricken man the doctor came and felt his pulse he also looked wise and wrote things in latin on a paper which he gave to a servant then he went away and said he would come in the morning again he was a great doctor with a title and quite believed to know everything but he did not know what had befallen this patient when gabriel cassilis awoke there was some confusion in his mind and his brain was wandering at least it appeared so because what he said had nothing to do with any possible wish or thought he rambled at large and at length and then he grew angry and then he became suddenly sorrowful and sighed then he became perfectly silent the confused babble of speech ceased as suddenly as it had come and since that morning gabriel cassilis has not spoken it was at half past nine that his secretary called simultaneously with the doctor he heard something from the servants and pushed into the room where his chief was lying the eyes of the sick man opened languidly and fell upon his first officer but they expressed no interest and asked no question ah sighed mr mowll in the impatience of a sympathy which has but little time to spare will he recover doctor no doubt no doubt this way my dear sir he led the secretary out of the room hush he understands what is said this is no ordinary seizure has he received any shock shock enough to kill thirty men said the secretary where was he yesterday why did he not say something do something to avert the disaster oh then the shock has been of a financial kind i gathered from mr colquhoun that it was of a family nature something sudden and distressing family nature echoed the secretary who ever heard of mr cassilis worrying himself about family matters no sir when a man is ruined he has no time to bother about family matters ruined the great mr gabriel cassilis ruined i should say so and i ought to know they say so in the city they will say so to night in the papers if he were well and able to face things there might be no even then there could be no hope settling day this very morning and a pretty settling it is whatever day it is said the doctor i cannot have him disturbed you may return in three or four hours if you like and then perhaps he may be able to speak to you just now leave him in peace what had happened was this when mr cassilis caused to be circulated a certain pamphlet which we have heard of impugning the resources of the republic of eldorado he wished the stock to go down it did go down and he bought in bought in so largely that he held two millions of the stock men in his position do not buy large quantities of stock without affecting the price stock exchange transactions are not secret and eldorado stock went up this was what gabriel cassilis naturally desired also the letter of el senor don bellaco de la carambola to the times showing the admirable way in which eldorado loans were received and administered helped the stock went up from at which price gabriel cassilis bought in to at which he should have sold had he done so at the right moment he would have realised the very handsome sum of two hundred and sixty thousand pounds but the trouble of the letters came and prevented him from acting while his mind was agitated by these agitated as we have seen to such an extent that he could no longer think or work or attend to any kind of business there arrived for him telegram after telegram in his own cipher from america these lay unopened it was disastrous because they announced beforehand the fact which only his correspondent knew the eldorado bonds were no longer to be paid that fact was now public it was made known by all the papers that eldorado having paid the interest out of the money borrowed had no further resources whatever and could pay no more it was stated in leading articles that england should have known all along what a miserable country eldorado is the british public were warned too late not to trust in eldorado promises any more and the unfortunates who held eldorado stock were actuated by one common impulse to sell and no one would buy it was absurd to quote eldorado bonds at anything and the great financier had to meet his engagements by finding the difference between stock at and stock at next to nothing for two millions gabriel cassilis was consequently ruined when it became known that he had some sort of stroke people said that it was the shock of the fatal news he made the one mistake of an otherwise faultless career they said to each other in trusting eldorado and his brain could not stand the blow when the secretary who understood the cipher came to open the letters and telegrams he left off talking about the fatal shock of the news it must have been something else something he knew nothing of because he saw the blow might have been averted and the man's mind clear enough when he went in for a great coup had become unhinged during the few days before the smash ruined gabriel cassilis knew nothing about the wreck of his life as he lay upon his bed afraid to speak because he would only babble incoherently all was gone from him money reputation wife he had no longer anything the anonymous correspondent had taken all away chapter xliii this comes of airy visions and the whispers of demons like to angels brother weep gilead beck returning from the twickenham party before the explosion found jack dunquerque waiting for him as we have seen he was not invited tell me how she was looking he cried did she ask after me wal mr dunquerque i reckon you the most fortunate individual in the hull world she looked like an angel and she talked like a like a woman with pretty blushes and yet she wasn't ashamed neither seems as if bein' ashamed isn't her strong point and what has she got to be ashamed of did colquhoun say anything we had already got upon the subject and i had ventured to make him a proposition you see mr dunquerque he grew confused and hesitated fact is i want you to look at things just exactly as i do i'm rich i have struck ile that ile is the mightiest special providence ever given to a single man but it's given for purposes and one of those purposes is that some of it's got to go to you to me to you mr dunquerque who fired that shot who delivered me from the grisly why ladds did as much as i mr beck shook his head captain ladds is a fine fellow he said steady as a rock is captain ladds there's nobody i'd rather march under if we'd the war to do all over again but the ile isn't for captain ladds it isn't for him that the golden butterfly fills me with yearnin's no sir i owe it all to you you've saved my life you've sought me out and gone about this city with me you've put me up to ropes you've taken me to that sweet creature's house and made her my friend and mrs l'estrange my friend too if i was to turn away and forget you i should deserve to lose that precious inseck he paused for a minute i said to mr colquhoun 'mr dunquerque shall have half of my pile and more if he wants it only you let him come back again to miss fleming' and he laughed in his easy way there's no kind of man in the states like that mr colquhoun seems as if he never wants to get anything he laughed and lay back on the grass and then he said 'my dear fellow let jack come back if he likes there's no fighting against fate only let him have the decency not to announce his engagement till phillis has had her first season' then he drank some cider cup and lay back again mrs cassilis she's a very superior woman that but a trifle cold i should say watched him whenever he spoke she's got a game of her own unless i am mistaken but beck jack gasped i can't do this thing i can't take your money i guess sir you can and i guess you will come mr dunquerque say you won't go against providence there's a sweet young lady waiting for you and a little mountain of dollars but jack shook his head i thank you all the same he said i shall never forget your generosity never but that cannot be we will leave it to miss fleming said gilead what miss fleming says is to be shall be he was interrupted by the arrival of two letters the first was from joseph jagenal it informed him that he had learned from his brothers that they had received money from him on account of work which he thought would never be done he enclosed a cheque for the full amount with many thanks for his kindness and the earnest hope that he would advance nothing more in the letter was his cheque for l the amount which the twins had borrowed during the four weeks of their acquaintance mr beck put the cheque in his pocket and opened the other letter it was from cornelius and informed him that the poem could not possibly be finished in the time that it was rapidly advancing but that he could not pledge himself to completing the work by october also that his brother humphrey found himself in the same position as regarded the picture he ended by the original statement that art cannot be forced mr beck laughed not straight men mr dunquerque i suspected it first when they backed out at the dinner and left me to do the talk wal they may be high toned whole souled and talented but give me the man who works now mr dunquerque if you please we'll go and have some dinner and you shall talk about miss fleming and the day after to morrow you note that down i've asked mrs l'estrange and miss phillis to breakfast captain ladds is coming and mr colquhoun and you shall sit next to her mrs cassilis is coming too when i asked her she wanted to know if mr colquhoun was to be there i said yes then she wanted to know if phillis was to be there i said yes then she set her lips hard and said 'i will come mr beck' she isn't happy that lady she's got somethin' on her mind that evening joseph jagenal had an unpleasant duty to perform it was at dinner that he spoke the twins were just taking their first glass of port he had been quite silent through dinner eating little now he looked from one to the other without a word they changed colour instinctively they knew what was coming he said with a gulp i am sorry to find that my brothers have not been acting honourably what is this brother humphrey asked cornelius i do not know brother cornelius said the artist i will tell you said joseph what they have done they made a disingenuous attempt to engage the affections of a rich young lady for the sake of her money if humphrey loved the girl began cornelius if cornelius was devoted to phillis fleming began humphrey i was not humphrey said cornelius no such thing and i told you so i never did love her said humphrey i always said it was you this was undignified i do not care which it was it belongs to both then you went down to her again under the belief that she was engaged to to the lord knows which of you and solemnly broke it off neither spoke this time another thing i regret to find that my brothers having made a contract for certain work with mr gilead beck and having been partly paid in advance are not executing the work there joseph said humphrey waving his hand as if this was a matter on quite another footing you must excuse us we know what is right in art if we know nothing else art joseph cannot be forced cornelius murmured assent we have our dignity to stand upon we retreat with dignity we say 'we will not be forced we will give the world our best' good said joseph that is very well but where is the money neither answered i have returned that money but it is a large sum and you must repay me in part understand me brothers you may stay here as long as i live i shall never ask more of you than to respect the family name there was a time when you promised great things and i believed in you it is only quite lately that i have learned to my sorrow that all this promise has been for years a pretence you sleep all day you call it work you habitually drink too much at night you cornelius the poet started have not put pen to paper for years you humphrey the artist hung his head have neither drawn nor painted anything since you came to live with me i cannot make either of you work i cannot retrieve the past i cannot restore lost habits of industry i cannot even make you feel your fall from the promise of your youth or remember the hopes of our father what i can do is to check your intemperate habits by such means as are in my power he stopped they were trembling violently half of the l which you have drawn from mr beck will be paid by household saving wine will disappear from my table brandy and soda will have to be bought at your own expense i shall order the dinners and i shall keep the key of the wine cellar a year has passed the twins have had a sad time they look forward with undisguised eagerness to the return of the years of fatness they have exhausted their own little income in purchasing the means for their midnight seances and they have run up a frightful score at the carnarvon arms but they still keep up bravely the pretence about their work chapter xliv so on the ruins he himself had made sat marius reft of all his former glory can you understand me sir gabriel cassilis sat in his own study it was the day after the garden party he slept through the night and in the morning rose and dressed as usual then he took his seat in his customary chair at his table before him lay papers but he did not read them he sat upright his frock coat tightly buttoned across his chest and rapped his knuckles with his gold eyeglasses as if he was thinking they brought him breakfast and he took a cup of tea then he motioned them to take the things away they gave him the times and he laid it mechanically at his elbow but he did not speak nor did he seem to attend to what was done around him and his eyes had a far off look in them can you understand me sir the speaker was his secretary he came in a cab panting eager to see if there was still any hope somehow or other it was whispered already in the city that gabriel cassilis had had some sort of stroke and there was terrible news besides mr mowll asked because there was something in his patron's face which frightened him his eyes were changed they had lost the keen sharp look which in a soldier means victory in a scholar clearness of purpose in a priest knowledge of human nature and ability to use that knowledge in a financier the power and the intuition of success that was gone in its place an expression almost of childish softness and another thing the lips once set firm and close were parted now and mobile the other things were nothing that a man of sixty five should in a single night become a man of eighty that the iron grey hair should become white that a steady hand should shake and straight shoulders be bent it was the look in his face the far off look which made the secretary ask that question before he went on mr cassilis nodded his head gently he could understand you left the telegrams unopened for a week and more cried the impatient clerk why oh why did you not let me open them there was no reply if i had known i could have acted even the day before yesterday i could have acted the news came yesterday morning it was all over the city by three and eldorado's down to nothing in a moment mr cassilis looked a mild inquiry no anxiety in that look at all eldorado won't pay up her interest it's due next week nothing to pay it with your agent in new york telegraphed this a week ago he's been confirming the secret every day since o lord o lord and you the only man who had the knowledge and all that stake in it can you speak sir for his master's silence was terrible to him listen then ten days ago eldorados went down after wylie's pamphlet you told him what to write and you paid him just as you did last year but you tried to hide it from me that was wrong sir i've served you faithfully for twenty years but never mind that you bought in at then the eldorado minister wrote to the paper stock went up to you stood to win only the day before yesterday l more than a quarter of a million yesterday by three they were down to this morning they are down to and it's settling day and you lose you lose your all oh what a day what a day still no complaint not even a sigh from the patient man in the windsor chair only that gentle tapping of the knuckles and that far off look the great name of gabriel cassilis dragged in the dust all your reputation gone the whole work of your life o sir can't you feel even that can't you feel the dreadful end of it all gabriel cassilis the great gabriel cassilis a lame duck not even that the work of his life was forgotten with all its hopes and the great financier listening to his clerk with the polite impatience of one who listens to a wearisome sermon was trying to understand what was the meaning of that black shadow which lay upon his mind and made him uneasy for the rest a perfect calm in his brain people will say it was the shock of the eldorado smash well sir it wasn't that i know so much but it's best to let people think so if you haven't a penny left in the world you have your character and that's as high as ever fortunately mr mowll went on my own little savings were not in eldorado stock but my employment is gone i suppose you will recommend me i hope sir and i do think that i've got some little reputation in the city it was not for want of asserting himself that this worthy man failed at any rate of achieving his reputation for twenty years he had magnified his office as confidential adviser of a great city light among his friends and in his usual haunts he successfully posed as one burdened with the weight of affairs laden with responsibility and at all times oppressed by the importance of his thoughts he carried a pocket book which shut with a clasp in the midst of a conversation he would stop become abstracted rush at the pocket book so to speak confide a jotting to its care shut it with a snap and then go on with a smile and an excuse some said that he stood in with gabriel cassilis all thought that he shared his secrets and gave advice when asked for it as a matter of fact he was a clerk and had always been a clerk but he was a clerk who knew a few things which might have been awkward if told generally he had a fair salary but no confidence no advice and not much more real knowledge of what his chief was doing than any outsider and in this tremendous smash it was a great consolation to him to reflect that the liabilities represented an amount for which it was really a credit to fail mr mowll has since got another place where the transactions are not so large but perhaps his personal emoluments greater in the evenings he will talk of the great failure we stood to win he will say leaning back with a superior smile we stood to win l we lost a million and a quarter i told him not to hang on too long against my advice he did i remember ah only four days before it happened he said to me 'mowll my boy' he said 'i've never known you wrong yet but for once i fancy my own opinion we've worked together for twenty years' he said 'and you've the clearest head of any man i ever saw' he said 'but here i think you're wrong and i shall hold on for another day or two' he said ah little he knew what a day or two would bring forth and he hasn't spoken since plays with his little boy and goes about in a bath chair what a man he was and what a pair if i may say so we made between us among the bulls and the bears dear me dear me it may be mentioned here that everything was at once given up the house in kensington palace gardens with its costly furniture its carriages plate library and pictures mr cassilis signed whatever documents were brought for signature without hesitation provided a copy of his own signature was placed before him otherwise he could not write his name and never a single word of lamentation reproach or sorrow the past was and is still dead to him all the past except one thing and that is ever with him for sixty years of his life this man of the city whose whole desire was to make money to win in the game which he played with rare success and skill regarded bankruptcy as the one thing to be dreaded or at least to be looked upon because it was absurd to dread it as a thing bringing with it the whole of dishonour not to meet your engagements was to be in some sort a criminal and now he was proclaimed as one who could not meet his engagements if he understood what had befallen him he did not care about it the trouble was slight indeed in comparison with the other disaster the honour of his wife and the legitimacy of his child these were gone and the man felt what it is that is greater than money gained or money lost the blow which fell upon him left his brain clear while it changed the whole course of his thoughts and deprived him partially of memory but it destroyed his power of speech that rare and wonderful disease which seems to attack none but the strongest which separates the brain from the tongue takes away the knowledge and the sense of language and kills the power of connecting words with things while it leaves that of understanding what is said the disease which doctors call aphasia was upon mr gabriel cassilis in old men this is an incurable disease gabriel cassilis will never speak again he can read listen and understand but he can frame no words with his lips nor write them with his hand he is a prisoner who has free use of his limbs he is separated from the world by a greater gulf than that which divides the blind and the deaf from the rest of us because he cannot make known his thoughts his wants or his wishes it took some time to discover what was the matter with him patients are not often found suffering from aphasia and paralysis was the first name given to his disease but it was very early found out that mr cassilis understood all that was said to him and by degrees they learned what he liked and what he disliked victoria cassilis sat up stairs waiting for something she knew not what to happen her maid told her that mr cassilis was ill she made no reply she did not ask to see him she did not ask for any further news of him she sat in her own room for two days waiting then joseph jagenal asked if he might see her she refused at first but on hearing that he proposed to stay in the house till she could receive him she gave way he came from lawrence perhaps he would bring her a message of some kind probably a menace you have something to say to me mr jagenal her face was set hard but her eyes were wistful he saw that she was afraid when a woman is afraid you may make her do pretty well what you please i have a good deal to tell you mrs cassilis and i am sorry to say it is of an unpleasant nature i have heard he went on from mr colquhoun that you made a remarkable statement in the presence of miss fleming and in the hearing of mr cassilis lawrence informed you correctly i have no doubt she replied coldly that statement of course was untrue said joseph knowing that no record ever was more true and therefore i venture to advise on the part of lawrence in the name of mr colquhoun partly partly in your own interest go on if you please mr jagenal believing that statement to be untrue he repeated for otherwise i could not give this advice i recommend to all parties concerned silence your husband's paralysis is attributed to the shock of his bankruptcy his what cried victoria who had heard as yet nothing of the city disaster his bankruptcy mr cassilis is ruined ruined mr cassilis she was startled out of herself ruined the thought of such disaster had never once crossed her brains ruined that colossus of wealth the man whom she married for his money while secretly she despised his power of accumulating money he is ruined mrs cassilis and hopelessly i have read certain papers which he put into my hands this morning it is clear to me that his mind has been for some weeks agitated by certain anonymous letters which came to him every day and accused you pardon me mrs cassilis accused you of infidelity the letters state that there is a secret of some kind connected with your former acquaintance with mr colquhoun that you have been lately in the habit of receiving him or meeting him every day that you were in his chambers one evening when mr cassilis called with other particulars extremely calculated to excite jealousy and suspicion lastly he was sent by the writer to twickenham the rest i believe you know she made no reply there can be no doubt not the least doubt that had your husband's mind been untroubled this would never have happened the disaster is due to his jealousy i could kill her said mrs cassilis clenching her fist i could kill her kill whom the woman who wrote those letters it was a woman no man could have done such a thing a woman's trick go on there is nothing more to say how far other people are involved with your husband i cannot tell i am going now into the city to find out if i can your wild words mrs cassilis and your unguarded conduct have brought about misfortunes on which you little calculated but i am not here to reproach you you are my husband's man of business i suppose she replied coldly a paid servant of his what you say has no importance nor what you think what did lawrence bid you tell me joseph jagenal's face clouded for a moment but what was the good of feeling resentment with such a woman and in such a miserable business you have two courses open to you he went on you may by repeating the confession you made in the hearing of mr cassilis draw upon yourself such punishment as the law provided the confession be true can inflict that will be a grievous thing to you it will drive you out of society and brand you as a criminal it will lock you up for two years in prison it will leave a stigma never to be forgotten or obliterated it means ruin far far worse than what you have brought on mr cassilis on the other hand you may keep silence this at least will secure the legitimacy of your boy and will keep for you the amount settled on you at your marriage but you may choose if the statement you made is true of course i can be no party to compounding a felony and lawrence she interposed what does lawrence say in any case mr colquhoun will leave england at once he will marry that phillis girl you may tell him she hissed out that i will do anything and suffer anything rather than consent to his marrying her or any one else mr colquhoun informs me further pursued the crafty lawyer that for some reason only known to himself he will never marry during the life of a certain person phillis fleming will probably marry the honourable mr ronald dunquerque she buried her head in her hands not to hide any emotion for there was none to hide but to think presently she rose and said take me to my husband if you please joseph jagenal as a lawyer is tolerably well versed in such wickedness and deceptions as the human heart is capable of at the same time he acknowledges to himself that the speech made by victoria cassilis to her husband and the manner in which it was delivered surpassed anything he had ever experienced or conceived gabriel cassilis was sitting in an arm chair near his table in his arms was his infant son a child of a year old for whose amusement he was dangling a bunch of keys the nurse was standing beside him when his wife opened the door he looked up and there crossed his face a sudden expression of such repulsion indignation and horror that the lawyer fairly expected the lady to give way altogether but she did not then mrs cassilis motioned the nurse to leave them and victoria said what she had come to say she stood at the table in the attitude of one who commands respect rather than one who entreats pardon her accentuation was precise and her words as carefully chosen as if she had written them down first but her husband held his eyes down as if afraid of meeting her gaze you would have called him a culprit waiting for reproof and punishment i learn to day for the first time that you have suffered from certain attacks made upon me by an anonymous writer i learn also for the first time and to my great regret that you have suffered in fortune as well as in health i have myself been too ill in mind and body to be told anything i am come to say at once that i am sorry if any rash words of mine have given you pain or any foolish actions of mine have given you reason for jealousy the exact truth is that lawrence colquhoun and i were once engaged the breaking off of that engagement caused me at the time the greatest unhappiness i resolved then that he should never be engaged to any other girl if i could prevent it by any means in my power my whole action of late which appeared to you as if i was running after an old lover was the prevention of his engagement which i determined to break off with phillis fleming in the heat of my passion i used words which were not true they occurred to me at the moment i said he was my husband i meant to have said my promised husband you now know mr cassilis the whole secret i am deeply humiliated in having to confess my revengeful spirit i am punished in your affliction always herself always her own punishment we can henceforth i presume mr cassilis resume our old manner of life mr cassilis made no answer but he patted the head of his child and joseph jagenal saw the tears running down his cheeks for he knew that the woman lied to him for the sake of the boy mr cassilis the lawyer pleaded let things go on as before he made no sign will you let me say something for you in the interests of the child he nodded then mrs cassilis your husband consents that there shall be no separation and no scandal but it will be advisable for you both that there shall be as little intercourse as possible your husband will breakfast and dine by himself and occupy his own apartments you are free provided you live in the same house and keep up appearances to do whatever you please but you will not obtrude your presence upon your husband mr cassilis nodded again then he sought his dictionary and hunted for a word it was the word he had first found and was silence yes you will also observe strict silence on what has passed at twickenham here or elsewhere should that silence not be observed the advisers of mr cassilis will recommend such legal measures as may be necessary again gabriel cassilis nodded he had not once looked up at his wife since that first gaze in which he concentrated the hatred and loathing of his speechless soul is that all asked victoria cassilis or have we more arrangements that is all madam said joseph opening the door with great ceremony she went away as she had come with cold haughtiness nothing seemed to touch her not her husband's misery not his ruin not the sight of her child one thing only pleased her lawrence colquhoun would not marry during her lifetime bah she would live a hundred years and he should never marry at all in her own room was her maid tomlinson said mrs cassilis in spite of her outward calm her nerves were strung to the utmost and she felt that she must speak to some one tomlinson if a woman wrote anonymous letters about you if those letters brought misery and misfortune what would you do to that woman i do not know ma'am said tomlinson whose cheeks grew white i will kill her tomlinson i will kill her i will get those letters and prove the handwriting and find that woman out i will devote my life to it and i will have no mercy on her when i have found her i will kill her somehow by poison by stabbing somehow don't tremble woman i don't mean you and tomlinson forget what i have said tomlinson could not forget she tottered from the room trembling in every limb the wretched maid had her revenge in full and overflowing measure and yet she was not satisfied the exasperating thing about revenge is that it never does satisfy but leaves you at the end as angry as at the beginning your enemy is crushed you have seen him tied to a stake as is the pleasant wont of the red indian and stick arrows knives and red hot things into him these hurt so much that he is glad to die but he is dead and you can do no more to him and it seems a pity because if you had kept him alive you might have thought of other and more dreadful ways of revenge these doubts will occur to the most revenge satiated christian and they lead to self reproach after all one might just as well forgive a fellow at once mrs cassilis was a selfish and heartless woman all the harm that was done to her was the loss of her great wealth and what had her husband done to tomlinson that he should be stricken and what had others done who were involved with him in the great disaster tomlinson was so terrified however by the look which crossed her mistress's face that she went away that very evening pretended to have received a telegram from liverpool when she got there wrote for boxes and wages with a letter in somebody else's writing for a reason to her mistress and then went to america where she had relations she lives now in a city of the western states where her brother keeps a store she is a leader in her religious circle and i think that if she were to see victoria cassilis by any accident in the streets of that city she would fly again and to the farthest corners of the earth so much for revenge and i do hope that tomlinson's example will be laid to heart and pondered by other ladies' maids whose mistresses are selfish and sharp tempered chapter xlv farewell to all my greatness the last day of gilead beck's wealth he rose as unconscious of his doom as that frolicsome kid whose destiny brought the tear to delia's eye had he looked at the papers he would at least have ascertained that gabriel cassilis was ruined but he had a rooted dislike to newspapers and never looked at them he classed the editor of the times with mr huggins of clearville or mr van cott of chicago but supposed that he had a larger influence politics he despised criticism was beyond him with social matters he had no concern and it would wound the national self respect were he to explain how carelessly he regarded matters which to londoners seem of world wide importance on this day gilead rose early because there was a good deal to look after his breakfast was fixed for eleven a real breakfast at six he was dressed and making in his mind's eye the arrangements for seating his guests mr and mrs cassilis mrs l'estrange and phillis lawrence colquhoun ladds and jack dunquerque all his most intimate friends were coming he had also invited the twins but a guilty conscience made them send an excuse they were now sitting at home sober by compulsion and in great wretchedness as has been seen the breakfast was to be held in the same room in which he once entertained the men of genius but the appointments were different gilead beck now went in for flowers to please the ladies flowers in june do not savour of ostentation also for fruit strawberries apricots cherries and grapes in early june are not things quite beyond precedent and his conscience acquitted him of display which might seem shoddy and when the table was laid with its flowers and fruit and dainty cold dishes garnished with all sorts of pretty things it was he felt a work of art which reflected the highest credit on himself and everybody concerned gilead beck was at great peace with himself that morning he was resolved on putting into practice at once some of those schemes which the golden butterfly demanded as loudly as it could whisper he would start that daily paper which should be independent of commercial success have no advertisements boil down the news do without long leaders and always speak the truth without evasion equivocation suppression or exaggeration a miracle in journalism he would run the great national drama which should revive the ancient glories of the stage and for the rest he would be guided by circumstances and when a big thing had to be done he would step in with his pile and do that big thing by himself there was in all this perhaps a little over rating the power of the pile but gilead beck was after all only human think what an inflation of dignity brother de pauper et egens would follow in your own case on the acquisition of fifteen hundred pounds a day another thing pleased our gilead he knew that in his own country the difficulty of getting into what he felt to be the best society would be insuperable the society of shoddy the companionship with the quickly grown rich and the friendship of the gilded bladder are in the reach of every wealthy man but gilead was a man of finer feelings he wanted more than this he wanted the friendship of those who were born in the purple of good breeding in new york he could not have got this in london he did get it his friends were ladies and gentlemen they not only tolerated him but they liked him they were people to whom he could give nothing but they courted his society and this pleased him more than any other part of his grand luck there was no great merit in their liking the man rude as his life had been he was gifted with the tenderest and kindest heart lowly born and roughly bred he was yet a man of boundless sympathies and because he had kept his self respect throughout and was ashamed of nothing he slipt easily and naturally into the new circle picking up without difficulty what was lacking of external things yet he was just the same as when he landed in england with the same earnest almost solemn way of looking at things the same gravity the same twang which marked his nationality he affected nothing and pretended nothing he hid nothing and was ashamed of nothing he paraded nothing and wanted to be thought no other than the man he was the ex miner ex adventurer ex everything who by a lucky stroke hit upon ile and was living on the profits and perhaps in all the world there was no happier man than gilead beck on that bright june morning which was to be the last day of his grandeur a purling stream of content murmured and babbled hymns of praise in his heart he had no fears his nerves were strong he expected nothing but a continuous flow of prosperity and happiness the first to arrive was jack dunquerque now if this youth had read the papers he would have been able to communicate some of the fatal news but he had not because he was full of phillis and if any rumour of the eldorado collapse smote his ears it smote them unnoticed because he did not connect eldorado with gilead beck what did it matter to this intolerably selfish young man how many british speculators lost their money by the eldorado smash when he was going to meet phillis after all the round world and all that is therein do really rotate about a pole of course invisible which goes through every man's own centre of gravity and sticks out in a manner which may be felt by him and the reason why men have so many different opinions is i am persuaded this extraordinary miraculous multitudinous simultaneous revolution of the earth upon her million axes enough for jack that phillis was coming phillis whom he had not seen since the discovery more memorable to him than any made by traveller or physicist of the coping stone jack came smiling and bounding up the stairs with agile spring a good half hour before the time perhaps phillis might be before him but she was not then came ladds gilead beck saw that there was some trouble upon him but forbore to ask him what it was he bore his heavy inscrutable look such as that with which he had been wont to meet gambling losses untoward telegrams from newmarket and other buffetings of fate then came a letter from mrs cassilis her husband was ill and therefore she could not come then came a letter from lawrence colquhoun he had most important business in the city and therefore he could not come seems like the wedding feast said gilead irreverently he was a little disconcerted by the defection of so many guests but he had a leaf taken out of the table and cheerfully waited for the remaining two they came at last and i think the hearts of all three leaped within them at sight of phillis's happy face if it was sweet before when jack first met her with the mysterious look of childhood on it it was far sweeter now with the bloom and blush of conscious womanhood the modest light of maidenly joy with which she met her lover jack rushed so to speak at her hand and held it with a ridiculous shamelessness only excusable on the ground that they were almost in a family circle then phillis shook hands with gilead beck with a smile of gratitude which meant a good deal more than preliminary thanks for the coming breakfast then it came to ladds's turn he turned very red i do not know why and whispered in his deepest bass know all about it lucky beggar jack wish you happiness thank you captain ladds phillis replied in her fearless fashion i am very happy already and so is jack wanted yesterday ladds went on in the same deep whisper wanted yesterday to offer some slight token of regard found i couldn't no more money eldorado smash all gone locked in boxes found ring once my mother's will you accept it phillis understood the ring but she did not understand the rest of the speech it was one of those old fashioned rings set in pearls and brilliants she was not by any means above admiring rings and she accepted it with a cheerful alacrity sell up ladds growled go away do something earn the daily crust but i don't understand she interrupted never mind tell you after breakfast tell you all presently and then they went to breakfast it was rather a silent party ladds was as might have been expected of a man who had lost his all disposed to taciturnity jack and phillis were too happy to talk much agatha l'estrange and the host had all the conversation to themselves agatha asked him if the dainty spread before them was the usual method of breakfast in america gilead beck replied that of late years he had been accustomed to call a chunk of cold pork with a piece of bread a substantial breakfast and that the same luxuries furnished him as a rule with dinner the old life he said had its points i confess for those who love cold pork it was one long round of delirious joy and there was always the future to look forward to now the future has come i like it better my experience mrs l'estrange is that you may divide men into two classes those who've got a future and those who haven't i belonged to the class who had a future sometimes we miss it and i feel like to cry whenever i think of the boys with a bright future before them who fell in the war at my side not in tens but in hundreds sometimes we find it i found it when i struck ile and always for those men whether the future come early or whether it come late it lies bright and shinin' before them and so they never lose hope and have women no future as well as men mr beck asked phillis i don't know miss fleming but i hope you have before my golden butterfly came to me i was lookin' forward for my future and i knew it was bound to come in some form or other i looked forward for thirty years my youth was gone when it came and half my manhood but it is here perhaps mr beck said mrs l'estrange who was a little rococo in her morality it is well that this great fortune did not come to you when you were younger you think that madam perhaps it is so to fool around new york would be a poor return for the luck of the butterfly yes better as it is providence knows very well what to be about it don't need promptin' from us and impatience is no manner of use not the least use in the world at the right time the luck comes at the right time the luck will go yes he looked solemnly round the table some day the luck is bound to go when it goes i hope i shall be prepared for the change but if it goes to morrow it cannot take away mrs l'estrange the memory of these few months your friendship and yours miss fleming there's things which do not depend upon ile more things than i thought formerly things which money cannot do more than once i thought my pile ought to find it easy to do somethin' useful before the time comes but the world is a more tangled web than i used to think there are always the poor among us said the good agatha yes madam that is true and there always will be more you give to the poor more you make them poor there's folks goin' up and folks goin' down you in england help the folks goin' down you make them fall easy i want to help the folks goin' up at this moment a telegram was brought for him it was from his london bankers they informed him that a cheque for a small sum had been presented but that his balance was already overdrawn and that they had received a telegram from new york on which they would be glad to see him gilead beck read it and could not understand it the cheque was for his own weekly account at the hotel he laid the letter aside and went on with his exposition of the duties and responsibilities of wealth he pointed out to mrs l'estrange who alone listened to him jack was whispering to phillis and ladds was absorbed in thoughts of his own that when he arrived in london he was possessed with the idea that all he had to do in order to protect benefit and advance humanity was to found a series of institutions that in the pursuit of this idea he had visited and examined all the british institutions he could hear of and that his conclusions were that they were all a failure for he concluded what have you done your citizens need not save money because a hospital a church an almshouse a dispensary and a workhouse stand in every parish they need not be moral because there's homes for the repentant in every other street all around they are protected by charity and the state even if they get knocked down in the street they need not fight because there's a policeman within easy hail you breed your poor mrs l'estrange and you take almighty care to keep them always with you in my country he who can work and won't work goes to the wall he starves and a good thing too here he gets fat every way he went on you encourage your people to do nothing your clever young men get a handsome income for life i am told at oxford and cambridge if they pass one good examination for us the examination is only the beginning your clergymen get a handsome income for life whether they do their work or not ours have got to go on preachin' well and livin' well else we want to know the reason why you give your subalterns as much as other nations give their colonels you set them down to a grand mess every day as if they were all born lords you keep four times as many naval officers as you want and ten times as many generals it's all waste and lavishin' from end to end and as for your royal family i reckon that i'd find a dozen families in massachusetts alone who'd run the royal mill for a tenth of the money i own they wouldn't have the same gracious manners he added and your princess is wal if miss fleming were princess she couldn't do the part better perhaps gracious manners are worth paying for here another telegram was brought him it was from new york it informed him in plain and intelligible terms that his wells had all run dry that his credit was exhausted and that no more bills would be honoured he read this aloud with a firm voice and unfaltering eye then he looked round him and said solemnly the time has come it's come a little sooner than i expected but it has come at last he was staggered but he remembered something which consoled him at least he said if the income is gone the pile remains that's close upon half a million of english money we can do something with that mr cassilis has got it all for me who cried ladds eagerly mr gabriel cassilis the great english financier he is ruined said ladds he has failed for two millions sterling if your money is in his hands part of it i believe was in eldorado stock the eldoradians cannot pay their interest and the stock has sunk to nothing gabriel cassilis has lost all my money in it at least i have lost it on his recommendation your money all gone tommy cried jack all jack ladds' aromatic cocoa fragrant nutritious no use now business sold twenty years ago proceeds sunk in eldorado stock nothing but the smell left and while they were gazing in each other's face with mute bewilderment a third messenger arrived with a letter it was from mr mowll the secretary it informed poor gilead that mr gabriel cassilis had drawn in accordance with his power of attorney upon him to the following extent a bewildering mass of figures followed at the bottom of which was the total gilead beck's two million dollars that further gabriel cassilis always it appeared acting on the wishes of mr beck had invested the whole sum in eldorado stock that c he threw the letter on the table half unread then after a moment's hesitation he rose solemnly and sought the corner of the room in which stood the safe containing the emblem of his luck he opened it and took out the box of glass and gold which held it this was covered with a case of green leather he carried it to the table they all crowded round while he raised the leathern cover and displayed the butterfly has any one he lifted his head and looked helplessly round has any one felt an airthquake for a strange thing had happened the wings of the insect were lying on the floor of the box the white quartz which formed its body had slipped from the gold wire which held it up and the golden butterfly was in pieces he opened the box with a little gold key and took out the fragments of the two wings and the body gone he said broken 'if this golden butterfly fall and break farewell the luck of gilead p beck' your own lines mr dunquerque broken into little bits it is the ile run dry the credit exhausted and the pile fooled away no one spoke i am sorry for you most mr dunquerque i am powerful sorry sir i had hoped with the assistance of miss fleming to divide that pile with you now sir i've got nothing not a red cent left to divide with a beggar mrs l'estrange he went on those last words of mine were prophetic when i am gone back to america i suppose the odds and ends here will pay my passage you'll remember that i said the luck would some day go it was all so sudden so incomprehensible that no one present had a word to say either of sympathy or of sorrow gilead beck proceeded with his soliloquy i've had a real high time for three months the best three months of my life whatever happens more can't touch the memory of the last three months i've met english ladies and made friends of english gentlemen there's amer'can ladies and amer'can gentlemen but i can't speak of them because i never went into their society you don't find ladies and gentlemen in empire city and in all the trades i've turned my attention to from school keepin' to editing there's not been one where amer'can ladies cared to show their hand that means that the stars and stripes may be as good as the union jack come to know them he stopped and pulled himself together with a laugh i can't make it out somehow seems as if i'm in a dream is it real is the story of the golden butterfly a true story or is it made up out of some man's brain it is real mr beck said phillis softly putting her hand in his it is real no one could have invented such a story see dear mr beck you that we all love so much there is you in it and i am in it and and the twins why if people saw us all in a book they would say it was impossible i am the only girl in all the civilised world who can neither read nor write and jack doesn't mind it and you are the only man who ever found the golden butterfly indeed it is all real it is all real beck jack echoed you have had the high time and sorry indeed we are that it is over but perhaps it is not all over surely something out of the two million dollars must have remained mr beck pointed sorrowfully to the three pieces which were the fragments of the butterfly nothing is left he said nothing except the solid gold that made his cage and that will go to pay the hotel bill mrs l'estrange looked on in silence what was this quiet lady this woman of even and uneventful life to say in the presence of such misfortune ladds held out his hand worth twenty of any of us he said we are in the same boat and you too captain ladds gilead cried it is worse than my own misfortune because i am a rough man and can go back to the rough life no mrs l'estrange no my dear young lady i can't not with the same light heart as before you've spoiled me i must strike out something new away from empire city and ile and gold i'm spoiled it's not the cold chunk of pork that i am afraid of it is the beautiful life and the sweetness that i'm going to lose i said i hoped i should be prepared to meet the fall of my luck when it came but i never thought it would come like this stay with us mr beck said phillis don't go back to the old life stay with us said jack we will all live together do not leave us mr beck said mrs l'estrange women can blush although they may be past forty stay here with your friends he looked from one to the other and something like a tear glittered in his eye but he shook his head then he took up the wings of the butterfly the pretty golden laminae cut in the perfect shape of a wing marked and veined by nature as if for once she was determined to show that she too could be an artist and imitate her self they lay in her hands and he looked fondly at them what shall i do with these he said softly they have been very good to me they have given me the pleasantest hours of my life they have made me dream of power as if i was autocrat of all the russians say mrs l'estrange since my chief pleasure has come through mr dunquerque may i offer the broken butterfly to miss fleming he laid the wings before her with a sweet sad smile jack took them up and looked at them in the white quartz were the little holes where the wings had fitted he put them back in their old place the wings in the quartz they fitted exactly and in a moment the butterfly was as it had always been jack deftly bent round it again the golden wire which held it to the golden flower singular to relate the wire fitted like the wings just the same as before and the butterfly vibrated on its perch again it's wonderful cried gilead beck it's the luck i've given away it's gone to you miss fleming but it won't take the form of ile then take it back mr beck cried phillis no young lady the luck left me of its own accord that was shown when the butterfly fell off the wires it is yours now yours and you will make a better use of it i think he went on with his hand upon the golden case i think there's a luck in the world which i never dreamed of a better luck than ile mrs l'estrange you know what sort of luck i mean yes mr beck i know she replied phillis laid her hands on jack's shoulder while his arm stole round her waist it is love mr beck said the girl yes that is the best luck in all the world and i am sure of it jack stooped and kissed her the simplicity and innocence of this maiden went to gilead beck's heart they were a religion to him an education in the presence of that guileless heart all earthly thoughts dropped from his soul and he was like the girl before him pure in heart and clean in memory that is indeed the sweet enchantment of innocence a bewitchment out of which we need never awake unless we like take the case and all miss fleming said gilead beck but she would not have the splendid case with its thick plate glass and solid gold pillars then gilead beck brought out the little wooden box the same in which the golden butterfly lay when he ran from the bear on the slopes of the sierra nevada and phillis laid her new treasure in the cotton wool and slung the box by its steel chain round his neck laughing in a solemn fashion while they talked thus sadly the door opened and lawrence colquhoun stood before them agatha cried out when she saw him because he was transformed the lazy insouciant look was gone a troubled look was in its place worse than a troubled look a look of misery a look of self reproach a look as of a criminal brought to the bar and convicted lawrence cried mrs l'estrange he came into the room in a helpless sort of way his hands shaking before him like those of some half blind old man phillis he said in hoarse voice forgive me what have i to forgive lawrence forgive me he repeated humbly nay you do not understand dunquerque it is for you to speak for all of you you all love phillis agatha you love her you used to love me too how shall i tell you i think we guess said gilead i did it for the best phillis i thought to double your fortune cassilis said i should double it i thought to double my own i put all your money child every farthing of your money in eldorado stock by his advice and all my own too and it is all gone every penny of it gone jack dunquerque clasped phillis tighter by the hand she only laughed why lawrence she said what if you have lost all my money jack doesn't care do you jack no darling no said jack and at the moment such was the infatuation of this young man he really did not care lawrence said agatha you acted for the best don't dear lawrence don't trouble too much captain ladds has lost all his fortune too and mr beck has lost all his and we are all ruined together all ruined together echoed gilead beck looking at mrs l'estrange gabriel cassilis is a wonderful man i always said he was a wonderful man in the evening the three ruined men sat together in gilead's room nothing saved colquhoun asked ladds after a long pause nothing the stock was when i bought in at percent it is now anything you like what you please because no one will buy it wal said gilead beck it does seem rough on us all and perhaps it's rougher on you two than it is on me but to think only to think that such an almighty pile should be fooled away on a darned half caste state like eldorado and for all of us to believe mr gabriel cassilis a whole souled high toned speculator once i thought he continued that we amer'cans must be the ten tribes because i said nobody but one out of the ten tribes would get such a providential lift as the golden butterfly gentlemen my opinions are changed since this morning i believe we're nothing better not a single cent better than one of the kicked out tribes i may be an amalekite or i may be a hivite but i'm darned if i ever call myself again one of the children of abraham chapter the last whisper love ye breezes sigh in love's content soft air of morn let eve in brighter sunsets die and day with brighter dawn be born it is a week since the disastrous day gilead beck has sold the works of art with which he intended to found his grand national collection he has torn up his great schemes for a national theatre a grand national paper he has ceased to think for the delectation of the golden butterfly about improving the human race his gratitude to that prodigy of nature has so far cooled that he now considers it more in the light of a capricious sprite a sort of robin good fellow than as a benefactor he has also changed his views as to the construction of the round earth and all that is therein ile he says may be found by other lucky adventures but ile is not to be depended on for a permanence he would now recommend those who strike ile to make their pile as quickly as may be and devote all their energies to the safety of that pile and as to the human race it may slide what's the good he says to jack dunquerque of helpin' up those that are bound to climb let them climb and what's the good of tryin' to save those that are bound to fall let them fall i'm down myself but i mean to get up again it is sad to record that mr burls the picture dealer refused to buy back again the great picture of sisera and jael no one would purchase the work at all mr beck offered it to the langham hotel as a gift the directors firmly declined to accept it when it was evident that this remarkable effort of genius was appreciated by no one gilead beck resolved on leaving it where it was it is rumoured that the manager of the hotel bribed the owner of a certain regent street restaurant to take it away and i have heard that it now hangs having been greatly cut down on the wall of that establishment getting its tones mellowed day by day with the steam of roast and boiled as for the other pictures mr burls expressed his extreme sorrow that temporary embarrassment prevented him purchasing them back at the price given for them he afterwards told mr beck that the unprincipled picture dealer who did ultimately buy them at the price of so much a square foot and as second rate copies was a disgrace to his honourable profession he he said stood high in public estimation for truth generosity and fair dealing none but genuine works came from his own establishment and what he called a grooze was a grooze and nothing but a grooze as for the pile gilead's power of attorney had effectually destroyed that there was not a cent left not one single coin to rub against another all was gone in that great crash he called upon gabriel cassilis the financier smiled upon him with his newly born air of sweetness and trust but as we have seen he could no longer speak and there was nothing in his face to express sorrow or repentance gilead found himself when all was wound up the possessor of that single cheque which joseph jagenal had placed in his hands and which most fortunately for himself he had not paid into the bank four hundred pounds with that at forty five he was to begin the world again after all the majority of mankind at forty five have much less than four hundred pounds he heard from canada that the town he had built the whole of which belonged to him was deserted again there was a quicker rush out of it than into it it stands there now more lonely than empire city its derricks and machinery rusting and dropping to pieces the houses empty and neglected the land relapsing into its old condition of bog and marsh but gilead beck will never see it again he kept away from twickenham during this winding up and settlement of affairs it was a week later when his mind at rest and his conscience clear of bills and doubts because now there was nothing more to lose he called at the house where he had spent so many pleasant hours mrs l'estrange received him she was troubled in look and the traces of tears were on her face it is a most onfortunate time gilead said sympathetically a most onfortunate time blow after blow mr beck agatha sobbed stroke upon stroke that is so madam they've got the knife well in this time and when they give it a twist we're bound to cry out you've thought me selfish i know not to inquire before no mr beck no it is only too kind of you to think of us in your overwhelming disaster i have never spent so wretched a week poor lawrence has literally not a penny left except what he gets from the sale of his horses pictures and things captain ladds is the same phillis has no longer a farthing and now oh dear oh dear i am going to lose her altogether but when she marries mr dunquerque you will see her often no no haven't they told you jack has got almost nothing only ten thousand pounds altogether and they have made up their minds to emigrate they are going to virginia where jack will buy a small estate is that so asked gilead meditatively lawrence says that he and captain ladds will go away together somewhere perhaps back to empire city and you will be left alone you mrs l'estrange all alone in this country and ruined it mustn't be he straightened himself up and looked round the room it must not be mrs l'estrange you know me partly that is you know the manner of man i wish to seem and try to be you know what i have been you do not know because you cannot guess the things which you have put into my head mrs l'estrange blushed and began to tremble could it be possible that he was actually going to he was you and i together mrs l'estrange are gone to wreck in this almighty hurricane i've got one or two thousand dollars left perhaps you will have as much perhaps not mrs l'estrange you will think it presumptuous in a rough american not an american gentleman by birth and raising to offer you such protection and care as he can give to the best of women we too will go to virginia with mr dunquerque and his wife we will settle near them and watch their happiness the virginians are a kindly folk and love the english people especially if they are of gentle birth say mrs l'estrange o mr beck i am forty years of age and i am five and forty just then phillis and jack burst into the room they did not look at all like being ruined they were wild with joy and good spirits and you are going to virginia mr dunquerque said gilead i am thinking of going too if i can persuade this lady to go with me o agatha come with us come with me corrected gilead then phillis saw how things lay what a change in phillis to see so much and half laughing but more in seriousness than in mirth threw her arms round agatha's neck will you come dear agatha he is a good man and he loves you and we will all live near together and be happy three short scenes to conclude my story it is little more than a year since agatha l'estrange as shy and blushing as any maiden much more shy than phillis laid her hand in gilead's with the confession half sobbed out and it isn't a mistake you are making because i am not ruined at all it is only you and these poor children and lawrence we are back again to empire city it is the early fall september the yellow leaves clothe all the forests with brown and gold the sunlight strikes upon the peaks and ridges of the great sierra lights up the broad belt of wood making shadows blacker than night and lies along the grass grown streets of the deserted empire city two men in hunting dress are making their way slowly through the grass and weeds that choke the pathway don't like it colquhoun says one more ghostly than ever they push on and presently the foremost ladds starts back with a cry what is it asks colquhoun they push aside the brambles and behold a skeleton the body has been on its knees but now only the bones are left they are clothed in the garb of the celestial and one side of the skull is broken in as if with a shot it must be my old friend achow said colquhoun calmly see he's been murdered in the dead of night ladds awakened colquhoun can't help it he said very sorry ghosts walking about the stairs says the ghost of achow to the shade leeching 'no your piecy pidgin makee shootee me' don't like ghosts colquhoun next morning they left empire city ladds was firm in the conviction that he had heard and seen a chinaman's ghost and was resolute against stopping another night in the place just outside the town they made another discovery good lord cried ladds frightened out of sobriety of speech it rains skeletons look there he's beckoning and to be sure before them was raised with finger as of invitation a skeleton hand this too belonged to a complete assortment of human bones clad in chinese dress by its side lay a rusty pistol lawrence picked it up by gad he said it's the same pistol i gave to leeching how do you read this story ladds ladds sat down and replied slowly he said that he never did like reading ghost stories and since the apparition of the murdered achow the night before he should like them still less ghost stories he said are all very well until you come to see and hear a ghost now that he had a ghost story of his own an original one in pigeon english he did not intend ever to read another therefore colquhoun must excuse him if he gave up the story of leeching's skeleton entirely to his own reading he then went on to say that he never had liked skeletons and that he believed empire city was nothing but a mouldy old churchyard without the church while as a cemetery it wasn't a patch upon highgate and the mention of highgate he said reminded him of phillis and he proposed they should both get to virginia and call upon jack and his wife all this took time to explain and meanwhile lawrence was poking the butt end of his gun about in the grass to see if there was anything more there was something more it was a bag of coarse yellow canvas tied by a string round what had been the waist of a man lawrence cut the string and opened the bag we're in luck tommy look at this it was the gold so laboriously scraped together by the two chinamen which had caused in a manner the death of both lift it tommy colquhoun grew excited at his find lift it there must be a hundred and fifty ounces i should think it will be worth four or five hundred pounds here's a find to this pair who had only a year ago chucked away their thousands the luck of picking up a bag of gold appeared something wonderful tommy said colquhoun i tell you what we will do we will add this little windfall to what beck would call your little pile and my little pile and we'll go and buy a little farm in virginia too and we will live there close to jack and phillis agatha will like it too and there's capital shooting gabriel cassilis and his wife reside at brighton the whole of the great fortune being lost they have nothing but victoria's settlement that gives them a small income enough to subsist upon victoria tells her friends the old man he looks very old and fragile now is wheeled about in a chair on sunny days when he is not being wheeled about he plays with his child to whom he talks that is pours out a stream of meaningless words because he will never again talk coherently victoria is exactly the same as ever cold calm and proud nor is there anything whatever in her manner to her husband if she accidentally meets him to show that she has the slightest sorrow shame or repentance for the catastrophe she brought about joseph jagenal is working the great dyson will case for them and is confident that he will get the testator's intentions which can now be only imperfectly understood set aside when gabriel cassilis will once more become comparatively wealthy on a verandah in sunny virginia agatha beck sits quietly working and crooning some old song in sheer content and peace of heart presently she lifts her head as she hears a step that smile with which she greets her husband shows that she is happy in her new life gilead beck is in white with a broad straw hat because it is in hot september in his hand he has a letter good news wife good news he says jack and phillis are coming here to day and will stay till monday will be here almost as soon as the note baby coming too of course gilead says agatha smiling superior as if the dear girl would go anywhere without her little philip and six weeks old to morrow everybody who has appreciated how very far from clever jack dunquerque was will be prepared to hear that he committed an enormous etymological blunder in the baptism of his boy whom he named philip in the firm belief that philip was the masculine form of phillis here they come here they are jack comes rattling up to the house in his american trap jumps out throws the reins to the boy and hands out his wife with the child kisses and greetings phillis seems at first unchanged except perhaps that the air of virginia has made her sweet delicacy of features more delicate yet look again and you find that she is changed she was a child when we saw her first then we saw her grow into a maiden she is a wife and a mother now she whispers her husband all right phil dear beck you've got to shut your eyes for just one minute no turn your back so now you may look phillis has hung round the neck of her unconscious baby by a golden chain the golden butterfly it seems as strong and vigorous as ever and as it lies upon the child's white dress it looks as if it were poised for a moment's rest but ready for flight that inseck said gilead sentimentally wal it's given me the best thing that a man can get he took the hand of his wife love and friendship you are welcome phillis to all the rest provided that all the rest does not take away these nay she said her eyes filling with the gentle dew of happiness and content i have all that i want for myself i have my husband and my boy my little little philip i am more than happy and so i give to tiny phil all the remaining luck of the golden butterfly the end
