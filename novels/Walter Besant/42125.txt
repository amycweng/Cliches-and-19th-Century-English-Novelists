armorel of lyonesse part i chapter i the child of samson it was the evening of a fine september day through the square window built out so as to form another room almost as large as that which had been thus enlarged the autumn sun now fast declining to the west poured in warm and strong but not too warm or too strong for the girl on whose head it fell as she sat leaning back in the low chair her face turned towards the window the sun of scilly is never too fierce or too burning in summer nor in winter does it ever lose its force in july when the people of the adjacent islands of great britain and ireland venture not forth into the glare of the sun here the soft sea mists and the strong sea air temper the heat and in december the sun still shines with a lingering warmth as if he loved the place this girl lived in the sunshine all the year round rowed in it lay in it basked in it bareheaded summer and winter in the winter she would sit sheltered from the wind in some warm corner of the rocks in summer she would lie on the hillside or stand upon the high headlands and the seabeat crags while the breezes which in the land of lyonesse do never cease played with her long tresses and kept her soft cheek cool the window was wide open on all three sides the girl had been doing some kind of work but it had dropped from her hands and now lay unregarded on the floor she was gazing upon the scene before her but with the accustomed eyes which looked out upon it every day a girl who has such a picture continually before her all day long never tires of it though she may not be always consciously considering it and praising it the stranger for his part cannot choose but cry aloud for admiration but the native who knows it as no stranger can is silent the house halfway up the low hill looked out upon the southto be exact its aspect was s w by sso that from this window the girl saw always stretched out at her feet the ocean now glowing in the golden sunshine of september had she been tall enough she might even have seen the coast of south america the nearest land in the far distance looking s w that is she would have seen the broad mouth of oroonooque and the shores of el dorado this broad seascape was broken exactly in the middle by the bishops rock and its stately lighthouse rising tall and straight out of the water on the left hand the low hill of annet shut out the sea and on the right great minalto rugged and black the white foam always playing round its foot or flying over its great black northern headland bounded and framed the picture almost in the middle of the water not more than two miles distant a sailing ship all sails set made swift way bound outward one knows not whither lovely at all times is a ship in full sail but doubly lovely when she is seen from afar sailing on a smooth sea under a cloudless sky the sun of afternoon lighting up her white sails no other ships were in sight there was not even the long line of smoke which proclaims the steamer below the horizon there was not even a penzance fishingboat tacking slowly homewards with brown sails and its two masts in this direction there was no other sign of man the girl i say saw this sight every day she never tired of it partly because no one ever tires of the place in which he was born and has livednot even an arab of the great sandy desert partly because the sea which has been called by unobservant poets unchanging does in fact changeface colour mood even shapeevery day and is never the same except perhaps when the east wind of march covers the sky with a monotony of grey and takes the colour out of the face of ocean as it takes the colour from the granite rocks last years brown and yellow fern and the purple heath to this girl who lived with the sea around her it always formed a setting a background a frame for her thoughts and dreams wherever she went whatever she said or sang or thought or did there was always in her ears the lapping or the lashing of the waves always before her eyes was the white surge flying over the rocks always the tumbling waves but as for what she actually thought or what she dreamed seeing how ignorant of the world she was and how innocent and how young and as for what was passing in her mind this afternoon as she sat at the window i know not on the first consideration of the thing one would be inclined to ask how without knowledge can a girl think or imagine or dream anything on further thought one understands that knowledge has very little to do with dreams or fancies yet with or without knowledge no poet sacred bard or prophet has ever been able to divine the thoughts of a girl or to interpret them or even to set them down in consecutive language i suppose they are not in truth thoughts thought implies reasoning and the connection of facts and the experience of life as far as it has gone a young maidens mind is full of dimly seen shadows and pallid ghosts which flit across the brain and disappear these shadows have the semblance of shape but it is dim and uncertain they have the pretence of colour but it changes every moment if they seem to show a face it vanishes immediately and is forgotten yet these shadows smile upon the young with kindly eyes they beckon with their fingers and point to where low down on the horizon with cloudy outline lies the purple islandto such a girl as this the future is always a small island girt by the sea far off and lonely the shadows whisper to her they sing to her but no girl has ever yet told useven if she understandswhat it is they tell her she had been lying there quiet and motionless for an hour or more ever since the teathings had been taken awayat holy hill they have tea at halfpast four the ancient lady who was in the room with her had fallen back again into the slumber which held her nearly all day long as well as all the night the house seemed thoroughly wrapped and lapped in the softest peace and stillness in one corner a high clock woodencased swung its brass pendulum behind a pane of glass with solemn and sonorous chronicle of the moments so that they seemed to march rather than to fly a clock ought not to tick as if father time were hurried and driven along without dignity and by a scourge this clock for one was not in a hurry its tick showed that time rests notbut hastes not there is admonition in such a clock when it has no one to admonish but a girl whose work depends on her own sweet will its voice might seem thrown away yet one never knows the worth of an admonition besides the clock suited the place and the room where should time march with solemn step and slow if not on the quiet island of samson in the archipelago of scilly on its face was written the name of its maker plain for all the world to seepeter trevellick penzance ad the room was not ceiled but showed the dark joists and beams above once painted but a long time ago the walls were wainscotted and painted drab after an old fashion now gone out within the panels hung coloured prints which must have been there since the beginning of this century they represented rural subjectsthe farmer sitting before a sirloin of beef while his wife a cheerful nymph brought him brown george foaming with her best homebrewed the children hung about his knees expectant of morsels or the rustic bade farewell to his sweetheart the recruitingsergeant waiting for him and the villagers to a woman bathed in tears there were half a dozen of those compositions simply coloured i believe they are now worth much money but there were many other things in this room worth money opposite the fireplace stood a cabinet of carved oak black with age precious beyond price behind its glass windows one could see a collection of things once strange and rarethings which used to be brought home by sailors long before steamers ploughed every ocean and globetrotters trotted over every land there were wonderful things in coral white and red and pink venussfingers from the philippines fans from the seychelles stuffed birds of wondrous hue daggers and knives carven tomahawks ivory toys and many other wonders from the far east and fabulous cathay beside the cabinet was a wooden desk carved in mahogany with a date of said to have been brought to the islands by one of the royalist prisoners whom cromwell hanged upon the highest carn of hangmans island there was no escaping cromwellnot even in scilly any more than in jamaica in one corner was a cupboard the door standing open no collector ever came here to gaze upon the treasures unspeakable of cups and saucers plates and punchbowls on the mantelshelf were brass candlesticks and silver candlesticks side by side with ornaments of china pink and gold belonging to the artistic reign of good king george the fourth on the hearthrug before the fire which was always burning in this room all the year round lay an old dog sleeping everybody knows the feeling of a room or a house belonging to the old even if the windows are kept open the air is always close rest a gentle elderly angel sits in the least frequented room with folded wings sleep is always coming to the doors at all hours for the sake of rest and sleep the house must be kept very quiet nobody must ever laugh in the house there is none of the litter that children make nothing is out of its place nothing is disturbed the furniture is oldfashioned and formal the curtains are old and faded the carpets are old faded and worn it is always evening everything belonging to the house has done its work all together like the tenant are sitting stillsolemn hushed at rest waiting for the approaching end the only young thing at holy hill was the girl at the window everything else was oldthe servants the farm labourers the house and the furniture in the great hooded armchair beside the fire reposed the proprietor tenant or owner of all she was the oldest and most venerable dame ever seen at this time she was asleep her head had dropped forward a little but not much her eyes were closed her hands were folded in her lap she was now so very ancient that she never left her chair except for her bed also by reason of her great antiquity she now passed most of the day in sleep partly awake in the morning when she gazed about and asked questions of the day but sometimes as you will presently see she revived again in the evening became lively and talkative and suffered her memory to return to the ancient days by the assistance of her handmaidens this venerable lady was enabled to present an appearance both picturesque and pleasing chiefly because it carried the imagination back to a period so very remote to begin with she wore her bonnet all day long fifty years ago it was not uncommon in country places to find very old ladies who wore their bonnets all day long ursula rosevean however was the last who still preserved that ancient custom it was a large bonnet that she wore a kind of bonnet calculated to impress very deeply the imagination of onewhether male or femalewho saw it for the first time it was of bold design as capacious as a storeship as flowing in its lines as an old manofwarinspired to a certain extent by the fashions of the waterloo periodyet in great part of independent design those few who were permitted to gaze upon the bonnet beheld it reverently within the bonnet an adroit arrangement of cap and ribbons concealed whatever of baldness or exiguity as to locksbut what does one know venus calva has never been worshipped by men and women only pay their tribute at her shrine from fearnever from love the face of the sleeping lady reminded oneat first vaguelyof history presently one perceived that it was the identical face which that dread occidental star queen elizabeth herself would have assumed had she lived to the age of ninetyfive which was ursulas time of life in the year for it was an aquiline face thin and sharp and if her eyes had been open you would have remarked that they were bright and piercing also like those of the tudor queen her cheek still preserved something of the colour which had once made it beautiful but cheek and forehead alike were covered with lines innumerable and her withered hands seemed to have grown too small for their natural glove she was dressed in black silk and wore a gold chain about her neck the clock struck halfpast five melodiously then the girl started and sat uprightas awakened out of her dream armorel it seemed to saynay since it seemed to say it actually did saychild armorel i am old and wise for a hundred and fortythree years ever since i left the hands of the ingenious peter trevellick of penzance in the year i have been counting the moments never ceasing save at those periods when surgical operations have been necessary in each year there are moments judge therefore for yourself how many moments in all i have counted i must you will own be very wise indeed i am older even than your greatgreatgrandmother i remember her a baby first and then a pretty child and then a beautiful woman for all she is now so worn and wizened i remember her father and her grandfather also her brothers and her son and her grandsonand your own father dear armorel the moments pass they never cease i tell them as they go you have but short space to do all you wish to do you child have done nothing at all yet but the moments pass patience for you too work will be found youth passes you can hear it pass i tell the moments in which it melts away and vanishes age itself shall pass you may listen if you please i tell the moments in which it slowly passes armorel looked at the clock with serious eyes during the delivery of this fine sermon the whole bearing of which she did not perhaps comprehend then she started up suddenly and sprang to her feet stung by a sudden pang of restlessness with a quick breath and a sigh we who have passed the noon of life are apt to forget the disease of restlessness to which youth is prone it is an affection which greatly troubles that period of life though it should be the happiest and the most contented it is a disorder due to anticipation impatience and inexperience the voyage is all before youth is eager to be sailing on that unknown ocean full of strange islands who would not be restless with such a journey before one and such discoveries to make armorel opened the door noiselessly and slipped out at the same moment the old dog awoke and crept out with her going delicately and on tiptoe lest he should awaken the ancient lady in the hall outside the girl stood listening the house was quite silent save that from the kitchen there was wafted on the air a soft droninggentle melodious and murmurous like the contented booming of a bumblebee among the figwort armorel laughed gently oh she murmured they are all asleep grandmother is asleep in the parlour dorcas and chessun are asleep in the kitchen justinian is asleep in the cottage and i suppose the boy is asleep somewhere in the farmyard the girl led the way and the dog followed she passed through the door into the garden of the front it was not exactly a wellordered garden because everything seemed to grow as it pleased but then in samson you have not to coax flowers and plants into growing they grow because it pleases them to grow this is the reason why they grow so tall and so fast the garden faced the southwest and was protected from the north and east by the house itself and by a high stone wall there is not anywhere on the island a warmer and sunnier corner than this little front garden of holy hill the geranium clambered up the walls beside and among the branches of the treefuchsia both together covering the front of the house with the rich colouring of their flowers on either side of the door grew a great tree with gnarled trunk and twisted branches of lemon verbena fragrant and sweet perfuming the air the myrtles were like unto trees for size the very marguerites ran to timber of the smaller kind the pampasgrass in the warmest corner rose eight feet high waving its long silver plumes the tall stalk still stood which had borne the flowers of an aloe that very summer the leaves of the plant itself were slowly dying away their lifework which is nothing at all but the production of that one flowering stem finished that done the world has no more attractions for the aloe it is contentit slowly dies away and in the front of the garden was a row of tall dracaena palms an old ships figurehead thrown ashore after a wreck representing the head and bust of a beautiful maiden gilded but with a good deal of the gilt rubbed off stood on the left hand of the garden half hidden by another fuchsiatree in flower and a huge oldfashioned ships lantern hung from an iron bar projecting over the door of the house the house itself was of stone with a roof of small slates impossible to say how old it was because in this land stonework ages rapidly and soon becomes covered with yellow and orange lichen while in the interstices there grows the grey sandwort and in the soft sea air and the damp sea mists the sharp edges even of granite are quickly rounded off and crumbled but it was a very old house save for the square projecting window which had been added recentlysay thirty or forty years agoa long low house of two storeys simply built it stands halfway up the hill which slopes down to the waters edge it is protected from the north and northeast winds which are the deadliest enemies to scilly partly by the hill behind and partly by a spur of grey rock running like an ancient cyclopean wall down the whole face of the hill into the sea where for many a fathom it sticks out black teeth round which the white surge rises and tumbles even in the calmest time beyond the gardenwallwhy they wanted a gardenwall i know not except for the pride and dignity of the thingwas a narrow green with a little a very little pond in the pond there were ducks and beside the green was a small farmyard containing everything that a farmyard should contain except a stable it had no stable because there are no horses or carts upon the island pigs there are and cows fowls there are and ducks and geese and a single donkey for the purpose of carrying the flowerbaskets from the farm to the landingplace but neither horse nor cart beyond the farmyard was a cottage exactly like the house but smaller it was thatched and on the thatch grew clumps of samphire this was the abode of justinian tryeth bailiff head man or foreman who managed the farm when you have named ursula rosevean and armorel her greatgreatgranddaughter and justinian tryeth and dorcas his wifeshe was a native of st agnes and therefore a hicks by birthpeter his son and chessun his daughter you have a complete directory of the island because nobody else now lives on samson formerly however and almost within the memory of the oldest inhabitant according to the computation of antiquaries and the voice of tradition this island maintained a population of over two score the hill which rises behind the house is the southern hill of the two which with the broad valley between them make up the island of samson this hill slopes steeply seaward to south and west it is not a lofty hill by any means in scilly there are no lofty hills when nature addressed herself to the construction of this archipelago she brought to the task a light touch at the moment she happened to be full of feeling for the great and artistic effects which may be produced by small elevations especially in those places where the material is granite therefore though she raised no alpine peak in scilly she provided great abundance and any variety of bold coastline with rugged cliffs lofty carns and headlands piled with rocks and her success as an artist in this genre has been undoubtedly wonderful the actual measurement of holy hill samsonbut why should we measurehas been taken for the admiration of the world by the ordnance survey it is really no more than a hundred and thirtytwo feetnot a foot more or less but then one knows hills ten times that heightthe herefordshire beacon for examplewhich are not half so mountainous in the effect produced only a hundred and thirtytwo feetyet on its summit one feels the exhilaration of spirits caused by the air elsewhere of five thousand feet at least on its southern and western slopes lie the fields which form the flowerfarm of holy hill below the farmyard the ground sloped more steeply to the water the slope was covered with short heather fern now brown and yellow and long trailing branches of bramble now laden with ripe blackberries the leaves enriched with blazon of gold and purple and crimson armorel ran across the green and plunged among the fern tossing her arms and singing aloud the old dog trotting and jumping but with less elasticity beside her she was bareheaded the sunshine made her dark cheeks ruddy and caused her black eyes to glow hebe young and strong loves phoebus and fears not any freckles when she came to the waters edge where the boulders lie piled in a broken mass among and above the water she stood still and looked across the sea silent for a moment then she began to sing in a strong contralto but no one could hear her not even the coastguard on telegraph hill or he of the star fort the song she sang was one taught her by the old lady who had sung it herself in the old old days when the road was always filled with merchantmen waiting for convoy up the channel and when the islands were rich with the trade of the ships and their piloting and their wrecksto say nothing of the free trade which went on gallantly and without break or stop as she sang she lifted her arms and swung them in slow cadence as a nautchgirl sometimes swings her arms what she sang was none other than the old song early one morning just as the sun was rising i heard a maid sing in the valley below oh dont deceive me oh never leave me how could you use a poor maiden so in the year of grace armorel was fifteen years of age but she looked nineteen or twenty because she was so tall and so wellgrown she was dressed simply in a blue flannel the straw hat which she carried in her hand was trimmed with red ribbons at her throat she had stuck a red verbenashe naturally took to red because her complexion was so dark black hair black eyes a strongly marked brow a dark cheek of warm and ruddy hue the lips full but the mouth finely curved features large but regularshe was already though so young a tall and handsome woman those able to understand things would recognise in her dark complexion in her carriage in her eyes and in her upright figure the true castilian touch the gipsy is swarthy the negro is black the mulatto is dusky it is not the colour alone but the figure and the carriage also which mark the spanish blood a noble spanish lady yet how could she get to samson she wore no glovesyou cannot buy gloves in samsonand her hands were brown with exposure to sea and sun to wind and rain they were by no means tiny hands but strong and capable hands her armsno one ever saw them but for shape and whiteness they could not be matchedwould have disgraced no young fellow of her own age for strength and muscle that was fairly to be expected in one who continually sailed and rowed across the inland seas of this archipelago who went to church by boat and to market by boat who paid her visits by boat and transacted her business by boat and went by boat to do her shopping she who rows every day upon the salt water and knows how to manage a sail when the breeze is strong and the atlantic surge rolls over the rocks and roughens the still water of the road must needs be strong and sound for my own part i admire not the fragile maiden so much as her who rejoices in her strength youth in woman as well as in man should be brave and lusty clean of limb as well as of heart strong of arm as well as of will enduring hardness of voluntary labour as well as hardness of involuntary pain with feet that can walk run and climb and with hands that can hold on such a girl as armorelso tall so strong so healthyoffers methinks a home readymade for all the virtues and especially the virtues feminine to house themselves therein here they will remain growing stronger every day until at last they have become part and parcel of the very girl herself and cannot be parted from her whereas when they visit the puny creature weak timid delicatebut notis better to remain silent how many times had the girl wandered morning or afternoon down the rough face of the hill and stood looking vaguely out to sea and presently returned home again how many such walks had she taken and forgotten for a hundred timesyea a thousand timeswe do over and over again the old familiar action the little piece of the days routine and forget it when we lie down to sleep but there comes the thousandth time when the same thing is done again in the same way yet is never to be forgotten for on that day happens the thing which changes and charges a whole life it is the first of many days it is the beginning of new days from it whatever may have happened before everything shall now be dated until the end mohammed lived many years but all the things that happened unto him or his successors are dated from the flight is it for nothing that it has been told what things armorel did and how she looked on this day not so but for the sake of what happened afterwards and because the history of armorel begins with this restless fit which drove her out of the quiet room down the hillside to the sea her history begins like every history of a woman worth relating with the man cast by the sea upon the shores of her island the maiden always lives upon an island and whether the man is cast upon the shore by the sea of society or the sea of travel or the sea of accident or the sea of adventure or the sea of briny waves and roaring winds and jagged rocks matters little to armorel it was the last to you dear dorothy or violet it will doubtless be by the sea of society and the day that casts him before your feet will ever after begin a new period in your reckoning armorel stopped her song as suddenly as she had begun it she stopped because on the water below her not far from the shore she saw a strange thing she had good sea eyesan ordinary telescope does not afford a field of vision much larger or clearer across water than armorels eyesbut the thing was so strange that she shaded her forehead with her hand and looked more curiously it would be strange on any evening even after the calmest day of summer when the sun is setting low to see a small boat going out beyond samson towards the western islets there the swell of ocean is always rolling among the rocks and round the crags and headlands of the isles only in calm weather and in broad daylight can the boatman who knows the place venture in those waters not even the most skilled boatman would steer for the outer islands at sunset for there are hidden rocks long ridges of teeth that run out from the islands to tear and grind to powder any boat that should be caught in their devouring jaws there are currents also which run swiftly and unexpectedly between the islands to sweep the boat along with them till it shall strike the rocks and so go down with any who are abroad and there are strong gusts which sweep round the headlands and blow through the narrow sounds so that it is only when the day is calm and in the full light of the sun that a boat can sail among these islands yet armorel saw a boat on the water not half a mile from samson with two men on board more than this the boat was apparently without oars or sails and it was drifting out to sea what did this mean she looked and wondered she looked again and she remembered the tide was ebbing the boat was floating out with the tide the breeze had dropped but there was still something leftwhat there was came from the southeast and helped the boat along there was not much sea but the feet of great minalto were white and the white foam kept leaping up the sides and on her right over the ledges round white island the water was tearing and boiling a white and angry heap why the wind was getting up and the sun was setting and if they did not begin to row back as hard as they could and that soon they would be out to sea and in the dark she looked again and she thought more the sinking sun fell upon the boat and lit it up so plainly that she could now see very well two things first that the boat was really without any oars or sails at all and next that the two men in her were not natives of scilly she could not discern their faces but she could tell by their appearance and the way they sat in the boat that they were not men of the place besides what would an islander want out in a boat at such a time and in such a place they were therefore visitors and by the quiet way in which they sat as if it mattered not at all it was perfectly plain that they understood little or nothing of their danger again she considered and now it became certain to her looking down upon the boat that the current was not taking her out to sea at all which would be dangerous enough but actually straight on the ridge or ledge of rocks lying off the southwest of white island then seized with sudden terror she turned and fled back to the farm chapter ii presented by the sea peter cried armorel in the farmyard peter peter wake up where is the boy wake up and come quick the boy was not sleeping however and came forth slowly but obediently in rustic fashion he was a little older than most of those who still permit themselves to be called boys unless his looks deceived one he was a great deal older for he was entirely bald save for a few long scattered hairs which were white his beard and whiskers also consisted of nothing but a few sparse white hairs he moved heavily without the spring of boyhood in his feet had peter jumped or run one might in haste have inferred a condition of drink or mental disorder as for his shoulders too they were rounded as if by the weight of yearsa thing which is rarely seen in boys yet armorel called this antique person the boy and he answered to the name without remonstrance quick peter she cried theres a boat drifting on white island ledge and the tides running out strong and there are two men in her and theyve got no oars in the boat ignorant trippers i suppose they will both be killed to a certainty unless quick peter followed her flying footsteps with a show of haste and a movement of the legs approaching alacrity but then he was always a slow boy and one who loved to have his work done for him therefore when he reached the landingplace he found that armorel was well before him and that she had already shipped mast and sail and oars and was waiting for him to shove off samson has two landing beaches one on the northeast below bryher hill and the other farther south on the eastern side of the valley there might be a third better than either on porth bay if anyone desired to put off there on the west side facing the other islands where nobody has any business at all except to see the rocks or shoot wild birds the beach used by the holy hill folk was the second of these two here they kept their boats and had their old stone boathouse to store the gear and it was here that armorel stood waiting for her companion peter was slow on land at sea however he alone is slow who does not know what can be got out of a boat and how it can be got peter did possess this knowledge all the islanders in fact have it they are born with it they also know that nothing at sea is gained by hurry it is a maxim which is said to rule or govern their conduct on land as well as afloat peter therefore when he had pushed off sat down and took an oar with no more appearance of hurry than if he were taking a boatload of boxes filled with flowers across to the port armorel took the other oar they are drifting on white island ledge repeated armorel and the tide is running out fast peter made no replyarmorel expected nonebut dipped his oar they rowed in silence for ten minutes then peter found utterance and spoke slowly twenty years agoi remember it wella boat went ashore on that very ledge the tide was running outstrong like tonight there was three men in hervisitors they were who wanted to save the boatmans pay their bodies was never found then both pulled on in silence and doggedly in ten minutes or more they had rounded the point at a respectful distance for reasons well known to the navigator and the nautical surveyor of scilly peter without a word shipped his oar armorel did likewise then peter stepped the mast and hoisted the sail keeping the line in his own hand and looked ahead while armorel took the helm its jinkinss boat said peter because they were now in sight of her whatll jinkins say when he hears that his boats gone to pieces and the two men who are they will jinkins say nothing about the men strangers they are gentlemen i suppose well if the breeze doesnt soon ah here it is the wind suddenly filled the sail the boat heeled over under the breeze and a moment after was flying through the water straight up the broad channel between the two minaltos and samson the sun was very low now between them and the west lay the boat they were pursuinga small black object with two black silhouettes of figures clear against the crimson sky and now armorel perceived that they had by this time gotten an inkling at least of their danger for they no longer sat passive but had torn up a plank from the bottom with which one kneeling in the bows was working as with a paddle but without science the boat yawed this way and that but still kept on her course drifting to the rocks if she touches the ledge peter said armorel she will be in little bits in five minutes the water is rushing over it like a millstream this she said ignorant of millstreams because there are none on scilly but the comparison served if she touches peter replied we may just go home again for we shall be no good to nobody beyond the boat they could plainly see the waters breaking over the ledge the sun lit up the white foam that leaped and flew over the black rocks just showing their teeth above the water as the tide went down here is a problemyou may find plenty like it in every book of algebra given a boat drifting upon a ledge of rocks with the current and the tide given a boat sailing in pursuit with a fair wind aft given also the velocity of the current and the speed of the boat and the distance of the first boat from the rocks at what distance must the second boat commence the race in order to catch up the first before it drives upon the rocks this second boat paying close attention to the problem came up hand over hand rapidly overtaking the first boat where the two men not only understood at last the danger they were in but also that an attempt was being made to save them in fact one of them who had some tincture or flavour of the mathematics left in him from his school days remembered the problems of this class and would have given a great deal to have been back again in school working out one of them presently the boats were so near that peter hailed boat ahoy back her back her or youll be upon the rocks back her all you know weve broken our oars they shouted keep her off peter bawled again even with a plank taken from the bottom of the boat a practised boatman would have been able to keep her off long enough to clear the rocks but these two young men were not used to the ways of the sea put up your hellum said peter quietly what are you going to do the girl obeyed first as one must do at sea and asked the question afterwards theres only one chance we must cut across her bows two lubbers they ought not to be trusted with a boat theres plenty of room he looked at the ledge ahead and at his own sail nowsteady he tightened the rope the boat changed her course then peter stood up and called again his hand to his mouth back her back her back her all you know he sat down and said quietly now thenluff it isluffall you can the boat turned suddenly it was high time right in front of themonly a few yards in frontthe water rushed as if over a cascade boiling and surging among the rocks at high tide there would have been the calm unruffled surface of the ocean swell now there were roaring floods and swelling whirlpools the girl looked round but only for an instant then the boat crossed the bows of the other and armorel as they passed caught the rope that was held out to her one moment more and they were off the rocks in deep water towing the other boat after them then peter arose lowered the sail and took down his mast nothing he said between us and mincarlo now gentlemen if you will step into this boat we can tow yours along with us sotake care sir sit in the stern beside the young lady can you row either of you they could both row they said in these days a man is as much ashamed of not being able to row as fifty years ago he was ashamed of not being able to ride peter took one oar and gave the other to the stranger nearest then without more words he dipped his oar and began to row back again the sun went down and it suddenly became cold armorel perceived that the man beside her was quite a young mannot more than one or twoandtwenty he wore brave attireeven a brown velvet jacket a white waistcoat and a crimson necktie he also had a soft felt hat nature had not yet given him much beard but what there was of it he wore pointed with a light moustache so arranged as to show how it would be worn when it became of a respectable length as he sat in the boat he seemed tall and he did not look at all like one of the bawling and boastful trippers who sometimes come over to the islands for a night and pretend to know how to manage a boat yet what do you mean asked the girl severely by going out in a boat when you ought to have known very well that you could not manage her we thought we could replied this disconcerted pretender with meekness suitable to the occasion indeed under such humiliating circumstances captain parolles himself would become meek if we had not seen you she continued you would most certainly have been killed i begin to think we might we should certainly have gone on those rocks but there is an island close by we could swim if your boat had touched those rocks you would have been dead in three minutes this maid of wisdom continued nothing could have saved you no boat could have come near you and to think of standing or swimming in that current and among those rocks oh but you dont know scilly no he replied still with a meekness that disarmed wrath im afraid not tell me how it happened the other man struck inhe who was wielding the oar he also was a young man of shorter and more sturdy build than the other had he not unfortunately confined his whole attention in youth to football he might have made a good boatman really a young man whose appearance conveyed no information or suggestion at all about him except that he seemed healthy active and vigorous and that he was presumably shortsighted or he would not have worn spectacles i will tell you how it came about he said this man would go sketching the coast i told him that the islands are so beautifully and benevolently built that every good bit has got another bit on the next island or across a cove or on the other side of a bay put there on purpose for the finest view of the first bit you only get that arrangement you know in the isles of scilly and the isles of greece but he wouldnt be persuaded and so we took a boat and went to sea like the three merchants of bristol city we saw jerusalem and madagascar very well and if you hadnt turned up in the nick of time i believe we should have seen the river styx as well with cocytus very likely good old charon certainly and tantalus too much punishedoverdoneup to his neck armorel heard wondering what in the name of goodness this talker of strange language might mean when his oar broke you know the talker went on i began to laugh and so i caught a crab and while i lay in the bottom laughing like tom of bedlam my oar dropped overboard and there we were five mortal hours we drifted but we had tobacco and a flask and we didnt mind so very much some boat we thought might pick us up some boat echoed armorel and outside samson as for the rocks we never thought about them had we known of the rocks we should not have laughed you have saved our lives said the young man in the velvet jacket he had a soft sweet voice which trembled a little as he spoke and indeed it is a solemn thing to be rescued from certain death peter did it armorel replied you may thank peter let me thank you he said softly and persuasively the other man may thank peter just as you like so long that is as you remember that it will have to be a lesson to you as long as you live never to go out in a boat without a man it shall be a lesson i promise and the man i go out with next time shall not be you dick never she went on enforcing the lesson never go in a boat alone unless you know the waters are you plymouth trippers but then plymouth people generally know how to handle a boat we are from london in the twilight the blush caused by being taken for a plymouth tripper was not perceived i am an artist and i came to sketch he said this with some slight emphasis and distinction there must be no mistaking an artist from london for a plymouth tripper you must be hungry we are ravenous but at this moment one can only feel that it is better to be hungry and alive than to be drowned and dead oh she said earnestly you dont know how strong the water is it would have thrown you down and rolled you over and over among the rocks your head would have been knocked to pieces your face would have been crushed out of shape every bone would have been broken peter has seen them so ay ay said peter ive picked em up just so you are well off those rocks gentlemen silence fell upon them the twilight was deepening the breeze was chill armorel felt that the young man beside her was shiveringperhaps with the cold he looked across the dark water and gasped we are coming up he said out of the gates of death and the jaws of hell strange to have been so near unto dying five minutes more and there would have been an end and two more men would have been created for no other purpose but to be drowned armorel made no reply the oars kept dipping dipping evenly and steadily across the waters on either hand flashed lights st agnes and the bishop from the souththey are white lights and from the north the crimson splendour of round island the wind was dropping and there was a little phosphorescence on the water which gleamed along the blade of the oar in half an hour the boat rounded the new pier and they were in the harbour of hugh town at the foot of the landing steps now said armorel you had better get home as fast as you can and have some supper why cried the artist realising the fact for the first time you are bareheaded you will kill yourself i am used to going about bareheaded i shall come to no harm now go and get some food and you the young man stood on the steppingstones ready to mount we shall put up the sail and get back to samson in twenty minutes there is breeze enough for that will you tell us said the artist before you goto whom we are indebted for our very lives my name is armorel may we call upon you tonight we are too bewildered we cannot say what we ought and must say i live on samson what is your name my name is roland lee my friend here is called dick stephenson you can come if you wish i shall be glad to see you she corrected herself thinking she had been inhospitable and ungracious am i to ask for miss armorel she laughed merrily you will find no one to ask i am afraid nobody else you see lives on samson when you land just turn to the left walk over the hill and you will find the house on the other side samson is not so big that you can miss the house goodnight roland lee goodnight dick stephenson shes only a child said the young man called dick as he climbed painfully and fearfully up the dark and narrow steps slippery with seaweed and not even protected by an inner bar i suppose it doesnt much matter since shes only a child but i merely desire to point out that its always the way if there does happen to be an adventure accompanied by a girlmost adventures bring along the girl nobody cares in fact for an adventure without a girl in itim put in the background and made to do the work while you sit down and talk to the girl dont tell me it was accidental it was the accident of design hang it all ill turn painter myself chapter iii in the bar parlour at nine oclock the little bar parlour of tregarthens was nearly full it is a very little room low as well as little therefore it is easily filled and though it is the principal clubroom of hugh town where the better sort and the notables meet it can easily accommodate them all they do not however meet every evening and they do not all come at once there is a wooden settle along the wall beautifully polished by constant use which holds four a smaller one beside the fire where at a pinch two might sit there is a seat in the window which also might hold two but is only comfortable for one a small round table only leaves room for one chair this makes sitting accommodation for nine and when all are present and all nine are smoking tobacco like one the atmosphere is convivially pungent this evening there were only seven they consisted of the two young men whose perils on the deep you have just witnessed a justice of the peacebut his office is a sinecure because on the scilly isles virtue reigns in every heart a flowerfarmer of the highest standing two other gentlemen weighed down with the mercantile anxieties and interests of the placethey ought to have been in wigs and square brown coats with silver buckles to their shoes and one who held office and exercised authority the art of conversation cannot be successfully cultivated on a small island on board ship or in a small country town conversation requires a continual change of company and a great variety of topics your great talker when he inconsiderately remains too long among the same set becomes a bore after a little unless he goes away or dies or becomes silent they kill him or lock him up in an asylum at tregarthens he would be made to understand that either he or the rest of the population must leave the archipelago and go elsewhere in some colonial circles they play whist which is an excellent method perhaps the best ever invented for disguising the poverty or the absence of conversation at tregarthens they do not feel this necessitythey are contented with their conversation they are so happily contented that they do not repine even though they get no more than an observation dropped every ten minutes or so they are not anxious to reply hurriedly they are even contented to sit silently enjoying the proximity of each otherthe thing in fact which lies at the root of all society the evening is not felt to be dull though there are no fireworks of wit and repartee indeed if douglas jerrold himself were to appear with a bag full of the most sparkling epigrams and repartees nobody would laugh even when he was kicked out into the cold and unappreciative nightthe stars have no sense of humouras a punishment for impudence this evening the notables spoke occasionally they spoke slowlythe scillonians all talk slowlythey neither attempted nor looked for smartness they did not tell stories because all the stories are known and they can now only be told to strangers the two young men from london listened without taking any part in the talk people who have just escapedand that narrowlya sharp and painful death by drowning and banging on jagged rocks are expected to be hushed for awhile but they listened and they became aware that the talk in whatever direction it wandered always came back to the sea everything in scilly belongs to the sea they may go up country which is a journey of a mile and a half or even two milesand speak for a moment of the crops and the farms but that leads to the question of import and export and therefore to the vessels lying within the pier and to the steam service to penzance and to vessels in other ports and generally to steam service about the world and again wherever two or three are gathered together in scilly one at least will be found to have ploughed the seas in distant parts this confers a superiority on the society of the islands which cannot even in these days be denied or concealed in the last century when a man who was known to have crossed the pacific entered a coffeehouse the company with one accord gazed upon him with envy and wonder even now familiarity hath not quite bred contempt we still look with unconcealed respect upon one who can tell of tahiti and the new hebrides and has stood upon the mysterious shores of papua and at tregarthens this evening these two strangers were young they had not yet made the circuit of the round earth they had had as yet not many opportunities of talking with travellers and sailors therefore they listened and were silent presently one after the other the company got up and went out there is no sitting late at night in scilly there were left of all only the permanent official i hear gentlemen he said that you have had rather a nasty time this evening we should have been lost said the artist but for ayoung lady who saw our danger and came out to us armorel i saw her towing in your boat and landing you yes it was a mighty lucky job that she saw you in time theres a girl not yet sixteen years old yet id rather trust myself with her in a boat especially if she had the boy peter with her than any boatman of the islands and theres not a rock or an islet not a bay or a headland in this country of bays and capes and rocks that she does not know she could find her way blindfold by the feel of the wind and the force of the current but its in her blood father to sonfather to son and daughter toothe roseveans are born boatmen she saved our lives repeated the artist that is all we know of her it is a good deal to know perhaps from our own point of view she belongs to samson theyve always lived on samson once there were roseveans tryeths jenkinses and woodcocks on samson now they are nearly all goneonly one family of rosevean left and one of tryeth she said that nobody else lived there well it is only her own family theyve started a flowerfarm lately on holy hill and i hear its doing pretty well its a likely situation too facing southwest and well sheltered you should go and see the flowerfarm armorel will be glad to show you the farm and the island too samson has got a good many curious thingsmore curious perhaps than she knows poor child he paused for a moment and then continued theres nobody on the island now but themselves theres the old woman firstyou should see her too shes a curiosity by herselfursula roseveanshe was a traverse and came from bryher to be married she married methusalem rosevean armorels greatgreatgrandfatherthat was nigh upon eighty years ago shes close upon a hundred now and shes been a widow sincewhen was iti believe shed only been a wife for twelve months or so he was drowned on a smuggling runhis brother emanuel too widow used to look for him from the hilltop every night for a year and more afterwards a wonderful old woman go and look at her perhaps she will talk to you sometimes when armorel plays the fiddle she will brighten up and talk for an hour she knows how to cure all diseases and she can foretell the future but shes too old now and mostly shes asleep then theres justinian tryeth and dorcas his wifetheyre over seventy both of them if theyre a day dorcas was a st agnes girlthats the reason why her name was hicks if shed come from bryher shed have been a traverse if from tresco shed have been a jenkins but she was a hicks shes as old as her husband i should say as for the boy peter she called him the boy i remember but he seemed to me hes fifty but hes always been the boy he never married because there was nobody left on samson for him to marry and hes always been too busy on the farm to come over here after a wife and he looks more than fifty because once he fell off the pier head first into the stern of a boat and after hed been unconscious for three days all his hair fell off except a few stragglers and theyd turned white looks most as old as his father chessuns near fiftytwo who is chessun shes the girl shes always been the girl shes never married just like peter her brother because there was no one left on samson for her and she never leaves the island except once or twice a year when she goes to the afternoon service at bryher well gentlemen thats all the people left on samson there used to be morea great many morequite a population and if all stories are true they were a lively lot youll see their cottages standing in ruins as for getting drowned youd hardly believe why take armorel alone her father emanuelhed be about fiftyseven nowhe was drownedtwelve years ago it must be nowwith his wife and his three boys emanuel john and andrew crossing over from a wedding at st agnes he married rovena wetherel from st marys then there was her grandfather he was a pilotbut they were all pilotsand he was cast away taking an east indiaman up the channel cast away on chesil bank in a fogthat was in the year and all hands lost his fatherno no that was his uncleall in the line were drowned that ones uncle died in his bed unexpectedlyyou can see the bed stillbut they do say just before some officers came over about a little bit of business connected with french brandy one of the roseveans went away and became a purser in the royal navy those were the days for pursers their accounts were never audited and when theyd squared the captain and paid him the wages and allowances for the dummies and the dead men they had left as muchay as a couple of thousand a year after this he left the navy and purveyed for the fleet and became so rich that they had to make him a knight was there much smuggling here in the old days look here sir a scillonian in the old days called himself a pilot a fisherman a shopkeeper or a farmer just as he pleased that was his pleasant way but he was alwaysmind youa smuggler armorels greatgreatgreatgrandfather father of the old ladys husbandhim who was never heard of afterwards but was supposed to have been cast away off the french coasthe was known to have made great sums of money never was anyone on the islands in such a big way lots of money came to the islands from smuggling they say that the st martins people have kept theirs and have got it invested but for all the rest its gone and they were wreckers too many and many a good ship before the islands were lit up have struck on the rocks and gone to pieces what do you think became of the cargoes where were the scilly boats when the craft was breaking up and did you never hear of the ships lantern tied to the horns of a cow theyve got one on samson could tell a tale or two and theyve still got a figurehead there which ought to have haunted old emanuel rosevean when his boat capsized off the coast of france an interesting family history yes until the preventive service put an end to the trade the roseveans were the most successful and the most daring smugglers in the islands but an unlucky family all these drownings make people talk old wives talk i dare say but for something one of them didwrecking a ship robbing the dead who knowsthey say the bad luck will go on till something is donei know not what he got up and put on his cap the bluecloth cap with a cloth peak much affected in scilly because the wind blows off any other form of hat ever invented it is ten oclocki must go did you ever hear the story gentlemen of the scillonian sailor he sat down again i believe it must have been one of the roseveans he was on board a west indiaman homeward bound and the skipper got into a fog and lost his reckoning then he asked this man if he knew the scilly isles better nor any book says the sailor then says the skipper take the wheel in an hour crash went the ship upon the rocks damn your eyes says the skipper you said you knew the scilly isles so i do says the man this is one of em the ship went to pieces and near all the hands were lost but the people of the islands had a fine time with the flotsam and the jetsam for a good many days afterwards i believe said the young manhe who answered to the name of dickthat this patriot is buried in the old churchyard i saw an inscription today which probably marks his tomb under the name is written the words dulce et decorbut the rest is obliterated very likelythey would bury him in the old churchyard goodnight gentlemen roland the young man called dick jumped from the settle roland pinch meshake mestick a knife into mebut not too fari feel as if i was going off my head the fair armorels father was a corsair who was drowned on his way from the coast of france with his grandfather and his greatgrandfather and greatgranduncles after having been cast away upon the chesil bank and never heard of again though he was wanted on account of a keg of french brandy picked up in the channel he made an immense pile of money which has been lost and theres an old lady at the farm so oldso oldso very very oldit takes your breath away only to think of itthat she married methusalem her husband was drowneda new light this on historyand of course she escaped on the arkas a stowaway or a cabin passenger armorel plays the fiddle and makes the old lady jump well go over there tomorrow we will it is a land of enchantment this outlying bit of lyonesse meanwhile just to clear my brain i think i must have a whisky the weakness of humanity demands it oh twas in tregarthens bar where the pipes and whiskies are they are an unlucky family he went on because they did something remark roland that here is the very element of romance my ancestors have done something too i am sure they have because my grandfather kept a shop and you cant keep a shop without doing something but fate never persecuted my father the dean and i am not in much anxiety that i too shall be shadowed on account of the old man yet look at armorel rosevean theres distinction mind you in being selected by fate for vicarious punishment the old corsair wrecked a ship and robbed the bodies therefore all his descendants have got to be drowned dear me if we were all to be drowned because our people had once done something the hungry insatiate sea would be choked and the world would come to an end a scotch whisky rebecca if you please and a seltzer tomorrow roland we will once more cross the raging main but under protection if you break an oar again you shall be put overboard we will visit this fair child of samson child of samson the child of samson was delilah her mother or is she the grand daughter of the timnite has she inherited the virtues of her father as well as his strength were the latter days of delilah sanctified and purified happily she is only as yet a childonly a child rolandhe emphasised the wordsalthough a child of samson in the night a vision came to roland lee he saw armorel once more sailing to his rescue and in his vision he was seized with a mighty terror and a shaking of the limbs and his heart sank and his cheek blanched and he cried aloud as he sank beneath the cold waters oh armorel you have come too late armorel you cannot save me now chapter iv the golden torque the morning was bright the sky blue the breeze freshso fresh that even in the road the sea broke over the bows and the boat ran almost gunwale under this time the two landsmen were not unprotected they were in charge of two boatmen humiliating perhaps but your true courage consisteth not in vain boasting and arrogant pretence and he is safest who doth not ignorantly presume to manage a boat therefore boatmen twain now guided the light bark and held the ropes dick said roland presently looking ahead i see her there she isupon the hillside among the brown fern i can see her with her blue dress dick looked and shook his shortsighted head i only see samson he said he groweth bigger as we approach that is not uncommon with islands i perceive that he hath two hills one on the north and the other on the south he showethperhaps with pridea narrow plain in the middle the hills appear to be strewn with boulders and there are carns and perhaps logan stones there is always a logan stone but you can never find it there are also i perceive ruins samson looks quite a large island when you come near to it life on samson must be curiously peaceful no postoffice no telegrams no telephones no tennis no shops no papers no peoplegood heavens for a whole month one would enjoy samson dont you see her repeated roland she is coming down the hillside i dare say i do see her if i knew it but i cannot at this distance even with assisted eyes oh a blue dressblueagainst the brown and yellow of the fern can you not dick gazed with the slow uncertain eyes of short sight and adjusted his glasses my pal he said to please you i would pretend to see anything in fact i always do it saves trouble i see her plainlyblue dress you saycertainlysitting on a rock nonsense she is walking down the hill you dont see her at all quite so coming down the hill dick replied unmoved she has been in my mind all night i have been thinking all kinds of thingsimpossible thingsabout this nymph she is not in the least common to begin with she is she is only a child roland dont a child why shouldnt she be a child i suppose i may admire a beautiful child do you insinuate that i am going to make love to her well old man you mostly do it was not so dark last night but one could see that she is a very beautiful girl she looks eighteen but our friend last night assured us that she is not yet sixteen a very beautiful girl she is features regular and a head that ought to be modelled she is dark like a spaniard gipsy probably name of stanley or smithpharaoh stanley was most likely her papa gipsy yourself who ever heard of a gipsy on scilly you might as well look for an organgrinder spanish blood i swear castilian of the deepest blue then her eyes you didnt observe her eyes i was too hungry besides as usual i was doing all the work they are black eyes the romany have black eyesroving eyeshard bold bad black eyes soft blacknot hard black the dark velvet eyes which hold the light dick i should like to paint those eyes she is now looking at our boat i can see her lifting her hand to shade her eyes i should like to paint those eyes just at the moment when she gives away her heart you cannot childe roland because there could only be one other person present on that interesting occasion and that person must not be you dick too often you are little better than an ass if you painted those eyes when she was giving away her heart it might lead to another and a later picture when she was giving away her temper eyes which hold the light also hold the fire you might be killed with lightning or at least blinded with excess of light take care better be blinded with excess of light than pass by insensible some men are worse than the fellow with the muckrake he was only insensible to a golden crown they are insensible to venus without loveliness where is love without love what is life yet said dick drily most of us have got to shape our lives for ourselves before we can afford to think of venus it will be understood that these two young men represented two large classes of humanity one would not go so far as to say that mankind may be divided into those two classes only but undoubtedly they are always with us first the young man who walketh humbly doing his appointed task with honesty and taking with gratitude any good thing that is bestowed upon him by fate next the young man who believes that the whole round world and all that therein is are created for his own special pleasure and enjoyment that for him the lovely girls attire themselves and for his pleasure go forth to dance and ball for him the actress plays her best for him the feasts are spread the corks are popped the fruits are ripened the suns shine to the former class belonged dick stephenson to the latter roland lee indeed the artistic temperament not uncommonly enlists a young man in the latter class look cried the artist she sees us she is coming down the hill even you can see her now oh the light elastic step nothing in the world more beautiful than the light elastic step of a girl somehow i dont remember it in pictures perhapssome dayi may he began to talk in unconnected jerks as for the greek maiden by the seashore playing at ball and showing bony shoulders and all thati dont like it only very young girls should play at ball and jump aboutnot women grown and formed they may walk or spring as much as they like but they must not jump and they must not run they must not laugh loud violent emotions are masculine figure and dress alike make violence ungraceful that is why i dont like to see women jump about if they knew how it uglifies most of them armorel is only a childyesbut how graceful how complete she is in her movements she was now visible even to a shortsighted man tripping lightly through the fern on the slope of the hill as she ran she tossed her arms to balance herself from boulder to boulder she was singing too but those in the boat could not hear her and before the keel touched the sand she was silent she stood waiting for them on the beach her old dog jack beside her a smile of welcome in her eyes and the sunlight on her cheeks hebe herselfwho remained always fifteen from prehistoric times until the melancholy catastrophe of the fourth century when with the other olympians she was snuffed outwas not sweeter more dainty or stronger or more vigorous of aspect i thought you would come across this morning she said i went to the top of the hill and looked out and presently i saw your boat you have not ventured out alone again i see goodmorning roland lee goodmorning dick stephenson she called them thus by their christian names not with familiarity but quite naturally and because when she went into the worldthat is to say to bryher churchon sunday afternoon each called unto each by his christian name and to each she gave her hand with a smile of welcome but it seemed to dick who was observant rather than jealous that his companion appropriated to himself and absorbed both smiles shall i show you samson have you seen the islands yet no they had only arrived two days before and were going back the next day many do that said the girl they stay here a day or two they go across to tresco and see the gardens then perhaps they walk over sallakey down and they see peninnis and porthellick and the old church and they think they have seen the islands you will know nothing whatever about scilly if you go tomorrow why should we go tomorrow asked the artist tell me that dick i because my time is up and somerset house once more expects me you my friend dick replied with meaning because you have got your work to do and you must not fool around any longer roland lee laughed we came first of all he said turning to armorel in order to thank you for oh you thanked me last night besides it was peter no no i refuse to believe in peter well do not let us say any more about it come with me the landingplace of samson is a flat beach covered with a fine white sand and strewn with little shellsyellow and grey green and blue behind the beach is a low bank on which grow the seaholly the sealavender the horned poppy and the spurge and behind the bank stretches a small plain low and sandy raised above the high tide by no more than a foot or two armorel led the way across this plain to the foot of the northern hill it is a rough and rugged hill wild and uncultivated the slope facing the south is covered with gorse and fern the latter brown and yellow in september among the fern at this season stood the tall dead stalks of foxglove here and there were patches of short turf set about with the withered flowers of the seapink and the long branches of the bramble lay trailing over the ground the hand of some prehistoric giant has sprinkled the slopes of this hill with boulders of granite they are piled above each other so as to make carns headlands and capes with strange resemblances and odd surprises upon the top they found a small plateau sloping gently to the north see said armorel this is the finest thing we have to show on samson or on any of the islands this is the burialplace of the kings here are their tombs what kings asked dick looking about him where are the tombs the kings roland repeated there can be no other kings these are their tombs do not interrupt the ancient kings armorel replied with historic precision these mounds are their tombs seeonetwohalf a dozen of them are here only kings had barrows raised over them did you expect graves and headstones dick stephenson oh these are barrows are they he replied in some confusion a man of the world does not expect to be caught in ignorance by the solitary inhabitant of a desert island a long time ago armorel went on these islands formed part of the mainland bryher and tresco st helens tean st martins and st marys were all joined together and the road was only a creek of the sea then the sea washed away all the land between scilly and the lands end they used to call the place lyonesse the kings of lyonesse were buried on samson their kingdom is gone but their graves remain it is said that their ghosts have been seen dorcas saw them once i should like to see them very much said roland if you were here at night we could go out and look for them i have been here often after dark looking for them what did you see she answered like unto the bold sir bediverewho perhaps was standing on that occasion not far from this hilltop i saw the moonlight on the rocks and i heard the beating of the waves quoth dick the spook of a king of lyonesse would be indeed worth coming out to see armorel led the way to a barrow the top of which showed signs of the spade see she said here is one that has been opened it was a long time ago there were the four slabs of stone still in position which formed the sides of the grave and the slab which had been its cover lying close beside armorel looked into the grave they found she whispered the bones of the king lying on the stone but when someone touched them they turned to dust there is the dust at your feet in the grave the wind cannot bear it away it may blow the sand and earth into it but the dust remains the rain can turn it into mud but it cannot melt it this is the dust of a king the young men stood beside her silent awed a little partly by the serious look in the girls face and partly because though it now lay open to the wind and rain it was really a grave one must not laugh beside the grave of a man the wind lifted armorels long locks and blew them off her white forehead her eyes were sad and even solemn even the shortsighted dick saw that his friend was right they were soft black eyes not of the gipsy kind and he repented him of a hasty inference to the artist it seemed as if here was a princess of lyonesse mourning over the grave of her buried king andwhatfatherbrothercousinlover everything in his imagination vanishedexcept that one figure even her clothes were changed for the raimentsay the court mourningof that vanished realm and also like sir bedivere he heard nothing but the wild water lapping on the crag and here followed a thing so strange that the historian hesitates about putting it down let us remember that it is thirty years or thereabouts since this barrow was laid open that we may suppose those who opened it to have had eyes in their heads that it has been lying open ever since and that every visitorto be sure there are not manywho lands on samson is bound to climb this hill and visit this open barrow with its perfect kistvaen these things borne in mind it will seem indeed wonderful that anything in the grave should have escaped discovery roland lee leaning over began idly to poke about the mould and dust of the grave with his stick he was thinking of the girl and of the romance with which his imagination had already clothed this lonely spot he was also thinking of a picture which might be made of her he was wondering what excuse he could make for staying another week at tregarthenswhen he was startled by striking his stick against metal he knelt down and felt about with his hands then he found something and drew it out and arose with the triumph that belongs to an archaeologist who picks up an ancient thingsay a rose noble in a newly ploughed field the thing which he found was a hoop or ring it was covered and encrusted with mould he rubbed this off with his fingers lo it was of gold a hoop of gold as thick as a ladys little finger twisted spirally bent into the form of a circle the two ends not joined but turned back pure gold yellow soft gold i believe he said gasping that this must beit isa torque i think i have seen something like it in museums and ive read of them it was your kings necklace it was buried with him it lay around the skeleton neck all these thousand years take it miss armorel it is yours no no let me look at it let me have it in my hands it is yoursin ignorance of ancient law and the rights of the lord proprietorit is yours because you found it then i will give it to you because you are the princess of the island she took it with a blush and placed it round her own neck bending open the ends and closing them again it lay therethe red red goldas if it belonged to her and had been made for her the buried king is your ancestor said roland it is his legacy to his descendant wear the kings necklace my luck as usual grumbled dick aside why couldnt i find a torque and say pretty things come said armorel we have seen the barrows there are others scattered aboutbut this is the best place for them now i will show you the island the hill slopes gently northward till it reaches a headland or carn of granite boldly projecting here it breaks away sharply to the sea armorel climbed lightly up the carn and stood upon the highest boulder a pretty figure against the sky the young men followed and stood below her illustration armorel climbed lightly up the carn at their feet the waves broke in white foam in the calmest weather the atlantic surge rolling over the rocks is broken into foam a broad sound or channel lay between samson and the adjacent island in the channel half a dozen rocks and islets showed black and threatening the island across the channel said armorel is bryher this is bryher hill because it faces bryher island yonder on bryher is samson hill because it faces samson island bryher is a large place there are houses and farms on bryher and a church where they have service every sunday afternoon if you were here on sunday you could go in our boat with peter chessun and me justinian and dorcas mostly stay at home now because they are old can anybody stay on the island then asked roland quickly once the doctor came for justinians rheumatism and bad weather began and he had to stay a week his other patients meanly took advantage and got well i suppose said dick i hope so armorel replied simply she turned and looked to the northeast where lie the eastern islands the group between st martins and st marys a miniature in little of the greater group from this point they looked to the eye of ignorance like one island armorel distinguished them there were great and little arthur ganilly with his two hills like samson the ganninicks and meneweather ragged island and inisvouls they are not inhabited said the girl pointing to them one by one but it is pleasant to row about among them in fine weather in the old time when they made kelp people would go and live there for weeks together but they are not cultivated then she turned northwards and showed them the long island of st martins with its white houses its church its gentle hills and its white and red daymark on the highest point half of st martins was hidden by tresco and more than half of tresco by bryher over the downs of tresco rose the dome of round island crowned with its white lighthouse and over bryher out at sea showed the rent and jagged crest of the great rock menovawr you should land on tresco said armorel there is the church to see oh it is a most beautiful church they say that in cornwall itself there is hardly any church so fine as tresco church and then there are the gardens and the lake everybody goes to see the gardens but they do not walk over the down to cromwells castle yet there is nothing in the islands like cromwells castle standing on the sound with shipmans head beyond and you must go out beyond tresco to the islands which we cannot see heretean and st helens and the rest then she turned westward lying scattered among the bright waters whitened by the breeze there lay before their eyesdots and specks upon the biggest maps but here great massive rocks and rugged islets piled with granite surrounded by ledges and reefs cut and carved by winds and flying foam into ragged edges bold peaks and defiant cliffsplaces where all the year round the seals play and the seagulls scream and in spring the puffins lay their eggs with the oystercatchers and the sherewaters the shags and the hern over all shone the golden sun of september and round them all the water leaped and sparkled in the light those are the outer islands the girl pointed them out her eyes brightening it is among the outer islands that i like best to sail look that great rock with the ledge at foot is castle bryher that noble rock beyond is maiden bower the rock farthest out is scilly if you were going to stay we would sail round scilly and watch the waves always tearing at his sides you cannot see from here but he is divided by a narrow channel the water always rushes through this channel roaring and tearing but once we found it calmand we got through only peter would never try again if you were going to staysometimes in september it is very still i did not know said roland that there was anything near england so wonderful and so lovely you cannot see the islands in one morning you cannot see half of them from this hill you like them more and more as you stay longer and see them every day with a different light and a different sea you know them all i suppose roland asked oh every one if you had sailed among them so often you would know them too there are hundreds and every one has got its name i think i have stood on all though there are some on which no one can land even at low tide and in the calmest weather and no one knows what beautiful bays and beaches and headlands there are hidden away and never seen by anyone if you could stay i would show them to you but since you cannot she sighed well you have not even seen the whole of samson yetand that is only one of all the rest she leaped lightly from the rocks and led them southward see she said on this hill there are ten great barrows at least every one the tomb of a kinga king of lyonesse and on the sides of the hillthey kept the top for the kingsthere are smaller barrows i suppose of the princes and princesses i told you that the island was a royal buryingground at the foot of the hillyou can see themare some walls which they say are the ruins of a church but i suppose that in those days they had no church they left these venerable tombs behind them and descended the hill at its foot between the two hills there lies a pretty little bay circular and fringed with a beach of white sand if one wanted a port for samson here is the spot looking straight across the atlantic with mincarlo lying like a lion couchant on the water a mile out this is porth bay said their guide out there at the end is shark point there are sharks sometimes i believe but i have never seen them now we are going up the southern hill it began with a gentle ascent there were signs of former cultivation stone walls remained enclosing spaces which once were fieldsnothing in them now but fern and gorse and bramble and wild flowers halfway up there stood a ruined cottage the walls were standing but the roof was gone and all the woodwork the gardenwall remained but the little garden was overrun with fern this was my greatgreatgrandmothers cottage said armorel it was built by her husband they lived in it for twelve months after they were married then he was drowned and she came to live at the farm seeshe showed them in a corner of the garden a little wizened appletree crouching under the stone wall out of the reach of the north windshe planted this tree on her weddingday it is too old now to bear fruit but she is still living and her husband has been dead for seventyfive years i often come to look at the place and to wonder how it looked when it was first inhabited there were flowers i suppose in the garden when she was young and happy there are more ruins said roland yes there are other ruins when all the people except ourselves went away these cottages were deserted and so they fell into decay they used to live by smuggling and wrecking you see and when they could no longer do either they had to go away or starve they stood upon the highest point of holy hill some twenty feet above the summit of the northern hill and looked out upon the southern islands there said armorel with a flush of pride because the view here is so different and yet so lovely here you can see the south islands look there is minalto which you drifted past yesterday those are the ledges of white island where you were nearly cast away and lost there is annet where the seabirds lay their eggsoh thousands and thousands of puffins though now there are not any you should see them in the spring that is st agnesa beautiful island i should like to show you camberdizl and st warnas cove and there are the dogs of scilly beyondthey look to be black spots from here you should see them close then you would understand how big they are and how terrible there are gorregan and daisy rosevean and rosevear crebawethan and pednathias and therewhere you see a little circle of whitethat is retarrier ledge not long ago there was a great ship coming slowly up the channel in bad weather she was filled with germans from new york going home to spend the money they had saved in america most of them had their money with them tied up in bags suddenly the ship struck on retarrier it was ten oclock in the evening and a great sea running for two hours the ship kept bumping on the rocks then she began to break up and they were all drownedall the women and all the children and most of the men some of them had lifebelts on but they did not know how to tie them and so the things only slipped down over their legs and helped to drown them the money was found on them in the old days the people of the islands would have had it all but the coastguard took care of it there on the right of retarrier is the bishops rock and lighthouse in storms the lighthouse rocks like a tree in the wind you ought to sail over to those rocks if it was only to see the surf dashing up their sides but since you cannot stay again she sighed these are very interesting islands said dick especially is it interesting to consider the consequences of being a native i should like to stay and sail among them said roland for instancedick pursued his line of thoughtin the study of geography we who are from the inland parts of great britain must begin by learning the elements the definitions the terminology now to a scilly boy a scillonian the girl corrected him we never speak of scilly folk naturally to a scillonian no explanation is needed he knows without being told the meaning of peninsula island bay shore archipelago current tide cape headland ocean lake road harbour reef lighthouse beacon buoy soundingeverything he must know also what is meant by a gale of wind a stiff breeze a dead calm he recognises by the look of it a lively sea a chopping sea a heavy sea a roaring sea a sulky sea he knows everything except a river that i suppose requires very careful explanation it was a scilly youthi mean a scillonianwho sat down on the river bank to wait for the water to go by the history seems to prove the commercial intercourse which in remote antiquity took place between phoenicia and the cassiterides or scilly islands armorel looked puzzled i did not know that story of a scillonian and a river she said coldly never mind his stories said roland this place is a story in itself you are a story we are all in fairyland noshe shook her head bryher is the only island in all scilly which has any fairies they call them pixies there i do not think that fairies would ever like to come and live on samson because of the graves you know she led them down the hill along a path worn by her own feet alone and brought them out to the level space occupied by the farmbuildings this is where we live she said if you could stay here roland lee we could give you a room we have many empty roomsshe sighedsince my father and mother and my brothers were all drowned will you come in she took them into the best parlour a room which struck a sudden chill to anyone who entered therein it was the room reserved for days of ceremonyfor a wedding a christening or a funeral between these events the room was never used the furniture presented the aspect common to best parlours being formal and awkward in one corner stood a bookcase with glass doors filled with books armorel showed them into this apartment drew up the blind opened the windowthere was certainly a stuffiness in the airand looked about the room with evident pride few best parlours she thought in the adjacent islands of st marys bryher tresco or even great britain itself could beat this she left them for a few minutes and came back bearing a tray on which were a plate of apples another of biscuits and a decanter full of a very black liquid hospitality has its rules even on samson whither come so few visitors will you taste our scilly apples she said these are from our own orchard behind the house you will find them very sweet roland took oneas a general rule this young man would rather take a dose of medicine than an appleand munched it with avidity a delicious fruit he cried but his friend refused the proffered gift then you will take a biscuit dick stephenson nothing at least a glass of wine never in the morning thank you you will roland lee she turned with a look of disappointment to the other man who was so easily pleased and who said such beautiful things it is my own winei made it myself last year of ripe blackberries indeed i will your own wine your own making miss armorel wine of samsonthe glorious vintage of the blackberry in pies and in jampots i know the blackberry but not as yet in decanters thank you thank you he smiled heroically while he held the glass to the light smelt it rolled it gently round then he tasted it sweet he said critically and strong clings to the palate a liqueur winea curious wine he drank it up and smiled again your own making it is wonderful nonot another drop thank you shall i show youthe girl asked timidlywould you like to see my greatgreatgrandmother she is so very old that the people come all the way from st agnes only just to look at her sometimes she answers questions for them and they think it is telling their fortunes she is asleep but you may talk aloud you will not awaken her she is so very very old you know consider she has been a widow nearly eighty years she led them into the other room where in effect the ancient dame sat in her hooded chair fast asleep in cap and bonnet her hands in black mittens crossed heavens roland murmured what a face i must draw that face andhe looked at the girl bending over the chair placing a pillow in positionand that other it is wonderful he said aloud this is indeed the face of one who has lived a hundred years does she sometimes wake up and talk in the evening she recovers her memory for awhile and talkssometimes quite nicely sometimes she rambles and you have a spinningwheel in the corner she likes someone to work at the spinningwheel while she talks then she thinks it is the old time back again and there is a violin i play it in the evening it keeps her awake and helps her to remember justinian taught me he used to play very well indeed until his fingers grew stiff i can play a great many tunes but it is difficult to learn any new ones last summer there were some ladies at tregarthensone of them had a most beautiful voice and she used to sing in the evening with the window open i used to sail across on purpose to land and listen outside and i learned a very pretty tune i would play it to you in the evening if you were not going away i am not obliged to go away the young man said with strangely flushing cheeks roland that was dicks voicebut it was unheeded will you stay here then the girl asked here in this house in your house you can have my brother emanuels room i shall be very glad if you will stay and i will show you everything she did not invite the young man called dick but this other the young man who drank her wine and ate her apple if youryouryour guardianor your greatgreatgrandmother approves oh she will approve stay roland lee we will make you very happy here and you dont know what a lot there is to see roland again dicks warning voice a thousand thanks he said i will stay chapter v the enchanted island the striking of seven by the most sonorous and musical of clocks ever heard reminded roland of the dinnerhour at seven most of us are preparing for this function which civilisation has converted almost into an act of praise and worship some men he remembered were now walking in the direction of the club some were dressing some were making for restaurants some had already begun one naturally associates seven oclock with the anticipation of dinner there are men it is true who habitually take in food at midday and call it dinner there are also those who have no dinner at all he began to realise that he was not this evening going to have any dinner at all for he was now at the farmhouse sitting in the square window with armorel he had gone back to tregarthens and returned with his portmanteau and his painting gear fortunately he had also taken an abundant lunch at that establishment he had become an inhabitant of samson the increased population therefore now consisted of seven souls in fact there was no dinner for him everybody in samson dines at halfpast twelve he had tea with armorel at halfpast four after tea they wandered along the shore and stood upon shark point to see the sun set behind mincarlo an operation performed with zeal and despatch and with great breadth and largeness of colouring when the shades of evening began to prevail they were fain to get home quickly because there is no path among the boulders nor have former inhabitants provided handrails for visitors on the carns therefore they retraced their steps to the farm and armorel left him sitting alone in the square window while she went about some household duties in the quiet room the solemn clock told the moments and there was light enough left to discern the ghostly figure of the ancient dame sleeping in her chair the place was so quiet and so strange that the visitor presently felt as if he was sitting among ghosts it is at twilight in fact that the spirits of the past make themselves most readily felt if not seen now it was exactly as if he had been in the place before he knew now why he had been so suddenly and strangely attracted to samson he had been there beforewhen or under what conditions he knew not and did not ask himself it is a condition of the mind known to everybody a toucha worda lookand we are transported backhow many years ago the hills the rocks the house armorel herselfall were familiar to him the thing was absurd yet in his mind it was quite clear it was so absurd that he thought his mind was wandering and he arose and went out into the garden there the figurehead of the woman under the tall fuchsiatreethe glow from the fire in the sittingroom fell upon the face through the windowseemed to smile upon him as upon an old friend he went back again and sat down where was armorel this strange familiarity with an unknown place quickly passes though it may return he now began to feel as if perhaps he was making a mistake he was living on an island with practically no other companion than a girl of fifteen dick who had become suddenly grumpy on learning his resolution to stay might be right well he would sketch and paint he would be very careful not a word should be said that might disturb the childs tranquillity nodick was a fool he was going to have a day or twojust a day or twoof quiet happiness the girl was young and beautiful and innocent she was also made happyshe showed that happiness without an attempt at concealmentbecause he was going to stay what would follow wellit was an adventure one does not ask what is going to follow on first encountering an adventure what young man besides sallying forth upon a simple holiday looks to find himself upon a desert island with no other companion than a trustful and admiring maiden of fifteen then armorel returned and took a chair beside him he was a little surprisedbut then on a desert island nothing happens as on terra firmathat she did not ring for lights and was still not without some hope of dinner they took up the thread of talk about the islands concerning which roland lee perceived that he would before long know a good deal local knowledge is always interesting but it does not except to novelists possess a marketable value one cannot for instance at a dinnerparty turn the conversation on the respective families of st agnes and st martins he made a mental note that he would presently change the subject to one of deeper personal interest perhaps he could get armorel to talk about herself that would be very much more interesting than to hear about the three pipers holes of tresco white and st marys islands how did she livethis girland what did she doand what did she think meantime while the girl herself was talking of the rocks and bays the crags and coves the white sand and the grey granite the seals and the shags the puffins and the dottrells she was wondering for her part what manner of man this washow he lived and what he did and what he thought for when man and woman meet they are clothed and covered up they are a mystery each to the other never since the fall have we been able to read each others hearts but when the clock struck seven armorel sprang to her feet as one who hath a serious duty to perform and preparations to make for it first she pulled down the blind and so shut out what was left of the twilight the fire had sunk low but by its light she was dimly visible she pushed back the table she placed two chairs opposite the old lady and another chair before the spinningwheel something said the young man to himself is certainly going to happen one can no longer hope for dinner family prayers perhaps or the worship of the old lady as an ancestor the descendants of the ancient people of lyonesse no doubt bow down to the sun and dance to the moon and pass the children through the holed stone and make baal fires and worship their grandmothers it will be an interesting function but perhaps only family prayers armorel took down the fiddle that hung on the wall and began to tune it twanging the strings and drawing the bow across in the manner which so pleasantly excites the theatre before the music begins not family prayers then said the young man perhaps disappointed what did happen however was a series of things quite new and wholly unexpected never was known such a desert island first of all the lady of many generations moved uneasily in her sleep at the twanging of the strings and her fingers clutched at her dress as if she was startled by an uneasy dream and then the door opened and a small procession of three came in at this point had the young man been a roman catholic he would have crossed himself as he was not he only started and murmured as i thought the worship of the ancestor these are the ghosts of the grandfather and the grandmother the old lady is a mummy they are all ghostsi shall presently awake and find myself on my back among the barrows first came an ancient dame but not so ancient as she of the great chair greyheaded she was and equipped in a large cap wrinkled was her face and her chin for lack of teeth approached her nose quite in the ancestral manner she was followed by an old man also greyheaded and greybearded wrinkled of face his shoulders bent and twisted with rheumatism his fingers gnarled and twisted these two took the chairs set for them by armorel the third in the procession was a woman already elderly and with streaks of grey in her hair she was thin and sharpfaced she sat down before the spinningwheel and began to work not as you may now see the amateur but in the quiet quick professional manner which means business the stranger was not quite right in his conjecture they were not ancestors the old man who had worked on the farm man and boy for nearly seventy years and now managed it altogether was justinian tryeth the old woman was dorcas his wife the middleaged woman was their daughter chessun who had been maid on the farm as her brother peter had been boy all her life whatever was intended was clearly a daily function because each dropped into his own place without hesitation the old woman had brought some knitting with her her daughter picked up the thread of the spindle and the old man taking the tongs stimulated the coals into a flame which he continually nursed and maintained with new fuel there was neither lamp nor candle in the room the ruddy firelight rising and falling played about the room warming the drab panels into crimson sinking into the dark beams of the joists flashing among the china in the cupboard painting red the venussfingers in the cabinet and throwing strange lights and shadows upon the aged lady in the chair was she really alive was she after all only a mummy roland looked on breathless what was to be done next time had gone back eighty yearsa hundred and eighty yearsany number of years as they sat here in the firelight with the spinningwheel the old servingpeople with their mistress without lamp or candle so they sat in the generations long gone by and again that curious feeling fell upon him that he had seen it all before yet he could not remember what was to be done next armorel the tuning complete turned with a look of inquiry to the old man singletons slip he commanded with the authority of a professor the girl began to play this old tune perhaps you remember the style of the fiddlerhe is getting scarce nowwho used to sit in the corner and play the hornpipe for the sailors in the days when every sailor could dance the hornpipe perhaps you do not remember that fiddler and his style that is your misfortune for there was a noble freedom in the handling of his bow and the interpretation of his melodies was bold and original he poured into the music all the spirit it was capable of containing and drew out of his hearers every emotion that each particular tune was able to draw because you see tunes have their limitations you cannot strike every chord in the human heart with a simple hornpipe this sailors best friend however did all that could be done and always conscientious if you please never allowing his playing to become slovenly or to lack spirit armorel played after the manner of this old fiddler standing up to her work in the middle of the room singletons slip is a ditty which was formerly much admired by those who danced the hey the jig or the simple country dance it was also much played by the pipe and tabor upon the village green it accompanied the bear when he carried the pole it assisted those who danced on stilts and it lent spirit to those who frolicked in the morrice charles ii knew it tom durfey wrote words to it i believe but i have not yet found them in his collection rochester must certainly have danced to it armorel played it first cheerfully and loudly as if to arouse the spirits of those who listened to remind them that legs may be shaken to this tune and that ladies may be and should be when this tune begins taken to their places and presently handed round and down the middle then she played it trippingly as if they were actually all dancing then she played it tenderlythere is if you come to think of it a good deal of possible tenderness in the airand lastly she played it joyfully yet softly how had she learned all these modes and moods while she played the old man listened critically nodding his head and beating the time then fired with memory he bent his arms and worked his fingers as if they held the fiddle and the bow and he threw back his head and thrust out his leg and leaned sideways just like that jolly fiddler of whom we have just been reminded such my friends is the power of music after a little while justinian stopped this imaginary performance and sitting forward yielded himself wholly to the influence of the tune cracking his fingers over his head and beating time with one foot just as you may see the old villager in the old coloured printsno villager in these days of bad beer ever cracks his fingers or shows any external signs of joyful emotion as for the two servingwomen they reminded the spectator of the supers on the stage who march when they are told to march sit down to feast when they are ordered and swell a procession for a funeral or a festival all with unmoved countenance showing a philosophy so great that the triumph of victory or the disaster of defeat finds them equally calm and selfcontainedthat is to say the two women showed no sense at all of being pleased or moved by singletons slip they went onone with her knitting and the other with her spinning as for the ancient lady however when the music began she straightened herself sat upright and opened her eyes then chessun hastened to adjust her bonnet if ladies sleep in their bonnets these adornments have a tendency to fall out of the perpendicular heaven forbid that we should gaze upon ursula rosevean with her bonnet tilted like a lady in a van coming home to wapping from fairlop fair this done the venerable dame looked about her with eyes curiously bright and keen then she began to beat time with her fingers and then she began to talk butand this added to the strangeness of the whole businessnobody seemed to regard what she said it was much as if the oracle of delphi were pouring out the most valuable prophecies and none of her attendants paid any heed if thought the young man i were to take down her words they would be a message and what with the voice of the oracle the spirited fiddling the firelight dancing about the room the old man snapping his fingers and perhaps some physical exhaustion following on the absence of dinner the young man felt as if the music had got into his head he wanted to get up and dance with armorel round and round the room he would not have marvelled had dorcas and justinian bidden him lead out chessun and so take hands round twice down the middle and back again set and turn singlewhere had he learnt these phrases and terms of the old country dance nowhere they belonged to the place and to the music and to the timeand that was at least a hundred and eighty years back the fiddle stopped armorel held it down and looked again at her master tis well played he said a moving piece now prince ruperts march she nodded and began another tune this is a piece which may be played many ways first to those who understand it rightly it indicates the tramp of an army the riding of the cavalry the jingling of sabres next it may serve for a battlepiece and you shall hear between the bars the charge of the horse and the clashing of the steel or it may be played as a triumphal march after victory or again as a country dance in which a stately dignity takes the place of youthful mirth and merriment at such a dance to the tune of prince ruperts march the elders themselvesyea the justice of peace the vicar the mayor and aldermen and the headborough himselfmay stand up in line and now roland became conscious of the old ladys words he heard them clear and distinct and as she talked the firelight fell upon her eyes and she seemed to be gazing fixedly upon the stranger when the princess augusta east indiaman struck upon the castinicks in the middle of the night she went to pieces in an hourany vessel would they said she was wrecked by the people of samson who tied a ships lantern between the horns of a cow but it was never proved there are other islands in scilly and other islanders if you talk of wrecking some of the dead bodies were washed ashore and a good part of the cargo so that there was something for everybody a finer wreck never came to the islands what if a ship is bound to be wrecked better that she should strike on british rocks and cast her cargo ashore for the kings subjects better the rocks of scilly than the rocks of france what the sea casts up belongs to the people who find it that is just but you must not rob the living no that is a great crime twas in the year when emanuel rosevean my fatherinlaw rescued the passenger who was lying senseless lashed to a spar he should not have taken the bag that was hanging round his neck that was not well done he should have given the man his bag again he stood here before he went away you have saved my life he said i had all my treasure in a bag tied about my neck if i had brought that safe ashore i could have offered you something worth your acceptance but i have nothing i begin the world again emanuel heard him say this and he let him go but the bag was in his box he kept the bag very soon the wrath of the lord fell upon the house and his hand has been heavy upon us ever since no luck for usnor shall be any till we find the man and give him back his bag of treasure she went on repeating this story with small variations and additions but roland was now listening again to the fiddle armorel stopped again dissembling love said her master she began that tune obediently the stranger within the gates seemed compelled to listen his brain reeled the old woman fascinated him the words which he had heard had been few but now he seemed to see standing before the fire his hair powdered and in black silk stockings and shoes with steel buckles the man who had been saved and robbed shaking hands with the man who had saved and robbed him oh it was quite clear he had seen it all before he remembered it this time he heard nothing of the tune my husband methusalem my dear husband with his only brother began to pay for that wickedness they were capsized crossing to st marys and drowned if i had thought what was going to happen i would have taken the bag and walked through all england looking for him until i had found him yesif it took me fifty years but i knew nothing i thought our happiness would last for ever fiveandtwenty years after my son emanuel was cast away in the bristol channel piloting a vessel they struck on steep holm in a fog and your own father armorel was drowned with his wife and three boys on their way home from a weddingfeast at st agnes here her voice dropped and roland heard the concluding bars of dissembling love which armorel was playing with quite uncommon tenderness when she stopped justinian gave her no rest blue petticoats he commanded armorel again obeyed then the old lady went back in memory to the days of her girlhoodnow so long ago nowhere now can one find an old lady who will tell of her girlish days when the century was not yet arrived at the age of ten we shall dance tonight she said on bryher green my boy will be there we shall dance together john tryeth from samson will play his fiddle we shall dance prince ruperts march and blue petticoats and dissembling love the ensign from the garrison is coming and the deputy commissary they will drink my health but they shall not have me for partner my boy will be theremy own boythe handsomest man on all the islands though he is so black thats the spaniard in him his mother was a murenohonor mureno the last of the murenos he has got the old spaniards sword still its the spanish blood it gives my boy his black eyes and his black hair it makes his cheeks swarthy and it makes him proud and hottempered i like a man to be quick and proud if hes strong and brave as well when i have sons the lord make them all like their father so she went on talking of her lover armorel stopped and looked again at her master the chirping of the lark he said armorel began this tune it is of an artificial character lending itself less readily than the rest to emotion the composer called it the chirping of the lark because he wanted a title it resembles the song of that warbler in no single particular but it changed the old ladys current of thought this long war she said looking round cheerfully will be the making of the islands if it lasts never was there so much money about we roll in money the women have all got silks and satins the men drink port wine and the finest french brandy which they run over for themselves the merchantmen put into the road and the sailors spend their money at the port why shouldnt we go on fighting the french until they havent a ship left afloat my man made the run last week and hid the cargoi know where i shall help him to carry the kegs across to the garrison where they want brandy badly a fine run and a good days work she looked around with a jubilant countenance then another memory seized her and the light left her eyes better be drowned yourself than marry a man who is going to be drowned better not marry at all than lose your husband six months afterwards it is long ago now armorel time goes onone can remember he would be very old nowyesvery old sometimes i see him still but he has not grown old where he is staying that is bad for me because he liked young women not old women men mostly do they are so made even the oldest of them perhaps the old women when they rise again are made young again so that their lovers may love them still the clock struck halfpast eight armorel stopped playing and the old lady stopped talking at the same moment her eyes closed her head fell forward she became comatose then the two servingwomen got up and helped her or carried her out of the room to her bedroom behind and the old man arose and without so much as a goodnight hobbled away to his own cottage she will go to bed now said armorel chessun will take in her broth and her wine and she will sleep all night do you have this performance every night yes the playing seems to put life and heart into her all the morning she dozes or if she wakes she is not often able to talk but in the evening when we sit around the fire just as they used to sit in the old days without candlesbecause my people were poor and candles were dearand when chessun spins and i playshe revives and sits up and talks as you have seen her yes it is rather ghostly justinian used to playoh he could play very well indeed not so well as you yesmuch betterand he knows hundreds of tunes but his fingers became stiff with rheumatism and as he had put off teaching peter until it was too late he taught me that is all i think you play wonderfully well do you play nothing but old tunes i only know what i have learned there is that song which i heard the lady sing last yeari dont know what it is called tell me if you like it she struck the strings again and played a song full of life and spirit of tenderness and fond memorya bright sparkling songwhich wanted no words oh cried roland you are really wonderful you are playing the kerry dance she laughed and layed down the violin we must not have any more playing tonight do you really like to hear me play you look as if you did it is wonderful he replied i could listen all night but if there is to be no more music shall we look outside if there were no light in the house the ships lantern was hanging up with one of those big ships candles in it which are of such noble dimensions and of generosity so unbounded in the matter of tallow there was no moon but the sky was clear and the sea could be seen by the light of the stars and the revolving lights of bishops rock and st agnes flashed across the water the young man shivered we are in fairyland he said it is a charmed island nothing is real armorel your name should be titania how have you made me hear and believe all these things how do you contrive your sorceries are you an enchantress confessyou cannot in sober truth play those tunes the old lady is in reality only a phantom called into visible shape by your incantations but you are a benevolent witchyou will not turn me into a pig i do not understand there have been no sorceries there are no witches left on the scilly islands formerly there were many dorcas knows about them i do not know what was the good of them i suppose you are quite real after all it is only strange and incomprehensible it is a fine night tomorrow it will be a fine day with a gentle breeze we will go sailing among the outer islands the air is heavy with perfume what is it surely an enchanted land it is the scent of the lemonverbena treesee here is a sprig it is very sweet how silent it is here night after night never to hear a sound nothing but the sound of the waves they never cease listenit is a calm night but you can hear them lapping on the beach ten minutes later when they returned to the house they found candles lighted and supper spread a substantial supper such as was owed to a man who had had no dinner there was cold roast fowl and ham there was a lettucesalad and a goodly cheese and there was the unexpected and grateful sight of a brown george with a most delectable ball of white froth at the top also roland remarked the presence of the decanter containing the blackberry wine now you shall have some supper armorel assumed the head of the table and took up the carvingknife no thank youi can carve very well besides you are our visitor and it is a pleasure to carve for you will you have a wing or a leg do you like your ham thin not too thin oh how hungry you must be that is alehomebrewed ale will you take some or would you prefer a glass of the blackberry wine nohelp yourself the beer for me said roland he filled and drank a tumbler of the beverage dear to every rightminded briton it was strong and generous with flakes of hop floating in it like the beeswing in port this is splendid beer he said i do not remember that i ever tasted such beer as this it is humming aleoctober alestingo no wonder our forefathers fought so well when they had such beer as this to fight upon peter is proud of his homebrewed do you make everything for yourselves is samson sufficient for all the needs of the islanders this beer is the beer of samsonstrong and mighty my hair is growing long alreadyand curly we make all we can there are no shops you see on samson we bake our own bread we brew our own beer we make our own butter we even spin our own linen and you make your own wine armorel he called her naturally by her christian name you could not call such a girl miss armorel or miss rosevean it is a wonderful island after supper they sat by the fireside and by permission he smoked his pipe then everybody else on the island being in bed and asleep they talked the young man had his way that is to say he encouraged the girl to talk about herself he led her on he had a soft voice soft eyes and a general manner of sympathy which surprised confidence she began timidly at first to talk about herself yet with feminine reservation no woman will ever talk about herself in the way which delights young men but she told him all he asked her simple lonely lifehow she arose early in the morning how she roamed about the island and sang aloud with none to hear her but the seagulls and the shags do you never draw he asked she had tried to draw but there was no one to help her do you read no she seldom read in the best parlour there was a bookcase full of books but she never looked at them as for the old lady and dorcas they had never learned to read she had been at school over at st marys till she was thirteen but she hardly cared to read and the newspapersdo you ever read them she never read them she knew nothing that went on as for her ambitions and her hopesif he could get at them fond youthas if a girl would ever tell her ambitions but armorel apparently had none to tell she lived in the present it was joy enough for her to wander in the soft warm air of her island home upon the hills and round the coast to cruise among the rocks while the breeze filled out the sail and the sparkling water leaped above the bow so far she told nay she hid nothing because there was nothing to hide she told no more because as yet her ambitions and her dreams of the future had no shape they were vague and mistyshe was only aware of their existence when restlessness seized her and impelled her to get up and run over the hills to porth bay and back again but at night when she went to bed she experienced quite a new and disquieting sensation it showed at least that she was no longer a child but already on the threshold of womanhood with blushing cheek and beating heart she remembered that for an hour and more she had been talking about nothing but herself what would mr roland lee think of a girl who could waste his time in talking about nothing but herself chapter vi the flowerfarm roland startled out of sleep by the sudden feeling of danger which always seizes us in a strange bedexcept a bed at an innsat up and looked around him his room was small and low and simply furnished he was lying on a feather bed of the oldfashioned kind the bedstead was of wood but without curtains he presently remembered where he was on samson islandthe guest of a child a girl of fifteen he sprang out of bed and threw open the window his room was over the porch the fragrance of the lemonverbena tree arose like steam from a haystack and filled his chamber below him and beyond the garden the geese waddled on the green the ducks splashed in the pond and in the farmyard peter walked about slowly carrying a pitchfork in his hands but apparently for amusement rather than use as if it had been a court sword he looked at his watch it was halfpast seven at this time in london he would have been still in the first long slumber of the night now he was eager to be up and dressed if only for a better understanding of the situation to be the guest of a child has the freshness of novelty but it is a situation which might lead to complications suppose a guardian or a lawyer or a cousin of some kind were to cross over in a boat and ask what he was doing there and suppose he had no better reply than the plain truththat this young lady had been so good as to invite him would a man go down to stay at a country house on the simple invitation of a schoolgirl at the same time this girl appeared to be the mistress of the establishment there was an ancient ladytoo old for superintendenceand there were servants well if no guardian challenged his presence why then for a single dayhe must not stay moreit surely mattered little the girl was but a child yet he must not stay longer perhaps they were not too well off he must not be a burden and again though the girl invited him to stay she named no limit of time she did not invite him to stay for a week or for a fortnight perhaps she expected him to go away that very morning he proceededwith somewhat thoughtful countenance considering these thingsto dress paying as much attention to his personal appearance as a young man should and an old man must it is the privilege of middleaged men to go slovenly if they please no one regardeth him of middle age while their locks are turning grey and their children are growing up they are in the thick of the days work and they may disregard if they choose the mysteries of the toilette apollo however must be as jealous about his apparel and adornment as the graces themselves who are always represented at the moment before the choice is made a velvet jacket and a white waistcoat are trifles in themselves but they become a youthful figure and a face which has finelycut features and is decorated with a promising silky beard pointed withal and the brown shading of a young moustache besides he who is an artist thinks more than other young men about such things dress to him as to a woman becomes costume colour has to be considered such picturesqueness as is possible in modern fashion is aimed at the artistic craving for fitness and beauty must be satisfied roland did what he could and with his velvet coat a clean white waistcoat a crimson scarf a good figure and a handsome face he was as handsome a youth of twentyone as one is likely to find anywhere again as he opened his door and began to descend the narrow stairs there came over him that curious feeling of having been in the place before he had felt it in the evening when armorel played dissembling love now he felt it again and when he stood in the porch he seemed to remember standing there oncelong ago long agobut how long he could not tell nor as happened to him before could he remember what had happened on that occasion armorel herself was in the garden looking for some flowers for the breakfasttable she greeted him with a smile of welcome and a friendly grasp of the hand there was also a look of kindly solicitude on her face which would have suited a chatelaine of forty years had he slept well had he really been provided with everything he wanted was there anything at all lacking if so would he speak to chessun breakfast she said leaving him in the garden would be served in a few minutes would he speak to chessun then it seemed as if she meant him to stay another night what should he do then armorel came back breakfast is quite ready she said come in roland lee it is a beautiful morning there is a fresh breeze and a smooth sea we can go anywhere this morning i have spoken to peter and he will be ready to go with us in an hour or so i think we may even get out to scilly and maiden bower yes the morning was bright and the sky was clear in the golden sunshine of september the islets across the water showed like creations of a poets dream roland drew a deep breath of admiration everybody he said ought to come to scilly and to stay a long time he turned from the view to the girl beside him she had changed her blue flannel dress for a daintier and a prettier costumethink not that there are no shops at hugh townof grey nuns cloth daintily embroidered in front still at her throat she wore a red flower and round her neck clung the golden torque found in the old kings grave her dark eyes glowed her lips were parted in a smile her cheek showed the dewy bloom that some girls fortunate above their sisters can exhibit when they first appear in the morning her long tresses were now tied up and confined she looked as if she had just stepped forth from her chamber fresh from her sleep no one certainly could have guessed that she had been up since six nor that the fish which had been hissing in the fryingpan and were now lying meekly side by side in a dish on the breakfasttable were of her own catching an hours sitting in the boat off samson ledge with hook and line had procured this splendid contribution to the morning banquet fish fragrant with the salt sea fish that had not been packed tight in boxes nor travelled in railway trains nor been slapped about on counters nor been packed in ice fish that can never lie on a london tablethese were set out before rolands hungry gaze the ancient dame did not appear the two breakfasted as they had supped together i do not know how or where armorel learned the art and practice of hospitality but certainly she showed a true feeling in the matter of feedingespecially at breakfast first the table was decorated with the autumn leaves of the bramblecrimson yellow purplefew indeed know how beautiful a table may be made when decorated with these leaves there were also a few late flowers from the garden but not many the coffee was strong the milk hot and thick the bread and butter homemade like the beer of yester eve the ham was cured by chessun the eggs were collected by armorel she had also with her own hands made the jam and the cake armorel sat behind the cups with as much ease as if she had been accustomed from infancy to entertain young gentlemen at breakfast she was serious over her task and poured out the coffee as if it was something precious not to be wasted or carelessly administered which is the spirit in which all good food should be approached she did not ask any questions nor did she talk much during the banquet perhaps she had an instinctive perception of the great truth that breakfast which is taken at the beginning of the daythe sacred day with all its possibilities and its chances of what may happen the fateful day which alone and unaided may change the whole course and current of a lifeshould be approached with a becoming gravity at breakfast the man fortifies himself before he goes forth to work but he has the work before him in the evening it is done he has passed through the dangers of the day he still lives he has received no hurt he has we hope prospered in his honest handiwork he may laugh and rejoice but at breakfast we should be serious what will you do asked armorel breakfast completed until peter is ready he has got some work you know before he can come out i should like first he said to see your flowerfarm if i may if you please but there is nothing to see at this time of the year you must not think we grow flowers all the year round if you were here in february you would see the fields covered with beautiful flowersiris anemone jonquil narcissus and daffodil they are very pretty then and the air is sweet with their scent but now the fields are quite bare i should like to see them however i will show them to you it is a great happiness to the islands said armorel gravely that we have found out the flowerfarming everybody was very poor before all the old ways of living were gone you see a long time ago the people had wrecks every winterthe sea cast up quantities of things which they could sell or they went out in boats and took the things out of the hold when the ship was on the rocks and then they were all smugglers the scillonians used to run over to france openly day and night with no one to stop them and they used to carry fruit and vegetables out to the homewardbound ships in the channel and then they were pilots as well some of the men used to make as much as two hundred pounds a year as pilots my grandfathers were all pilots they were smugglers too and they had this farm and grew vegetables for the ships then the government built the lighthouses and there were no more wrecks and the preventive service came and stopped the smuggling and since the steamers took the place of the sailingships no vessels put in here and there are no more pilots wanted so you see it was as if nothing was left at all it does seem rough on the people first they tried kelpmaking they collected the seaweed and put it in a kiln or furnace and made a fire under it i can show you some of the old furnaces still but that came to an end then they tried a fishing company but i believe it did not pay and then they began to build ships but i suppose other people could build them better so that came to an end too and for some time i do not know how all the people lived as for the farms they could never grow enough for the islands then a great many of the people went away they had to go or they would have starved some went to england and some to america and some to australia all the families went away from samson one by one until at last there were none left but ourselves and justinian on bryher and st martins they became fishermen but not here as for justinian he sent away all his boys except peter oh they have done very wellsplendidly one is a coastguard and one is bosn in the queens navy one is captain of a steamer trading between philadelphia and cuba and one is actually chief steward on a great pacific liner justinian is very proud of him indeed yes said roland with reason the scillonians the girl continued proudly all get on very well wherever they go they are honest you see as well as clever and the flowerfarming somebody discovered that the early spring flowers which begin here in january could be carried to london and sold quite fresh and then everybody began to plant bulbs that is all we have had a farm of some kind here for i do not know how many generations since the time roland suggested when in consequence of the separation of scilly from the mainland and the disappearance of lyonesse the royal family found themselves left in samson she laughed well all these stone inclosures on the hill belonged to our farm we grew things and ate them i suppose perhaps we sold them but we were then poor i know and now we have no more trouble beside and behind the farmhouse on the slope of the hill they came upon a series of little fields following one after the other they were quite smallsome mere patches none larger than a garden of ordinary size and they were all enclosed and shut in by high hedges so that they looked like largish boxes with the lids off some of the hedges were of elm growing thick and close some of escallonia with its red flowers some of veronica its purple blossom like heads of bulrush some of the servicetree and some but not many of tamarisk its pink bunches of blossom all displayed at this time of the year but the fields were now brown and bare and had nothing at all growing in them except a few patches of gladiolus now dying beyond these fields however there were others of larger area with ruder hedges formed by laths reeds wooden palings and stone walls these were inclosed and partly sheltered for the growth of vegetables these are our fields said armorel at this time of the year there is nothing to show you our harvest begins in january and lasts till may but february and march are our best months seethere is peter with a young man from bryher planting bulbs for next year they are taken up every three years and replanted peter in fact was at work he was superintendinga form of work which he found to suit him bestwhile the young man from bryher who looked more than half sailor with a broad longhandled spade was leisurely turning over the light sandy soil and laying in the bulbs side by side out of a great basket it seems an easy form of agriculture said roland it is not hard there is nothing to do after this until the flowers are picked but sometimes a cold wind will come down from the north and will kill a whole field full of blossomsin spite of all our hedges that is a terrible loss when everything goes well we cut the flowers pack them in boxes carry them over to the port and next morning they are sold in londonoh and all over the country in every big town i shall never again behold a daffodil in february said roland without thinking of samson you have lent a new association to the spring flowers henceforth they will bring back this glorious view of sea and islands grey and black rocks the splendid sunshine and the fresh breezeand he added with a winning smile and deferential eyes the lady of lyonesse armorel laughed it was very nice to be called the lady of lyonessenobody before had ever called her anything except plain armorel and it was quite a new experience to have a young gentleman treating her with deference as well as compliment at the back of the house was an orchard through which they presently passed like the flowerfields it was protected by a high hedge but the appletrees looked like the olives of provence every one seemed in the last decay of age they were twisted and dwarfish the branches grew in queer angles and elbows as if they were crouching down out of reach of the north wind the trunks were bent and which completed their resemblance to the olive all alike were covered and clothed with a thick grey lichen clinging to every bough like a glove and hanging like a fringe if you tear it off the tree begins to shiver and shake though on samson it is never cold let us sit down said roland in this secluded spot and talk have i your leave armorel to thank you he filled and lit his briarroot and lay back on the warm bank gazing upwards at the blue sky through the leaves and the twisted branches of an aged appletree it is good to be here do you know how very very good it was of you to ask me armorel and do you know how very very rash it was the girl who showed her youth and inexperience in many little ways regarded him with admiration unconcealed certainly he was a personable young man even picturesque when his beard should be a little longer when his moustache should be a little stronger he might be able to pass for charles i idealised and in early manhood when as yet he had not begun to dissimulate i was so glad when you promised to stay she replied truthfully again it is most good of you to say so but armorel a dreadful misgiving has possessed me does yourdoes the ancestress approve of the invitation armorel laughed why she said we never consult her about anything she is too old you know was nobody consulted at all did you ask me here all out of your own head as the children say why not there is nobody to consult why should i not ask you it was very good of youonlywellyou are younger than most ladies who invite people to their house wellbut i asked you she replied with a little irritation and you said you would come you asked if anybody could stay on the island yes of course he did not explain that at first he thought the place was a lodginghouse the mistake was not unnatural but he could not explain i ought to have known he said you are the queen of samson as well as a princess in lyonesse i beg your majesty to forgive the ignorance of a traveller from foreign parts justinian and peter manage the farm dorcas and chessun manage the house there is no one to ask she added simply what i am doing she said this with a touch of sadness have you no relationscousinsnobody i have some faroff cousins they live in london i believe one of them went awaya long long time ago in the great warand became a purser in the navy after that he was purveyor for the fleet and was made a knight he was my grandfathers cousin so i suppose he is dead by this time but i dare say he has left children you are very lonely armorel i had three brothers but they were all drownedfather mother three brothers all drowned together coming from st agnes that was ten years ago when i was only a little girl and did not know what it meant all our misfortunes my greatgreatgrandmother says are due to the wickedness of her husbands father who took a bag of treasure from the neck of a passenger rescued from a wreck you heard her last night do you think that god would drown my innocent brothers and my innocent father and mother all on the same day because eighty years ago that wicked thing was done no armorel i can believe a great deal but that i cannot believe and so you see i am quite alone why should i not invite you to stay here there is not in reality armorel any reason except that you did not know anything about me oh but i saw you and talked with you yes but that was not enough we do not ask people into our houses unless we know something about them i could see that you were a gentleman you are very good to think so let me try to justify that belief but armorel seriously there are thieves and rogues and wicked men in the world some of these may come to scilly do not ask another stranger believe me it is dangerous as for me you have shown me your flowerfarm and have entertained me hospitably let me thank you and take my departure go away take your departure why armorel looked ready to cry you have only just come you have seen nothing do you wish me to stay another night of course i do what is it roland lee you have got something on your mind why should you not stay i should like somebody he replied weakly to approve if the ancestress or even dorcas or chessun herself would approve why of course dorcas approves she says it is the best thing in the world for me to have someone here to talk to she said so yesterday evening and again this morning in that case armorel and since it is so delightful hereand so newand since you are so kind i will stay one more day he remembered his friends warning and the grumpiness which he showed on the way back his conscience smote him but not severely he would be very careful and after all she was but a child he would just stay the one day and make a sketch or two then he would go away that is settled then one more dayor perhaps one more week or a month or a year she said laughing and now before peter is ready i must leave you for ten minutes because i have to make a cake for your tea this evening as for dinner we shall have that in the boat or on one of the islands it is my business you know to make the puddings and the cakes armorelyou shall not i would rather go without you shall certainly not go without a cake why i like to make things it would be dull here indeed if i had not got things to do all day long do you not find it dull sometimes even with things to do perhaps sometimes i suppose we are all of us tempted to be discontented at times even when we have so many blessings as i enjoy armorel was young enough you see to talk the language of her nurses and servingwomen how do you get through the day i get up at six oclock except in winter when it is too dark i have a run with jack after breakfast we run up the hill and down the other sideround porth bay just to see the waves beating on white island ledge where you very nearly very nearly roland echoed but for you then we run up bryher hill and stand on the carn just for jack to bark at the north wind sometimes it rains oh yesand sometimes it blows such a gale of wind that i could not stand on the carn for a moment then i stay at home and make or mend something there are always things to be made or mended then we are always wanting stores of some kind or other and i have to go over to hugh town and buy them at hugh town there are shops where they keep beautiful thingsyou can buy anything you want at hugh town we cannot make pins and needles at home can we then we have dinner and granny is brought in sometimes she wakes up then and gets lively and knows everything that is going on she will talk quite sensibly for an hour at a time and i have my fiddle to practise after tea when the days are long enough i go up on the hills again and wander about till dark and do you never have any companions at all he asked with a curious unreasoning perfectly inexcusable touch of jealousy because it could not matter to him even if all the young men of st marys and bryher and tresco and st martins came over every sunday to court this dainty damsel yet he did feel the least bit anxious never any companions nobody ever comes here they used to come when granny was still able to talk in order to ask her advice she was so wise you see and every evening you make music for the ancestress and the worthy tryeth family yes and then i have supper and go to bed generally by nine oclock we are all asleep in the house it would be a monotonous life if you were older but it is only a preliminary or a preparation to something else it is the overture played in soft music to the happy comedy of your future life armorel you mean to say something kind she replied of course my life must seem dull to you one cannot always live on lovely skies and sunlit seas and enchanted islands sometimes it seems to me that a little more talk would be pleasant justinian talks very well to be sure but he is the only one he knows quantities of wrecks it would astonish you to hear him tell of the wrecks he has seen dorcas talks very little now because she has lost all her teeth chessun is a silent woman because shes always been kept under by her mother and peters not a talkative boy because hes always been kept under both by his father and his mother besides he got that nasty fall which made all his hair fall off you cant wonder if he thinks about that a good deal and they are all getting old yes they seem to be getting very old indeed some day they will follow the example of other old people and vanish then armorel you will be like robinson crusoe or alexander selkirk i know all about alexander selkirk he lived alone on juan fernandez having been put ashore by captain stradling of the cinque ports he had been four years and four months on the island when captain woodes rogers found him he was clothed in goatskin he built two huts with pimentotrees and covered them with long grass and lined them with the skin of goats he made fire by rubbing two sticks together on his knee and he lived by catching goats you mean roland lee she said with great seriousness that some day or other all these old people will diemy greatgreatgrandmother justinian dorcas and even peter and chessun and that then i shall be alone on the island that would be terrible but it will not happen in that way i am sure it will not because it would be so very terrible we are in the lords hand and it will not be allowed the young man coloured and dropped his eyes there certainly was not a single girl of all those whom he knew in london who could have said such a thing so simply and so sincerely not the youngest girl fresh from the most religious teaching could say such a thing yet they go to church a good deal oftener than armorel whose chances were only once a week and then only when the weather was fine this it is to be a scillonian and to believe what you hear in church roland had no reply to make even to hint that faith so simple and so complete was rare would have been cruel and wicked you have quoted woodes rogers he said presently have you read that good old navigator it is not often that one finds a girl quoting from woodes rogers oh i do not read much there is a bookcase full of books but i only read the voyages there is a whole row of them woodes rogers shelvocke commodore anson wallis carteret and cookand more besides i like carteret best because his ship was so small and so crazy and his men so few and so weak and yet he would keep on traversing the ocean as long as he could and discovered a great deal more than his commander who cowardly deserted him there are other things in the world besides voyagesand other books i learned the other things at school there was geographythe world is only the scilly islands spread out bigand history too you would be surprised to find what a lot of english history there is that belongs to scilly queen elizabeth built the star fortyouve seen the star fort on the garrison there is charles the firsts castle on tresco all in ruins and down below it cromwells castle which i will show you and charles the second stayed here oh and there was the spanish armada i must not forget that because of another greatgreatfaroffgreatgrandfather three hundred years ago who was wrecked here how was that he was a captain or officer of some kind on board one of the spanish ships his name was don hernando mureno after the armada was defeated and driven away some of the ships came down the irish sea and among them his shipand she ran ashore on one of the outer islandsi think on maiden bower how many were saved i cannot tell you but some were and among them don hernando mureno himself he stayed here and never wanted to go away any more but married a scillonian and lived out his life on bryher and is buried at the old church at st marys where i could show you his grave and the headstonethough the letters are all gone by this time i have his sword still and i will show it to you one of my grandfathers married his granddaughter they say i take after the spanish side you are a true castilian armorel unless indeed you happen to be an andalusian or a biscayan do you think i ought to read the other books she asked him anxiously if you really think so i will tryi will really i suppose that no young mannot even the most hardened lecturers at newnhamever becomes quite indifferent to the spectacle of venus entrusting the care of her intellect to a young philosopher it is a moving spectacle and still novel it makes a much more beautiful picture than that of venus handing over the care of her soul to the shaven and shorn roland coloured he felt at once the responsibility and the delicacy of the task thus offered him we will look into the shelves he said i suppose that the ancestress no longer reads she never learned to read at all she can neither read nor write yet there was never anyone who knew so much she could cure all diseases and the people came over here from all the islands for her advice dorcas knew a great deal but she does not know the half or the quarter of her mistresss knowledge armorelroland knocked out the ashes of his pipei think you wantvery badlysomeone to advise you will you advise me roland lee childhe slowly got upall my life so far i have been looking for someone to advise and help myself you must not lean upon a reed comelet us seek peter the boy and launch the ship and go forth upon our voyage about this sea of many islands perchance we may discover circe upon one of themunless you are yourself circeand i shall presently find myself transformed but you are too good to turn me into anything except a prince or a poet and we may light upon st brandans land or we may find judas iscariot floating on that island of redhot brass or we may chance on andromeda and witness the battle of perseus and the dragon or we may find the weeping ariadneeverything is possible on an island roland lee said the girl you are talking like your friend dick stephenson why do you say such extravagant things this is the island of samson and i am nothing in the world but armorel rosevean chapter vii a voyage of discovery all day long the boat sailed about among the channels and over the shallow ledges of the outer or western islands whither no boat may reach save on such a day so quiet and so calm the visitor who comes by one boat and goes away by the next thinks he has seen this archipelago as well stand inside a great cathedral for half an hour and then go away thinking you have seen it all it takes many days to see these fragments of lyonesse and to get a time sense of the place they sailed round the southern point of samson and they steered westward leaving great minalto on the lee towards mincarlo lying like an oldfashioned sofa high at the two ends and flat in the middle they found a landing at the southern point and clambered up the steep and rocky sides of the low hill on this island there are four peaks with a down in the middle all complete it is like a dolls island everywhere in scilly there are the same features here a hill strewn with boulders here a little down with fern and gorse and heath here a bay in which the water on such days as it can be approached peacefully laps a smooth white beach here dark caves and holes in which the water always even in the calmest day of summer grumbles and groans and when the least sea rises begins to roar and bellowin time of storm it shrieks and howls those who sail round these rumbling waterdungeons begin to think of sea monsters hidden in those recesses the awful calamary lies watching waiting his tentacles forty feet long stretching out in the green water floating innocently till they touch their prey then seizing and haling it within sight of the baleful gleaming eyes and within reach of the devouring mouth in these holes too lie the great congereelsthey fear nothing that swims except that calamary and in these recesses walk about the huge crabs which devour the dead bodies of shipwrecked sailors on the sunlit rocks one looks to see a mermaiden with glittering scales combing out her long fair tresses perhaps one may unfortunately miss this beautiful sight which is rare even in scilly but one cannot miss seeing the seals flopping in the water and swimming out to sea with seeming intent to cross the broad ocean and in windy weather porpoises blow in the shallow waters of the sounds all round the rocks at low tide hangs the long seaweed undisturbed since the days when they manufactured kelp like the rank growth of a tropical creeper at high tide it stands up erect rocking to and fro in the wash and sway of the water like the treetops of the forest in the breeze everywhere except in the rare places where men come and go the wild seabirds make their nests the shags stand on the ledges of the highest rocks in silent rows gazing upon the water below the seagulls fly shrieking in seagullic rapturethere is surely no life quite so joyous as a seagulls the curlews call the herons sail across the sky and in spring millions of puffins swim and dive and fly about the rocks and lay their eggs in the hollow places of these wild and lonely islands these things which one presently expects and observes without wonder in all the islands were new to roland when he set foot on the rugged rock of mincarlo he climbed up the steep sides of the rock and stood upon the top of its highest peak he made two or three rapid sketches of rock and sea the girl looking over his shoulder watching curiously for the first time in her life the growth of a picture illustration watching curiously for the first time in her life the growth of a picture then he stood and looked around the great stones were piled about the brown turf crept up their sides where there was space to grow the yellow branches of the fern were spread and on all four sides lay the shining water all my life he said i have dreamed of islands this is true joy armorel for a permanency samson is better than mincarlo because there is more of it but to come here sometimesto sit on this carn while the wind whistles in your ear and the waves are lapping against the rocks all day long and alwaysarmorel is there any other world are there men and women living somewhere is there anybody but you and meand peter he added hastily i dont believe in london it is a dream everything is a dream but the islands and the boat and armorel she was only a child but she turned a rosy red at the compliment nothing but the boat and herself she was very fond of the boat you see and she felt that the words conveyed a high compliment then they began to explore the rest of this mountainous island which has such a variety of scenery all packed away in the small space of twelve acres when they had walked over the whole of mincarlo that is accessible they returned to their landingplace where peter sat in the boat keeping her off with head bent as if he was asleep it must be halfpast twelve said armorel i am sure you are hungry we will have dinner here no better place for a picnic come along peter bear a hand with the basket here armorel is a rock that will do for a table and here is one on which we two can sit there is a rock for you peter now the opening of a luncheonbasket is always a moment of grave anxiety what have we got this is a rabbitpie said armorel and this is a cakepudding i made it yesterday do you like cakepudding here are bread and salt and things can you make your dinner off a rabbitpie roland lee a very good dinner too the young man now understood that on samson one uses the word dinner instead of lunch and that supper is an excellent cold spread served at eight a very good dinner armorel i mean to carve this sit down and let me see you make a good dinner an admirable rabbitpie and an excellent cakepudding also there had not been forgotten a stone jar filled with that homebrewed of which the like can no longer be found in any other spot in the british islands i hope one need do no more than indicate the truly appreciative havoc wrought by the young gentleman among all these good gifts and blessings after dinner to lie in the sunshine and have a pipe looking across the wide stretch of sunny water to the broken line of rocks and the blue horizon beyond was happiness undeserved beside him sat the girl anxious that he should be happythinking of nothing but what might best please her guest then they got into the boat again and sailed half a mile or so due north by the compass until they came within another separate archipelago of which mincarlo is an outlying companion it is the group of rocks called the outer or the western islands lying tumbled about in the water west of bryher and samson some of them are close together some are separated by broad channels here the sea is never calm at the foot of the rocks stretch out ledges some of them bare at low water revealing their ugly black stone teeth the swell of the atlantic on the calmest days rises and falls and makes white eddies broken water and flying spray among these rocks they rowed peter and roland taking the oars while armorel steered they rowed round maiden bower with its cluster of granite forts defying the whole strength of the atlantic which will want another hundred thousand years to grind them downabout and among the black rocks and the seal rocks dark and threatening they landed on ilyswillig with his peak of fifty feet a strange wild island they stood on the ledge of castle bryher and looked up at the tower of granite which rises out of the water like the round keep of a norman castle they hoisted sail and stood out to scilly himself where his twin rocks command the entrance to the islands scilly is of the dual number he consists of two great mountains rising from the water sheer precipitous and threatening each about eighty feet high but with the air of eight hundred each black and square and terrible of aspect they are separated by a narrow channel hardly broad enough for a boat to pass through one day last year said armorelit was in july after a fortnight of fine weatherwe went through this channel peter and ididnt we peter it was a dead calm and at high tide the boy nodded his head the channel was now the tide being nearly high like a foaming torrent through which the water raced and rushed boiling into whirlpools foaming and tearing at the sides the rapids below niagara are not fiercer than was this channel though the day was so fair and the sea without so quiet once said peter breaking the silence there was a ship cast up by a wave right into the fork of the channel she went to pieces in ten minutes for she was held in a vice like while the waves beat her into sticks some of the men got on to the north rockwhat they call cuckooand there they stuck till the gale abated then people saw them from bryher and a pilotboat put off for them so they were saved said roland no they were not saved peter replied slowly twas this way the pilotboat that took them off the rock capsized on the way home so they was all drowned poor beggars now if they had been brought safe ashore we might have been told what these rocks look like in rough weather and what scilly is like when you have climbed it and how a man feels in the middle of a storm on scilly you can see very well what it is like from samson said armorel the waves beat upon the rocks and the white spray flies over them and hides them i should like to hear as well as to see said roland fancy the thunder of the atlantic waves against this mass of rock the hissing and boiling in the channel the roaring of the wind and the dashing of the waves i wonder if any of these shipwrecked men had a sketchbook in his pocket to be drowned he continued just by the upsetting of a boat and after escaping death in a much more exciting manner their companions were torn from the deck and hurled and dashed against the rock so that in a moment their bones were broken to fragments and the fragments themselves were thrown against the rocks till there was nothing left of them and these poor fellows clung to the rock hiding under a boulder from the driving windcold starving wet and miserable and just as they thought of food and shelter and warmth again to be taken and plunged into the cold water there to roll about till they were drowned a dreadful tragedy having thus broken the ice peter proceeded to relate more stories of shipwreck taking after his father justinian tryeth whose conversational powers in this direction were according to armorel unrivalled there is a shipwreck story belonging to every rock of scilly and to many there are several shipwrecks as there are about as many rocks of scilly as there are days in the year the stories would take long in the telling fortunately peter did not know all it is natural however that a native of samson and the descendant of many generations of wreckers should love to talk about wrecks therefore he proceeded to tell of the french frigate which came over to conquer scilly in and was very properly driven ashore by the sea which owns allegiance to britannia and all hands lost so that the frenchmen captured no more than their graves which now lie in a triumphant row on st agnes on maiden bower he placed i know not with what truth the wreck of the spaniard which gave armorel an ancestor on mincarlo he remembered the loss of an orangeship on her way from the azores on menovaur he had seen a collier driven in broad daylight and broken all to pieces in half a day and of her crew not a man saved other things similarly cheerful he narrated slowly while the sunshine made these grey rocks put on a hospitable look and the boat danced over the rippling waves with his droning voice his smooth face with the long white hair upon it like the last scanty leaves upon a tree he was like the figure of death at the feast while armorelyoung beautiful smilingreminded her guest of life and love and hope they sailed round so many of these rocks and islets they landed on so many they lingered so long among the reefs loth to leave the wild strange place that the sun was fast going down when they hoisted sail and steered for new grinsey sound on their homeward way you may enter new grinsey sound either from the north or from the south the disadvantage of attempting it from the former on ordinary days is that those who do so are generally capsized and frequently drowned on such a day as this however the northern passage may be attempted it is the channel dangerous and beset with rocks and ledges between the islands of bryher and tresco as the boat sailed slowly in losing the breeze as it rounded the point the channel spread itself out broad and clear on the right hand rose precipitous the cliffs and crags of shipmans head which looks like a continuation of bryher but is really separated from the island by a narrow passageyou may work through it in calm weatherrunning from hell bay to the sound on the left is tresco its downs rising steeply from the water and making a great pretence of being a very lofty ascent indeed in the middle of the coast juts out a high promontory surrounded on all sides but one by the water on this rock stands cromwells castle a round tower older than the martello towers it still possesses a roof but its interior has been long since gutted in front of it has been built a square stone platform or bastion where once no doubt they mounted guns for the purpose of defending this channel against an invader as if nature had not already defended it by her ledges and shallows and hardly concealed teeth of granite to protect by a fort a channel when the way is so tortuous and difficult and where there are so many other ways is almost as if warkworth castle five miles inland on the winding coquet had been built to protect the shores of northumberland from the invading dane or as if chepstow above the muddy wye had been built for the defence of bristol there however the castle is and a very noble picture it made as the boat slowly voyaged through the sound the declining sun not yet sunk too low behind bryher clothed it with light and splendour and brought out the rich colour of grey rock and yellow fern upon the steep hillside behind beyond the castle in the midst of the sound rose a pyramidal island a pile of rocks seventy or eighty feet high on whose highest carn some of oliver cromwells prisoners were hanged according to the voice of tradition which somehow always goes dead against that strong person roland who had exhausted the language of delight among the outer islands contemplated this picture in silence do you not like it asked the girl like it he repeated armorel it is splendid will you make a sketch of it i cannot i must make a picture i ought to come here day after day there must be a good place to take it fromover there i think on that beach armorel it is splendid to think that the picture is to be seen so near to london and that no one comes to see it if you want to come day after day roland she said softly you will not be able to go away tomorrow you must stay longer with us on samson i ought not child you should not ask me why should you not stay if you are happy with us we will make you as comfortable as ever we can you have only to tell us what you want she looked so eagerly and sincerely anxious that he yielded if you are really and truly sure he said of course i am really and truly sure the weather will be fine i think and we will go sailing every day then i will stay a day or two longer i will make a picture of cromwells castleand the hill at the back of it and the water below it i will make it for you armorel but i will keep a copy of it for myself then we shall each have a memento of this daysomething to remember it by i should like to have the picture but oh rolandas if i could ever forget this day she spoke with perfect simplicity this child of nature without the least touch of coquetry why should she not speak what was in her heart never before had she seen a young man so brave so gallant so comely nor one who spoke so gently nor one who treated her with so much consideration he turned his face he could not meet those trustful eyes with the innocence that lay there he was abashed by reason of this innocence a childonly a child armorel would change in a year or two this trustfulness would vanish she would become like all other girlsshy and reserved selfconscious in intuitive selfdefence but there was no harm as yet she was a childonly a child as the sun went down the bows ran into the fine white sand of the landingplace and their voyage was ended a perfect day he murmured a day to dream of how shall i thank you enough armorel you can stay and have some more days like it chapter viii the voyagers this was the first of many such voyages and travels though not often in the outside waters for the vexed bermoothes themselves are not more lashed by breezes from all the quarters of the compass than these isles of scilly they sailed from point to point and from island to island landing where they listed or where armorel led wandering for long hours round the shores or on the hills all the islands except the bare rocks are covered with down and moorland bounded in every direction by rocky headlands and slopes covered with granite boulders they were quite alone in their explorations no native is ever met upon those downs no visitor except on st marys wanders on the beaches and around the bays they were quite alone all the day long the seabreeze whistled in their ears the gulls flew over their headsthe cormorants hardly stirred from the rocks when they climbed up the hawk that hung motionless in the air above them changed not his place when they drew near and always day after day they came continually upon unexpected places strange places beautiful places beaches of dazzling white wildly heaped carns here a cromlech a logan stone a barrowsamson is not the only island which guards the tombs of the great departeda new view of sea and sky and whitefooted rock i believe that there does not live any single man who has actually explored all the isles of scilly stood upon every rock climbed every hill and searched on every island for its treasures of ancient barrows plants birds carns and headlands once there was a worthy person who came here as chaplain to st martins he started with the excellent intention of seeing everything alas he never saw a single island properly he never walked round one exhaustively he wrote a book about them to be sure but he saw only half as for samson this person of feeble intelligence even declared that the island was not worth a second visit after that one would shut the book but is lured on in the hope of finding something new one must not ask of the islanders themselves for information about the isles because few of them ever go outside their own island unless to hugh town where is the port and where are the shops why should they on the other islands they have no business justinian tryeth for instance was seventyfive years of age hugh town he knew and had often been there though now peter did the business of the farm at the port st agnes he knew having wooed and won a wife there he had been to bryher church which is close to the shorethe rest of bryher was to him as unknown as iceland as for st martins or annet or great ganilly he saw them constantly they were always within his sight yet he had never desired to visit them they were an emblem a shape a name to him and nothing more it is so always with those who live in strange and beautiful places the marvels are part of their daily life they heed them not unless like armorel they have no work to do and are quick to feel the influences of things around them most swiss people seem to care nothing for their alps but here and there is one who would gladly spend all his days high up among the fragrant pines or climbing the slope of ice with steady step and slow but these young people did try to visit all the islands upon roland there fell the insatiate curiositythe rageof an explorer and a discoverer he became like captain cook himself he longed for more islands every day he found a new island give cries he who sails upon unknown seas and scans the round circle of the horizon for the cloudy peak of some fardistant mountain givegive more islandsstill more islands let us sail for yonder cloud let us sail on until the cloud becomes a hilltop and the hill another island largesse for him who first calls land ahead there shall we find strange monsters and treasures rare with friendly natives and girls more blooming than those of fair tahiti let us sail thither though it prove no more than a barren rock the restingplace of the sealion though we can do no more than climb its steep sides and stand upon the top while the spray flies over the rocks and beats upon our faces in such a spirit as captain carteret armorels favourite steered his frail bark from shore to shore did roland sail among those scilly seas of course they went to tresco where there is the finest garden in all the world but one should not go to see the garden more than once because its perfumed alleys its glasshouses its cultivated and artificial air are somehow incongruous with the rest of the islands as well expect to meet a gentleman in a court dress walking across fylingdale moor yet it is indeed a very noble and royal garden other gardens have finer hothouses none have a better show of flowers and trees of every kind for variety it is like unto the botanical gardens of a tropical land you might be standing in one of the alleys of the garden of mauritius or of java or the cape here everything grows and flourishes that will grow anywhere except of course those plants which carry patriotism to an extreme and refuse absolutely to leave their native soil you cannot go picking pepper here nor can you strip the cinnamontree of its bark but here you will see the bamboos cluster tall and graceful the eucalyptus here parades his naked trunk and his blue leaves here the ferntree lifts its circle of glory of lace and embroidery twenty feet high the prickly pear nestles in warm corners the aloe shoots up its tall stalk of flower and of seed the palms stand in long rows and every lovely plant every sweet flower created for the solace of man grows abundantly and hastens with zeal to display its blossoms the soft air is full of perfumes strange and familiar it is as if kew had taken off her glass roofs and placed all her plants and trees to face the english winter but then the winter of scilly is not the winter of great britain the botanist may visit this garden many times and always find something to please him but the ordinary traveller will go but once and admire and come away it is far better outside on the breezy down where the dry fern and withered bents crack beneath your feet and the elastic turf springs as you tread upon it there are other things on tresco there is a big freshwater lakeit would be a respectable lake even in westmorelandwhere the wild birds disport themselves beside it south american ostriches roam gravely after the manner of the bird it is pleasant to see the creatures there is a great cave if you like dark damp caves better than the cave there is a splendid bold coast sloping steeply from the down all round the northern part of the island then they walked all round st marys it is nine miles round but if as these young people did you climb every headland and walk round every bay and descend every possible place where the boulders make a ladder down to the boiling water below it is nine hundred miles round and for its length the most wonderful walk in all the world they crossed the broad sound to st agnes and saw st warnas wondrous cove they stood on the desolate gugh and the lonely annet beloved of puffins they climbed on every one of the eastern islands and even sailed when they found a day calm enough to permit the voyage among the dogs of scilly and clambered up the black boulders of rosevear and scared the astonished cormorants from wild goreggan one day it rained in the morning then they had to stay at home and armorel showed the house she took her guest into the dairy where chessun made the butter and scalded the creamthat rich cream which the westcountry folk eat with everything she made him stand by and help make a junket which devonshire people believe cannot be made outside the shadow of dartmoor she took him into the kitchenthe old room with its old furniture the candlesticks and snuffers of brass the bacon hanging to the joists the blue china the ancient pewter platters the long bright spita kitchen of the eighteenth century and then she took him into a room which no longer exists anywhere else save in name it was the stillroom and on the shelves there stood the elixirs and cordials of ancient time the currant gin to fortify the stomach on a raw morning before crossing the road the cherry brandy for a cold and stormy night the elderberry wine good mulled and spiced at christmastime the blackberry wine the homemade distilled waterslavender water hungary water cyprus water and the divine cordial itself which takes three seasons to complete and requires all the flowers of spring summer and autumn then they went into the best parlour and armorel opening a cupboard took out an old sword of strange shape and with faded scabbard on the blade there was a graven latin legend this is my ancestors sword she said he was an officer of the spanish armadahernando mureno was his name you are indeed a spanish lady armorel your ancestor is well known to have been the bravest and most honourable gentleman in king philips service he remained herehe would not go home he married and became a protestant she put back the sword in its place and brought forth other things to show himoldfashioned watches old compasses sextants telescopes flintandsteel pistolsall kinds of things belonging to the old days of smuggling and of piloting then she opened the bookcase it should have been filled with histories of pirates and buccaneers but it was not it contained a whole body of theology of the methodist kind roland tossed them over impatiently i dont wonder he said at your reading nothing if this is all you have but he found one or two books which he set aside as they wandered about the islands of course they talked it wants but little to make a young man open his heart to a girl only a pair of soft and sympathetic eyes a face full of interest and questions of admiration whether she tells him anything in return is quite another matter most young men when they review the situation afterwards discover that they have told everything and learned nothing perhaps there is nothing to learn in a few days armorel knew everything about her guest he had come from australiafrom that fardistant landin search of fortune he had as yet made but few friends he was unknown and without patrons he had no family connections which would help him the patrimony on which he was to live until he should begin to succeed was but small and although he held moneymaking in the customary contempt it was necessary that he should make a good deal becausewhich is often the casehis standard of comfort was pitched rather high it included for instance a good club good cigars and good claret also as he said an artist should be free from sordid anxieties art demands an atmosphere of calm therefore he must have an income this like everything that does not exist must be created man is godlike because he alone of creatures can create he and he alone constantly creates things which previously did not existan income honour rank tastes wants desires necessities habits rules and laws how can you bear to sell your pictures asked the girl we sell our flowers but then we grow them by the thousand you make every picture by itselfhow can you sell the beautiful things you must want to keep them every one to look at all your life those that you have given to me i could never part with one must live fair friend of mine he replied lightly it is my only way of making money and without money we can do nothing it is not the selling of his pictures that the artist dreadsthat is the necessity of art as a profession it is the danger that no one will care about seeing them or buying them that is much more terrible because it means failure sometimes i dream that i have become old and grey and have been working all my life and have had no success at all and am still unknown and despised in art there are thousands of such failures i think the artist who fails is despised more than any other man it is truly miserable to aspire so high and to fall so low yet who am i that i should reach the port all good painters succeed said the girl who had never seen a painter before or any painting save her own coloured engravings you are a good painter roland you must succeed you will become a great painter in everybodys estimation i will take your words for an oracle he said when i am melancholy and the future looks dark i will say thus and thus spoke armorel the young man who is about to attempt fortune by the pursuit of art must not consider too long the wrecks that strew the shores and float about the waters lest he lose selfconfidence continually these wrecks occur and there is no insurance against them yet continually other barques hoist sail and set forth upon their perilous voyage it may be reckoned as a good point in this aspirant that he was not overconfident some are wrecked at the outset he said others gain a kind of success heavens what a kind to struggle all their lives for admission to the galleries and to rejoice if once in a while a picture is sold they are not the good painters the girl of large experience again reminded him am i a good painter he replied humbly well one can but try to do good work and leave to the gods the rest there is luck in things it is not every good man who succeeds armorel to every man however there is allotted the highest stature possible for him to reach let me be contented if i grow to my full height you must roland you could not be contented with anything less to reach ones full height one must live for work alone it is a hard saying armorel it is a great deal harder than you can understand if you love your work and if you are happy in it said the girl you do not understand child most men never reach their full height you can see their pictures in the galleriespoor stunted things it is because they live for anything rather than their work they are pictures without a soul in them now when a young man holds forth in this strain one or two things suggest themselves first one thinks that he is playing a part putting on side affecting depthsin fact enacting the part of the common prig who is now methinks less common than he was if he is not a prig uttering insincere sentimentalities he may be a young man who has preserved his ideals beyond the usual age by some accident the ideals and beliefs and aspirations of young men when they first begin the study of art in any of its branches are very beautiful things and full of truths which can only somehow be expressed by very young men the third explanation is that in certain circumstances as in the companionship of a girl not belonging to society and the worlda young innocent and receptive girlwhose mind is ready for pure ideas uncontaminated by earthly touch the old enthusiasms are apt to return and the old beliefs to come back then such things may spring in the heart and rise to the lips as one could not think or utter in a london studio sincere or not this young man pursued his theme making a kind of confession which armorel could not as yet understand but she remembered women at all ages remember tenaciously and treasure up in their hearts things which they may at some other time learn to understand there was an old allegory armorel this young man went on of a young man choosing his way once for all it is an absurd story because every day and all day long we are pulled the other way sometimes it makes me tremble all over only to think of the flowery way i know what the end would be but yet armorel what can you know or understand about the way of pleasure and how men are drawn into it with ropes my soul is sometimes sick with yearning when i think of those who run along that way and sing and feast what kind of way is it roland you cannot understand and i cannot tell you the way of pleasure and the way of wealth these are the two roads by which the artistic life is ruined yet we are dragged into them by ropes you shall keep to the true path roland the girl said with glistening eyes oh how happy you will be when you have reached your full heightyou will be a giant then he laughed and shook his head again armorel i will take it from your lipsa prophecy but you do not understand no she said i am very ignorant yet if i cannot understand i can remember the way of pleasure and the way of wealth i shall remember we are told that we must not set our hearts upon the things of this world i used to think that it meant being too fond of pretty frocks and ribbons dorcas said so once since you have come i see that there are many many things that i know nothing of if i am to be dragged to them by ropes i do not want to know them the way of pleasure and the way of wealth they destroy the artistic life she repeated as if learning a lesson these ways must be ways of sin dont you think she asked looking up with curious eyes doubtless yet this is not quite the modern manner of regarding and speaking of the subject and considering what an eighteenthcentury and bourgeoislike manner it is and how fond we now are of that remarkable century one is surprised that the manner has not before now been revived when we again tie our hair behind and assume silverbuckled shoes and white silk stockings we shall once more adopt that manner it was not however artificial with armorel the words fell naturally from her lips a thing that was prejudicial to the better nature of a man must she thought belong to ways of sin againdoubtless but roland did not think of it in that way and the words startled him puritan he said but you are always right it is the instinct of your heart always to be right but we no longer talk that language it is a hundred years old in these days there is no more talk about sinat least outside certain circles there are habits it is true which harm an artists eye and destroy his hand we say that it is a pity when an artist falls into these habits we call it a pity armorel not the way of sin a pitythat is all it means the same thing i dare say so far as the artist is concerned chapter ix the last day but one the last day but one it always comes at lengthit is bound to comethe saddest the most sentimental of all days the boy who leaves schooli speak of the oldfashioned boy and the ancient schoolwhere he has been fagged and bullied and flogged on this last day but one looks round with a choking throat upon the dingy walls and the battered desks even the convict who is about to be released after years of prison feels a sentimental melancholy in gazing for the last time upon the whitewashed walls the world which misunderstands the power of temptation and is distrustful as to the reality of repentance will probably prove cold to him how much more then when one looks around on the last day but one of a holiday tomorrow we part this is the last day of companionship rolands holiday was to consist of a day or two or three at the mostyet lo the evening and the morning were the twentyfirst day there was always something new to be seen something more to be sketched some fresh excuse for staying in a house where this young man lived from the first as if he had been there all his life and belonged to the family scilly has to be seen in cloud as well as in sunshine in wind and rain as well as in fair weather one island had been accidentally overlooked another must be revisited so the days went on each one like the days before it but with a difference the weather was for the most part fine so that they could at least sail about the islands of the road every morning the young man got up at six and after a bathe from shark point walked all round samson and refreshed his soul by gazing upon the outer islands breakfast over he took a pipe in the farmyard with justinian and peter who continually talked of shipwrecks and of things washed ashore during this interval armorel made the puddings and the cakes when she had accomplished this delicate and responsible duty she came out prepared for the day they took their dinnerbasket with them and sallied forth in the afternoon they returned in the evening at seven oclock the table was pushed back the old serving people came in the fire was stirred into animation armorel played the oldfashioned tunes and the ancient lady rallied and sat up and talked her mind in the past all the days alike yet each one differing from its neighbours there is no monotony though place and people remain exactly the same when there is the semblance of variety for besides the discovery of so many curious and interesting islands this fortunate young man as we have seen discovered that his daily companion though so youngonly a childwas a girl of wonderful quickness and ready sympathy a young artist wants sympathyit is necessary for his growth sympathy interest and flattery are necessary for the artistic temperament all these armorel offered him in large measure running over she kept alive in him that faith in his own star which every artist as well as every general must possess great is the encouragement of such sympathy to the young man of ambitions this consideration is indeed the principal excuse for early marriages three weeks of talk with such a girlno one else to consider or to interruptno permission to be soughtsurely these things made up a holiday which quite beat the record three whole weeks such a holiday should form the foundation of a lifelong friendship could either of them ever forget such a holiday now it was all over for very shame roland could make no longer any excuses for staying his sketchbook was crammed there were materials in it for a hundred picturesmost of them might be called studies of armorel she was in the boat holding the tiller bareheaded her hair flying in the breeze the spray dashing into her face and the clear blue water rushing past the boat or she was sitting idly in the same boat lying in grinsey sound with shipmans head behind her or she was standing on the seaweed at low water under the mighty rock of castle bryher or she was standing upright in the low room violin in hand her face and figure crimsoned in the red firelight or she was standing in the porch between the verbenatrees the golden figurehead smiling benevolently upon her and the old ships lanthorn swinging overhead with an innocent air as if it had never heard of a wreck and knew not how valuable a property may be a cow judiciously treatedwith a lighted lanthorn between its hornson a stormy night there were other things sketches of bays and coves and headlands and carns gathered from all the islandsfrom porthellick and peninnis on st marys which everybody goes to see to st warnas cove on st agnes whither no traveller ever wendeth a very noble time no letters no newspapers no trouble of any kind yet one cannot remain for ever even in a house where such a permanent guest would be welcomed now and then it is true one hears how such a one went to a friends house and stayed there la fontaine gay and coleridge are examples but i have never heard before this case of a young man going to a house where a quite young girl almost a child was the mistress and staying there now the end had come he must go back to london where all the men and most of the women have their own shows to run and there is not enough sympathy to go round back to what the young artist he who has as yet exhibited little and sold nothing calls his workputting a capital letter to it like the young clergyman perhaps he did not understand that under the eyes of a girl who knew nothing about art he had done really better and finer work and had learned more in those three weeks than in all the time that he had spent in a studio well it was all over the sketching was ended there would be no more sailing over the blue waves of the rolling atlantic outside the islands no more quiet cruising in the road no more fishing no more clambering among the granite rocks no more sitting in sunny places looking out to sea with this bright child at his side alas and no more talks with armorel from the first day the child sat at his feet and became his disciple heloise herself was not an apter pupil she ardently desired to learn like a curious child she asked him questions all day long and received the answers as if they were gospel but no child that he had ever known betrayed blacker gaps of ignorance than this girl of fifteen consider what could she know other girls learn at school armorels schooling was over at fourteen when she came home from st marys to her desert island other girls continue their education by reading books but armorel never read anything except voyages of the last century which treat but little of the modern life other girls also learn from hearing their elders talk but armorels elders never talked other girls again learn from conversation with companions but armorel had no companions and they learn from the shops in the street the people who walk about from the church the theatre the shows but armorel had no better street than the main street of hugh town and they learn from society but this girl had none and they learn from newspapers magazines and novels but armorel had none of these no voice no sound of the outer world reached alexandra selkirk of samson juan fernandez itself was not more cut off from men and women therefore in her seclusion and her ignorance this young man came to her like another apollo or a vishnu at leasta revelation of the world of which she knew nothing and to which she never gave a thought he opened a door and bade her look within all she saw was a great company painting pictures and talking art but that was something as for what he said this young man ardent she remembered and treasured all even the lightest things the most trivial opinions he did not abuse her confidence had he been older he might have been cynical had he not been an artist he might have been flippant had he been a city man and a moneygrub he might have shown her the sordid side of the world being such as he was he showed her the best and most beautiful partthe world of art but as for these black gaps of ignorance most of them remained even after rolands visit your best friend armorel said her guest would not deny that you are ignorant of many things you have never gone to a dinnerparty or sat in a drawingroom you cannot play lawntennis you know none of the arts feminine you cannot talk the language of society oh you are a very ignorant person indeed but then there are compensations what are compensations things that make up do you mean the boat and the islands the boat is certainly something and the islands give a flavour of their own to life on samson dont they if i were talking the usual cant i should say that the chief compensation is the absence of the hollow world and its insincere society that is cant and humbug because society is very pleasant only i suppose one must not expect too much from it your real compensations armorel are of another kind you can fiddle like a jolly sailor all of the olden time if you were to carry that fiddle of yours on to the common hard at portsea not a man among them all even the decayed veteranif he still liveswho caught nelson the dying hero in his arms but would jump to his feet and shuffleheel and toe doublestep backstep flourish and fling i believe those terms are correct i am so glad you think i can fiddle you want only instruction in style to make you a very fine violinist besides there is nothing more pleasing to look at just now than a girl playing a violin it is partly fashion formerly it was thought graceful for a girl to play the guitar then the harp now it is the fiddle when it is not the zither or the banjo that is one compensation there is another i declare that i do not believe there is in all london a girl with such a genius as yours for puddings and pies cakes and biscuits i now understand that there is more wanted in this confection than industry and application it is an art every art affords scope for genius born not made the truethe really artisticadministration of spice and sugar milk eggs butter and flour requires real geniussuch as yours my child and as to the stillroom there isnt such a thing left i believe in the whole world except on samson any more than there is a spinningwheel who but yourself armorel possesses the secret long since supposed to be hopelessly lost of composing cyprus water and the divine cordial in this respect you belong to a hundred years ago when the modern ignorance was unknown and where can i findi should like to knowa london girl who understands cherry brandy and can make her own blackberry wine you want to please me roland because you are going away and i am unhappy she hung her head in sadness too deep for tears that is why you say all these fine things but i know that they mean very little i am only an ignorant girl i must always out of common gratitude want to please you but i am only speaking the bare truth then there is the delicate question of dress an ordinary man is not supposed to know anything about dress but an artist has always to consider it there are certainly other girlsthousands of other girlsmore expensively dressed than you armorel but you have the taste for costume which is far better than any amount of costly stuff chessun taught me how to sew and how to cut out but the assurance of this excellence brought her no comfort when i am gone armorel you will go on with your drawing will you not it will be seen that he endeavoured as an apostle of art to introduce its cult even on remote samson that was so and not without success the girl he discovered had been always making untaught attempts at drawing and wanted nothing but a little instruction this was a fresh discovery that you should have the gift of the pencil is delightful to think of the pencil you see is like the jinni fear you have no jinn on samsonwho could do almost anything for those who knew how to command his obedience but only made those people ridiculous who ignorantly tried to order him around if you go on drawing every day i am sure you will learn how to make that jinn obedient i will send you when i get home some simple books for your guidance promise child that you will not throw away this gift i will draw every day she replied obediently but with profound dejection then there is your reading you must read something i have looked through your shelves and have picked out some books for you there is a volume of cowper and of pope and an old copy of the spectator and there is goldsmiths deserted village i will read anything you wish me to read she replied i will send you some more books you ought to know something about the world of today addison and goldsmith will not teach you that but i dont know what to send you novels are supposed to represent life but then they presuppose a knowledge of the world to begin with you want an account of modern society as it is and the thing does not exist i will consider about it i will read whatever you send me roland when i have read all the books and learned to draw shall i have grown to my full height remember what you said about yourself i dont know armorel it is not reading but he left the sentence unfinished who is to tell meon samson she asked in the afternoon of this day roland planted his easel on the plateau of the northern hill where the barrows are and put the last touches to the sketch which he afterwards made into the first picture which he ever exhibited it appeared in the grosvenor of of course everybody remembers the picture which attracted a very respectable amount of attention it was called the daughter of lyonesse it represented a maiden in the first blossom of womanhoodtall and shapely she was dressed in a robe of white wool thrown over her left shoulder and gathered at the waist by a simple belt of brown leather a white linen vest was seen below the wool round her neck was a golden torque behind her was the setting sun she stood upon the highest of a low pile of granite boulders round the feet of which were spread the yellow branches of the fern and the faded flowers of the heather she shaded her eyes from the sun with her left hand and looked out to sea she was bareheaded the strong breeze lifted her long black hair and blew it from her shoulders her eyes were black and her complexion was dark behind her and below her was the splendour of sun and sky and sea with the western islands rising black above the golden waters the sketch showed the figure but the drapery was not complete as yet it was a study of light and colour and a portrait i dont quite know said the painter thoughtfully whether you ought not to wear a purple chiton phoenician trade must have brought phoenician luxuries to lyonesse your ancestors were tinmenrich minersno doubt the ladies of the family went dressed in the very very best i wonder whether in those days the kings daughter was barefooted the caliga i thinkthe leather sandalwould have been early introduced into the royal family on account of the spikiness of the fern in autumn and the thorns of the gorse all the year round the slaves and common people of course would have to endure the thorns he continued his work while he talked armorel making no reply enacting the model with zeal it is a strange sunset he went on as if talking to himself a day of clouds but in the west a broad belt of blue low down in the horizon in the midst of the belt the sun flaming crimson on either hand the sky aglow but only in the belt of clear above is the solid cloud grey and sulky receiving none of the colour below is also the solid sulky cloud but under the sun there spreads out a fan of light which strikes the waters and sets them aflame in a long broad road from the heavens to your feet o child of lyonesse outside this road of light the waters are dull and gloomy in the sky the coloured belt of light fades gradually into soft yellows clear greens and azure blues a strange sunset a strange effect of light armorel you see your life it is prefigured by the light overhead the sky is grey and colourless where the glow of the future does not lie on the waters they are grey and colourless nothing around you but the waste of grey sea before you black rockslife is always full of black rocks and beyond the splendid sunsoft warm and glowing you shall interpret that in your own way armorel listened standing motionless her left hand shading her eyes if the picture he went on comes out as i hope it may it will be one of those that suggest many things every good picture armorel as well as every good poem suggests it is like that statue of christ which is always taller than the tallest man nobody can ever get above the thought and soul of a good picture or a good poem there is always more in it than the wisest man knows that is the proof of genius that is why i long all day for the mysterious power of putting into my work the soul of everyone who looks upon itas well as my own soul when you come to stand before a great picture armorel perhaps you will understand what i mean you will find your heart agitated with strange emotionsyou will leave it with new thoughts when you go away from your desert island remember every day to read a piece of great verse to look upon a great picture and to hear a piece of great music as for these suggested thoughts you will not perhaps be able to put them into words but they will be there still armorel made no reply it was as if he were talking to a statue i have painted you he said with the golden torque round your neck the red gold is caught by the sunshine as for your dress i think it must be a white woollen robeperhaps a border of purplebut i dont know there are already heaps of colourcolour of sky and of water of the granite with the yellow lichen and of brown and yellow fern and of heather faded noyou shall be all in white armorel no dress so sweet for a girl as white a vest of white linen made by yourself from your own spinningwheel up to the throat and covering the right shoulder are you tired child noi like to hear you talk i have nearly donein fact he leaned back and contemplated his work with the enthusiasm which is to a painter what the glow of composition is to the writer i have done all i can until i go home the sun of scilly hath a more golden glow in september than the sun of st johns wood if i have caught arightor something like itthe light that is around you and about you armorel the sun in your left hand is like the red light of the candle through the closed fingers soi can do no morearmorel you are all glorious within and without you are indeed the kings daughter you are clothed with the sun as with a garment if the sun were to disappear this moment you would stand upon the peak for all the island to admirea flaming beacon his voice was jubilanthe had done well yet he shaded his eyes and looked at canvas and at model once more with jealousy and suspicion if he had passed over something it was an ambitious picturethe most ambitious thing he had yet attempted armorel he cried if i could only paint as well as i can see come down child you are good indeed to stand so long and so patiently she obeyed and jumped off her eminence and stood beside him looking at the picture tell me what you think said the painter you seeit is the kings daughter she stands on a peak in lyonesse and looks forth upon the waters why i know not she seeks the secrets of the future perhaps she looks for the coming of the perfect knight perhaps she expects the heaven that waits for every maidenin this world as well as in the next everyone may interpret the picture for himself she is youngeverything is possible to the young tell me armorel what do you think she drew a long breath ah she murmured i have never seen anything like this before it is not me you have painted roland you say it is a picture of mejust to please and flatter me there is my faceyet not my face all is changed roland when i am grown to my full height shall i look like this if you do when that day comes i shall be proved to be a painter indeed he replied if you had seen nothing but yourselfyour own selfand no more i would have burnt the thing now you give me hopes afterwards armorel loved best to remember him as he stood there beside this unfinished picture glowing with the thought that he had done what he had attempted the soul was there out of the chatter of the studio the endless discussions of style and method he had come down to this simple spot to live for three weeks cut off from the world with a child who knew nothing of these things he came at a time when his enthusiasm for his work was at its fiercest that is when the early studies are beginning to bear fruit when the hand has acquired command of the pencil and can control the brush and when the eye is already trained to colour it was at a time when the young artist refuses to look at any but the greatest work and refuses to dream of any future except that of the greatest and noblest work it is a splendid thing to have had even for a short time these dreams and these enthusiasms the picture is finished said armorel and tomorrow you will go away and leave me the tears welled up in her eyes why should not the child cry for the departure of this sweet friend my dear child he said i cannot believe that you will stay for ever on this desert island i do not want to leave the island i want to keep you here why dont you stay altogether roland you can paint here have we made you happy are you satisfied with our way of living we will change it for you if you wish nonoit is not that i must go home i must go back to my work but i cannot bear to think of you left alone with these old people with no companions and no friends the time will come when you will leave the place and go away somewherewhere people live and talk he reflected that if she went away it might be among people ignorant of art and void of culture this beautiful child who might have been a princessshe was only a flowerfarmer of the scilly islands what could she hope or expect i do not want to go into the world she went on i am afraid because i am so ignorant people would laugh at me i would rather stay here always if you were with me then we would do nothing but sail and row and go fishing and you could paint and sketch all the time it is impossible armorel you talk like a child in a year or two you will understand that it is impossible besides we should both grow old think of that think of two old people going about sailing among the islands for ever i like justinian tryeth bald and bowed and wrinkled you like dorcasno no you could never grow like dorcas you shall grow serenely beautifully old what would that matter she replied some day even one of us would die what would that matter either because we should only be parted by a year or two oh whether we are old or young the sea never grows old nor the hills and rocksand the sunshine is always the same and when we die there will be a new heaven and a new earthyou can read it in the book of revelationbut no more sea no more sea that i cannot understand how could angels and saints be happy without the sea if one lives among people in towns i dare say it may be disagreeable to grow old and perhaps to look ugly like poor dorcas but not no not when one lives in such a place as this where did you get your wisdom armorel is that wisdom when i go away my chief regret will be that i kept talking to you about myself men are selfish pigs we should have talked about nothing but you then i should have learned a great deal see how we miss our opportunities no no i had nothing to tell you and you had such a great deal to tell me it was you who taught me that everybody ought to try to grow to his full height did i it was only a passing thought such things occur to one sometimes she sat down on a boulder and crossed her hands in her lap looking at him seriously and gravely with her great black eyes now she said i want to be very serious it is my last chance roland i am resolved that i will try to grow to my full height you are going away tomorrow and i shall have no one to advise me give me all the help you can before you go what help can i give you armorel i have been thinking you have told me all about yourself you are going to be a great artist you will give up all your life to your work when you have grown as tall as you can everybody will congratulate you and you will be proud and happy but who is to tell me how shall i know when i am grown to my full height you have got something more in your mind armorel give me a model roland you always paint from a model yourselfyou told me so now think of the very best actual girl of all the girls you knowthe most perfect girl mind she must be a girl that i can remember and try to copy i must have something to think of and go by you know the very best actual girl i know he laughed with a touch of the abominable modern cynicism which no longer believes in girls that wouldnt help you much i am afraid you see armorel i should not look to the actual girls i know for the best girl at all there is howeverhe pulled his shadowy moustache looking very wisea most wonderful girli confess that i have never met her but i have heard of her the poets keep talking about herand some of the novelists are fond of drawing her i have heard of her read of her and dreamed of her shall i tell you about her if you pleasethat is if she can become my model perhaps she is quite a possible girl armorel like yourself that is to say a girl who may really develop out of certain qualities as for actual girls there are any number whom one knows in a wayone can distinguish themi mean by their voices their faces and their figures and so forth but as for knowing anything more about them tell me then about the girl whom you do know though you have never seen her i will if i can as for her facenow never mind her face she interrupted impatiently never mind her face as you say besides you can look in the glass if you want to know her face yes that will do said armorel simply now go on first of all then she is always well dressedbeautifully dressedand with as much taste as the silly fashion of the day allows a woman you know though she is the most beautiful creature in the whole of animated nature can never afford to do without the adornments of dress it does not much matter how a man goes dressed he only dresses for warmth in any dress and in any rags a handsome man looks well but not a woman her dress either ruins her beauty or it heightens it a woman must always and at all ages look as beautiful as she can therefore she arranges her clothes so as to set off her beauty when she is young to make her seem still beautiful when she is past her youth and to hide the ravages of time when she is old that is the first thing which i remark about this girl of course she doesnt dress as if her father was a silver king such a simple stuff as your grey nuns cloth armorel is good enough to make the most lovely dress she is always well dressed his pupil repeated that is the first thing she is accomplished of course roland added airily as if accomplishments were as easy to pick up as the blue and grey shells on porth bay she understands music and plays on some instrument she knows about art of all kindsart in painting sculptures decorations poetry literature music she can talk intelligently about art and she has trained her eye so that she knows good work she is never carried away by shams and humbug she has trained her eye and knows good work armorel repeated above all she is sympathetic she does not talk so as to show how clever she is but to bring out the best points of the man she is talking with yet when men leave her they forget what they have said themselves and only remember how much this girl seems to know seems to know armorel looked up one woman cannot know everything but a clever woman will know about everything that belongs to her own set we all belong to our own set and every set talks its own languagescientific artistic whatever it is this girl does not pretend to enter into the arena but she knows the rules of the game and talks accordingly she is always intelligent gracious and sympathetic she is intelligent gracious and sympathetic armorel repeated is she gracious to everybodyeven to people she does not like in society said roland we like everybody we are all perfectly wellbred and wellbehaved we always say the kindest things about each other now you are saying one thing and meaning another that is like your friend dick stephenson dont roland well then i have very little more to say this girl however is always a womans woman what is that difficult to explain a wise lady once advised me when i went courting first to make quite sure that the girl was a womans woman i think she meant that other girls should speak and think well of her i havent always remembered the advice it is true but here he stopped short and in some confusion remembering that this was not an occasion for plenary confession but armorel only nodded gravely i shall remember she said the rest you know she loves everything that is beautiful and good she hates everything that is coarse and ugly that is all thank youi shall remember she repeated roland you must have thought a good deal about girls to know so much he blushed he really did he blushed a rich and rosy red an artist you know he said has to draw beautiful girls naturally he thinks of the lovely soul behind the lovely face these things are only commonplaces you yourself armorelyouwill shame me presentlywhen you have grown to that full heightfor drawing a picture so insufficient of the perfect woman he stooped slightly as if he would have kissed her forehead why not she was but a child but he refrained illustration he stooped slightly as if he would have kissed her forehead let us go home he said with a certain harshness in his voice the sun is down the clouds have covered up the belt of blue you have seen your splendid future armorel and you are back in the grey and sunless present it grows cold tomorrow i think we may have rain let us go home child let us go home chapter x mr fletcher returns for his bag half an hour later the blinds were down the fire was brightly burning the red firelight was merrily dancing about the room and the table was pushed back then dorcas and justinian came inthe two old servingfolk bent with age greyheaded toothlessfollowed by chessunthin and tall silent and subdued and armorel taking her violin tuned it and turned to her old master for instructions just as she had done on the first and every following night of rolands stay barley break said justinian armorel struck up that wellknown air then as before the ancient dame started moved uneasily sat upright and opened her eyes and began to talk but tonight she was not rambling she did not begin one fragment of reminiscence and break off in the middle she started with a clear story in her mind which she began at the beginning and carried on when armorel saw her thus disposed she stopped playing barley break which may amuse the aged mind and recall old merriment but lacks earnestness put on thy smock o monday said justinian this ditty lends itself to more sustained thought armorel put more seriousness into it than the theme of the music would seem to warrant the old lady however seemed to like it and continued her narrative without interrupting it at any point armorel also observed that though she addressed the assembled multitude generally she kept glancing furtively at roland the night was terrible said the ancient dame speaking distinctly and connectedly never was such a storm knownwe could hear the waves beating and dashing about the islands louder than the roaring of the wind and we heard the minutegun so that there was little sleep for anyone at daybreak we were all on the shore out on shark point sure enough on the castinicks the ship lay breaking up fasta splendid east indiaman she was her masts were gone and her bows were stove inas soon as the light got strong enough we could see so muchand the shore covered already with wreck but not a sign of passengers or crew then my husbands father who was always first saw something and ran into the water up to his middle and dragged ashore a spar and sure enough a man was lashed to the spar when father hauled the man up he was quite senseless and he seemed dead so that another quarter of an hour would have finished him even if his head had not been knocked against a rock or the spar turned over and drowned him just as father was going to call for help to drag him up he saw a little leather bag hanging from his neck by a leather thong there were others about all the people of samsonfifty of themmen women and childrenall busy collecting the things that had been washed ashore and some up to their waists in the water after the things still floating about but nobody was looking therefore father thinking it was a dead man whipped out his knife cut the leather thong and slipped the bag into his own pocket not stopping to look at it no one saw him mindno onenot even your father justinian who was close beside him at the time ay ay said justinian if father had seen it naturally but his voice died away and roland was left to wonder what under such circumstances a native of samson would have done no one saw it father thought the man was dead but he wasnt presently he moved then they carried him up the hill to the farmthis very houseand laid him down before the firejust at your feet armoreland i was standing by get him a cordial says father so we gave him a dram and he drank it and opened his eyes he was a gentlemanwe could see thatnot a common sailor not a common man here her head dropped and she seemed to be losing herself again try her with a saraband said justinian as if a determined effort had to be made armorel changed her tune a saraband lends itself to a serious and even solemn turn of thought as a dance it requires the best manners the bravest dress and the most dignified air it will be seen therefore that to a mind bent upon a grave narrative of deeds lamentable and fateful the saraband played in a proper frame of mind may prove sympathetic the ancient lady lifted her head strengthened by the opening bars which indeed are very strong and resumed her story armorel to be sure and all her hearers knew the history well having heard it every night in disjointed bits the tale of the stolen treasure was familiar to her it was more than familiarit was a bore the family doom seemed unjust to her it disturbed her sense of providential benevolence yet she threw all her soul into the saraband in order to prolong by a few minutes the waking and conscious moments of this remote ancestress a striking illustration had the others understood it of filial piety but i was standing close by father she went oni was beside him on the beach and i saw it i saw him cut the thong and slip the bag into his pocket when he came to himself i whispered to father theres his bag youve got his bag in your pocket i know he said rough hold your tongue girl so i said no more but waited then the man opened his eyes and tried to sit up but he couldnt being still dizzy with the beating of the waves but he looked at us wondering where he was you are ashore master said father the only one of all the ships company that is so far ashore he asked ay ashore where else would you be your ships in splinters your captain and your crew are dead men all but youre ashore with that the man shut his eyes and lay quiet for a time then he opened them again where am i he asked you are on samson in scilly i told him then he tried to get up again but he couldnt and so we carried him upstairs and laid him on the bed he was in bed for nigh upon six weeks never was any man so near his latter end i nursed him all the time he had a fever and his head wandered in his rambling he told me who he was his name was robert fletcherrobert fletcher she repeated nodding to roland with strange significance a brave gentleman and handsome and wellmannered he had been in the service of an indian king and though he was only thirty he had made his fortune and was bringing it home thinking that he would do nothing more all his life but just sit down and enjoy himself all his fortune was in the bag when he recovered he told me that the last thing he remembered before he was washed off the ship was feeling for the safety of his bag and it was gone and he was a beggar poor man and i knew all the time where the bag was and who had it but i could not tell him if father sinned when he kept the bag i sinned as well because i knew he kept it if father was punished when his son was drowned that son was my husband and i was punished too she stopped and it seemed as if for the evening she had run down but armorel stimulated her again and she went on looking more and more at the face of the stranger that was in their gates while he lay ill and was like to die father was uneasyi know why he wanted him to die because then he could keep the treasure with a quiet mind alls ours that comes ashore thats what we used to say he never confessed his thoughtsbut i who knew what was in the bag guessed them very well the stranger began to recover and father fell into a gloomy fit and would go and sit by himself for hours nobody dared ask himfor he was a man of short temper and rough in his speechwhat was the matter with him but i knew very well he was gloomy because he didnt want to lose that bag but the man got better and at last quite well and one morning he came down dressed in clothes that father lent him because his own were ruined in the washing of him ashore and he bade us all farewell captain rosevean he said very earnestly when i left india i was rich i was carrying all my fortune home with me in a small compass for safety as i thought i was going to be a rich man and work no more welli have escaped with my life and that is all if i were not a beggar i would offer you half my fortune for saving my life as it is i can offer you nothing but my gratitude so he shook hands with father who stood as white as a sheet for all he was a ruddyfaced man and inclined to brandy and farewell mistress ursula he said farewell my kind nurse so he kissed me being a courteous gentleman i shall come back again to see you he said i shall surely come back look to see me some day when you least expect me so he went away and they rowed him over to the port and he sailed to penzance father went to his own room where the treasure was and my heart sank heavy as lead the more i thought of the wickedness the heavier fell my heart there was father and his son my husband and myself and my own son not yet born the hand of the lord would be upon us for that wickedness i ought to have cried out to the stranger before he went away that his treasure was safe and that we were keeping it for him but i didnt then i tried to comfort myself i said that when he came again i would give him back the bag even if i had to steal it from fathers chest it was a long time agothey are all gone swallowed up by the seawhich was right because we stole the treasure from the sea he never came back i looked for him to come after my husband was drowned and after my son went too and my grandsonbut he never came again as he promised and at last at lasther voice rose almost to a shriek and everybody jumped in his chair but armorel continued to play the saraband slowly and with much expressionat last he has come back and we are saved all that are left of us are saved armorel my child you are saved your bones shall not lie rotting among the seaweed your flesh shall not be devoured by crabs and congereels you may sail without fear among the islands for he has kept his promise and has come back then she roseshe who had not stood upon her feet for three yearsactually rose and stood up or seemed to stand the red light playing on her face made her eyes shine like two balls of fire you she cried pointing her long skinny finger at roland you oh you have come at last you have suffered all that innocent blood to be shed but you have come at last she sank back among her pillows but her finger still pointed at the stranger sir she said now with tremulous voice you are welcome late though it is mr fletcher you are welcome when you came a day or two ago i wondered being now very old and foolish if it was really you now i know i remember though it is nearly eighty years ago you are welcome again to samson mr fletcher you find me changed no doubt i knew you would keep your promise and come again some time or other as for you i see little change you are dressed differently and when you were here last your hair was worn in another fashion but you are no older to look at you are not changed at all by time you would not know me again how should you i suppose you knewsomebody told you perhapsthat the bag was safe after all that knowledge has kept you young nothing short of that knowledge could have kept you young i assure you sir had i known where to find you i would have taken the bag and its contents to you long long ago and now you are come back in search of it it was eighty years ago dorcas whispered to chessun shuddering he must be more than a hundred a hundred years returned her daughter with pallid cheeks it isnt in nature he looks no more than twenty mother is he a man and alive pretend that you are mr fletcher whispered armorel do not contradict her say something it is a long time ago said roland i should have kept my promise much sooner and as for that bagyou saved my life you know pray keep the bag it has long been forgotten keep the bag do you know what is in it do you know what it is worth that mr fletcher is your politeness we who have suffered so much from the possession of the bag cannot believe that you have forgotten it because if we have suffered for our guilt you must have suffered through that guilt else there would be no justice no justice at all unless you have suffered too else all those lives have been wasted and thrown away the old lady spoke with the voice and firmness of a woman of fifty she looked strong she sat up erect armorel played on now softly now loudly the servingfolk looked on openmouthed the women with terror undisguised was this gentleman so young and so pleasant none other than the man whose injury had brought all these drownings upon the family nearly eighty years ago that happened then he must be a ghost what else could he be no human creature could come back after eighty years still so young when i said madam roland explained that i had forgotten the bag what i meant was that after losing it so long i had quite abandoned all hope of finding it again i assure you that i have not come here in search of it in fact i thought it was lying at the bottom of the sea where so many other treasures lie it is not at the bottom of the sea mr fletcher you shall have it again tomorrow you are still so young that you can enjoy your fortune make good use of it sir and do not forget the poor i have counted the contents again and again they are not things that wear out and rust are they no no you must often have laughed to think that the moth and the worm cannot destroy that treasure you will be very pleased to have it back i shall be very pleased indeed he echoed to have my treasure again face and voice unchanged the old lady shook her head and after eighty years it is a miracle yet not a greater miracle than the vengeance which has pursued this house so long this single crime has been visited upon the third and fourth generation tis time that punishment should cease at lastcease at last i must tell you mr fletcher she went on that when my husband was drowned and my fatherinlaw died i took possession of the bag and everything else i said nothing to my son why because until the owner of the stolen bag came back the curse was on him and his children nono i would not let him know but i knew very well what would happen to all of them oh yes i knew and i waited but he was happy and his son and his grandson and his greatgrandson until they were drowned one after the other and still you stayed away madam had i known i would have returned fifty years ago and more in time to have saved them all you might have come sooner sir permit me to say and so have saved some it was wonderful how erect the old lady held herself and with what firmness and precision she spoke there is now only one leftthe child armorel tomorrow sir you shall have your bag again once more you are our guest this time i hope you will leave a blessing instead of a curse upon the house at this moment armorel ceased playing then this ancient lady stopped talking she looked round her eyes lost their fire her face its expression her mouth its firmness she fell back in her pillows and her head dropped dorcas and chessun rose and carried her to her own room the old man got up too and shambled out armorel pushed the table into its place and lit the candles the incident was closed in the morning the old lady had forgotten everything almost said roland she has made me believe that my name is fletcher shall i tomorrow morning ask her for the bag where is that bag armorel it is a true story i am quite certain of it oh yes it is true justinian knows about the wreck though it happened before he was born mr fletcher was the only man saved of all the ship and companycaptain officers crew and passengersthe only one he was rescued by captain rosevean himself and brought here he had the bedroom where you sleepthe bedroom which was my brother emanuels room here he lay ill a long time but recovered and went away and the bag i know nothing about the bag that has gone long ago i suppose with all the money that my people made by smuggling and by piloting i have seen her watching you for some days past i thought she would speak to you last night tomorrow she will have forgotten everything i suppose i have some kind of resemblance to mr robert fletcher presumably deceased wellbut armorel this is a fortunate evening the family luck has come backi have brought it back the ancient one said so and you are saved she may call me fletchercall me tryethcall me any name that flyethif she only calls me him who arrived in time to save you armorel chapter xi rolands letter roland went away like mr robert fletcher he promised to return and like her greatgreatgrandmother but for other reasons armorel treasured this promise also like mr robert fletcher now presumably deceased roland went away with the sense of having left something behind him not his heart dear reader a young man of twentyone does not give away his heart in the oldfashioned way any longer he carries it about with him carefully kept in its proper place what roland had left behind him for awhile was a part of himself it would perhaps come back to him in good time but for the present it remained on samson and discoursed to the rest of him in london whenever he would listen on the beauties of that archipelago and the graces of the child armorel and this part of himself which haunted samson made him sit down and write a letter it would have been a tender a sorrowful an affectionate letter had it not been for that other part of himthe greater partwhich went to london that other part of him remonstrated she is but a simple country girl it said her future will be to marry a simple scillonian why disturb her mind why seek to plant the seeds of discontent under the guise of culture leave herleave her to herself forget those dark eyes in whose depths there seemed to lie so sweet so great a soul believe me there was nothing at all behind those eyes but ignorance and curiosity how could there be anything leave her in peace or since you must write let it be a cold letterfriendly but fatherlyand let her understand clearly that the visit can produce no further consequences whatever thus the london half of himthe bigger half perhaps his friend dick stephenson remonstrated in the same strain but the lesser half insisted on writing a letter of some kindand had his way he wrote a letter and sent it off it was the very first letter that had ever been sent to samson of that i am quite sure no letters ever reached that island if people had business with samson they transacted it at the port with justinian or peter of course it was the first letter that had ever been received by armorel peter brought it across for her he had wrapped the unaccustomed thing in brown paper for fear the spray should fall upon it armorel drew it forth from its covering and gazed upon it with the wonder of a child who gets an unexpected toy she read over the address a dozen times miss roseveanlook at it dorcas what a pity you cannot read miss roseveanhe might have written armorelisland of samson scilly of course it is from roland no one else would write to me then she opened it carefully so as not to injure any part of the writingindeed roland possessed that desirable but very rare gift of a very beautiful hand no penman of the monastery no scrivener of a later age no arab or persian scribe could write a more beautiful hand it was a hand in which every letter was clearly formed as if it made a picture of itself and every word was a group like the eastern isles of scilly to be admired by the whole world the letter beganthe london portion conceding so muchwith a penandink sketch of the writers head if it was just a little idealised who shall blame the limner this was delightful armorel had no portrait of her friend what would follow after such a beautiful beginning then the writing began and armorel addressed herself seriously to the mastering of and the meaning of the letter i blush to record the fact but armorel read handwriting slowly consider since she left school she had seen none while at school she had seen little people easily forget such a simple thing though we who write all day long cannot understand how a man can forget how to write yet there are many workingmen who cannot read handwriting nor can they themselves write they have had no occasion all their lives to use either accomplishment and so have readily forgotten ita fact which shows the profound wisdom of the school boards in teaching spelling armorel could read the letter but she read it slowly it seemed when she read it first sentence by sentence a really beautiful letterregarded as a letter in the abstract after she had read it two or three times over and had mastered the whole document she began to understand that the writer of it was not the man she remembered not the man whose memory she loved and cherished not at all her friend roland lee all the old camaraderie was gone it was the letter of another man altogether it was cold and stiff the coldness went to the girls heart she had never known roland to be cold where was the sympathy which formerly flowed in magnetic currents from one to the other where was the brotherly interestshe called it brotherly the writer spoke it is true with gratitude overwhelming of his stay on the island and her hospitality but good gracious armorel wanted no thanks his visit had made her happy he knew that why should he take up a page and a half in returning thanks to her when her own heart was full of gratitude to him he said that the three weeks he had spent among the islands had been a holiday which he could never forgetthis was very good so far but then he spoiled all by adding that he should not readily forgetreadily forget he wrotehis fair companion and guide among those labyrinthine waters fair companion what had fairness to do with it armorel had been his pupil he taught her all day long she did not want to be called his fair companion that was mockery she wanted to be called his dear friend or his dear sister that would have gone straight to her heart she expected at least so much when she opened the letter but worsefar worsewas to follow he actually spoke of the possibilities of their never meeting again the world outside scilly being so very wide never to meet again and he had promised to return he had faithfully promised why he had only to take the steamer from penzance samson island would not sail away why did he not rather say when he was to be expected worst of all he spoke of her forgetting him oh how could she forget him as for the rest of the letter the paternal advice to continue in the path of industry and so forth no clergyman in the pulpit could speak more wisely but these things touched not the girl woman wants affection rather than wisdom even though she understands or has at least been told that wisdom delivereth from the way of the evil man armorel at length laid the letter down with a sigh and a tear she kept it in her pocket for some days and read it every day but with increasing sadness finally she laid it in a drawer where were all the sketches fragments of illustration and outline drawings which roland had given her she would read it no longer she would wait till roland came back and she would ask him what it meant perhaps it was the way of the world to be so cold and so constrained in letterwriting there came a box with the letter it contained booksquite a large number of booksselected by roland with the view of suiting the case of one who dwells upon a desert island it was just as if captain woodes rogers had left alexander alone upon juan fernandez and gone home to make up for him a parcel of books intended to show him what went on in the wider world there were also drawing materials colours brushes pencils books of instruction and books of music roland the fatherlythe london part of rolandneglected nothing that might be solidly serviceable to the young person observe here one of those black gaps of ignorance already spoken of in this girl of the lonely isles she did not know that an answer to the letter was absolutely necessary in the london studio the writer sat wondering why no answer came he had been so careful too not a word which could be misunderstood he had been so truly fatherly and yet no reply nobody was at hand to tell armorel that she must sit down and write some kind of an answer she tried in fact she made several attempts but she could not write anything that satisfied her the coldness of the letter chilled her she wanted to write as she had talked with himall out of the fulness of her heart how could she write to this frigid creature the writer of such a letter could not be her dear companion who laughed and made her laugh sang and made her sing made pictures for her told her all about his own private ambitions and had no secrets from her it was a strange man who wrote to her and signed the name of roland lee the real roland would never have hinted at the possibility of her forgetting him or at the chance of their never meeting again the real roland would have written to say when he was coming again she could not reply to this impostor therefore she never answered that letter at all and so she got no more letters it was a pity because had she written what was in her mind for very pity the real roland would have returned to her once and once only the voice of roland came to her across the seaand then it was a changed voice he spoke no more but he would come again he said he would come again every day she sat on the hill beside the barrow and gazed across the road she could see the pier of hugh town and the vessels in the port perhaps roland had come over from penzance by the morning steamer and would shortly sail across the road and leap out upon the beach and run to meet and greet her with both hands outstretched the light of affection in his eyes and the laugh of welcome in his voice she was graver and more silent than before she did not sing so often as she walked among the ferns she did not prattle to chessun and dorcas while she made her cakes and puddings but nobody noticed any change in her the servingwomen if they observed any would have said only that armorel was growing into a woman already the autumn changed to winter roland would not come in winter when the sea is stormy and there is little sunshine she must wait now until spring meantime on samson where are no trees except those wizened and crooked little trees of the orchard there is not much to mark the winter except the cold wind and the short days here there is never frost or snow hail or ice the brown turf is much the same in december as in august the dead fern is not so yellow the dead and dying leaves of the bramble are not so splendid the wind is colder the sky is more grey otherwise winter makes little difference in the external aspect of this archipelago when the short days begin the brown fields of the flowerfarms clothe themselves with the verdure of spring before the new year has fairly set in some of the fresh delicate flowers have been already cut and laid in the hothouse to be sent across to covent garden the harvest of the year begins with its first day and they reap it from january to may there are plenty of things on such a farm for a girl to do armorel did not if you please sit down to weep but she daily recalled with tender regret every one of the pleasant days of that companionship she kept her promise too she read something every morning in the books which roland had sent her every afternoon she attempted to carry on the drawing lesson by herself she practised her violin diligently and every evening she played the old tunes to the old lady and awakened her once more to life and memory there was no change except that everything now was coloured by what he had said she was to grow to her full heighthe had told her howbut at present she hardly saw her way to carrying out those instructions her full height ignorant of the truthsince such a girl grown to her full height would be so tall as to be out of all proportion not only to samson but even to st marys itself sometimes one falls into the habit of associating a single person with an idea a thought an anticipation a place whenever the mind turns to this thought the person is present for example there is a street in london which i have learned from long habit to associate with a secondhand bookseller he was a gentle creature full of reading who had known many men i sometimes sat at the back of his shop conversing with him sometimes a twelvemonth would pass without my seeing him at all but always when i think of this street i think of this old gentleman the other day i passed through it alas the shutters were up the house was to let my gentle friend was gone armorel associated her futurethe unknown futurewith roland suppose that when that future should be the present she should find the shutters up the house deserted the tenant dead the harvest of flowers was well begun the boxes piled in the hold of the steamer merrily danced in the roll of the atlantic waves as the lady of the isles made her way to penzance in london the delicate narcissus and the jonquil returned to the dinnertables and stood about in glasses roland lee bought them and took them home to his studio where he sat looking at them reminded of armorelwho had never even answered his letter perhaps the flowers came from samson why did the girl send him no answer to his letter then his memory went back to that little island with its two hills and its barrows and the quiet houseand to the girl who lived there on what rock of samson was she sitting where was she at that moment gazing somewhere over the wild waste of waters the wind blowing about her curls and the beating of the waves in her ears she had forgotten him why not he was only a visitor of a week or two she was nothing but a childand an ignorant farmergirl living in a desert island ignorant no that was not the word he saw her once more standing in the middle of the room the ruddy firelight in her eyes and on her cheeks playing singletons slip and prince ruperts march while the ancient lady mopped and mowed and discoursed of other days and again he saw her standing on the beach when he said farewell the tears in her eyes her voice choked then he longed again as he had longed then to take her in his arms even in the presence of peter the boy to soothe and kiss her and bid her weep no more because he would never never leave her so strong was the impression made upon this young man by this child of fifteen that after six months spent in the society of many other girls of charms more matured he still remembered her and thought of her with that kind of yearning regret which is perilously akin to love an untaught ignorant girlwhose charm lay in her innocent confidence her soft black eyes and the beauty of the maiden emerging from the childcould hardly make a permanent impression on a man of the world even a young man of only twentyone the time would go on and the girl would be forgotten except as a pleasant memory associated with a delightful holiday an artist is perhaps above his fellows liable to swift and sudden changes his mind dwells continually on beauty all lovely girls have not black hair and black eyes apollo himself the god of artists loved not only all the nine muses and all the three graces but a good many nymphs and princesses as wellsuch is the artistic temperament so catholic is its admiration of beauty chapter xii the change a change said roland will surely come and that before long i cannot believearmorel remembered the words afterwardsthat you will stay on this island for ever it needed no unusual gift of prophecy to foretell impending change when the most important member of the household was nearing her hundredth year the change foretold actually came in april when the flowerfields had lost their beauty and the harvest of scilly was nearly over late blossoms of daffodil still reared their heads among the thick leaves though their blooming companions had all been cut off to grace london tables there were broad patches of wallflower little regarded the leaves of the bulbs were drooping and already turning brown these were the signs of approaching summer to the scillonian who has already had his spring on the adjacent island of great britain the primrose clustered on the banks the hedges of the west country were splendid putting forth tender leaves over a wealth of wild flowers the chestnutbuds were swollen and sticky ready to burst do we not know the signs and tokens of coming spring on scilly the lengthening daythere are no hedges and no trees to speak ofthe completion of the flower harvest and the drooping of the daffodilleaves in the fields are the chief signs of spring yet there are other signs if there are no woods to show the tender leaf of spring there are the green shoots of the fern on the down and there are the birds the puffin has already come back he comes in his thousands he arrives in april and he departs in september whence he cometh and whither he goeth no man hath ever learned nor can naturalist discover at the same time comes the guillemot and sometimes the solangoose the tern and the sheerwater come too if they come at all in spring but the wild ducks and the wild geese depart before the flowerharvest is finished armorel got up one morning in april a little earlier than usual it was five oclock the sun was rising over telegraph hill on st marys she ran down the stairs opened the door and stood on the porch drawing a deep breath no one was as yet stirring on samson though i think peter was beginning to turn in his bed out at sea armorel saw a great steamer homeward bound perhaps an australian liner the level rays of the early sun shone on her spars and made them stand out clear and fine against the sky behind her streamed her long white cloud of smoke and steam hanging over the water light and feathery there were no other ships visible the air was cold but the sun of april was already strong armorel shivered caught her hat and ran over the hill singing as she went not knowing that in the night while she slept the angel of death had visited the house about seven oclock she came back having completely circumnavigated the island of samson and made as usual many curious observations and discoveries in the manners and customs of puffins terns and shags she returned in the cheerful mood which belongs to youth health and readiness for breakfast she instantly perceived however on arriving that something had happenedsomething unusual for peter stood in the porch what was peter doing in the porch at seven oclock in the morning when he ought to have been ministering to the pigs further peter was standing in the attitude of a boy who waits to be sent on an errand it is an attitude of expectant readinessof zeal according to dutyof activity bought and freely rendered you will observe this attitude in all office boysexcept telegraphboys they never assume it they affect no zeal they betray no eagerness to put in a fair days work such an attitude would lack the dignity due to a government officer and at sight of armorel peter hung his head as one who sorrows or is ashamed or repentant what did he do that for what had happened why should he hang his head she asked these questions of peter who only shook his head and pointed within she heard justinians voice giving some directions she also heard dorcas and chessun they were all three speaking in low voices she hurried in the door of the old ladys bedroomthat sacred apartment into which no one except the two handmaidens had ever venturedstood wide open not only that but justinian himself was in the roomactually in the roomand beside the bed then armorel understood what had happened on no other condition would justinian be admitted to his old mistresss room on the other side of the bed stood dorcas and chessun seeing armorel at the door these two ladies instantly lifted up their voices and wailed aloudnay they shrieked and screamed their lamentations as if it was the first time in the worlds history that death had carried off an aged woman this they did by a kind of instinct the thing though they knew it not was a survival in ancient times it was the custom in lyonesse that the women should all wail and weep and shriek and beat their breasts and tear their hair and cut their cheeks with their nails while the body of the dead king or warrior was carried up the slope of the hill to be laid in its kistvaen and covered with its barrow on samson island they wailed aloud then because it had always been the right thing for the women of samson to do otherwise when one so ancient dies at last mind and memory gone before what place is there for wailing and weeping one natural tear we drop for all must die but grief belongs to the deathbed of the young there needed no shriek of the women nor anyones speech to tell armorel that the white face upturned on the bed was not the face of a living woman they had folded the dead hands across her breast the eyes were closed the countless wrinkles of the aged face were smoothed out the lips were parted with a wan smile after many many years ursula the widow was gone to rejoin her husband pray heaven her desire be granted and that she rise again young and beautifulsuch a woman as that illstarred sailor dragged to the bottom of the sea by the weight of robert fletchers bag had loved in life peter presently sailed across the road and returned with the doctor it is the part of the doctor not only to usher the newborn into life but to bar or open the gates of the tomb without him very few of us die and without him no one can be buried this man of science graciously expressed his willingness to acknowledge though he had not been called in that the deceased died of old age then he went back in the evening there was no music the violin remained in its place the great chair was empty no one brought out the spinningwheel the table was not pushed back how was the long evening to be got through without the violin how could those ancient tunes be played any more in the presence of that empty chair when the servingfolk came in as usual and sat round the fire and the women sighed and moaned and justinian stimulated the coals to a flame and the ruddy light played upon their faces armorel began to think that a continuance of these evenings would be tedious then they began to talk the conversation naturally turning on death and judgment and the prospects of heaven and the departed she was not one of them said dorcas as would never talk of such things ive often heard her say she wanted to rise again young and beautiful same as she was when her husband was took so that he should love her again nay said justinian thats foolish talk theres neither marrying nor giving in marriage there you ought to know so much dorcas husbands and wives will know each other i doubt not if its only for the mans forgiveness after the many crosses and rubs twould be a pity wife if we didnt know each other golden crown and all id be sorry to think you were not about somewhere armorel listened without much interest she wondered vaguely how dorcas would look in a golden crown and hoped that she might not laugh when she should be permitted to gaze upon her thus wonderfully adorned then she listened in silence while these thinkers followed up their speculations on the next world and the decrees of heaven with the freedom of their kind a strangely brutal freedom it consigns without a thought of pity the majority of mankind to a doom which they are too ignorant to realise and too stupid to understand the deceased lady it was agreed might perhapsthough this was by no means certainhave fallen under conviction of sin at some remote period before any of them knew her not since that was certain and as for her husband he was cut off in his sinslike all the roseveans struck down in his sins without a warning so that if the old lady expected to meet him after their separation of nearly eighty years on the shores of everlasting praise she would certainly be disappointed because he was otherwise situated and disposed of therefore she might just as well go up old and wrinkled this kind of talk was quite familiar to armorel and generally meant nothing to her the right of private judgment is claimed and freely exercised in scilly where that branch of the church catholic called bryanite greatly flourishes formerly she would have passed over this talk without heeding now she had begun to think of these as well as of many other things rolands words on religious things startled her into thinking she listened therefore wondering what view people like roland lee would take of her greatgrandfathers present condition and of the poor old ladys prospects of meeting him again then her thoughts wandered from these nebulous speculations and she heard no more though the conversation became lurid with the flames of tartarus and these old religioners gloated over the hopeless sufferings of the condemned a sweet and holy thing indeed has mankind made of the gospel of great joy before they separated chessun rose and left the room noiselessly armorel had no experience of the situation but she knew that something was going to be done something connected with the impending funeralsomething solemn in fact chessun returned after ten minutes or a quarter of an hour the others making a pretence of expecting nothing doctrinal meditation was written on justinians brow resignation on that of dorcas chessun bore in her hands a tray with glasses and a silver tankard filled with something that steamed it was a posset made with biscuits new milk and sherry nutmeg and sugaran emotional drink strong sweet comforting very good for mournful occasions but of late years unfortunately gone out of fashion they all had a glass the two women moaning over their glasses and the old man shaking his head then they went to bed they had a posset every night until the funeral they buried the ancient dame on bryher a boat carried the coffin across the water to the landingplace in new grinsey sound behind which stands the little old church with its churchyard armorel and her household followed in one of the family boats as in a mourningcarriage all the people of tresco and bryher were present at the funeral and most of them came across to samson after the ceremony to drink a glass of wine and eat a slice of cake the women no longer wailing and the men no longer shaking their heads all the roseveans who have escaped the vengeance of mr fletchers terrible bag lie in bryher churchyard they are mostly widows poor things they sleep alone because their husbands bones lie about among the tall weeds in the tranquil depths of the ocean and armorel looking forward thought with terror of the long silent evenings while the old servingfolk would sit round in the firelight silent or saying things that might as well have been left unsaid chapter xiii armorels inheritance you are now the mistress dearie said dorcas it is time that you should learn what that means it was the morning after the funeralthe day of accessionthe beginning of the new reign why dorcas it makes no difference does it there are still the flowers and the house and everything yestheres everything the old woman nodded her head meaningly oh yesthere is everything oh you dont knowyou dont suspectnobody knowswhat a surprise is in store for you what surprise dorcas youve never been into her room except to see her lying dead its your room now you can go in whenever you like always the master or the mistress has slept in that room when her fatherinlaw died she took the room and shes slept in it ever since and no one except me and chessun to clean up and sweep and dust has ever been in that room since and now its yours well dorcas it may be mine but i shall go on sleeping in my own room then keep it lockedkeep it locked upday and night theres nobody in samson to dreadbut keep it locked as for sleeping in it time enough perhaps when you come to marry but keep it locked why dorcas what is in it i am seventyfive years old and past dorcas went on i was fifteen when i came to the house and here ive been ever since not one of the grandchildren nor the greatgrandchildren ever came in here no one ever knew what is kept here what is it then armorel asked again she used to come here alone by daylight regularly once a month she locked the door when she came in no one ever knew what she was doing and no one ever asked one day she forgot to lock the door and by accident i opened it and saw what she was doing what was she doing shed opened all the cupboards and boxes and shed spread out all the things and was counting andno noyou may guess when you have looked for yourself what she was doing i shut the door softly and she never knew that id looked in upon her she might have been overseen from the orchard but no one ever went in there except to gather the fruit to make safe however ive put up a muslin blind now because peter might take it into his headboys go everywhere peering and prying nobody knows what i saw i never even told justinian men blab you see they get together and they drinkthen they blab you can never trust a man with a secret how long would it be before peter would let it out if he knew once over at hugh town drinking at a bar and all the world would know in half an hour no no the secret was hers it was mine as wellbut that was an accidentshe never knew that now it will be yours and mine and we will tell nobodynobody at all where shall i find this wonderful secret dorcas wherever you look dearie oh the room is full of things there cant be such another room in all the world its crammed with things look everywhere if they knew all the young lords and princes would be at your feet armorel because you are so rich best keep it secret though and get richer i so rich dorcas you are joking noyou shall look and find out not that you will understand at firstbecause how should you know the value of things heres her bunch of keys she always carried them in her pocket and at night she kept them under her pillowsand there i found them sure enough when she was cold and dead take them child i never told her secretnonot even to my own husband take the keys child they are yoursyour own you can open everything you can look at everything you can do what you like with everything its your inheritance but tell no one she repeated earnestly oh my dear let it remain a secret dont let anyone see you when you come in here lock the door as she didand keep it locked the old woman led armorel by the hand to the door of the room where there was to be found the great surprise she opened it placed a bunch of keys in her hand pushed her in and closed it behind her whispering lock it and keep it locked the girl turned the key obediently wondering what would happen next the room was on the ground floor looking out upon the orchard with a northern aspect so that the sun could only shine in for a small portion of the year during the summer months the appletrees were now in blossom the white pink and flowers bright in the sunshine contrasting with the grey lichen which wrapped every branch and hung down like ribbons the room was the oldest part of the house the only remaining portion of an earlier house it was low and small the fireplace had never been modernised it stood wide open with its dogs and its broad chimney the window was of three narrow lights one of which could be opened all were still provided with the old diamond panes in their leaden setting armorel observed the muslin blind put up by dorcas to keep out prying eyes in dull and cloudy days the room would be gloomy as it was even with the bright sunshine out of doors the air seemed cold and oppressiveperhaps from the fresh association of death armorel shivered as she looked about her the greater part of the room was taken up by a large bed in the old ladys time it had curtains and a head and things at the four corners like the plumes of a hearse but in faded crimson then it looked splendid now the bed had been stripped curtains and plumes and all were gone and only the skeleton bed left with its four great solid posts and its upper beams and its feather bed lying exposed with the bare pillowcases upon the mattress but the bedstead was magnificent without its trappings because it was made of mahogany black with age they no longer make such bedsteads there was also a tablean old black tablewith massive legs but there was nothing on it between door and wall there was a row of pegs with a chair beneath them now by some freak of chance when dorcas and chessun hung up the ancient dames things for the last timeher great bonnet and the cap of many ribbons within it and her silk dressthey arranged them so as to present a most extraordinary presentment of the venerable lady herselfmuch elongated and without any face she seemed to be sitting in the chair below the pegs dressed as usual and nodding her great bonnet but pulled out to eight or ten feet in length armorel caught the ghostly similitude and started trembling it seemed as if in a moment the wrinkled old face with the hawklike nose and the keen eyes would come back to the bonnet and the cap she was so much startled that she turned the bonnet round and then the figure seemed watching with the shoulders this was uncanny but it was not so terrible as the faceless form beside the fireplace was a cupboardone of those huge cupboards which one only finds in the old houses armorel tried the door but it was locked against the wall stood a chest of drawers brassbound massive she tried the handles but every lock was fast under the window stood an old seachest it was a very big seachest one would judge from its rich carvings and its ornamental ironwork that it was probably the seachest of an admiral at leastperhaps that of admiral hernando mureno armorels ancestor if such was his rank in the navy of his catholic majesty the sight of this seachest caused the girl to shiver with the fear of expectation nobody contemplates the absolutely unknown without a certain fear it contained she was certain the things that dorcas had seen of which she would not speak the chest seemed to drag her it cried open me look inside mesee what i have got to show you then she remembered as one in a dream hearing people talk words long forgotten came back to her twas in hugh town whither she went across to school when she was as yet a little girl what have the roseveansthus and thus said the voicedone with all their money theyve never spent anything theyve gone on saving and saving some day we shall find out what became of it was she going to find out what had become of it the old lady in her most lucid moments had never dropped the least hint of any inheritance except that disagreeable necessity of getting drowned on account of the unfortunate robert fletcher and that was not an inheritance to gladden the heart yet there was an inheritance it was here in this room and she was locked in alone in order that she herself unseen by any might discover what it was baron bluebeards last wifeshe who afterwards as a beautiful rich and lively young widow set so many hearts aflamewas not more curious than armorel nor was she in the course of her investigations more afraid than armorel the girl looked nervously about the room so ghostly and so full of shadow all old rooms have their ghosts but some of them have so many that one is not afraid of them there is a sense of companionship in a crowd of ghosts this room had only onethat of the woman who had grown old in itwho had spent nearly eighty years in it all the old ghosts had grown tired of this monotonous room gone away and left the place to her armorel not only believed in ghostsmany of us accord to these shadows a shadowy theoretical beliefshe actually knew that ghosts do sometimes appear dorcas had seen manychessun herself while not going actually that length threw out hints she herself had often too gone to look for them now she glanced nervously where the things were hanging expecting to see the ancestral figure reappear shoulders move the bonnet and cap turn round the old old face within them ready to warn to admonish and to guide if this had happened it would have seemed to armorel nothing but what was natural and in the regular course of things looked for but outside the sun shone on the white appleblossom no one is very much afraid of ghosts in the sunshine she encouraged herself with this reflection and began with unlocking the chest of drawers the lower drawers when they were opened contained nothing but the things of her greatgreatgrandmother among them was a box roughly madea boys box made with a jackknife it contained a gold watch with a french name upon ita very old watch with a representation of the annunciation in low relief on the gold face there were also in the box two or three gold chains and sundry rings and trinkets armorel took them out and laid them on the table they were she said to herself part of her inheritance was this the great surprise spoken of by dorcas she tried the two upper drawers they were locked but she easily found the right key and opened them she found that they were filled with lace they were crammed with lace there were packets of lace tied up tight rolls of lace cardboards with lace wound round and roundan immense quantity of lace was lying in these drawers as for its value armorel knew nothing nor did she even ask herself what the value might be she only unrolled one or two packets and wondered vaguely what in the world she should do with so much lace and she wished it was not so yellow yet the packets she unrolled contained valenciennessome of it half a yard wide precious almost beyond price armorel knew however very well how it had got there and what it meant the descendant of so many brave runners was not ignorant that lace velvet silk and satin brandy and claret all came from the french coast with which her gallant forefathers were so familiar before the preventive service interfered this then was left from the smuggling times they had not sold all they had kept enough in fact to stock half a dozen westend shops to adorn the trousseau of fifty princesses and here the stuff had lain undisturbed sincewell perhaps since the unfortunate visit of mr robert fletcher my inheritance so far said armorel is a pile of yellow lace and a gold watch and chain and some trinkets is this the great surprise but she looked at the seachest something more must be there next she turned to the cupboard it was locked and doublelocked but she found the key the cupboard was one of those great receptacles common in the oldest houses almost rooms in themselves but dark rooms where mediaeval housekeepers kept their stores in those days housekeeping on a respectable scale meant the continual maintenance of immense stores all the things which now we get from shops as we want them were then laid in store long before they were wanted outside the country town there were no shops and even in london itself people did not run to the shop every day the men had great quantities of shirtsthree clean shirts a day was the allowance of a solid city man under good queen annea city man who respected himself the women had a corresponding quantity of flowered petticoats wine was by no means the only thing laid down for future years all these accumulations helped to give solidity to the appearance of life when a woman thought of her cupboards filled with fine linen and a man of his cellars filled with wine the uncertainty and brevity of life alleged by the preacher seemed not to concern them it would be absurd to lay down a great bin of good port if one was not going to live long enough to drink it the fashion therefore has its advantages armorel threw open the door and looked in the place was so dark that she was obliged to light a candle in order to examine the shelves running round the sides of the cupboard there was a strange smell in the place which perhaps had not been opened for a long time bales of some kind lay upon the upper shelves armorel took down two and opened them they contained silkstrong rich silk she rolled them up and put them back on a lower shelf was a most singular collection in the front row were onetwono fewer than six punchbowls all of silver except one and that was of silver gilt this must be the great surprise armorel took them all out and placed them on the table for the most part they showed signs of having been used with freedomone has heard of an empty punchbowl being kicked about the place as a conclusion to the feast but six punchbowls they came said armorel from the wrecks behind the punchbowls were silver candlesticks silver snuffers silver cups silver tankardssome with coatsofarms some with names engraven there was also a great silver ship one of those galleons in silver which formerly adorned royal banquets all these armorel took out and arranged upon the table among them was a tall hourglass mounted in silver armorel set the sand running again after many years on the floor there were packets and bundles tied up and rolled together armorel opened one of them and finding that it contained a packet of gold lace and a pair of gold epaulettes she left them undisturbed and standing against the wall stacked behind the bundles of gold lace were swordsdozens of swords what could she do with swords well then now at last she had found the great surprise but still the seachest seemed to drag her and to call to her open me open me see what i have got for you so far then she said i have inherited a pile of lace a gold watch rings and chains six punchbowls twentyfour silver candlesticks twelve silver cups four great tankards a silver ship i know not how many old swords and a bundle of gold lace i wonder if these things make a person rich if so great wealth does not satisfy the soul this was certain because armorel really felt no richer than before yet the array of punchbowls was truly imposing and the silver candlesticks the snuffers the tankards the cups and the ship though they sadly wanted the brush and the chamois leather with a pinch of whitenin were worthy of a college plateroom one might surely feel a little elation at the thought of owning all this silver even if one did not understand its intrinsic value but like the effect of champagne such elation would quickly wear off next armorel remembered the secret cupboard at the head of the bed her own bed had its secret recess at the headevery respectable bedstead used formerly to have them where else could money be hidden away safely to be sure everybody knew this hidingplace but everybody pretended not to know it was an open secret like the concealed drawer in a schoolboys desk our forefathers were full of such secrets that everybody knew the stocking in the teapot the receptacle under the hearthstone the hidden compartment in the cabinet the secret room the secret staircase the recess in the head of the bedthese were all secrets that everybody knew and everybody respected i think that even the burglar respected these conventions armorel knew how to open the panelshe found the spring and it flew open rustily as if it had not been opened for a great many years behind the panel was a recess eighteen inches long and about nine inches deep and here stood a black jacknothing less than a black jack a quart jack not a leather jack but a tankard made of tin and painted with hunting scenes something like an etruscan vase or perhaps more like a brown george why should anyone want to hide away a black jack this quart pot however held something better than stingoeven stronger it was halffilled with foreign money here were moidores doubloons ducats piecesofeight louis dors spanish pillar dollars sequins gold coins from indianothing at all in the pot less than a hundred years old armorel took out a handful and looked at them well gold coins do look like money she began to feel really rich she had a quart tankard halffull of gold coins she added the black jack to the other treasures on the table all this foreign money must have come out of the wrecks and since it was all so old out of wrecks that had happened before the memory even of the ancient lady this then was perhaps the great surprise but there remained the seachest under the window and again when armorel looked upon it the chest continued to call to her open me open me see what i have for you armorel found the key which unlocked it and threw open the lid within there was the deep tray which belongs to every seachest this was filled with a quantity of uninteresting brown canvas bags she wanted to see what was below and tried to lift the tray but it was too heavy then still regarding the bags as of no account she took one out it was heavy and when she lifted it there was a clink as of coin it was tied tightly at the mouth with a piece of string she opened it within there were gold coins she took out a handful they were all sovereigns some of them worn some quite new and fresh from the mint she poured out the whole contents of the bag on the table why it was actually full of golden sovereigns nothing else in the bag all golden sovereigns and there were five hundred of them she counted them five hundred pounds she had never it is true thought much about moneybutfive hundred pounds it seemed an amazing sum five hundred pounds and all in a single bag and such a little bag as this she put back the money and tied up the bag then she took out another bag this was as big as the first and heavier it was full of guineasarmorel counted them there were also five hundred of them some of them were so old that they bore the impression of the elephant and therefore belonged to the seventeenth century but most of them belonged to the eighteenth century and bore the heads of the three first georges five hundred guineasand never before had armorel seen a guinea well she thought that made a thousand pounds she took up another bag and opened it that too weighed as much and was full of gold and another and yet another they were all full of gold and now she knew what dorcas meantthisnothing but thiswas the great surprise not the punchbowls or the lace or the bales of silk but these bags full of gold constituted her wealth she understood money you see lace and silk were beyond her this was her inheritance consider the roseveans from father to son had been from time immemorial wreckers smugglers and pilots they were also farmers on their little farm they grew nearly enough to support their simple lives they had pigs and poultry they had milch cows they had a few sheep they kept geese pigeons ducks they made their own beer and their own cordials and strong waters they made their own linen they were unto themselves millers tinkers carpenters cabinetmakers builders and thatchers they grew their own salads and vegetables and if they wanted any fruit they grew that as well oats and barley they grew clover and hay i believe that on samson wheat has never been grownindeed there are only eighty acres in all there was left therefore little to buy coals wood for fuel and for carpentering things in iron crockery tools cloth clothes flannel flour and sometimes a little beefwhat else did they want as for fish they had only to catch as much as they wanted tea coffee sugar and so forth came in with later civilisation when small ale possets and hypsy died out in order to provide these small deficiencies they were pilots to begin with this trade brought in a steady income they also sent out boats filled with fresh vegetables to meet the homewardbound east indiamen and they were also like the rest of the artless islanders wreckers and smugglers in the former capacity they occasionally acquired an extraordinary quantity of odd and valuable things in the latter profession they made at times and until the peace and the preventive service put an end to the business a really fine income then on samson they continued to live after the patriarchal fashion and in the old simplicity each captain rosevean in turn was the chieftain or sheik to him his family brought all that they earned or found the seachest took it all for three hundred years at least this seachest received everything and gave up nothing nobody ever took anything out of it nobody looked into it nobody knew until ursula counted the money and made bags for it what there was in the chest nobody ever asked if they were rich or how rich they were there was no bank on samson there is not even now a bank in the scilly archipelago at all nobody understood any other way of saving money than the good old fashion of putting it by in a bag on samson there never were thieves even when as many as fifty people lived on the island therefore the captain rosevean of the time though he knew not how much was saved nor did he ever inquire laid the last additions to the pile in the tray of the old seachest with the rest and having locked it up dropped the key in his pocket and went about his business in perfect confidence never thinking either that it might be stolen or that he might count up his hoard proceed to enjoy it and alter his simple way of life every captain rosevean in succession added to that hoard every year not one among them all thought of spending it or taking anything from it he added to it nobody ever counted it until the reign of ursula it was she who made the little brown bags of canvas she usurping the place of family chief or sheik took from her sons and grandsons all the money that they made they gave it over to her keepingshe was the family bank and like her predecessors in that room she told no one of the hoard most of the bags contained guineas of george i george ii and george iii down to the year when the mint left off coining guineas a few contained sovereigns of later date but the family savings since that year had been small and uncertain the really fat timethe prosperous timewhen the money poured in was during the long war which lasted for nearly fiveandtwenty years there were actually forty of these bags armorel laid them out upon the table and counted them forty and each bag to all appearance for she only counted two contained five hundred guineas or pounds forty times five hundredthat makes twenty thousand pounds if all were sovereigns there are i am told a few young ladies in this country who have as much as twenty thousand pounds for their dot there are also a great many young ladies in france and an amazing multitude whom no man may number in the united states of america who have as much but i am quite sure that not one of these heiresses except armorel herself has ever actually gazed upon her fortune in a concrete formtangibleto be countedto be weighedto be admired it is a pity that they cannot do this if only because they would then see for themselves what a very small pile of gold a fortune of twenty thousand pounds actually makes this would make them humble armorel stood looking at the table thus laden with bewildered eyes i have got she murmured twenty thousand sovereigns and guineas at least i have got a painted pot full of old money i have got six punchbowls a great silver ship a large number of silver candlesticks and cups i have got a silvermounted hourglassits sand was now nearly runi have got a great quantity of lace and silk i suppose all this does make riches whatever shall i do with it shall i give it to the poor or shall i put it back into the box and leave it there but perhaps there is something else in the box the chest in fact continued to call aloud to be examined even while armorel looked at her glittering treasures spread out upon the table she felt herself drawn towards the chest there was more in it there was another surprise waiting for hereven a greater surprise perhaps than that of the bags of gold search me cried the chest search me look into the innermost recesses of me explore my contents to the very bottom let nothing escape your eyes armorel knelt down before the chest and took out the tray it was empty now and she could lift it easily beneath the tray there was a most miscellaneous collection of things they lay in layers separated and dividedursulas hand was hereby silk handkerchiefs of the good old kindthe bandanna now gone out of fashion first armorel took out and laid on the floor a layer of silver spoons silver ladles even silver dishes all of antique appearance and for the most part stamped with a crest or a coatofarms for in the old days if a man was armiger he loved to place his shield on everything to look at it and glory in it to let others see it and envy it then she found a layer of watches there were gold watches and silver watches the latter of all kinds down to the veritable turnip the glasses were broken of nearly all and if one had examined the works would have been found rusted with the seawater which had got in what were they worth now perhaps the value of the cases and of the jewels with which the works were set and more with one or two where miniatures adorned the back and jewels were set in the face armorel turned with impatience from the watches to the gold chains which lay beside them there were yards of gold chain gold chains of all kinds from the heavy english make to the dainty interlaced venetian and threadlike trichinopoly there were silver chains alsomassive silver chains made for some extinct officebearer perhaps bosn on the admirals ship of the great armada armorel drew up some of the chains and played with them tying them round her wrists and letting them slip through her fingersthe pretty delicate things which spoke of wealth almost as loudly as the bags of guineas she laid them aside and took up a silk handkerchief containing a small collection of miniatures they were almost all portraits of women young and pretty women ladies on land whose faces warmed the hearts and fired the memories of men at sea the miniatures had hung round the necks of some and had lain in the seachests of others whose bones had long since melted to nothing in the salt sea depths while those of their mistresses had turned to dust beneath the aisle of some village church their memory long since forgotten and their very name trampled out by the feet of the rustics armorel laid aside these picturesthey were very pretty but she would look at them again another time the next parcel was a much larger one it consisted of snuffboxes there were dozens of snuffboxes one or two of gold one or two silvergilt some silver in the lids of some were pictures some most beautifully and delicately executed some of subjects which armorel did not understandand why she thought should painters draw people without proper clothes venus and the graces and the nymphs in whom our eighteenthcentury ancestors took such huge delight were to this young person merely people the snuffboxes were very well in their way but armorel had no inclination to look at them again then she found in a handkerchief the four corners of which were loosely tied together a great quantity of rings there were rings of every kindthe official ring or the ring of office the signetring the ring with the shield the ring with the name of a ship the ring with the name of a regiment mourningrings weddingrings betrothalrings rings with posies cramprings with the names of the magi on thembut their power was gonegimmalrings rings episcopal rings barbaric mediaeval and modern rings set with every kind of precious stonethere were hundreds of rings all drowned sailors used to have rings on their fingers armorel began to get tired of all these treasures beneath them however at the bottom of the box lay piled together a mass of curios they were stowed away for the most part in small boxes of foreign make and appearance ivory boxes carved wood boxes they consisted of all kinds of things such as gold and silver buckles brooches painted fans jewelhilted daggers crystal tubes of attar of roses and knives of curious construction the girl sighed she would look over them at another time they would perhaps add something to the inheritance but for the moment she was satisfied she had seen enough she was putting back a dagger whose jewelled handle flashed in the unaccustomed light when she saw lying half hidden among this pile of curious things the corner of a chagreen case this attracted her curiosity and she took it out the chagreen had been green in colour but was now very much discoloured it had been fastened by a silver clasp but this was broken a small leather strap was attached to two corners armorel expected to find another bag of money but this did not contain gold it was lighter than the canvas bags as she took it into her hands she remembered the bag of robert fletcher yes the leathern strap of this case had been cut through she held in her handsshe was certainthe abominable thing that had brought so much trouble on the family again the room felt ghostly she heard voices whispering the voices of all those who had been drowned the voices of the women who had mourned for them the voice of the old lady who was herself a witness of the crime they all whispered together in her ears armorel you must find him you must give it back to him what was in it the clasp acted no longer armorel lifted the overlapping leather and looked within there was a thick roll of silk she took this out wrapped up in the silk laid in folds side by side were a quantity of stonescommonlooking stones such as one may pick up she thought on the beach of porth bay there were a couple of hundred or more mostly small stones only one or two of them bigger than the top of armorels little finger only stones she cried all this trouble about a bag full of red stones among the stones lay a small folded paper armorel opened it the paper was discoloured by age or by water and most of the writing was effaced but she could read some of it from the king of burmah himself this ruby i estimate to be worth l at the very least the other mines the second largest stone weighs about l the smaller rt fletcher it was a note on the contents of the parcel written by the owner the stones therefore were rubies uncut rubies armorel knew little about precious stones and jewels but she had heard and read of them the price of a virtuous woman she knew was far above rubies and solomons fairest among women was made comely with rows of jewels queen sheba moreover brought precious stones among her presents to the wise king the girl wondered why such commonlooking objects as these should be precious but she was humbly ignorant and put that wonder by this then was nothing less than robert fletchers fortune he had this round his neck and he was bringing it home to enjoy and it was taken from him by her ancestor a wicked thing indeed a foul and wicked thing and the poor man had been sent empty away to begin his life all over again she shivered as she looked at them all for the sake of these dull red bits of stone how can man so easily fall into temptation in the empty room so quiet so ghostly she heard again the whispers armorel find himfind the manand give him back his jewels she replied aloud not daring to look round her lest she should see the pale and eager faces of those who had suffered death by drowning in consequence of this sin yesyes i will find him i will find him she pushed the chagreen case back into its corner and covered it up i will find him she repeated then she rose to her feet and looked about the room heavens what a sight the bags of gold two of them open their contents lying piled upon the tablethe chains of gold on the floorthe handful of old gold coins lying on the table beside the black jack the snuffboxes the miniatures the punchbowls the rings the silver cupsthe low room dark and quiet filled with ghosts and voices the recent occupant wagging her shoulders and shaking the back of her bonnet at her from the opposite wall and through the open window the sight of the sunlight on the appleblossoms mocking the gold and silver in this gloomy cave she comprehended as yet little of the extent of her good fortune lace and silk rings and miniatures snuffboxes all these things had no value to herof buying and selling she had no kind of experience all she understood was that she was the possessor of a vast quantity of things for which she could find no possible useone jewelled dagger for instance might be used for a dinnerknife or for a paperknife but what could she do with a dozen in addition to this museum of pretty and useless things she had forty bags with five hundred guineas or pounds in eachtwentyone thousand pounds say in cash this museum was perfectly unique no family in great britain had such a collection it had been growing for more than three hundred years it was begun in the time of the tudor kings at least perhaps even earlier wrecks there were and roseveans on samson before the seventh henry i doubt if any other family even the oldest and the noblest has been collecting so long certainly no other family even in this archipelago of wrecks can have had such opportunities of collecting with such difficulties in dissipating for more than three hundred years and armorel was sole heiress she understood that she had inherited something more than twenty thousand poundshow much more she knew not now unless one knows something of the capacities of one single pound one cannot arrive at the possibilities of twenty thousand pounds armorel knew as much as this tea at hugh town costs two shillings a poundperhaps twoandfoursugar threepence a pound nuns cloth so much a yardserge and flannel so much coals so much a ton wood for fuel so much this was nearly the extent of her knowledge and it must be confessed that it goes very little way towards a right comprehension of twenty thousand pounds once again she had heard justinian talking of the flowerfarm it has made he said four hundred pounds this year clear to which dorcas replied and the housekeeping doesnt come to half that nor near it whence by the new light of this great surprise she concluded first that the other two hundred thus made must have been added to those moneybags and next that two hundred pounds a year would be a liberal allowance for her whole yearly expenditure then she made a little calculation two hundred pounds a yeartwo hundred into twenty thousandtwenty thousandtwo and four noughtsshe put five bags in a row for the numbersubtract twoshe did sothere remained threedivide by twoshe did soone hundred years was the result of that sum her twenty thousand pounds would therefore last her exactly one hundred years at the expiration of the century all would be gone for the first time in her life armorel comprehended the fleeting nature of riches and naturally the discovery though she shivered at the thought of losing all made her feel a little proud a strange result of wealth to advance the inheritor one more step in the knowledge of possible misery she was like unto the curious youth who opens a book of medicine only to learn of new diseases and terrible sufferings and alarming symptoms and to imagine these in his own body of corruption in a hundred years there would be no more she would then be reduced to sell the lace and the other things for what they would then be worth there would still however remain the flowerfarm she would after all be no worse off than before the great surprise and then there sprang up in her heart the blossom of another thought to be developed later on into a lovely flower she had risen from her knees now and was standing beside the table vaguely gazing upon her inheritance it was all before her so the ancient lady had stood many and many a time counting the money looking to see if all was safe content to count it and to know that it was there the old lady was gone but from the opposite wall her shoulders and the back of her bonnet were looking on well armorel might go on doing exactly the same she might live as her forefathers had lived there was the flowerfarm to provide all their necessities if it brought in four hundred pounds a year she could add two hundred to the heapin every two years and a half another bag of five hundred sovereigns all her people had done thiswhy not she it seemed expected of her a plain duty laid upon her shoulders if she were to live on for eighty years longerwhich would bring her to her greatgreatgrandmothers ageshe would save eighty times two hundredsixteen thousand pounds the inheritance would then be worth thirtysix thousand poundsa prodigious sum of money indeed and besides the black jack with its foreign gold and the rings and lace and things a strange room it was this morning what voice was it that whispered solemnly in her ear lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal never before had this injunction possessed any other significance to her than belongs to one manifestly addressed to other people the bible is full of warnings addressed to other people armorel was like the royal duke who used to murmur during the weekly utterance of the commandments never did that never did that now this precept was clearly and from the very first intended to meet her own case oh to live for nothing than to add more bags to that tray in the great seachest roland had prophesied that there would be a change it had come already in part and more was coming what next as yet the girl did not understand that she was mistress of her own fate hitherto things had been done for her she was now about to act for herself but how if roland were only here but he had only written once and he had never kept his promise to write back again to samson if he were here he could advise she looked around and saw the heaps of things that were all hers and she laughed the girl whom roland thought to be only an ignorant and poor little country girl a flowerfarmers girl of samson island living alone with her old grandmother and the servingfolk was ignorant still no doubt but she was not poor she was richshe could have all that can be bought with moneyshe was rich what would roland say and think and she laughed aloud she was richthe last girl in the world to hope or expect or desire riches thus fate mocks us giving to one who wants it not wealth and to another who knows not how to use it youth and to a third insensible of its power beauty the young lady of society she whom the good old hymns used to call the worldlingfond and pretty title there are no worldlings nowwould have had no difficulty in knowing how to use this wonderful windfall she indeed is always longing perhaps praying for money she is always thinking how delightful it would be to be rich and how there is nothing in the whole world more desirable than much fine gold but to lady worldling poor thing such a windfall never happens again there are all the distressed gentlewomen the unappreciated artists the authors whose books wont sell the lawyers who have no clients the wives whose name is quiverful the tradesman who scapes the bankruptcy court year after year by the skin of his teeth and the poor dear young man who pines away because he cannot join the rabble rout of comuswhy why does not such a windfall ever come to any of these it never does yet they spend all their spare timeall the time when they ought to be planning and devising ways and means of advancementin dreaming of the golden days they would enjoy if only such a windfall fell to them one such man i knew he dreamed of wealth all his life he tried to become rich by taking every year a share in a foreign lottery of course he never won a prize while he was yet young and even far down the shady or outer slope of middle age he continually built castles in the air fashioning pleasant ways for himself when he should get that prize when he grew old he dreamed of the will he would make and of the envy with which other old men when he was gone should regard the memory of one who had cut up so well so he died poor but i think he had always through his dreaming been as happy as if he had been rich armorel told herself standing in the midst of this great treasure that she was rich roland had once told her she remembered that an artist ought to have money in order to be free only in freedom he said could a man make the best of himself what was good for an artist might be good for her at the same timeit is not for nothing that a girl reads and ponders over the gospelsthere were terrible words of warningthere were instances she shuddered overwhelmed with the prospects of new dangers she knew everything the room had yielded all its secrets there were no more cupboards boxes or drawers the sight of the treasures already began to pall upon her she applied herself to putting everything back first the chagreen case this she laid carefully in its corner among the daggers and pistols remembering that she had promised to find the owner how should she do that if she remained on samson then she put back the snuffboxes the miniatures and the watches in their silk handkerchiefs then the box of rings and the silver spoons and dishes then she put the tray in its place and laid the bags in the tray and locked the old seachest this done she bore back to the shelves in the cupboard the punchbowls candlesticks tankards and the big silver ship she locked and doublelocked the cupboarddoor she crammed the lace into the drawers and put back the box of trinkets then she dropped the keys in her pocket oh what a lump to carry about all day long but the weight of the keys in her pocket was nothing to the weight that was laid upon her shoulders by her great possessions this however she hardly felt at first everything was her own when the new king comes to the throne he makes a great clearance of all the personal belongings of the old king he gives away his cloaks and his uniforms and all the things belonging to the daily life of his predecessor that is always done therefore queen armorelvivat reginaat this point gathered together all her predecessors belongings she turned them out of the drawers and laid them on the floorwith the great bonnet and the wonderful cap of ribbons and then she opened the door she would give these things to dorcas her greatgreatgrandmother should have no more authority there even her clothes must go if her ghost should remain it should be without the bonnet and the cap she called dorcas who came curious to know how her young mistress took the great surprise armorel had taken it apparently as a matter of course so the new king stands upon the highest step of the throne calm and collected as if he had been prepared for this event and was expecting it day after day you know all now dearie she whispered shutting the door carefully did you find everything yesi believe i found everything the silver in the cupboard the lace the bags of gold i think i have found everything dorcas then you are rich my dear no rosevean before you was ever half so rich for none of it has been spent theyve all gone on saving and addingalmost to the last she saved and added oh the last thing she lost was the love of saving and the jealousy of her keys she never lost oh you are very richyou are the richest girl in the whole of scillynot even in st marys is there anyone who can compare with you even the lord proprietor himselfi hardly know yes i believe i must be very rich said armorel dorcas you kept her secret keep mine as well let no one know no one shall know dearieno one but lock the door keep the door locked always i will now dorcas here are all her dresses and things you must take them all away and keep them they are for you very well dearie though how im to wear black silk oh child she cried out of the religious terrors of her soulit is written that it is harder for a rich man to enter into heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle my dear if these great riches are to drag your soul down into hell it would be better if they were all thrown into the sea the silver punchbowls and the bags of gold and all but theres one comfort it doesnt say impossible it only says harder so that now and then perhaps a rich man may wriggle injust oneand oh i wish seeing the number of rich people there are in the world that thered been shown one camelonly a single camelgoing through the needles eye think what a miracle twould have brought conviction to all who saw it and consolation ever afterwards to all who considered itoh the many thousands of afflicted souls who are born rich you are not the only one child who is rich through no fault of her own often have i told justinian thinking of her and he not knowing or suspecting but believing i was talking silly that considering the warnings and woes pronounced against the rich we cannot be too thankful but dont despair my dearit is nowhere said to be impossible and theres the rich young man to be sure who was told to sell all that he had and to give to the poor he went away sorrowful you cant do that armorel because there are no poor on samson and its said woe unto you that are rich for you have had your consolation well but if your money never is your consolationand im sure i dont know what it is going to console you forthat doesnt apply to you does it theres the story of the rich man again and theres texts upon texts when you come to think of them you will remember them child and they will be your warnings besides you are not going to waste and riot like a prodigal son and where your earthly treasure is there you will not set your heart you will go on like all the roseveans before you and though the treasure is kept locked up you will add to it every year out of your savings just as they did there is another parable dorcas i think i ought to remember that as well it is that of the talents if the man who was rich with five talents had locked them up he would not have been called a good and faithful servant yes dearie yes you will find some scripture to comfort and assure your soul no doubt theres a good deal in scripture something for all sorts as they say though after all riches is a dangerous thing child if they knew it over at st marys not a young man in the place but would be sailing over to samson to try his luck our secret child all to ourselves yes our secret dorcas and now take away all these things everything that belonged to her there are her shoestake them too i want the room to be all my own so when all the things were gone armorel closed and locked the door then she ran out of the house gasping for she choked everything was turned into gold she gasped and choked and ran out over the hill and down the steps and across the narrow plain and up the northern hill hoping to drive some of the ghosts from her brain and to shake off some of the bewildering caused by the great surprise but a good deal remained and especially the religious terrors suggested by that pious bryanite christian and divider of the word dorcas tryeth when she sat down in the old place upon the carn the great gulf between herself and bryher island reminded her of that great gulf in the parable how if she should be the rich man sitting for ever and for ever on the redhot rock tormented with pain and thirstand how if on samson hill beyond she should see abraham himself the patriarch with lazarus lying at his feetas yet she had developed no lazarusbut who knows the future the rich man must have been a thoughtless and selfish person until now the parable never interested her at all why should it she had no money the other passages those which dorcas had kindly quoted in this her first hour of wealth came crowding into her mind and told her they were come to stay all these texts she had previously classed with the denunciations of sins the very meaning of which she knew not she had no concern with such wickedness nor could she possibly understand how it was that people when they actually knew that they must not do such things still went on doing them now however having become rich herself all the warnings of the new testament seemed directed against herself already the load of wealth was beginning to weigh upon her young shoulders she changed the current of her thoughts even the richest girl cannot be always thinking about woes and warnings else she would do nothing good or bad she began to think about the outer world she had been thinking of it constantly ever since roland left her now as she looked across the broad roadstead and remembered that thirty miles beyond telegraph hill rose the cliffs where the outer world beginsthey can be seen in a clear daya longing passionate and irresistible seized her she could go away now whenever she pleased she could visit the outer world and make the acquaintance of the people who live in it she laughed thinking how justinian who had never been beyond st marys pictured as he was fond of doing the outer world the sea of tiberias was to him the road the jordan was like grinsey sound the steep place down which the swine fell into the sea was like shipmans head the sermon on the mount took place on just such a spot as the carn of the north hill on samson with the sun shining on the western islands the new jerusalem in his mind was a city like hugh town consisting of one long street with stone houses roofed with slate each house two storeys high a door in the middle and one window on each side on the north side of the new jerusalem was the harbour with the ships the seashore and the open sea beyond on the south side was a bay with beaches of white sand and black rocks at the entrance exactly like porth cressa and it was a quiet town with seldom any noise of wheels and always the sound of the sea lapping on either hand north or south now there was nothing to keep her she could go to visit the outer world whenever she pleasedif only she knew how a girl of sixteen can hardly go forth into the wide wide world all alone announcing to the four corners her desire to make the acquaintance of everybody and to understand anything and then she began to remember her teachers last instructions the perfect girl was one who had trained her eye and her hand she could play one instrument well she understood music she understood art she was always gracious sympathetic and encouraging she knew how to get their best out of men she was always beautifully dressed she had the sweetest and the most beautiful manners and here she blushed crimson and then turned pale and felt a pang as if a knife had pierced her very heart for a dreadful thought struck her she thought she understood at last the true reason why roland never came back though he promised and looked so serious when he promised why why because she was so illmannered of course that was the reason why did roland speak so strongly about the perfect girls gracious and sympathetic manners unless to make her understand in this kindly and thoughtful way how much was wanting in herself of course he only looked upon her as a common country girl who knew nothing and would never learn anything he wanted her to understand thatto feel that she would never rise to higher levels he drew this picture of the perfect girl to make and keep her humble nay but now she had this moneyall this wealthnownow she sprang to her feet and threw out her arms the gesture that she had learned i know not where oh she cried it is the gift of the five talents i am not the rich young man i have not received these riches for my consolation they are my five talents i will go away and learni will learn i will become the perfect girl i will train eye and hand i will growgrowgrowto my full height that will be true work in the service of the giver of those talents i shall become a good and faithful servant when i have risen to the stature that is possible for me part ii chapter i sweet coz i suppose said philippa that we were obliged to ask her well my dear her mother replied mr jagenal is an old friend and when her voice dropped and she did not finish the sentence it is absurd to finish a sentence which is understood perhaps she will not do anything very outrageous well my dear mr jagenal distinctly said that her manner again she left the sentence unfinished perhaps it was her habit as she bears our name and comes from our place we can hardly deny the cousinship in a few minutes however we shall know the worst philippa dressed for dinner was standing before the fire tapping the fender impatiently with her foot and playing with her fan a handsome girl of three or fourandtwenty handsome not pretty if you please nor lovely by no means handsome with a kind of beauty which no painter or sculptor would assign to lady venus because it lacked softness nor to diana because that huntress chaste and fair was countrybred and philippa was of the townurban the young lady was perfectly well satisfied with her own style of beauty if she exaggerated a little its power that is a common feminine mistake the exaggeration brings to dress a moral responsibility philippa was dressed this evening in a creamy white silk which had the effect of softening a face and manner somewhat cold and even hard the young men of the period complained that philippa was standoffish certainly she did not commit the mistake too common among girls of plunging straight off into sympathetic interest with every young man philippa waited for the young men to interest her if they could generally they could not and while many girls listen with affected deference to the opinions of the young man philippa made the young man receive hers with deference these plain facts show perhaps why philippa at twentyfour was still free and unengaged in appearance she was tallall young ladies who respect themselves are tall in these days her features were clearly cut if a little pronounced her hazel eyes were intellectually bright though cold her hair the leastmarked feature was of a common brown colour but she treated it so as to produce a distinctive effect her mouth was fine though her lips were rather thin her figure was correct though venus herself would have preferred more of it and perhaps that more flexible but it is the commonplace girl we know who runs to plumpness she was dressed with greater care than usual that evening because people were coming but not to dinner the only guests at dinner were to be one mr jagenal the well known family solicitor of lincolns inn and a certain faroff cousin named armorel rosevean from the scilly isles and her companion and chaperon one mrs jerome elstreeunknown my dear her mother began you are too desponding mr jagenal assured your father she dropped her voice again oh he is an old bachelor what does he know our cousin comes from scilly so did we it does very well to talk of coming from scilly as if it was something grand but i have been looking into a book about it old families of scilly we say why they have never been anything but farmers and smugglers and our cousin i hear is actually a small tenantfarmera flowerfarmera kind of marketgardener she grows daffodils and jonquils and anemones and snowdrops and sells them very likely the daffodils on our table have come from her farm perhaps she will tell us about the price they fetch a dozen and she will inform us at dinner how she counts the stalks and makes out the bills absurd she is an heiress mr jagenal says an heiress how can she be an heiress philippa repeated with scorn she inherits the lease of a little flowerfarm the people of scilly are all quite quite poor my book says so some years ago the scilly folk were nearly starving your book must be wrong philippa mr jagenal says that the girl has a respectable fortune when a man of his experience says that he means here her voice dropped again well the island heiress will go back i dare say to her inheritance at this point mr jagenal himself was announcedelderly precise exact in appearance and in language you have not yet seen your cousin he asked no she will be here immediately i suppose your cousin came to our house five years ago my late partner received her she brought a letter from a clergyman then at the scilly islands she was sixteen quite ignorant of the world and a really interesting girl she had inherited a very handsome fortune my late partner found her tutors and guardians and she has been travelling and learning now she has come to london again she chooses to be her own mistress and has taken a flat and i have found a companion for herwidow of an artistour young friend alec feilding knew about hername of elstree i think she will do very well alec knew her he has never told me of any lady of that name philippa looked a little astonished then the girl of whom they were talking with the companion in question appeared you know how one forms in the mind a whole image or group of images preparatory and how these shadows are all dispelled by the appearance of the reality at the very first sight of armorel philippas prejudices and expectationsthe vision of the dowdy rustic the halfbred island savage the uncouth country maidenall vanished into thin air new prejudices might ariseit is a mistake to suppose that because old prejudices have been cleared away there can be no morebut in this case the old ones vanished for while armorel walked across the room and while mrs rosevean stepped forward to welcome her philippa made the discovery that her cousin knew how to carry herself how to walk and how to dress girls who have learned these three essentials have generally learned how to talk as well and a young lady of london understands at the first glance whether a strange young person her sister in the bonds of humanity is also a lady as for the dress it showed genius either on the part of armorel herself or of her advisers there was genius in the devising and invention of it but genius of this kind one can buy there was the genius of audacity in the wearing of it because it was a dress of the kind more generally worn by ladies of forty than of twentyone and it required a fine face and a good figure to carry it off ladies will quite understand when i explain that armorel wore a train and bodice of green brocaded velvet the sleeves and the petticoat trimmed with lace you may see a good deal of laceof a sorton many dresses but philippa recognised with astonishment that this was old lace the finest lace in the world of greater breadth than it is now madelace that was pricelesslace that only a rich girl could wear there were also pearls on the sleeves she wore mousquetaire gloveswhich proved many things there were bracelets on her wrists and round her neck she had a circlet of plain red goldit was the torque found in the kistvaen on samson but this philippa did not know and she observed taking in all these details in one comprehensive and catholic glance of mind and eye that her cousin was a very beautiful girl indeed with something castilian in her face and appearancedark and splendid for a simple dinner she would have been overdressed but considering the reception to come afterwards she was fittingly arrayed she was accompanied by her companionphilippa might have remembered that one must be an heiress in order to afford the luxury of such a household official mrs jerome elstree was almost young enough to want a chaperon for herself being certainly a good deal under thirty she was a graceful woman of fair complexion and blue eyes if armorel had desired a contrast to herself she could not have chosen better she wore a dress in the style which is called i believe second mourning the dress suggested widowhood but no longer in the first passionate agonywidowhood subdued and resigned the hostess rose from her chair and advanced a step to meet her guests she touched the fingers of mrs elstree very pleased indeed she murmured and turned to armorel my dear cousinshe seized both her hands and looked as well as spoke most motherly my dear child this is indeed a pleasure and to think that we have known nothing about your very existence all the time this is my daughtermy only daughter philippa then she subsided into her chair leaving philippa to do the rest we are cousins said philippa kindly but with cold and curious eyes i hope we shall be friends then she turned to the companion oh she cried with a start of surprise it is zoe yes said mrs elstree a quick smile on her lips formerly it was zoe how do you do philippa her voice was naturally soft and sweet a caressing voice a voice of velvet she glanced at philippa as she spoke and her eyes flashed with a light which hardly corresponded with the voice i was wondering as we came here whether you would remember me it is so long since we were at school together how long dear seven years eight years you remember that summer at the seasidewhere was it one changes a good deal in seven years yet i thought somehow that you would remember me you are looking very well philippastill a doubtful compliment but conveyed in the softest manner which should have removed any possible doubt armorel looked on with some astonishment on philippas face there had risen a flaming spot something was going on below the surface but philippa laughed of course i remember you very well she said but dear philippa mrs elstree went on softly smiling and gently speaking i am no longer zoe i am mrs jerome elstreei am la veuve elstree i am armorels companion i am sorry philippa replied coldly her eyes belied her words she was not sorry she did not care whether good or evil had happened to this woman she was too good a christian to desire the latter and not good enough to wish the former what she had really hopedwhenever she thought of zoewas that she might never never meet her again and here she was a guest in her own home and companion to her own cousin then mr rosevean appeared and welcomed the new cousin cordially he seemed a cheerful goodtempered kind of man was sixty years of age bald on the forehead and of aspect like the conventional colonel of punchin fact he had been in the army and served through the crimean war which was quite enough for honour he passed his time laboriously considering his investmentsfor he had great possessionsand making small collections which never came to anything he also wrote letters to the papers but these seldom appeared then they went in to dinner the conversation naturally turned at first upon scilly their common startingpoint and the illustrious family of the roseveans as soon as i heard about you my dear young lady i set to work to discover our exact relationship my grandfather sir jacobyou have heard of sir jacob rosevean knight of hanover yes naturallyhe was born in the year he was the younger brother of captain emanuel rosevean your greatgrandfather i believe my grandfathers were all named either emanuel or methusalem they took turns quite so mr rosevean nodded his head in approbation the preservation of the same christian names gives dignity to the family anthony goes with ashley emanuel or methusalem with rosevean the survival of the scripture name shows how the puritanic spirit lingers yet in the good old stocks philippa glanced at her mother mindful of her own remarks on the old families of scilly we come of a very fine old family cousin armorel i hope you have been brought up in becoming pride of birth it is a possession which the world cannot give and the world cannot take away we are a race of vikingsconquering vikings the last of them was perhaps my grandfather sir jacob unless any of the later roseveans i am afraid they can hardly be called vikings said armorel simply sir jacobmy grandfatherwas cast my dear young friend in the heroic mouldthe heroic mould nothing short of that for the services which he rendered to the state at the moment of britannias greatest peril he should have been raised to the house of lords but it was a time of giantsand he had to be contented with the simple recognition of a knighthood jacob roseveanwho was it had told armorel thislong before and why did she now remember the words so clearly ran away and went to sea he could read and write and cipher a little and so they made him clerk to the purser then he rose to be purser himself and when he had made some money he left the service and became contractor to the fleet and supplied stores of all kinds during the long war and at last he became so rich that they were obliged to make him a knight the simple recognition of a knighthood mr rosevean went on this it is to live in an age of heroes armorel waited for further details later on perhaps some of the heroic achievements of the great sir jacob would be related meantime every hero must make a beginning why should not jacob rosevean begin as pursers clerk it was pleasing to the girl to observe how large and generous a view her cousins took of the family greatnessnever before had she known to what an illustrious stock she belonged the smuggling the wrecking the piloting the farmingthese were all forgotten a whole race of heroic ancestors had taken the place of the plain roseveans whom armorel knew well if by the third generation of wealth and position one cannot evolve so simple a thing as an ancient family what is the use of history genealogy heraldry and imagination the roseveans were vikings they were the terror of the french coast they went acrusading with shortlegged robert they were rovers of the spanish main the great king of spain trembled when he heard their name they were buccaneers portraits of some of these ancestors hung on the wall sir jacob himself of course was there and sir jacobs greatgrandfather a cavalier and his grandfather an elizabethan worthy presumably these portraits came from samson island but armorel had never heard of any family portraits and she had grown up in shameful ignorance of these heroes there was a coatofarms too with which she was not acquainted yet there were circumstances connected with the grant of that shield by the sovereignking edward the firstwhich were highly creditable to the family armorel listened and marvelled but her host evidently believed it all and indeed it was his father not himself who had imagined these historic splendours it is pleasing he said to revive these memories between members of different branches you however are fresh from the ancestral scenes you are the heiress of the ancient island home yours is the hall of the vikings to you have been entrusted the relics of the past i look upon you and seem to see again the rovers putting forth to drag down the spanish pride there are noble memories armoreli must call you armorelassociated with that isle of samson our ancient family domain let us never forget them the dinner came to an end at last and the ladies went away mrs elstree sat down in the most comfortable chair by the fire and was silent leaning her face upon her hands and looking into the firelight mrs rosevean took a chair on the other side and fell asleep philippa and armorel talked i cannot understand said philippa bluntly how such a girl as you could have come from scilly i have been reading a book about the place and it says that the people are all poor and that samson your islandour islandis quite a small place i will tell you if you like said armorel as much about myself as you please to hear the chief advantage of an autobiographyas you shall see dear reader if you will oblige me by reading mine when it comes outis the right of preserving silence upon certain points armorel for example said nothing at all about roland lee nor did she tell of the chagreen case with the rubies but she did tell how she found the treasure of the seachest and the cupboard and how she took everything except the punchbowls and the silver ship and cups to london and how she gave them over to the lawyer to whom she had a letter and she told how she was resolved to repair the deficiencies of her upbringing and how for five long years she had worked day and night i think you are a very brave girl said philippa most girls in your place would have been contented to sit down and enjoy their good fortune i was so very ignorant when i began andand one or two things had happened which made me ashamed of my ignorance yet it was brave of you to work so hard at first said armorel when this good fortune came to me i was afraid thinking of the parable of the rich man philippa started and looked astonished in the circle of dives this parable is never mentioned no one regardeth that parable which is generally believed to be a late interpolation but when i came to think i understood that it might be the gift of the five talentsa sacred trust philippas eyes showed no comprehension of this language armorel indeed had learned long since that the bryanite or early christian language is no longer used in society but philippa was her cousin perhaps in the family it would still pass current i worked most at music shall i play to you nothing dear philippa said zoe halfturning round would please you so much as to hear armorel play you used to play a little yourselfphilippa had been the pride and glory of the school for her playinga little had she lost her memory will you play this evening i brought her violin in the carriage said zoe softly i wanted to give you as many delightful surprises as possible philippa to find your cousin so beautiful to hear her play and to receive me again this will be indeed an evening to remember i will play if you like said armorel simply but perhaps you have made other arrangements nonoyou can play but of course you have had good masters you shall play instead of me zoe murmured her satisfaction and turned again her face to the fire tell me armorel said philippa all this about the vikingsthe hall of the vikingsthe roversand the rest of it was it familiar to you no i have never heard of any vikings or rovers and there is no hall we are i suppose really an old family of scilly we have lived in the same place for i know not how many years one of the outlying rocks of scilly is called rosevean oh there is no doubt about our antiquity about the crusaders and all the rest of it i know nothing perhaps because there was nobody to tell me i see said philippa thoughtfully well it does no harm to believe these things perhaps some of them are true sir jacob certainly cannot be denied nor the roseveans of samson island my dear i am very glad you came chapter ii the sonata the room was full of people it was the average sort of reception where one always expects to meet men and women who have done something men who write paint or compose women who do the same but not so well women who play and sing women who are aesthetic and show their appreciation of art by wearing hideous dresses women who recite men and women who advocate all kinds of thingsmostly cranks and cracks there are besides the people who know the people who do things and these who are a talkative and appreciative folk carry on the conversation thirdly there are the people who do nothing and know nobody who go away and talk casually of having met this or that great man last night armorel said philippa let me introduce dr boveytracy perhaps you already know his works unfortunatelynot yet armorel replied the doctor was quite a young man not more than two or threeandtwenty his degree was german and his appearance with long light hair and spectacles was studiously german if he could have germanised his name as well as his appearance he would certainly have done so as a pianist a teacher of music and a composer the young doctor is already beginning to be known when armorel confessed her ignorance he gently spread his hands and smiled pity if you will really play armorel dr boveytracy will kindly accompany you armorel took her violin out of the case and began to tune it what will you play asked the musician something serious so armorel turned over a pile of music and selected a piece it was the sonata by schumann in d minor for violin and pianoforte shall we play this philippa looked a little surprised the choice was daring the herr doctor smiled graciously this is indeed serious he said i suppose that to begin your musical training with the performance of heys and hornpipes and country dances is not the modern scientific method but he who learns to fiddle for sailors to dance may acquire a mastery over the instrument which the modern scientific method teaches much more slowly armorel began her musical training with a fiddle as obedient to her as the slave of the lamp to his master and for five years she had been under masters playing every day until the pianist sat down held his outstretched fingers professionally over the keys and struck a chord armorel raised her bow and the sonata began i am told that there is now quite a fair percentage of educated people who really do understand music can tell good playing from bad and fine playing from its counterfeit in the same way there is a percentagebut not nearly so largeof people who know a good picture when they see it and can appreciate correct drawing if they cannot understand fine colour out of the sixty or seventy people who filled this room there were certainly twentybut then it was an exceptionally good collectionwho understood that a violinist born and trained was playing to them in a style not often found outside st jamess hall and they marvelled while the music delivered its messagewhich is different for every soul they sat or stood in silence spellbound of the remaining fifty thirty understood that a piece of classical music was going on it had no voice or message for them they did not comprehend one single phrasethe sonata might have been a sermon in the bulgarian tongue but they knew how to behave in the presence of music and they governed themselves accordingly the remnanttwenty in numbercontaining all the young men and most of the girls understood that here was a really beautiful girl playing the fiddle for them the young men murmured their admiration and the girls whispered envious thingsnot necessarily spiteful but certainly envious what girl could resist envy at sight of that dress with its lace and that command of the violin andwhich every girl concedes last of all and grudginglythat face and figure philippa stood beside the piano rather pale she knew now why her old schoolfellow had been so anxious that armorel should play kind and thoughtful zoe the playing of the first movement surprised her here was one who had indeed mastered her instrument at the playing of the second which is a scherzo bright and lively she acknowledged her mistressnot her rival at the playing of the third which contains a lovely simple innocent and happy tune her heart meltednever never could she so pour into her playing the soul of that melody never could she so rise to the spirit of the musician and put into the music what even he himself had not imagined but zoe was wrong her soul was not filled with envy philippa had a larger soul it was finished the twenty who understood gasped the thirty who listened murmured thanks and resumed their talk about something else the twenty who neither listened nor understood went on talking without any comment at all you have had excellent masters said the doctor you play very well indeednot like an amateur it is a pity that you cannot play in public you have made good use of your opportunities said philippa i have never heard an amateur play better i play a little myself but i said you would be pleased zoe murmured softly at her side i knew you would be pleased when you heard armorel play you will play yourself presently said the herr doctor no not this evening philippa replied impossibleafter armorel not this evening echoed zoe sweetly then there came walking tall and erect through the crowd which respectfully parted right and left to let him pass a young man of striking and even distinguished appearance philippa he said will you introduce me to your cousin armorel this is another cousin of mineunfortunately not of yoursmr alec feilding i am very unfortunate miss rosevean i came too late to hear more than the end of the sonata normannneruda herself could not interpret that music better then he saw zoe and greeted her as an old friend mrs elstree and i he said have known each other a long time fifty years at least zoe murmured is it not so long philippa will you play something else he asked the people are dying to hear you again armorel looked at philippa if you will she said kindly if you are not tired play us this time something lighter we cannot all appreciate schumann shall i give you a memory of scilly she replied that will be light enough she played in fact that old dittyone of those which she had been wont to play for the ancient ladycalled prince ruperts march she played this with variations which that gallant cavalier had never heard it is a fine air however and lends itself to the phantasy of a musician then those who had understood the sonata laughed with condescension as a philosopher laughs when he hears a simple story and those who had pretended to understand pricked up their ears thinking that this was another piece of classical music and joyfully perceiving that they would understand it and those who had made no pretence now listened with open mouths and ears as upright as those of any wildass of the desert music worth hearing this armorel played for five or six minutes then she stopped and laid down her violin i think i have played enough for one evening she said she left the piano and retired into the throng a girl took her place the herr doctor placed another piece of music before him lifted his hands held them suspended for a moment and then struck a chord this girl began to sing mr alec feilding followed armorel and led her to a seat at the end of the room then he sat down beside her and as soon as the song was finished began to talk he began by talking about music and the masters in music his talk was authoritative he laid down opinions he talked as if he was writing a book of instruction and he talked as if the whole wide world was listening to him but not quite so loudly as if that had been really the case he was a man of thirty or so his features were perfectly regular but his expression was rather wooden his eyes were good but rather too close together his mouth was hidden by a huge moustache curled and twisted and pointed forwards armorel disliked his manner and for some reason or other distrusted his face he left off laying down the law on music and began to talk about things personal i hope you like your new companion he said she is an old friend of mine i was in hopes of being able to advance her husband in his profession but he died before i got the chance mr jagenal told me what was wanted and i was happy in recommending zoemrs elstree thank you said armorel coldly i dare say we shall get to like each other in time if so i shall rejoice in having been of some service to you as well as to her what is her day at home i believe we are to be at home on wednesdays as for me he said lightly i am always at home in my studio i am a triple slavemiss roseveanas you may have heard i am a slave of the brush the pen and the wastepaperbasket if you will come with mrs elstree to my studio i can show you one or two things that you might like to see thank you she replied without apparent interest in his studio the young man was not accustomed to girls who showed no interest in him and retired chilled presently she heard his voice again this time he was talking with philippa they were talking low in the doorway beside her but she could not choose but hear you recommended heryou said philippa why not do you know howwhereshe has been living for the last seven years certainly she married an american he died a year ago leaving her rather badly off is there any reason philippa why i should not recommend her if there is i will speak to mr jagenal nonono there is no reason that i know of somebody told me she had gone on the stage who was it gone on the stage nono she was married to this american you have never spoken to me about her reason enough fair cousin you do not like her andyoudo she replied slowly i like all pretty women philippa i respect one only then other people came and were introduced to armorel one does not leave in cold neglect a girl who is so beautiful and plays so wonderfully none of them interested armorel very much at the beginning when a girl first goes into society she expects to be interested and excited at a general gathering this expectation disappears and the current coin of everybodys talk takes the place of interest suddenly she caught a face which she knew when a girl has been travelling about for five years she sees a great many faces this was a face which she remembered perfectly well yet could not at first place it in any scene or assign it to any date then she recollected and she walked boldly across the room and stood before the owner of that face you have forgotten me she said abruptly iican i ever have known you he asked will you shake hands mr stephenson you were dick stephenson five years ago have you forgotten armorel of samson island in scilly no he had not forgotten that young lady but he would never have known her thus changedthus dressed where is your friend roland lee dick stephenson changed colour i have not seen him for a long time we are no longerexactlyfriends why not she asked with severity have you done anything bad how have you offended him no no certainly not he coloured more deeply i have done nothing bad at all he added with much indignation have you deserted him then i thought men never gave up their friends come to see me mr stephenson you shall tell me where he is and what he is doing in the press of the crowd as they were going away she heard mr jagenals voice you are burning the candle at both ends alec he was saying you cannot possibly go on painting writing editing your paper riding in the park and going out every evening as you do now no mans constitution can stand it young gentleman curb your activity be wise in time chapter iii the cleverest man in london alec feildingeverybody even those who had never seen him called him alecstood before the fire in his own den in his hand he held a manuscript which he was reading with great care making dabs and dashes on it with a thick red pencil sometimes he called the place his studio sometimes his study no other man in london i believe has so good a right to call his workshop by either name no other man in london certainly is so well known both for pen and pencil to be at once a poet a novelist an essayist and a painter and to do all these things well if not splendidly is given to few the room was large and lofty as becomes a studio a heavy curtain hung across the door the carpet was thick there was a great fireplace as deep and broad as that of an old hall the fire burning on bricks in the ancient style above the fireplace there was no modern overmantel but dark panels of oak carved in flowers and grapes with a coat of armshis own he claimed descent from the noble house of feilding and in the centre panel his own portrait let into the wall without a framethe work was executed by the most illustrious portraitpainter of the daythe face full of thought the eyes charged with feeling the features clear regular and classical a beautiful portrait with every point idealised three sides of the room were fitted with bookshelves as becomes a study and these were filled with books the fourth side was partly hung with tapestry and partly adorned with armour and weapons here were also two small pictures representing the illustrious alec in childhoodthe light of future genius already in his eyesand in early manhood a large library table littered with books manuscripts and proofs belonged to the study an easel before the north light and another table provided with palettes brushes paints and all the tools of the limning trade belonged to the studio the house which was in st johns wood stood in an old garden at the end of a culdesac off the main road it was therefore quiet the house itself was new built in the style now familiar and put up for the convenience of those who believe that there is nothing in the world to be considered except art therefore there was a spacious hall stairs broad enough for an ancient mansion led to the first floor and to the great studio there were also three or four small cupboards called bedrooms diningroom and anything else you might please but the studio was the real thing the house was built for the studio the place was charged with an atmosphere of peace intellectual calm reigned here art of all kinds abhors noise one could feel here the silence necessary for intellectual efforts of the highest order apart from the books and the easel and this silence the character of the occupant was betrayedor perhaps proclaimedby other things the furniture was massive the library table of the largest kind the easy chairs by the fire as solid and comfortable as if they had been designed for a club smokingroom a cabinet showed a collection of china behind glass the appointments down to the inkstand and the paperknife were large and solid all together spoke not only of the artist but of the successful artist not only of the man who works but of one who works with success and honour the man arrived the things also spoke of the splendid man the man who knows that success should be followed by the splendid life too often the successful man is a poorspirited creature who continues in the humble middleclass style to which he was born is satisfied with his suburban villa never wants a better house or one more finely appointed and has no craving for society what is success worth if one does not live up to it success is not an end it is the means it brings the power of getting the things that make lifewinehorsesthe best cook at the best clubsportthe society every day of beautiful and wellbred womenall these things the man who has succeeded can enjoy those who have not yet succeeded may envy the favourite of fortune as for his work this highly successful man owned that he could not desert the muse of painting any more than her sister of belleslettres happy would he be with either were tother dear charmer away happier still was he with both and they were not jealous they allowed himthese tender creaturesto love them both he was by nature polygamous perhaps therefore those who were invited to see his latest picturethe lucky few because you must not think that his studio was open on show sunday for all the world to seestayed when they had admired that production to talk of his latest poem or his latest story over the mantelshelf was quite a stack of invitations and really one hardly knows whether alec feilding was most to be envied for his success as a painterthough he painted little or for his storiesthough these were all shortmuch too short or for his versescertainly written in the most delightful vein of vers de societe or for his essays full of observation or for his social success which was undoubted and there is no doubt that there was not any man in london more envied or who occupied a more enviable position than alec feilding to be sure he deserved it because without any exception he was the cleverest man in town he owned and edited a paper of his owna weekly journal devoted to the higher interests of art it was called the muses nine it was illustrated especially by blocks from art books noticed in its columns in this paper his own things first appeared his verses his stories his essays the columns signed editor were the leading feature of the paper for which alone many people bought it every week the contents of these columns were always fresh epigrammatic and delightful in the stories a certain feminine quality lent piquancyit seemed sometimes as if a man could not have written these stories the verses always tripped lightly merrily and gracefully along an abbe de la cour in the last century might have served up such a weekly dish for the parisians had he been the cleverest man in paris alec feildings enemiesevery man who is rising or has risen has enemiesconsoled themselves for a success which could not be denied by sneering at the ephemeral character of his work it was for today tomorrow they said it would be flat this was not quite true but as it is equally true of nearly every piece of modern work the successful author could afford to disregard this criticism perhaps there may be here and there a writer who expects more than a limited immortality i do not know any but there may be some and these will probably be disappointed the enemies said further that his social successalso undoubtedwas due to his unbounded cheek this too was partly true because if one would rise at all one must possess that useful quality without it one will surely sink it is not to be denied that this young man walked into drawingrooms as if his presence was a favour that he spoke as one who delivers a judgment and that he professed a profound belief in himself with such gifts and gracesthe gift of painting the gift of verse the gift of fiction a handsome presence good manners and unbounded cheekalec feilding had already risen very high indeed for so young a man his enemies again said that he was looking out for an heiress his enemies as sometimes but not often happens spoke from imperfect knowledge every man has his weak points and should be careful to keep them to himselffriends may become enemiesand to let no one know them or suspect them as for the weak points of alec feildinghad his enemies known them but you shall see he sat down at his librarytable and began to copy the manuscript that he had been reading it was a laborious task first because copying work is always tedious and next because he was making alterationschanging names and placesand leaving out bits he worked on steadily for about half an hour then there was a gentle tap at the door and his servantwho looked as solemn and discreet as if he had been charles the seconds confidential clerk of the backstairscame in noiselessly on tiptoe and whispered a name alec placed the manuscript and his copy carefully in a drawer and nodded his head you have already seen the man who came in five years older and a good deal alteredchanged perhaps for the worsebut then the freshness of twentyone cannot be expected to last the man who stayed three weeks in samson and promised a girl that he would return the man who broke that promise and forgot the girl he never went back to scilly perhaps he had grown handsomer his vandyke beard and moustache were by this time thicker and longer he was more picturesque in appearance than of old he still wore a brown velvet coat he looked still more what he wasan artist but his cheek was thin and pale dark rings were round his eyes his face was gloomy he wore the look of wastethe waste of energy and of purpose it is not good to see this look in the eyes of a young man you sent for me he said with no other greeting i did come in is the door shut ive got some good news for you heavens you look as if you wanted good news badly whats the matter man more debts and duns and i want to consult you a little about this picture of yourshe pointed to the easel illustration i want to consult you a little about this picture of yours mine no yours you have bought mepictures and all just as you like what does it matterherewithin these walls hush even here you should not whisper it the birds of the air you know take great care roland laughed but not mirthfully mine he repeated mine suppose i were to call together the fellows at the club and suppose i were to tell the story of the last three yearseh eh how a man was fooled on until he sold himself and became a slaveeh you cant tell that story roland you know some day i willi must alec feilding threw himself back in his chair crossed his legs and joined his fingers it is an attitude of judicial remonstrance come roland he said smiling blandly let us have it out it galls sometimes doesnt it but remember you cant have everythingcome now if you were to tell the fellows at the club truthfully the whole story they would i dare say be glad to get such a beautiful pile of stones to throw at me one more reputation built on pretence and humbugeh yes the little edifice which you and i have reared together with so much care would be shattered at a single stroke wouldnt it you could do that you can always do that but at some little cost to yourselfsome little cost remember roland remarked that the cost or consequences of that little exploit might be condemned truly if you will but not until you realise what they are now my version of the story is this there was oncethree years agoa fellow who had failed the academy wouldnt accept his pictures no one would buy them and yet he had some power and true feeling but he could not succeed he could not get anybody to buy his pictures and then he was an extravagant kind of man he was head over ears in debt he liked to lead the easy lifedinner and billiards at the cluball the rest of it then there was another manan old schoolfellow of hisa man who wanted for purposes of his own a reputation for genius in more than one branch of art he wanted to seem a master of painting as well as poetry and fiction this man addressed the failure he said unsuccessful greatness i will buy your pictures of you on the simple condition that i may call them mine the failure hesitated at first naturally he was loth to write himself down a failure everybody would be then he consented he promised to paint no more in the style in which he had failed except for this other man then the other man who knew his way about called his friends together set up a picture painted by the failure on an easel bought the tools laid them out on the tablethere they areand launched himself upon the world as an artist as well as a poet and author a fraud wasnt he yet it paid both menthe fraud and the failure for the fraud knew how to puff the work and to get it puffed and praised and noticed everywhere he made people talk about it he had paragraphs about it he got critics to treat hisor the failurespictures seriously in fact he advertised them as successfully and as systematically as if he had been a soapman is this true so far quite true go onfraud i willfailure then the price of the pictures went up the fraud was able to sell them at a price continually rising and the failure received a price in proportion he shared in the proceeds the fraud gave him two thirds is that true two thirds he ran your price failure from nothing at all to four hundred and fifty poundsyour last and biggest price and he gave you two thirds all you had to do was to produce the pictures what he did was to persuade the world that they were great and valuable pictures is that true roland grunted three years ago you were at your wits end for the next days dinner you had borrowed of all your friends you had pawned your watch and chain you were face to face with povertyno starvation deny that if you can he turned fiercely on roland you cant deny it what are you now you have a good income you dine every day on the best of everything you do yourself well in every respect hang it roland you are an ungrateful dog you have ruined my life you have robbed me of my name let us stop heroics if you are useful to me i am ten times as useful to you because my dear boy without me you cannot live without you i can do very well indeed i have only to find another starving geniusthere are plenty aboutin order to keep up my reputation as a painter go to the club call the men together tell them if you like and what you like you have no proofs i can deny it and i can give you the sack and i can get that other starving genius to carry on the work roland made no reply why my dear fellowwhy should we quarrel what does it matter about a little reputation what is the good of your precious name to you when you are dead here you arepainting better and better every dayyour price risingyour position more assuredwhat on earth can any man want more as for me you are useful to me if you were not i should put an end to the arrangement that is understood very well then enough said now if you please we will look at the picture he got up and walked across the room to the easel roland followed submissively with hanging head he staggered as he went not with strong drink but with the rage that tore his heart it is really a very beautiful thing said the cleverest man in all london looking at it critically i think that even you have never done anything quite so good the picture showed a great rock rising precipitous from the seaat its base was a reef or projecting shelf the shags stood in a line on the top of the rock the seagulls flew around the rock and sailed merrily before the breeze there was a little sea on but not much a boat with a young man in it lay off the rock and a girl was on the reef standing among the long yellow seaweed the spray flew up the sides of the rock the sun was sinking what was it but one of rolands sketches made in the outer islands with armorel for his companion it is very good roland alec repeated if i am not so good a painter myself i am not envious i can appreciate and acknowledge good work under the circumstances rather an extraordinary speech but rolands gloomy face softened a little even at such a moment the artist feels the power of praise the other standing before the picture watched the softening of the face good work he repeated by way of question man it is splendid work i can feel the breath of the salt breeze i can see the white spray flying over the rock the girl stands out real and living it is a splendid piece of work roland i think it is better than the last the unlucky painter replied huskily i should rather think it is i expect to get a great name for this picturethe painter wincedand youyouthe painter will get a much more solid thingyou will get a big cheque ive sold it already no dealers this time it has been bought by a rich american three hundred is the figure i can offer you and heres your cheque he took it ready drawn and signed from his pocketbook roland lee received it but he let it drop from his fingers the paper fluttered to the floor he gazed upon the picture in silence well what are you thinking of i was thinking of the day when i made the sketch for that picture i remember what the girl said to me what the devil does it matter what the girl said all we care about is the picture i remember her very words you who have bought the picture can see the girl but i who painted it can hear her voice you are not going off into heroics again no no dont be afraid i am not going to tell you what she said only i told her being pleased with what she told me that she was a prophetess nobody ought ever to prophesy good things about a man for they never come to pass let them prophesy disappointment and ruin and shame and then they always come true my god what a prophecy was hers and what has come of it i have sold my genius which is my soul i have traded it away it is the sin unforgiven in this world and in the next when you give over tragedy and blank verse oh i have done i should like to ask you a question ask it the foregroundthe seaweeds lying over the boulders does the light fall quite naturally i hardly understandlook here if the sunlight you to pretend to be a painter roland snorted impatiently you to talk about lights and shadows man alive i wonder you havent been found out ages ago the light falls this waythis wayseehe turned the painting about to show how it fell oh i understand yes yes i see now alec seemed not to resent this language of contempt is there anything else you want to know before i go perhaps you wish the sea painted black cornish coast again i suppose somewhere that way what does it matter where you put it call it a view on primrose hill he stooped and picked up the cheque he looked at it savagely for a moment as if he would like to tear it into a thousand fragments then he crammed it into his pocket and turned to go my american said alec who rolls in money is ready to buy another i think i can make an advance of fifty shall we say three hundred and fifty and shall we expect the painting in three months or so before the summer holidayssay you will become rich old man as for this fellow he is going to the new gallery go and gaze upon it and say to yourself this was worth to me three hundredthree hundred how many men at the club roland can command three hundred for a picture thirty is nearer their figure and your own dear boy would have continued to stand at double ducks egg if it had not been for me trust me for running up your price our interests my dear roland are identical and indivisible i think you are the only painter in history whose name will remain unknown though his works will live as long as the pigments keep their colour fortune is yours and fame is mine you have got the best of the bargain curse you and your bargain pleasant words rolandhis face darkened pleasant words if you please or perhaps i know now what is the reason of this outbreak i heard last night a rumour youve been taking opium again it isnt true if it was what does that matter to you this my friend the partnership exists only so long as the work continues to improve if bad habits spoil the quality of the work i shall dissolve the partnership and find that other starving geniusplenty plenty plenty about nothing shakes the nerves more quickly than opium nothing destroys the finer powers of head and hand more surely dont let me hear any more about opium dont fall into bad habits if you want to go on making an income and dont let me have to speak of this again now there is no more to be said i think well we part friends tata dear boy roland flung himself out of the room with an interjection of great strength not found in the school grammars alec feilding returned to his table rolands a great fool he murmured because there isnt a gallery in london that wouldnt jump at his pictures and he could sell as fast as he could paint a great fool he is but it would be very difficult for me to find another man so good and such a fool on fools and their folly the wise man flourishes chapter iv master of all the arts this unreasonable person dispatched and the illustrious artists doubts about his lights and shadows dispelled alec feilding resumed his interrupted task that is to say he took the manuscript out of the drawer and went on laboriously copying it so great a writer whose time was so precious might surely give out his copying work lesser men do this for half an hour he worked on then the servant tapped at the door and came in again noiselessly as before to whisper a name alec nodded and once more put back the manuscript in the drawer the visitor was a young lady she was of slight and slender figure dressed quite plainly and even poorly in a cloth jacket and a stuff frock her gloves were shabby her features were fine but not beautiful the eyes bright and the mouth mobile but the forehead too large for beauty she carried a black leather roll such as those who teach music generally carry about with them she was quite young certainly not more than twoandtwenty effie he looked round surprised may i come in for two minutes i will not stay longer indeed i should be so sorry to waste your time i am sure you would effie he gave her his hand without rising precious timemy timethere is so little of it therefore child i have brought you she said another little poem i think it is the kind of thing you likein the vers de societe style she unrolled her leather case and took out a very neatly written paper he read it slowly then he nodded his head approvingly and read it aloud how long does it take you to knock off this kind of thing effie it took me the whole of yesterday this morning i corrected it and copied it out do you like it you are a clever little animal effie and you shall make your fortune yes it is very good very good indeed austin dobson himself is not better it is very good light tripping gracefulin good taste it is very good indeed leave it with me effie if i like it as well tomorrow as i do today you may depend upon seeing it in the next number oh she blushed a rosy red with the pleasure of being praised indeed it is a pleasure which never palls the old man who has been praised all his life is just as eager for more as the young poet who is only just beginning oh you really think it is good i do indeed the best proof is that i am going to buy it of you it shall go into the editors columnmy own columnin the place of honour yes she replied but doubtfullyand she reddened again for a different reason oh mr feilding she said with an effort i am so happy when i see my verses in printin your papereven without my name it makes me so proud that i hardly dare to say what i want say it effie get it off your mind you will feel better afterwards well then it cannot be anything to youso great and high with your beautiful stories and your splendid pictures what is a poor little set of verses to you go ongo on his face clouded and his eyes hardened in the paper it doesnt matter a bit it isit islaterwhen they come out all together in a little volumewithwith go on i say he sat upright his chair half turned his hands on the arms his face severe and judicial with your name on the titlepage oh that is troubling your mind is it when the critics praise the poems and praise the poetoh is it right mr feilding is it right upon my word he pushed back his chair and rose a tall man of six feet frowning angrilyso that the girl trembled and tottered upon my word thisfrom you this from the girl whom i have literally kept from starvation miss effie wilmot perhaps you will tell me what you mean havent i bought your verses havent i polished and corrected them and made them fit to be seen am i not free to do what i please with my own yesyesyou buy them but iohi write them look here child i can have no nonsense before i took these verses of you had you any opening or market for them no none at all nobody would buy them they were not even returned by editors they were thrown into the basket very well i buy them on the condition that i do what i please with them i give you three poundsthree poundsfor a poem if it is good enough for me to lick into shape then it becomes my own it is a bargain when you leave off wanting money you will leave off bringing me verses then i shall look for another girl there are thousands of girls about who can write verses as good as these the girl remained silent what her employer said was perfectly true and yetand yetit was not right what more do you want he asked brutally i am the author of these poems she said and you are not within these walls i allow you to say sothis once take care never to say so again outside these walls if you say so i will bring an action against you for libel and slander and defamation of character remember that you had better however take these verses and go away he flung them at her feet we will put an end to the arrangement no noi consent she humbly stooped and picked them up do what you like with them i am too poor to refuse do what you please it is your interest certainly to consent why i paid you last year a hundred pounds a hundred pounds theres an income for a girl of twenty well effie i forgive you but no more nonsense and give over crying for now she was sobbing and crying look here effiehe laid his hand on herssome day before long i will put your verses in another column with your name at the endeffie wilmot come will that do oh if you would if you really would i really will child dont think i care much about the thing what does it matter to me whether i am counted a writer of society verses it pleased me that the world should think me capable of these trifles while i am elaborating a really ambitious poem one more little volume and i shall have done besides all this time you are improving when you burst upon the world it will be with wings fullfledged and flightsustained that you will soar to the stars fair poetess i will make your fame assured be comforted she looked up tearful and happy oh forgive me she said yes i will do everythingexactlyas you want the world wants another poetess you shall be that sweet singer let me be the first to acknowledge the gift divine he bowed and raised her hand and kissed the fingers of her shabby glove now child he said your visit has gained you another three poundshere they are she took the money blushing again the glowing prospect warmed her heart but the three golden sovereigns chilled her again she had parted with her childher own it was goneand he would call it his and pretend to be the father and yet he was going to make such splendid amends to her how is your brother he is always the same he works all day at his play in the afternoon he creeps out for a little on his crutches in the future mr feilding we are both going to be happy he with his dramas and i with my poems is his drama nearly ready very nearly tell him to let me read it i can at least advise him if you will oh you are so kind what we should have done without your help and the money you have given me i do not know you are welcome sweet singer and heavenly poet the great man took her hand and pressed it now be thankful that you came here you have cleared your mind of doubts and you know what awaits you in the future bring your brothers little play i should likeyes i should like to see what sort of a play he has written she went away happier for the prophecy in the dead of night she dreamed that she saw mr alec feilding carried along in a triumphal car to the temple of fame the goddess herself flying aloft in a white satin robe blew the trumpet and a nymph flying lower downin white linenput on the laurel crown and held it steady when the chariot bumped over the ruts it was her crownher ownthat adorned those brows is it right she asked again is it right mr feilding when she was gone proceeded to copy out the poem carefully in his own handwriting adding a few erasures and corrections so as to give the copy the hallmark of the poets study then he threw the original upon the fire there he said if miss effie wilmot should have the audacity to claim these things as her own at least i have the originals in my own handwritingwith my own corrections upon them too as they were sent to the printer yes effie my dear some day perhaps your verses shall appear with your name to them not while they are so good though i only wish they were a little more masculine again he lugged out that manuscript and resumed his copying laboriously toiling on the clock ticked and the ashes dropped and the silence was profound while he performed this intellectual feat at the stroke of noon the servant disturbed him a third time he put away his work in the drawer and went out to meet this visitor this time it was none other than a lady of qualitya grande dame de par le monde she came in splendid attire sailing into the studio like some richly adorned pinnace or royal yacht a lady of a certain age but still comely in the eyes of man lady frances cried alec this is indeed unexpected and you know that it is the greatest honour for me to wait upon you yes yes i know that but i thought i should like to see you as you arein your own studio so i came i hope not at an inconvenient time no time could be inconvenient for a visit from you i dont know your model might be sitting to you to be sure you are not a figurepainter but one always supposes that models are standing to artists all day long goodlooking women too i believe perhaps you have got one hidden away behind the screen just as they do on the stage i will look she put up her glasses and walked across the room to look behind the screen no she has gone oh is this your new picture he bowed i hope you like it i do she said looking at it it seems to me the very best thing you have done oh it is really beautiful do you know mr feilding that you are a very wonderful man alec laughed pleasantly of course he knew if you think so he said you write the most beautiful verses and the most charming stories you paint the most wonderful pictures you belong to society and you go everywhere how do you do it how do you find time to do it i suppose you never want any sleep poet painter novelist journalist are you a sculptor as well by chance not yet perhaps glutton are you a dramatist againnot yet perhaps some time insatiate you are a master of all the arts alec feilding ma he laughed pleasantly again you are the cleverest man in all london well i sent you another story yesterday you did i was about to write and thank you for it is it a true story quite true it happened in my husbands family thirty years ago they are not very proud of it you can dress it up somehow with new names quite so i shall rewrite the whole i dont mind it is a great pleasure to me to see the stories in print and no one suspects poor little me are they so very badly written the style is a littlejust a little may i sayjerky but the stories are admirable do let me have some more lady frances remember no one is to know where you get them a masonic secrecy forms part of my character i even put my own name to them for greater security he did every week he put his own name to stories which he got from people like this lady of quality that ought to disarm suspicion on the other hand everybody must know that you cannot invent these things alec laughed most people give me credit for inventing even your stories by the way she said are you coming to my dinner next week with the greatest pleasure if you dont come you shall have no more stories drawn from the domestic annals and the early escapades of the british aristocracy i assure you lady frances i look forward with the greatest very well then i shall expect you and remembersecrecy she laid her finger on her lips and vanished the smile faded out of the young mans face he sat down again and once more set himself to work doggedly copying out the manuscript which was indeed none other than the story furnished him by lady frances it was going to appear in the next weeks issue of the journal with his name at the end was not alec feilding the cleverest allround man in the whole of londonomnium artium magister chapter v only a simple service mrs elstree took the card that the maid brought her she started up mechanically touched her hairwhich was of the feathery and fluffy kindand her dress with the womans instinct to see that everything was in order the quick colour rose to her cheekperhaps from the heat of the fire yes she said i am at home she was sitting beside the fire in the drawingroom of armorels flat it was a cold afternoon in march outside a black east wind raged through the streets it was no day for driving or for walking within soft carpets easychairs and bright fires invited one to stay at home this lady indeed was one of those who love warmth and physical ease above all other things actually to be warm lazily warm without any effort to feel warmth afforded her a positive and distinct physical pleasure just as a cat is pleased by being stroked therefore though a book lay in her lap she had not been reading it is much pleasanter to lie back and feel warm with halfclosed eyes in a peaceful room than to be led away by some impetuous novelist into uncomfortable places cold places fatiguing places she started however and the book fell to the floor where it remained and she rose to her feet when the owner of the card came in the relict of jerome elstree was still young and grief had as yet destroyed none of her beauty she looked better perhaps in the morningwhich says a great deal alec she murmuredher eyes as soft as her voice i thought you would come this afternoon are you quite alone mrs elstree he asked with a look of warning quite mr feilding and since the door is shut and we are quite alonewhythen she laughed held out both her hands and put up her face like a child he took her hands and bent to kiss her lips zoe he said you grow lovelier every day last night he kissed her again lovelier than philippa what is philippa beside you an iceberg beside aa garden of flowers there is beauty in icebergs i have read never mind philippa dear zoe she is nothing to us i dont mind her a bit alec if you dont if you begin to mind her but we will wait until that happens why are you here today i have come to call upon mrs elstree widow of my poor friend jerome elstree ce pauvre jerome the tears come into my eyesin fact they did at that momentlookwhen i think of him so often have i spoken of his virtues and his untimely fate that he has really lived i never before understood that there are ghosts of men who never lived as well as ghosts of the dead and i came to call upon your charge miss rosevean yesshe said this dubiously perhaps jealouslyso i supposed why did you send me here alec you have always got some reason for everything there was no need for my comingi was doing as well as i expect to do the young man looked about the room without replying to this question someone he said presently has furnished this room who knows furniture it was armorel herself i have no tasteas you know and how do you get on with her are you happy here zoe i am as happy as i ever expect to beuntil yes yes he interrupted impatiently you like her then i like her as much as i can like any woman you know alec i am not greatly in love with my own sex if there were no other women in the world than just enough to dress me get my dinner and keep my house clean i should not murmur eve was the happiest of women in spite of the difficulties she must have had in keeping up with the fashion because you see she was the only woman no doubt and now tell me about this girl she is rich to be rich is everything money makes an angel of every woman when i was eighteen and first met you alec i was rich then you saw the wings sticking out visibly one on each shoulder didnt you they are gone nowat least she looked over her shoulder i see them no longer i heard she was rich where did the money come from it has been saving up for i dont know how long the girl is only twentyone and she has about thirty thousand pounds besides all kinds of precious things worth i dont know how much jagenal told me she was comfortably offcomfortably he saidbutthirty thousand pounds the mere thought of so much makes your eyes glow quite poetically alec write a poem on thirty thousand pounds well that is what she has and all her own without any drawbacks no nasty poor relationsno profligate brothersto nibble and gnaw she has not either brother or sisteran enviable lot when one has money when one has no money a brothera successful brothermight be useful and how do you get on with her i think we do pretty well together but my post is precarious why because the young woman is pretty rich and masterful it is a curious thing about women that the most masterful soonest find their master you mean that she will marry if she gets engaged being rich she will certainly marry at once until she marries i believe we can get on together because she is totally independent of me this afternoon for example she has gone out to look at pictures somewhere with a girl she has picked up somehowa girl who writes but my dear zoe you must look after her dont let her pick up girls and make friendships you are here to look after her i hoped that you would gain her complete confidencebecome indispensable to her oh that is why you sent me here pray my dear alec what can armorel be to you nothing dear child he replied patting her soft hand that will bring any discord between you and me butmake yourself indispensable and necessary to her you will tell me i dare say presently what you mean but you dont know this young islander necessary to me she is as you know necessary to her i shall never become we have nothing in common i can do nothing for her at all except go out to theatres and concerts and things in the evening even then our tastes clash i like to laugh she likes to sit solemnly with big eyes staringsoas if she was receiving inspiration i like comic operas she likes serious plays i like dance music she likes classical music i like the fools paradise she likesthe other kind where they all behave so well and are under no illusions in fact armorel takes herself quite seriously all round of course a girl with such a fortune can take herself anyhow she pleases she knows how to dress apparently most advanced girls disdain dress but she is not an advanced girl she is only a girl who knows a great deal she is not in the least emancipated why she still professes the christian religion she is just a girl who has set herself resolutely to learn all she can she has been about it for five years when she began i understand that she knew nothing what she means to do with her knowledge i have not learned she talks french and german and italian you have heard her play very well you cant beat that you shall see some of her drawings they are rather in your style i think a highly cultivated girl that is all a female prig a consciously superior person not a bit rather humbleminded but masterful and independent where she fails is of course in ordinary talk she cant talkshe can only converse she doesnt know the pictures and painters and poets and novelists of the dayshe doesnt know a single person in society she doesnt know any personal history at all and she doesnt care about any that is armorel i see he replied thoughtfully things will be difficult i am afraid what things oh there is another point in which she differs from people of society yes when you and i dear alec think and talk of people we conclude that they are exactly like ourselvesdo we not quite worldly and selfish you know everyone with his little show to run for himself now armorel on the other hand concludes that everyone is likenot usbut herself do you catch the difference there is a difference you know sometimes zoe i seem not to understand you but never mind under your influence i have no influence at all with her i never shall have but my dear zoe why are you here i want youi repeatto exercise an overwhelming influence oh it is impossible consideryou who know me so wellhow can i influence a girl who is always seeking after great things she wants everything noble and lofty and pure she has what they call a great souland ioh alec you know that i belong to the infinitely little souls there are a great great number of us but we are very contemptible let us think he replied let us contrive and devise some way enough about armorel tell me now about yourself i am always the same you have come perhaps this afternoon she murmured softly to bring me some new hopeoh alecat lastsome hope i have no new hope to give you child both sat in silence looking into the firelight it is seven yearsseven years said zoe since i had my great quarrel with philippa she was eighteen thenand so was ii charged her with throwing herself at your head you know so she did so she does still why the woman cant conceal even now that she loves you i saw it in her eyes last night i saw it in her attitude when she was talking to you she swore after the row we had that she would never speak to me again but you see she has broken that vow i was eighteen then and i was rich a good deal richer than philippa ever will be when you and i became engaged i was twentyone that is four years ago alec yet a year or two and the girl you wereengaged towill be thin and faded for your sake my dear boy i hope that you will not keep her waiting very much longer before you present her to the world my dear child could i help the smash that camethe smash and scandal when the whole town was ringing with your fathers smash and his suicide and the ruin of i dont know how many people was that the moment for us to step forward and take hands before the world no you certainly could not as a man of the world you would have been justified in breaking off the thingespecially as it was only a day or two old i could not let you go zoe he said with a touch of real tenderness i was madly in love i think you were alec i really think that at the time you were truly and madly in love else you would never have done a thing of which you repented the next day i have never repented dear zoenever once perhaps you calculated that something would be saved out of the smash perhaps for once in your life you never calculated at all upon anything welli consented to keep the thing a secret you know that it was necessary you said so i obeyed but four yearsfour yearsand no prospect of a termination consider she pleaded as she had spoken before in the same soft caressing murmuring tone i do consider zoe you can have your freedom again i have no right nonsense my freedom it is your own that you want my freedom she repeated but without raising her voice mine what could i do with itnow whither could i turn do not i advise you think that i will ever while i live restore your freedom to you i spoke in your own interest believe me i am now what you have made me you know what that is you know what i was four years ago i have advised you it is true no you have led me at the moment of my greatest trouble you made me break away from my own people who were sorry for my misfortunes and would have kept me among them in my own circle there was no reason for me to leave them the wreck of my fathers fortune was not imputed to me you persuaded me to assert my own independence and to go upon the stage for which i was as well fitted as for the kingdom of heaven i hopedi thoughtthat you would succeed no what you hoped and intended was to keep me in your power you would not let me go and you could notor would not could not my child i could not for four years i have endured the humiliations of the actress who is a failure and can only take the lowest parts you know what i have endured and yet oh alec your love is indeed a noble gift and now for your sake i am here playing a part for you i am the young widow of the man who never existed i make up a hundred lies every day to a girl who believes every wordwhich makes it more disgraceful and more horrible when one knows that she is disbelieved it is different zoe you know my position very well indeed you live in a little palace you keep your manservant and your two horses you go every day into some kind of good society it is necessary my position demands it your position my friend has nothing to do with it if you stayed at home every evening just as many copies of your paper would be sold you spend all this money on yourself alec because you are a selfish person and indulgent and because you like to make a great show of success you do not understand oh yes i do you paint lovely pictures which you sell you write admirable stories and excellent versesat least i suppose they are admirable and excellent you put them into a paper which is your own yesyes but all these things leave me as poor as i was four years ago he got up and stood before the fire looking into it then he walked across to the window and gazed into the street then he returned and looked into the fire again this restlessness may be a sign that something is on a mans mind zoe he said at length without looking at her your impatience makes you unjust you do not understand things have come to a crisis what kind of a crisis a financial crisis i must have money then go and make it paint more pictures write more poetry make money as other men do it is very noble and grand to pretend that you only work when you please but it isnt business and it isnt true againyou do not understand i must have money in a short time or else elsewhat may happen alec she leaned forward losing her murmuring manner for the first time i mayi mustbecome bankrupt that to me signifies social ruin you have something more to say wont you say it at once if i can get over this difficulty it will be all rightmy anxieties over i thought zoe when i sent you here that with a girl rich mistress of her own of age it would be easy for you to wind yourself into her confidence and borrowor beg or somehow get what i want out of her to borrow would be best how much do you want tell me exactly i want before the end of next month about l say l that is a very large sum of money not to this girl make her lend it to you make up some story beg it or borrow itand he laid his hand upon her shoulder but she made no movement in reply he stooped and kissed her head but she did not look up zoei swearif you will do this for me our long and weary waiting shall be at an end i will acknowledge everything i will give up this extravagant life we will settle down like a couple of honest bourgeois we will live over the shop if you likethat is the publishing office of the paper he took her hand and raised it to his lips but she made no response would she ever get the money back again perhaps how can i tell even for the bribe you offer alec i am afraid i cannot do it we will try together we will lay ourselves out to attract the girl to win her confidence consider she is alone she is in our hands yes yes but you do not know her alec if i cannot succeed what will you do i must look out for some girl with money and get engaged to her the mere fact of an engagement would be enough for me yes she said quickly it would have to be will you get engaged toto philippa no philippa will only have money at the death of her father and mothernot before philippa is out of the question is there nobody among all your fine friends who will lend you the money no one we do not lend money to each other we go on as if there were no money difficulties in the world as well as no diseases no old age no dying we do not speak of money friendship in society has its limits yes i see but cant you borrow it in the usual way of business people i should have to show books and enter into unpleasant explanations you see zoe the paper has got a very good name but rather a small circulation everybody sees it but very few buy it and so you heard of armorel and you thought that here was a chance you say to me in plain words if you get this money there shall be an end of the false position is that so that is exactly what i do say and swear zoe it is a very simple thing you have only to persuade the girl to lend you this money or to advance it or to invest it by your agencyor somethinga very simple and easy thing you love me well enough to do me such a simple service i love you well enough i suppose she replied sadly to do everything you tell me to do a simple service only to deceive and plunder this girl who believes us all to be honourable and truthful oh we shall find a waysome wayto pay her back dont be afraid and dont go off into platitudes zoeyou are much too prettyand when it is done and you are openly before the world i know you well enough to know how much happiness to expect i am a fool all women are fools philippa is a fool and ive set my foolish heart onyou if i failif i failher words sank to the softest and gentlest murmuryou are going to cast about for an heiress and you will get engaged to her and thenthenwe shall see dear alec what will happen then she sat up her cheek fiery and her eyes flashing though her voice was so soft hush she whispered i hear armorels step they heard her voice as well outside loud and clear come to my own room she said what you want is there this way it is the girl with herthe girl who writes they have gone into her own roomher boudoirher studywhere she works half the day the girl lives with her brother close by they listened silent with hushed breath like conspirators poor armorel said zoe if she only knew what we are plotting she thinks me the most truthful of women and all i am here for is to cheat her out of her money dont you think i had better make a clean breast and ask her to give me the money and let me go begin today said alec begin to talk about me interest her in me let her know how great and good hush then they heard her voice again in the hall nonoyou must come this evening bring archie with you i will play and he shall listen you shall both listen and then great thoughts will come to you always great thoughtsgreat thoughtsgreat pictures zoe murmured and we are so infinitely little brother worm shall we crawl into some hole and hide ourselves then the door opened and armorel herself appeared fresh and rosy in spite of the cold wind my dear child said zoe softly looking up from her cushions come in and sit down you must be perishing with the east wind do sit down and be comfortable you met mr feilding last night i believe the visitor remained for a quarter of an hour armorel had been to see a certain picture in the national gallery he talked of pictures just as the night before he had talked of music that is to say as one who knows all the facts about the painters and their works and their schools their merits and their defects he knew and could talk fluently the language of the art critic just as he knew and could talk the language of the musical critic armorel listened now and then she made a remark but her manner lacked the reverence with which most maidens listened to this thricegifted darling of the muses she actually seemed not to care very much what he said zoe for her part lay back in her cushions in silence how do you like him she asked when their visitor left them i dont know i havent thought about him he talks too much i think and he talks as if he was teaching no one has a better right to talk with authority but we are free to listen or not as we please why has he the right to teach everybody my dear child alec feilding is the cleverest man in all london he must be very clever then what does he do he does everythingpoetry painting fictioneverything oh you will show me his poetry perhaps some time and his pictures i suppose we shall see in may somewhere he doesnt look as if he was at all great but one may be wrong my dear armorel you are a fortunate girl though you do not understand your good fortune aleci am privileged to call him alechas conceived a great interest in you oh not of the common love kind that you despise so muchnothing to do with your beaux yeuxbut on account of your genius he was greatly taken with your playing if you will show him your pictures he will give you instruction that may be useful to you he wants to know you my dear well said armorel not in the least overwhelmed he can if he pleases i suppose since he is a friend of yours that is not all he wants your friendship as a sister in art such a mansuch an offer armorel must not be taken lightly i am not drawn towards him said the girl in fact i think i rather dislike his voice which is domineering and his manner which seems to me selfconscious and rather pompous and his eyes which are too close together zoe if he were not the cleverest man in london i should say that he was the most crafty zoe laughed what man discovers by experiment and experience she murmured incoherently woman discovers at a glance and yet they say chapter vi the other studio the failure was at work in his own studio not the large and lofty chamber fitted and furnished as if for michael angelo himself which served for the fraud not at all the failure did his work in a simple secondfloor back a chamber in a commonplace lodginghouse of keppel street bloomsbury nowhere in the realms of art was there a more dismal studio the walls were bare save for one picture which was turned round and showed its artistic back the floor had no carpet there was no other furniture than a table strewn and littered with sketches paints palettes brushes there were canvases leaning against the wall there was a portfolio also leaning against the wall there was an easel and the man standing before it and there was a single chair for three years roland lee had withdrawn from his former haunts and companions no one knew now where he lived he had not exhibited he had resigned his membership at the club he had gone out of sight many london men every year go out of sight it is quite easy you have only to leave off going to the wellknown places of resort very soonso soon that it is humiliating only to think of itmen cease asking where you are then they cease speaking of you you are clean gone out of their memoryyou and your worksit is as if the sea had closed over you there is not left a trace or a sign of your existence perhaps now and then something may revive your name some little adventure may be remembered some frolic of youthfor the restnothing silence oblivion it does indeed humiliate those who look on when such an accident revived the memory of roland lee one would ask another what had become of him and no one knew but of course he had gone downdowndown when a man disappears it means that he sinks he had gone out of sight therefore he had gone under yet when you climb you can never get so high as to be invisible even the president ra is not invisible again the higher that a balloon soars the smaller does it grow but the higher a man climbs up the hill of fame the bigger does he show it is quite certain that when a man has disappeared he has sunk the only questionand this can never be answeredis what becomes of the men who sink one man i heard ofalso like roland an artistwho has been traced to a certain tavern where he fuddles himself every evening and where you may treat with him for the purchase of his pictures at ten shillingsay or even five shillingsapiece and two scholarsscholars gone underi heard of the other day they now reside in the same lodginghouse it is close to the grays inn road one lives in the garret and the other occupies the cellar in the evening they get drunk together and dispute on points of the finer scholarship but this only accounts for three and where are all the rest of roland lee nobody knew anything there was no story or scandal attached to him he was no drinker he was no gambler he was no profligate but he had vanished yet he had not gone faronly to keppel street which is really a central place here he occupied a second floor and lived alone nobody ever called upon him he had no friends sometimes he sat all day long in his studio doing nothing sometimes he went forth and wandered about the streets in the evening he dined at restaurants where he was certain to meet none of his old friends he lived quite alone as to that rumour concerning opium it was an invention of his employer and proprietor he did not take opium day after day however he grew more moody what developments might have followed in this lonely life i know not opium perhaps whisky perhaps melancholia perhaps and from melancholiagood lord deliver us one thing saved him the work which filled his soul with rage also kept his soul from madness when the spirit of his art seized him and held him he forgot everything he worked as if he was a free man he forgot everything until the time came when he had to lay down his palette and to come back to the reality of his life some men would have accepted the position there were as we have seen compensations of a solid and comfortable kind had he chosen to work his hardest these golden compensations might have run into four figures some men might have sat and laughed among their friends forgetting the ignominy of their slavery not so roland his chains jangled as he walked they cut his wrists and galled his ankles they filled him with so much shame that he was fain to go away and hide himself and in this manner he enjoyed the great success which his employer had achieved for his pictures to arrive at the success for which you have always longed and prayedand to enjoy it in such a fashion oh mockery of fate this morning he was at work contentedlywith ardour he was beginning a picture from one of his sketches it was to be another study of rocks and sea as yet there was little to show it was growing in his brain and he was so fully wrapped in his invention that he did not hear the door open and was not conscious that for the first time within three years he had a visitor she opened the door and stood for a moment looking about her the bare and dingy walls the scanty furniture the meanness of the place made her very soul sink within her for they cried aloud the story of the painter for five long years she had thought of him he was successful he was rising to the top of the tree he was conquering the worldso brave so strong so clever there was no height to which he could not rise she should find him splendid triumphant and yet modesther old friend the same but glorified and she found him thus in this dingy denso low so shabby consider if she had risen while he was sinking how great was now the gulf between them then she stepped into the room and stood beside the artist at his easel roland lee she whispered he started looked up and recognised her armorel he cried then strange to say instead of hastening to meet and greet her and to hold out hands of welcome he stood gazing at her stupidly his face changing colour from crimson to white his hair was unkempt she saw his cheeks worn his eyes haggard with deep lines round them and his dress was shabby and uncared for you have not forgotten me then she said forgotten you no how could i forget you then are you pleased to see me shake hands with me roland lee he complied but with restraint have you dropped from the clouds he asked how did you find me here i met your old friend dick stephenson he told me that you lived here you are no longer friends but he has seen you going in and coming out that is how i found you are you well roland yes i am well does all go well with you my old friend why not you seei have got a magnificent studio there is every outward sign of wealth and prosperity and if you look into any artcriticisms you will find the papers ringing with my name you are changed armorel passed over the bitterness of this speech you are a little older perhaps she did not tell him how haggard and worn he looked how unkempt and unhappy let me see some of your work she said the picture on the easel was only in its very first stage she looked about the room nothing on the walls but one picture with its face turned round may i look at this she turned it round it was the picture of herself the princess of lyonesse the sketch of which he had finished on the last day of his holiday oh she cried i remember this and you have kept it rolandyou have kept it i am glad yes i have kept the only picture which i can call my own was i like that in those days you are like that now only the little princess has become a tall queen yes yes i remember you said then that if i should ever look like this you would be proved to be a painter indeed roland you are a painter indeed no no he said i am nothingnothing at all we were talkingwhen you made this sketchof how one can grow to his highest and noblest i have grown to my lowest he replied but youyou what has happened my friend you told me so much once about yourselfyou taught me so muchyou put so many new things into my headyou must tell me more what has happened nothing why are you here in this poor room i have been to studios in rome and florence and paris and vienna they are lovely rooms fit for a man whose mind is always full of lovely images and sweet thoughts but thisthis room is not a studio it is an ugly little prison how can light and colour visit such a place it explains itself it proclaims aloudfailurefailurefailure this picture is not failure my name is unknown i work on like a mole under ground i am a failure you have seen dick stephenson what did he say of me he said that you must have left off working but you have not what does it matter how much or how long a failure goes on working have you lost heart roland heart and hope and faith everything is lost armorel you have lost your courage because you have failed but many men have failed at firstgreat men robert browning failed for years you were brave once roland you were able to say that if you knew you were doing good work you cared nothing for the critics you see dick was right i no longer do any work i never send anything to the exhibitions but whywhywhy ask me no more questions armorel go away and leave me how beautiful and glorious you have grown child but i knew you would and i have gone down so low andandwell you see yes i remember how we talked of growing to our full height we did not think you see of the depths to which we might also drop there are awful depths which you could never guess he sank into the chair and his head dropped armorel stood over him the tears gathering into her eyes roland she laid her hand upon his shoulderthere is no action more sisterlysince i have found you i shall not let you go again it is five years since you went away you will tell me about yourself when you please i have a great deal to tell you dont you remember how sympathetic you used to be in the old days i want a great deal more sympathy now because i am five years older and i am trying so much i want you to hear me playyou were the first who ever praised my playing you know and you must see my drawings i have worked every day as i promised you i would i have remembered all your instructions come and see your pupils work my master he made no reply you live too much alone she went on dick stephenson told me that you have given up your club and that you go nowhere and that no one knows how you live you have dropped quite away from your old friends why did you do that you live in this dismal room by yourselfalone with your thoughts no wonder you lose courage and faith she opened the portfolio and drew out a number of the sketches why she said here are some of those you made with me here is castle bryheryou in the boat and i on the ledge among the seaweed under the great rockand the shags in a row on the top and here is porth cressaand here peninnisand here round island oh we have so many things to talk about will you come to see me you had better leave me alone armorel he said even you can do no good to me now when will you come seei will write down my address i have a flat and it is ever so much better furnished than this sir will you come tonight i shall be at home there will be no one but effie wilmot oh i am not going to talk about you but about myself i want your praise roland and your sympathy both were so readyonce will you come tonight you will drive me mad i think armorel will you come he shook his head i have got to tell you how i became rich if you will listen you must come and hear my news why there is no one but you in all london who knew me when i lived on samson alone with those old people you will come tonight roland again she laid her hand upon his shoulder i will ask no questions about younone at all you will tell me what you please about yourself but you must let me talk to you about myself as frankly as in the old days if you have got any kindly memory left of me at all roland you will come he rose and lifted his shameful eyes to hers so full of pity and of tears yes he said i will do whatever you tell me chapter vii a candid opinion youth in the london lodginghouse youth quite pooryouth ambitiousyouth with a possible futureyouth meditating great things walk along the streets of lodginglandthere are miles of such streetsand consider with trembling that the dingy houses contain thousands of young peopleboys and girlswho have come to the city of golden pavements to makenot a fortune unless that happens as wellbut their name in the long struggle before the lowest rung of the ladder is reached they endure hardness but they complain not everything is going to be made up to them in the splendid time to come something more than a year ago two such young people came up from the country and found shelter in a london lodginghouse where they could work and study until success should arrive they were boy and girl brother and sistertwins they had very little money and could afford no more than one sittingroom therefore one worked in the sittingroom and the other in a bedroom because their occupations demanded solitude the one in the sittingroom was the girl she was engaged in the pursuit of poetry she made verses continually every day unless she was reading verse she was either making or polishing or devising verses of all pursuits in the world this is at once the most absorbing and the most delightful it is also with the greater part of these who follow it the most useless thomas the rhymer sits down and takes his pen it is nine of the clock he considers he writes he scratches out he writes again he corrects again after ten minutes or so he looks up it is three in the afternoon the luncheon hour is past the morning is gone all he has to show for the six golden hours when an account of them is demanded will be a single stanza of a ballade and perhaps not a single editor will look at it to effie wilmot the girltwin thus engaged morning after morning the hours become moments and the days minutes the result and outcome of her labours you have already learned but she was young and she lived in hope a few more weeks and the great man her patron would have satisfied that whim of wishing to be thought a poet of society strange that one who painted pictures of such wonderful beauty who wrote such charming stories in such endless varietystories quaint and bizarre stories pathetic stories humorousshould so condescend what could a few simple versessuch as hersdo to increase his fame however that was nearly over she felt quite happy and lighthearted as happy as if like other poets she was writing things that would appear with her own name she pursued the light and airy fancies of her brain capturing one or two chaining them in the prison of her rhymes which of course were set to the oldnew tunes affected by the little poets of the day if they have got no message to deliver they can at least come on the stage and repeat over again the old things clad in dress revived we can keep on dressing up in the poets habit until the poet himself shall come along effie worked on sitting at the window poets can work anywhere though of course they ought to sit habitually on the sides of hills with hanging woods and mountainstreams and waterfalls but they can work just as well in a mean london lodging such as this where effie sat looking out if she looked through the curtain upon a most commonplace street we can allcommon spirits as well as poetsrise above our streets and houses and our dingy settingotherwise there would be no work done at all nay if we were all cockered up and daintily surrounded with things aesthetic and artistic and beautiful i believe we should be so happy that nobody would ever do anything the poet would murmur his thoughts in indolent rhyme by the fireside the musician would drop his fingers among the notes echoing faintly and imperfectly the music in his soulall for his own enjoyment the storyteller would tell his stories to his wife the dramatist would make plots without words for his children to act the painter would half sketch his visions and leave them unfinished art would die no such temptations were offered to effie the aesthetic movement had not touched that groundfloor front the shaky round table stood under the flaring gas which every night made her head ache the chiffonier contained in its recesses the tea and sugar and bread and butter and when the money ran to such luxuries her jam or her honey or her oranges there was one easychair and one armchair and before the window a small square table which had at least the merit of being firm and at this she wrote everybody knows this kind of room perfectly the poetic workshop is always kept locked no poet ever tells of the terrific struggles he has to encounter before he finally subdues his thought and compels it to walk or run in double harness of rhythm and rhyme no poet ever confesses how he sometimes has to let that thought go because he cannot subdue itnay the same discomfiture has been reported of those who like m jourdain speak in prose and no poet ever shows as a painter will readily show us the first sketch the first rough draft of a poem the unfinished lines the first feeble attempts at the rhythmic expression of a great thought let us respect the mystery of the crafthave we not all dabbled in verse and essayed to play upon the scrannelpipe it was towards noon however that effie was disturbed by the arrival of a visitor the event was so unusualso unprecedented eventhat no instructions had ever been given to the lodginghouse servant in the art of introducing callers she therefore opened the door and put in her heada gentleman missand went downstairs leaving the gentleman to walk in if he pleased you mr feilding effie cried springing to her feet oh this is indeed the great man took her hand my dear child he said i have been thinking over our conversation of the other day i am of course only anxious to be of service to you and to your brother and so i thought i would call he was quite magnificent in his furlined coat and he was very tall and big so that he seemed to fill up the whole room but he had an unusual air of hesitation i thought he repeated that i would call yes the girl sat with her hands in her lap waiting you remember what i told you aboutthethe verses which you sometimes bring me oh yes i remember it is so kind of you mr feilding so very kind and noble for the moment the dazzling prospect of seeing her verses acknowledged as her own in place of seeing them adopted by the editor made her believe that none but a truly noble person could do such a thing i mean to begin even sooner than i had intended it is true that when i took your verses i made them my own by those little touches and corrections which as you know very well distinguish true poetry from its imitationit was not until he was gone that effie remembered that not a single alteration had ever been made so great is the power of the human voice that for the moment she listened and acquiesced subdued and ashamed of herselfat last my young friend the time for alteration and improvement is past you can now stand aloneyour verses signedif of course we remain as i hope on the same friendly relations oh she murmured enough we understand each other your brother you told me is at work on a playa romantic drama yes he has finished it he has been at work upon it for two years thinking of nothing else all day mr feilding nodded approval that is the way he said heartily to produce good work perfectabsolutedevotionregardless of any earthly consideration artartbefore all else and now it is done yes he is copying it out effiehe suddenly changed the subjectyou have never told me of your resources tell me i do not ask out of idle curiosity that you are not rich i know no we are not rich we have a littlea thousand pounds apieceand we have resolved to live on that and on what we can get besides until we have made our way we have no rich relations to help us my father is a country clergyman with a small living we came to town so that archie could get treatment for his hip he is better now and we shall stay altogether if we can only hold on a thousand pounds each that is seventy pounds a year i suppose yes but during the last twelve months you have given me a hundred pounds for my versesthree pounds for every poem and there were thirtythree altogether in the volumevoices and echoes you know the poet who had published these verses did not change colour or show any sign of emotion in the presence of the poet who had written them he nodded his head yes he said on a hundred and seventy pounds a year you can liveon seventy you would starve where is your brother he works in his bedroom it is the room behind on the same floor my room is upstairs he requires i suppose good food wine and certain luxuries when we can afford them since you took my verses we have been able to buy things your money is well expended i should like to see your brother effie i will take you to him she said but she hesitated and blushed oh mr feilding archie knows nothing about thethe volumes you know he sees only the verses in the paper and he only knows that you have been so kind as to take them dont tell him anything else your secret effie he replied generously is safe with me he shall not know it from my lips she thanked him again it was not until he was gone that effie remembered that he could not possibly reveal that fact to her brother she led him into the room at the back of which was her brothers study and bedroom as well her brother might have been herself save for a slight manly growth upon the upper lip and for the pale cheek of ill health the same large forehead overhanging the face eyes sunken but as bright as his sisters the same sensitive lips were his a finer face than his sisters and stronger but not so sweet beside his chair a pair of crutches proclaimed that he was a cripple before him was a table at which he was writing there were on the table besides his writing materials a number of little dolls some of which were arranged in groups while others were lying about unused he was copying his finished play as he copied it he played the scenes with the dolls and spoke the dialogue the dolls were his characters there was not a single scene or change of the grouping which this conscientious young dramatist had not rehearsed over and over again until every line of the dialogue had its own stage picture clear and distinct in his mind you are mr feilding he asked rising with some difficulty i have heard so much of you from effie it is a great honour to have a call from you i take a deep interest the great man replied in anything that concerns miss effie wilmot i have been ablei believe you knowto give her some assistance and advice in her work ohhe waved his hand to deprecate any expressions of gratitudei have done very littlevery little indeed now about yourself i learn from your sister that you have ambitionsyou would become a dramatist i have no other ambition it is my only dream a very good dream indeed and you have made i am told a starta maiden efforta preliminary flight to try your wings you have written your first attempt at a play yes it is here it is finished tell me briefly the plot some young dramatists mar their plot in getting it out this young man had taken the trouble to write out first a rough outline of his piece and next a complete scenario with every situation detailed these he read to his visitor one after the other yes said mr feilding when he had finished there is something in the idea of the play perhaps not a completely novel motif a good deal might be said as to the arrangement of the scenes and one or two of the characters mightbut these are details remains to find out how the dialogue goes will you read me a scene or two the dramatist read as he read he might have observed in the eyes of his listener a growing eagerness as of one who vehemently yearns to get possession of somethinghis neighbours vineyard for example or his solitary ewe lamb but the reader did not observe this he was wholly wrapped in his piece he threw his soul into the reading he was anxious only that his words and his situations should produce the best effect upon his hearer yes yes your dialogue unhappily shows the want of skill common to the beginner said mr feilding when he had finished it will have to be completely rewritten as it stands now the play would be simply killed by it in spite of the situations which with some alterations are really pretty goodpretty good for a first effort you dont think thenthat the dramatists voice broke down consider for two long years he had done nothing but cast recast write rewrite this play he had dreamed all this time of success with this play and nownowthe very first criticand that the most accomplished man of the dayno less than mr alec feildingtold him that the play would not be received unless the dialogue was entirely rewritten he could not rewrite the dialogue it was a part of himself as well ask him to remake his own face or to reconstruct his legs his face fell his cheeks grew pale his eyes filled with unmanly tears i am truly sorry believe me said the critic to throw cold water on your hopes i have been myself an aspirant yethe hesitated in his kindlinesswhy encourage illusive expectations the play as it isi say as it is onlymust be pronounced totally unfit for the stage no manager would think of it for a moment then i may as well throw it on the fire and all my work wasted naynot wasted good worktrue workis never wasted you ought to have learned muchvery muchfrom this two years labour and as for putting it into the firehe laughed geniallyi believe i can show you a better way than that look here archiei call you by your christian name because i have so often talked about you we are old friendsi should be really sorry to think that you had actually lost all your time give me this play i will take itskeleton scenario dialogueall just as it isthe mere rough crude shapeless thing that it is i will buy it of youuseless as it is i will give you fifty pounds down for it and it shall become my propertymy own absolutely i shall then perhaps recast and rewrite the play from beginning to end when i have made a play out of it worth putting on the stagewhen in short i have made it my own playi may possibly bring it outpossibly most likely however not theres a chance for you archie such as you will never get again fifty pounds downthink of that fifty pounds the dramatist laid his hand for reply upon his papers if it should ever be brought out this good samaritan went on you will come and see it acted what a splendid lesson it will be for you in the art of writing drama the dramatists fingers tightened on his manuscript of course you must consider your sister the considerate critic continued she has been able to make a few pounds of late having been so fortunate as to attract the interest of one who is not wholly without influence should that interest fail or be withdrawn you might haveboth of youto suffer much privation the luxuries which you now enjoy would be impossibleand oh you kill me cried the unfortunate youth shall i leave you for the present my offer is always openon the condition of secrecyone is bound to keep business transactions secret i will leave you now there is no hurry think it over carefully and send me an answer he went out and shut the door the young dramatist i am ashamed to say fell to tears and weeping over the destruction of his hopes effie said mr feilding i have talked with your brother he has read some of the play to me and you think she asked him eagerly he shook his head mournfully the boy has much to learnvery much meantime the play itself is worthlessquite worthless oh poor boy and he has built so much upon it yesthey all do at the outset mind effie he is a clever boy he will do meantime he must study oh poor archie poor boy it seems hard doesnt it not to succeed all at once yet browning and tennyson and thackeray were all well on for forty before they succeeded why should he despair meantime i have made him a little offer oh mr feilding you are always so good i have offered to give him fifty poundsdownand to take this rough unlicked thing he calls a play if i find time i shall perhaps rewrite the whole and put it on the stage it will then of course be my ownmy own effie goodbye child i have not forgotten our talkor my promiseif we remain on friendly relations he went away effie sank into a chair what she had done with her own work had never seemed to her half so terrible as what was now proposed to be done with her brothers work she crept into his room he sat with his head in his hands most mournful of bards since the world began archie i knowi know he has told me oh archiedo you think it is true illustration archie i knowi know he says so effie he says it is worthless yet he will give you fifty pounds that is to please youfor your sake the thing is worthlessno manager would look at it yetfifty pounds why should mr feilding give fifty poundsa whole fifty poundsfor a worthless play archie dont do itdont let him have it wait a littlewe will ask somebody else oh i could tell you something waittell him if you must say anything that you will think it over when effie turned over the pages of the next number of the muses nine she found first of all her own verses in the editors column with his name at the bottom this sight which had formerly made her so proud now filled her with shame the generous promise of the future failed to awaken in her any glow of hope for the very words with which her only editor had beguiled her of her versesthe plea that they were worthless and must be rewrittenhe had used to her brother and as her poems had never been rewritten so would archies play she felt sure be presented without a single alteration with the name of mr alec feilding as author that week she took no verses to the studiostudy and a certain paragraph in the same columns perused by this suspicious young woman brought ragenothing short of rageinto her heart no not her brother as well as herself it ran thus i have always been under the impression that the dearth of good plays is due to nothing else in the world than the fact that the good men who ought to be writing them all run off into the domain of fiction it is a pleasant countrythat of fable land i have been there and i hope to go there again and make a long stay but play landthat is also a pleasant country i have been there lately and i hope to demonstrate that a good play may still be produced in the english tonguea good and original play in short i have written a romantic drama of which all i can say at present is that it lies finished in my fireproof safe and that a certain actormanager will probably play the titlerole before many moons have waxed and waned no said effie crumpling up the paper you have not got archies romantic drama yet chapter viii all about myself you have kept this promise then armorel welcomed her old friend with eyes of kindness and lips of smiles do you ever think of the promise that you broke effie dearthis young lady was the only other occupant of the roomthis is mr roland leemy first friend and my first master he knew me long ago in samson in the days of which i have told you we have memories of our ownmemories such as make the old friendships impossible to be dissolvedwhatever happens roland you first put a pencil into my hand and taught me how to use it in return i used to play oldfashioned tunes in the evening and you first put thoughts into my head before you came my head was filled with phantoms which had neither voice nor shape what am i to do now in return for such a gift she gave him both her hands and her face was so glowing her eyes so soft yet serious withal her voice so full of tendernessthat the luckless painter stood confused and overwhelmed how had he deserved such a reception this evening she went on we are going to talk about nobody but myself and about nothing but my own affairs effie you will be horribly bored it is five years since i had such a chance because my dear though you have the best will in the world and would talk to me about old times if you could you did not know me when i lived on samson in the scilly islandsand roland did that is if he still remembers samson i remember every day on samson every blade of grass on the island every boulder and every crag and every talk we had in those daysall the things you told me i remember as well a girl who has so changed so grown so much the better then we can talk just as we used to do i thought you would somehow remember the girl roland she looked up again smiling then she hesitated and went on slowly yet i was afraid this morning that you might have forgotten one of the two who wandered about the island together i could never forget you armorel i meantthe otherroland he made no reply in his evening dresswhich was full of creases as if it had not been put on for a very long timehe looked a little less forlorn than in the shabby old brownvelvet jacket he had brushed his hairnay he had even had it cut and trimmed but there still hung about him the look of waste his eyes were melancholy his bearing was dejected he spoke with hesitation he was even shy like a schoolboy effie noted these things and wondered and she observed besides not only that his coat was creased but that his shirt was frayed at the cuffs and torn in the front in fact the young man in dropping out of society had as a natural consequence neglected his wardrobe and allowed his linen to run to seed unrebuked every man who has been a bachelormost of us haveremembers how shirts behave when the eye of the master is once taken off them he was shy because the atmosphere of the drawingroom so dainty so luxurious so womanly was strange to him three years and more had passed since he had been in such a room he was also shy because this splendid creature this girl dressed in silk and lovely lace this miracle of girls called herself armorel his once simple rustic maid of samson isle further he was ashamed because this girl remembered him as he was in the good old days when his face was turned to the summit of the mountain and his feet were on the upward slope armorel had placed on the table a portfolio full of drawings now for myself she said gaily roland you are an artist you must look at my drawings here are the best i have done i have had many masters since you but none that taught me so much in so short a time do you remember when you first found out that i could hold a pencil you were very patient then master be lenient now i had a very apt pupil he began turning over the drawings these need no leniency these are very good indeed you have had other and better masters i have had other masters it is true i have done my best rolandto grow he dropped his eyes but he continued to turn over the sketches the drawings showed at least that natural aptitude which may be genius and may be that imitation of genius which is difficult to distinguish from the real gift many painters with no more natural aptitude than armorel have risen to be royal academicians but these are very good indeed roland repeated with emphasis you have indeed worked well and you have the true feeling do you remember roland that day when we talked about the perfect woman no i see by your eyes that you have forgotten but i remember i will not tell you all one thing she had done she had trained her eye and her hand she knew what was good in art and was not carried away by any follies or fashions i did not understand then what you meant by follies and fashions but i am wiser now i have been training eye and hand i think i know a good picture or a good statue or a good work in any art do not think me conceited master i have been obedient to your instructionsthat is all you have the soul of an artist armorel said her master but yeti feari thinkyou have missed the supreme gift you are not a great artist no i can grow no higher in painting i have learned my own limitations if it is only to understand and to worship the great masters it is worth while to get so far are you satisfied with your pupil for a moment the old look came back to rolands eyes you are the best of pupils he said but i might have expected so much tell me how you succeeded in getting away from samson she told him briefly how the ancient lady died how she found the family treasure and how she had resolved to go away and learn how she found masters and guardians how she lived in florence dresden paris how she worked unceasingly i remembered always roland your picture of the perfect woman could iihave told you things that have made youwhat you are it seemed as if another man had given the girl this excellent advice not himselfquite another man effie dear armorel turned to her you do not understand i must tell you five years ago when i lived on samson a girl so ignorant that it makes me tremble to think what might have happenedthere came to the island a young gentleman who was so kind as to take this ignorant girlmein hand and to fill her empty head with all kinds of great and noble thoughts he was an artist by profession oh an artist filled with ardour and with ambition he would be satisfied with nothing short of the best he taught me that none of us ought to be satisfied till we have attained our full stature and grown as tall as we possibly can it made that ignorant girls heart glow only to hear him talk because she had never heard such talk before then he left her and came back no more but presently the chance came to this girl as you have heard and she was able to leave the island and go where she could find masters and teachers it is five years ago and always every day rolandher lip quiveredi have said to myself my first master is growing tallertallertallerevery dayi must grow as tall as i can or else when i meet him again i shall be too insignificant for him to notice always i have thought how i should meet him again so tall so great so wonderful effie remarked that while armorel addressed roland she did not look at him until the last words when she turned and faced him with eyes running over the mans head dropped his fingers played with the drawings he made no reply in the evening armorel went on we used to have music i played only the oldfashioned tunes then that justinian tryeth taught medo you remember the tunes roland i will play one for you again she took a violin out of the case and began to tune the strings this is my old fiddle it has been justiniansand his fathers before him i have had other instruments since then but i love the old fiddle best she drew her bow across the strings i can play much better now roland and i have much better music but i will play only the old tunes because i want you to remember quite clearly those two who walked and talked and sailed together it is so easy for you to forget that young man but i remember him very well indeed she drew the bow across the strings again now we are in the old room while the old people are sitting round the fire effie dear put the shade over the lamp and turn it lowsonow we are all sitting in the firelight just as it used to be on samsonsee the red light dancing about the walls it fills your eyes and makes them glow roland oh we are back again what are you thinking of artist while the music falls upon your earswhile i playwhat shall i play dissembling love which others call the lost heart she played it with the old spirit but far more than the old delicacy and feeling you remember that roland do you hear the lapping of the waves in porth bay and the breakers over shark point or is it too rustic a ditty i will play you something better but still the old tunes she played first prince ruperts march and then the sarabandgreat and lofty airs to one who can play them greatly while she played effie watched in armorels eyes she read a purpose this was no mere play the man she called her master listened sitting at the table the sketches spread out before him ill at ease and as one in a troubled dream do you see him again that young man armorel asked it makes one happy only to think of such a young man he knew the dangers before him the way of wealth he said once and the way of pleasure draw men as if with ropes but he was so strong and steadfast nothing would turn him from his way not pleasure not wealth not anything mean or low there was never any young man so noble oh do you remember him roland tell metell medo you remember him over the pictures on the table he bowed his head but he made no reply then effie watching the glittering tears in armorels eyes and the bowed head of the man stole softly out of the room and closed the door armorel put down her fiddle she drew nearer to the man his head sank lower she stood over him tall and queenly as the muse stood over alfred de musset she laid her hand upon his shoulder that old spirit is not dead but sleeping roland you have not driven it forth it is your own still you have only silenced its voice for a while you think that you have killed it but you remember it still thank god it has been only sleeping if it were dead you would not remember let it wake again oh rolandlet it wake againagain oh rolandrolandmy friend and master she could say no more the man raised his head it is a shameful and a terrible thing to see the face of a man who is disgraced and conscious of his shame perhaps it is worse to see the face of a man who is disgraced and is unconscious of his shame he looked round and saw the tears in the girls eyes and the quivering of her lips the man you remember he said hoarsely is dead and buried he died three years ago and more another mana poor and mean creaturewalks about in his shape he is unworthy to be in your presence suffer him to go and think of him no longer not another man because you remember the former roland come back my old friend come back it is too late but he wavered it is never too late oh i wonderwas it the way of pleasure or was it the way of wealth do i look he asked bitterly as if it was the way of pleasure it is not too late roland you have sinned against yourself if it were too late you would be happy after the kind of those who can live in sin and be happy since you are not happy it is not too late the doors of heaven stand open night and day for all you talk the old language armorel it is the language of my soul i will say the same thing in any tongue you please so that you understand me to go backto begin all over againto go on as if the last three years had never been yesyesas if they had never been that is best as if they had never been armorel do you know he asked her quicklydo you know the thingthe awful thingthat i have done do not tell me never tell me some day i think i must what shall i say now say that your footsteps are turned in the old way roland he pushed back the chair and stood up now if they had been measured he would have proved four inches and a half taller than the girl for he was half an inch short of six feet and she was exactly five feet seven yet as they stood face to face it seemed to himand to her as wellas if she towered over him by as many inches as separate the tallest woman from the smallest man nature thus accommodates herself to the mental condition of the moment the small man however did a very strange thing he drew forth a pocketbook and took from it what armorel perceived to be a cheque this he deliberately tore across twice and threw the fragments into the fire you do not understand this act armorel it is the turning of the footstep she took his hand and pressed it i pray she said that the way may prove less thorny than you think nature again accommodating herself caused the small mean man to grow suddenly several inches there was still a goodly difference between the two but it was lessened more than that the man continued to grow and his face was brighter and his eyes less haggard i will go now armorel he said you will come againsoon not yet i will come again when the shame of the present belongs to the past no you shall come often but of past or present we will speak no more tell me in your own good time roland how you fare but do not desert your old pupil come to see me often he bowed his head and went away effie said armorel presently i cannot tell you what all this means it means a man who has fallen said the girl wise with poetic instinct anyone could see failure and shame written on his face it ought to be a noble face but something has gone out of it you knew him long agowhen he was differentand you tried to bring him to his old self oh armorelyou are wonderfulyou were his better spirityou were his musecalling him back she laid her hand in armorels they stood together in silence then armorel spoke i feared it was quite another mana new mana stranger that i had found but it was not it was the same man after all effie stooped and picked up a fragment of paper lying on the hearth mr feildings signature she said unthinking at times when one is moved trifles sometimes seem to acquire importance that it is a part of a cheque which he tore up effie dearit was good of you to go away and leave us when you did perhaps he would not have spoken so freely if you had been here oh he is the same man after all he has come back to me effie tell me but you know no more than i if you once loved a man and if you suffered the thought of him to lie in your heart for years and if you filled him with all the virtues that there are and if he grew in your heart to be a knight perfect at all points well armorel for she stopped and effie took her hand oh effie she replied with glowing cheeks could you ever afterwards love another man could you ever cease to love that man of your imagination could any meaner man content you for my partnevernevernever chapter ix to make him happy shall we discuss mr feilding any longer armorel asked with a little impatience it really seems as if we had nothing to talk about but the perfections of this incomparable person it was in the evening armorel had discovered already that the evenings spent at home in the society of her companion were both long and dull that they had nothing to talk about that zoe regarded every single subject from a point of view which was not her own and that both in conversation and in personal intercourse she was having a great deal more than she desired of mr alec feilding therefore she was naturally a little impatient one cannot every evening go and sit alone in the study one cannot play the violin all the evening and one cannot reduce a companion to absolute silence zoe who had been talking into the fire from her cushions turned her fluffy head opened her blue eyes wide and looked not reproachfully but sorrowfully and with wonder at a girl who could hear too much about alec feilding let me talkjust a littlesometimesof my best friend armorel dear if you only knew what alec has been to me and to my lost lovermy jerome forgive me zoe go on talking about him how quiet and cosy she murmured in reply this room is in the evening it makes one feel virtuous only to think of the cold wind and the cold people outside this heaven is surely a reward for the righteous it is enough only to lie in the warmth without talking but the time and the place invite confidences armorel i am going to repose a great confidence in youa secret plan of my own and you are so very very sympathetic when you please dear childespecially when effie is herei wonder if she is worth itthat you might spare me a little of your sympathy my dear zoearmorel felt a touch of remorseshe had been unsympatheticyou shall have all there is to spare but what kind of sympathy do you want you were talking of mr feildingnot of yourself yesand that is of myself in a way i know you will not misunderstand me dear you will not imagine that i amwell in love with alec when i confess to you that i think a very great deal about him i never thought so at all said armorel zoes eyes opened for a moment and gleamed it was a doubtful saying why should not she be in love with alec or alec with her but armorel knew nothing about love when a woman has loved once dear she murmured her heart is gone my lovepassages she put her handkerchief to her eyesto some women the drawingroom is the stagemy lovestory dear is finished and done my heart is in the grave with jerome but this you cannot understand i think so much of alecfirst because he has been all goodness to me and next because he is so wonderfully clever talk about him zoe as long as you please if he had been an ordinary man she went on i should have been equally grateful i suppose but there it would have ended to be under a debt of gratitude to such a man as alec makes one long to do something in return and besides there are so very very few good men in the world that it does one good only to talk about them i suppose that mr feilding is really a man of great genius said armorel i confess he seems to me rather ponderous in his talkmay i say dull from genius one expects the unexpected dull oh no a little constrained in his manner that comes from his excessive sensibility but dulloh no he seemed dull at the theatre last night it was a curious coincidence meeting him there was it not i thought you must have told him that you were going no no quite a coincidence and he so seldom goes to a theatre the badness of the acting he says irritates his nerves to such a degree that it sometimes spoils his work for a week and yet he is actually going to bring out a play himself there is a paragraph in the paper about ithis own paper give it to me dear it is on the sofa thank you she read the paragraph which we already know what do you think of that armorel isnt it rather arrogantabout good men turning out good work my dear genius can afford to be arrogant true genius is always impatient of small people and of stupidities it suffers its contempt to be seen and that makes the stupidities cry out about arrogance even the most stupid can cry out you see but think he is going to add a new wreath to his brow he is already known as a poet a novelist a painter an essayist and now he is to become a dramatist he really is the cleverest man in the whole world armorel expressed none of the admiration that was expected she was wondering whether if mr feilding had not been quite so clever he might not have been quite so heavy and didactic in conversation less clever people perhaps are more prodigal of their cleverness and give away some of it in conversation perhaps the very clever want it all for their books i said i would give you his poems zoe continued i bought the book for youthe second series which is better than the first it is on the piano dear that little parcel thank you she opened the parcel and disclosed a dainty little volume in white and gold it was illustrated by a small etching of the poets head for a frontispiece it was printed in beautiful new type on thick paperthe kind called handmadethe edges left ragged there were about a hundred and twenty pages and on every two pages there was a single poem these were not arranged in any order or sequence of thought they were all separate the poet showed knowledge of contemporary manners in serving up so small a dish of verse fifty or sixty short poems is quite as much as the reader of poetry will stand in these days armorel turned over the pages and began to read them strange how could a man so ponderous so pompous in his conceit so dogmatic so selfconscious write such pretty easyflowing numbers the metres fitted the subject the rhymes were apt the cadence true the verses tripped light and graceful like a maiden dancing how could such a man she cried get a touch so light it is truly wonderful i told you so dear he is altogether wonderful she went on reading presently she cried out why he writes like a woman only a woman could have written these lines she read them out it is a womans hand and a womans way of thinking that shows his genius no one except alecor a womancould have said just that thing in just that manner armorel closed the volume i think she said that i like a man to write like a man and a woman like a woman then said zoe how is a novelist to make a woman talk he makes his women talk like women if he can but when he speaks himself it must be with the voice of a man in these poems it is the poet who speaks not any character man or woman you will like the poems better as you read them they will grow upon you and you will find the poet himselfnot a woman but a manin his verses it helps one so much to understand the verses when you know the poet i think i could almost understand browning if i had ever known him think of alec when you read his verses yes said armorel still without enthusiasm you said we were talking about nothing else dear zoe went on i talk so much of him because i respect and revere him so much i have known alec a long timeshe lay back with her head turned from her companion talking softly into the fire as if she was communing with herself he is though you do not understand it yet a man of the most highly strung and sensitive nature the true reason why he talks ponderouslyas you call it armorelis that he is conscious of the traps into which this very sensitiveness of his may lead him for instance he may say before persons unworthy of his confidence things which they would most likely misunderstand it is simply wicked to cast pearls before swine a poet more than any other man must be quite sure of his audience before he gives himself away i assure you when alec feels himself alone with his intimatesa very little circlehis talk is brilliant we are unlucky then said armorel still without enthusiasm another thing may make him seem dull he is always preoccupied always thinking about his work his mind is overcharged i thought he was always in societya great dinerout he is society brings him relief the inanities of social intercourse rest his brain without this rest he would be crushed i see said armorel coldly then there is that other side of himof which you know nothing my dear he is constantly thinking of others his private lifebut i must not tell too much not only the cleverest man in london but the best armorel felt guilty she had not hitherto looked upon this phoenix with the reverence which was due to so great a creature nay she did not like him she was repelled rather than attracted by him she liked him less every time she met him and this was oftener than she desired somehow or other they were always meeting on some pretext or other he was always calling and certainly for the last few days zoe was unable to talk about anything else the genius the greatness of this man seemed to overwhelm her and now my dear she went on still talking about him for my little confidences i have a great scheme in my head oh a very great scheme indeed she turned round and sat up looking armorel full in the face her eyes under her fluffy hair were large and luminous when she lifted them oftener they were large but sleepy eyes now they were quite bright she was wide awake and she was in earnest i have spoken to no one but you about it as yet perhaps you and i can manage it all by ourselves what is it you and i dear you and i we twowe can be so associated and bound up in the life of the poetpainter as to be for ever joined with his name petrarch and laura are not more closely connected than we may be with alec feilding if you only join with me first tell me what it isthis plan of yours it is nothing less than just to relieve him once for all from his business cares has he business cares they take up his precious time they weigh upon his mind why should such a man have any business at all to look after well but said armorel refusing to rise to this tempting bait why does such a man allow himself to have business cares if they worry him it is the conduct of his journal my dear but other authors and painters do not conduct journals why should he i believe that successful writers and artists make very large incomes if he is so successful why does he trouble about managing a paper that is certainly work that can be done by a man of inferior brain you are so matteroffact dear the paper is his own and he thinks i suppose that nobody but himself could edit the thing leave poor alec one or two human weaknesses he may think this and yet make no allowance for his own shrinking and sensitive nature certainly armorel had seen no indications in this poetpainter of the shrinking nature it was very carefully concealed of course zoe continued you hardly know him but his genius you do know and the business worries that are inseparable from a journal are a serious hindrance to his higher work believe me dear even if you do not understand why it should be so i can very well believe iti only ask why mr feilding alone among authors and painters should hamper himself with such worries well dearthere they are and i have formed a planohshe clasped her hands and opened her eyes widesuch a plan the best and the cleverest plan in the world for the best and the cleverest man in the world but i want your help what can i do i will tell you first of all you must remember that alec is the sole proprietor as well as the editor of this journalthe muses nine it is his property he created it but the business management of the paper worries him my plan armorelmy planshe spoke and looked most impressivewill relieve him altogether of the work yesand how do i come into your plan this way i have found out through a person of business that if he would sell a sharesay a quarter or an eighthof his paper he would be able to put the business part of it into paid handsthe people who do nothing else now armorel we will buy that shareyou and i between us will buy it you shall advance the whole of the money and i will pay you back half the price will be nothing to you that is it will be a great deal because the investment will be such a splendid thing and the returns will be so brilliant you will increase your income enormously and you will have the satisfactionshe paused because though she was herself more animated earnest and eloquent with voice and eyes and though she threw so much persuasion into her manner the telltale face of the girl showed no kindling light of response at allthe satisfaction she continued of feeling that such a help to literature and art will make us both immortal armorel made no reply she was considering the proposition coldly and it was one of those things which must be considered without enthusiasm as for money zoe continued with one more attempt to awaken a responsive fire i have found out what will be wanted for three thousand five hundred pounds we can get this share in the paper only three thousand five hundred pounds that is no more than one thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds apiece i shall insist upon having my share in the investment because i should grudge you the whole of the work as for the returns i have been well advised of that of course alec is beyond all paltry desire for gain and he might ask a great deal more but he leaves everything to his advisersand oh my dear he must on no account knowyetwho is doing this for him afterwards we will break it to him gradually perhaps when he has quite recovered from the worries and is rested if we think of returns ten twenty even fifty per cent may be expected as the paper gets on think of fifty per cent no said armorel let us too be above paltry desire for gain let those who do want more money go in for this business if your advice is correct mr feilding can have no difficulty at all in selling a share of the paper people who want more money will be only too eager to buy it my dear child everybody wants more money i have quite enough but why do you ask me to join you zoe i do not know mr feilding except as an acquaintance he is i dare say all that you think but i do not find him personally interesting and there is no reason why i should pretend to be one of the train who follow him and admire him but i want youi want you armorel zoe clasped her hands and lifted her eyes humid now but a womans eyes move a girl less than a man i want you and none but you to join me in this we two alone will do it it will be such a splendid thing to do nothing short of the rescue of the finest and most poetic mind of the day from sordid cares and worries think of what future ages will say of you armorel laughed indeed she said this kind of immortality does not tempt me very much but zoe it is really useless to urge me i could not do this if i would and truly i would not if i could for i made a promise to mr jagenal when i came of age the other day that i would not lend or part with any money without taking his advice and that i would not change any of his investments without consulting him i seem to know beforehand what he would say if i consulted him about this proposal then my dear said zoe lying back in her cushions and turning her face to the fire let us talk about the matter no more she had failed from the outset she felt that she was going to fail the man had had every chance he had met the girl constantly she had left him alone with her but he had not attracted her in the least well she confessed in spite of his cleverness alec had somewhat of a wooden manner he was too authoritative and armorel was too independent she had failed armorel for her part remembered how her lawyer had warned her on the day when she became twentyone and of age to manage her own affairs all kinds of traps he told her are set to catch women who have got money in order to rob them of their money they are besieged on every side especially on the sides presumably the weakest she must put on the armour of suspicion she must neverneverneverhere he held up a terrifying forefingerenter into any engagement or promise verbal or in writing without consulting him the memory of this warning made her uneasybecause it was her own companion the lady appointed by her lawyer himself who had made the first attempt upon her money true the attempt was entirely disinterested there would be no gain to zoe even if she were to accede the proposal was prompted by the purest friendship and yet she felt uneasy as for the disinterested companion she wrote a letter that very night she said i have made an attempt to get this money for you it has failed it was hopeless from the first you have had your chance you have been with the girl often enough to attract and interest her yet she is neither attracted nor interested i have given her your poems she says they ought to be the work of a woman she likes the verse but she cares nothing about the poet strange for my own part i have been foolish enough to love the man and to care not one brass farthing about his work your poemsyour picturesthey all seem to me outside yourself and not a part of you at all why it is so i cannot explain well alec you planted me here and i remain till you tell me i may go it is not very lively the girl and i have nothing in common but it is restful and cosy and i always did like comfort and warmth and armorel pays all the bills what next however is there any other way what are my lords commands chapter x the secret of the two pictures a good many things troubled armorelthe companion with whom she could not talk her persistent praises of mr feilding the constant attendance of that illustrious geniusand she wanted advice generally she was a selfreliant person but these were new experiences effie she knew could not advise her she might go to mr jagenal but then elderly lawyers are not always ready to receive confidences from young ladies then she thought of her cousin philippa whom she had not seen since that first evening philippa looked trustworthy and judicious she went to see her in the morning when she would be alone philippa received her with the greatest friendliness if you really would like a talk about everything she said come to my own room she led the way here we shall be quiet and undisturbed it is the place where i practise every day but i shall never be able to play like you dear now take that chair and let us begin first why do you come so seldom frankly and truly do you wish me to come often frankly and truly fair cousin yes but come alone mrs elstree and i were at school together and we were not friends that is all i hope you like her for a companion the first of my difficulties said armorel is that i do not i imagined when she came that it mattered nothing about her you see i have been for five years under masters and teachers and i never thought anything about them outside the lesson i thought my companion would be only another master but she isnt i have her company at breakfast lunch and dinner and all the evening i think i am wrong not to like her because she is always goodtempered somehow she jars upon me she likes everything i do not care aboutcomic operas dance music french novels she has no feeling for pictures and her taste in literature is not mine oh i am talking scandal and she is so perfectly inoffensive mostly she lies by the fire and either dozes or reads her french novels all day long i go about my devices but there is the evening this is rather unfortunate armorel is it not if it were only for a month or two one would not mind tell me philippa how long must i have a companion philippa laughed i dare say the question may solve itself before long women generally achieve independencewith the wedding ringunless that brings worse slavery no said armorel gravely i shall not achieve independence that way not that way not by marrying why not armorel you will not laugh at me philippa i learned a long time ago that i could only marry one kind of man and now i cannot find him you did know such a man formerly my dear you are not going to let a childish passion ruin your own life i knew a man who was in my mind this kind of man he came across my life for two or three weeks when he went away i kept his image in my mind and it gradually grew as i grewalways larger and more beautiful the more i learnedthe more splendid grew this image it was an idol that i set up and worshipped for five long years and now your idol is shattered no the idol remains it is the man who no longer corresponds to the idol the man who might have become this wonderful image is goneand i can never love any other man he must be my idol in the body but armorel this is unreal we are not angels men and women must take each other with their imperfections my idol may have had his imperfections too well the man has gone i am punished perhaps for setting up an idol she was silent for awhile and philippa had nothing to say but about my companion armorel went on when can i do without one there is nothing but opinion to consider opinion says that a young lady must not live alone if one never hears what opinion says one need not consider opinion perhaps well but you could not go into society alone that matters nothing because i never go into society at all never go into society at all what do you mean i mean that we go nowhere well what are people about they call upon you i suppose no nobody ever calls but where are mrs elstrees friends she has no friends oh she hasor hadan immense circle of friends that was before her father lost everything and killed himself they were fairweather friends yes but ones own people dont run away because of misfortune philippa looked dissatisfied with the explanation my dear cousin this must be inquired into your lawyer told me that mrs elstrees large circle of friends would be of such service to you do you really mean that you go nowhere and your wonderful playing absolutely wasted and your face seen nowhere oh it is intolerable that such a girl as you should be so neglected i have other friends there is effie wilmot and her brother who wants to become a dramatist and i have found an old friend an artist i am not at all lonely but in the evening i confess it is dull i am not afraid of being alone i have always been alone but now i am not alone i have to talk and uncongenial talk now advise me philippa her talk is always on one subjectalways the wonderful virtues of mr feilding my cousin alec yesphilippa changed colour and shaded her face with a handscreen i believe she knows him your cousin oh i had forgotten but it is all the better because you know him philippa i am troubled about him for not only does zoe talk about him perpetually but he is always calling on one pretext or other if i go to a picturegallery he is there if i walk in the park i meet him if i go to churchzoe does not gohe meets me in the porch if we go to the theatre he is there i did not think that alec was that kind of man said philippa still keeping the handscreen before her face are you mistaken perhaps has he said anything no he has said nothing but it annoys me to have this man following me aboutandandphilippahe is your cousini knowbut i detest him can you not show that you dislike his attentions if he will not understand that you dislike himwaitperhaps he will speakthough i hardly thinkyou may be mistaken dear if he speaks let your answer be quite unmistakable then i hope that he will speak tomorrow zoe wanted me to find some money in order to help him in some wayout of some worries my dear childi implore youdo not be drawn into any money entanglements what does zoe mean what does it all mean my dear there is something here that i cannot understand what can it mean zoe to help my cousin out of worries about money zoe what has zoe to do with him and his worries he has been very kind to her and to her husband there is something we do not understand philippa repeated you are not angry with me for not liking your cousin angry no indeed he has been so spoiled with his success that i dont wonder at your not liking him as for me you know it is different i knew alec before his greatness became visible no one in the old days ever suspected the wonderful powers he has developed when he was a boy no one knew that he could even hold a pencil nobody suspected him of making rhymesand now see what he has done yet after all his achievements seem to me only like incongruous additions stuck on to a central house alec and painting dont go together in my mind nor alec and vers de societe nor alec and storytelling in his youth he passed for a practical lad full of commonsense and without imagination was he of a sensitive highly nervous temperament not to my knowledge he has been always and is still i think a man of a singularly calm and even cold tempernot in the least nervous nor particularly sensitive armorel compared this estimate with that of her companion strange that two persons should disagree so widely in their estimate of a man then three or four years ago he suddenly blossomed out into a painter he invited his friends to his chambers he told us that he had a little surprise for us and then he drew aside a curtain and disclosed the first picture he thought worthy of exhibition it hangs on the wall above your head armorel with its companion of the following year my father bought them and gave them to me armorel got up to look at them oh she cried these are copies illustration oh she cried these are copies copies no they are alecs own original pictures what makes you think they are copies what made her think that they were copies was the very remarkable fact that both pictures represented scenes among the scilly isles that in each of them was representedherselfas a girl of fifteen or sixteen that the sketches for both these pictures had been made in her own presence by the artist that he was none other than roland lee and that the picture she had seen in his studio was done by the same hand and in the same style as the two pictures before her of that she had no doubt she had so trained her eye and hand that there could be no doubt at all of that fact she stared bewildered philippa who was beside her looking at the pictures went on talking without observing the sheer amazement in armorels eyes that was his first picture she continued and this was the second i remember very well the little speech he made while we were all crowding round the picture i am going he said to make a new departure you all thought i was just following the beaten road at the bar well i am trying a new and a shorter way to success you see my first effort it was difficult to believe our eyes alec a painter one might as well have expected to find alec a poet and in a few months he was a poet and then a storyteller and his poetry is as good as it is made in these days and his short stories are as good as any of those by the french writers what is the subject of this picture armorel asked with an effort the place is somewhere on the cornish coast i believe he always paints the same kind of picturealways a rocky coasta tossing seaperhaps a boatspray flying over the rocksand always a girl the same girl there she is in both picturesa handsome blackhaired girl quite youngit might be almost a portrait of yourself when you were younger armorel almost said armorel this girl is now as well known to alecs friends as wouvermanns white horse but no one knows the model armorels memory went back to the day when roland made that sketch she stoodsojust as the painter had drawn her on a round boulder the water boiling and surging at her feet and the white foam running up behind her the granite rock grey and black how could she ever forget that sketch alec is wonderful in his seas philippa went on look at the bright colour and the clear transparency of the water you can feel it rolling at your feet upon my word armorel the girl is really like you a little perhaps yes they are good pictures philippa the man who painted them is a painter indeed she sat down again still bewildered presently she heard philippas voice what is it she asked you have become deaf and dumb are you ill noi am not ill the sight of those pictures set me thinking i will go now philippa if he speaks to me i will reply so that there can be no mistake but if he persists in following me about i will ask you to interfere if necessary philippa promised her i will interfere for you but there is something in all this which i do not understand come again soon dear and tell me everything when they began this talk one girl was a little troubled but not much the other was free from any trouble when they parted both girls were troubled one felt vaguely that danger was in the air zoe meant something by constantly talking about her cousin alec what understanding was there between him and that womanthat detestable woman the other walked home in a doubt and perplexity that drove everything else out of her head what did those pictures mean had roland given away his sketches was there another painter who had the very touch of roland as well as his sketches no no it was impossible suddenly she remembered something on the fragment of paper that effie picked up the corner of the torn chequeeven the signature of alec feilding what did that mean why had roland torn up a cheque signed by mr feilding why had he called that act the turning of the footstep chapter xi a critic on truth one painter may make use of another mans sketches for his own pictures the thing is conceivable though one cannot recall and there is no record of any such case it is perhaps possible portraitpainters have employed other men to paint backgrounds and even hands and drapery now the two pictures hanging in philippas room were most certainly painted from rolands sketches if there were any room for doubt the figure of armorel herself in the foreground removed that doubt therefore roland must have lent his sketches to mr feilding what else did he lend can one man lend another his eye his hand his sense of colour his touch his style there was once i seem to have read a man who sold his soul to the only functionary who buys such things and keeps a stock of them secondhand on the condition that he should be able to paint as well as the immortal raffaello he obtained his wish because the devil always keeps his bargain to the letter with the result that instead of winning the imperishable wreath for himself that he expected he was never known at all and his pictures are now sold as those of the master whose works they so miraculously resemble armorel had perhaps heard this story somewhere could the cleverest man in all london have made a similar transaction taking roland lee for his model if so the devil had not cheated him at all and he got out of the bargain all he expected because he not only painted quite as well as his master and in exactly the same style so that it was impossible to distinguish between them but which the other unfortunate did not get all the credit was given to him while the original model or master languished in obscurity it was obvious to a trained eye at very first sight that the style of the pictures was that of roland lee he had a style of his own the first mark of genius in any art is individuality his style was no more to be imitated in painting than the style of robert browning can be followed in poetry painters there are who have been imitated and have created a school of imitators even these can always be distinguished from their copyists the subtle touch of the master the personal presence of his hand cannot be copied or imitated in these two pictures the hand of roland was clearly unmistakably visible the light thrown over them the atmosphere with which they were chargedeverything was his he had caught the september sunshine as it lies over and enfolds the scilly islandswho should know that soft and golden light better than armorelhe had caught the transparencies of the seas the shining yellows of the seaweed the browns and purples of bramble and fern the greyness and the blackness of the rock you could hear the rush of the water eddying among the boulders you could see the rapid movement of the seagulls wings as they swept along with the wind could another even with the original sketches lying before him even with skill and feeling of his own reproduce these things in rolands own individual style no she cried but not aloud i know these pictures they are not his at all they are rolands every line of thought that she followedto write these down would be to produce another ring and bookin her troubled meditations after the discovery led her to the same conclusion it was that at which she had arrived in a single moment of time without argument or reasoning and at the very first sight of the pictures the first thought is always right they are rolands picturesthat was the first thought the second thought brings along the doubts suggests objections endeavours to be judicial deprecates haste and calls for the scales they cannot said the second thought be rolands paintings because mr feilding says they are his the third thought which is the first strengthened by evidence declared emphatically that they were rolands whatever mr feilding might say and could be the work of none other therefore the cleverest man in all london according to everybody the best and most generous and most honourable according to armorels companion was an impostor and a liar never before had she ever heard of such a liar armorel it is true knew but little of the crooked paths by which many men perform this earthly pilgrimage from the world which is to the world which is to come children born on samsonnay even those also of st maryshave few opportunities of observing these ways that is why all scillonians are perfectly honest they do not know how to cheateven those who might wish to become dishonest if they knew in her five years apprenticeship the tree of knowledge had dropped some of its baleful fruit at armorels feet that cannot be avoided even in a convent garden yet she had not eaten largely of the fruit nor with the voracity that distinguishes many young people of both sexes when they get hold of these apples in other words she only knew of craft and falsehood in general terms as they are set forth in the gospels and by the apostles and especially in the book of revelation which expressly states the portion of liars yet even with this slight foundation to build upon armorel was well aware that here was a fraud of a most monstrous character surely there never was before this man any man in the world who dared to present to the world another mans paintings and to call them his own men and women have claimed books which they never wrotewitness the leading case of the false george eliot and the story told by anthony trollope men have pretended to be wellknown writersdid i not myself once meet a man in an hotel pretending to be one of our most genial of storytellers men have written things and pretended that they were the work of famous hands literaturealashath many impostors but in art the record is clean there are a few ghosts to be sure here and theresporadic spectresbut they are obscure and mostly unknown armorel had never heard or seen any of them surely there never before was any man like unto this man and apart from the colossal impudence of the thing she began to consider the profound difficulties in carrying it out because you see no one man unaided could carry it through it requires the consent the silence and the activenay the zealouscooperation of another man and how are you to get that man in order to get this other manthis active and zealous fellowconspiratoryou must find means to persuade him to sacrifice every single thing that men care forhonour reputation success he must be satisfied to pursue art actually and literally for arts own sake this is i know a rule of conduct preached by every art critic every aesthete every lecturer or writer on art yet observe what it may lead to was there for instance an unknown genius who gave his work to giotto with permission to call it his own and was that obscure genius content to sit and watch that work in the crowd unseen and unsuspected while he murmured praises and thanksgiving for the skill of hand and eye which had been given to him but claimed by that other young man messer giotto did turner have his ghost sublime sacrifice of self so to pursue art for arts sake as to give your pictures to another man by which he may rise to honoureven it may be to the presidency of the royal academy contented only with the consciousness of good and sincere work and with the possession of mastery it is beyond us we cannot achieve this greatnesswe cannot rise to this devotion art hath no such votaries by what persuasions thenby what bribeswas roland induced to consent to his own suicideignoble secret and shameful suicide he must have consented in no other way could the thing be done he must have agreed to efface himselfbut not out of pure devotion to art not so the roland of the past survived still the burning desire for distinction and recognition still flamed in his soul the bitterness and shame with which he spoke of himself proved that his consent had been wrung from him he was ashamed why because another bore the honours that should be his because he was a bondman of the impostor of this armorel was certain roland leethe man whom for five long years she had imagined to be marching from triumph to triumphconqueror of the worldhad sold himselffor what consideration she knew nothand and eye genius and brain heart and soulhad sold himself into slavery he had consented to a monstrous and most impudent fraud and the man who stood before the canvas in public writing his name in the corner wasthe noun appellative the proper nounbelonging to such an act and her own friendher gallant hero of artwhat else was he in this conspiracy of two you cannot persuade a womansuch is the poverty of the feminine imaginationto call a thing like this by any other name than its plain simple and natural one a man may explain away find excuses make suggestions point out extenuating circumstances show how the force of events destroys free will and propose a surplice and a golden crown for the unfortunate victim of fate instead of bare shoulders and the nineclawed cat but a womannever if the thing done is a lie the man who did it is a armorel said her companionit was in the afternoon and she had been dozing after her lunchwhat is the matter you have been sitting in the window which has a detestable view of a dismal street for two long hours without talking at lunch you sat as if in a dream are you ill has anything happened has the respectable mr jagenal robbed you of your money has philippa been saying amiable things about me i have found out something which has disquieted me beyond expression said armorel gravely zoe changed colour heavensshe laughed curiously what has come out now anything about me one never knows what may come out next it is very odd what a lot of things may be said about everybody my discovery has nothing to do with you at leastno nothing at all that is reassuring it certainly was as everybody knows who does not wish the curtain to draw up once again on the earlier and halfforgotten scenes of the play perhaps it might relieve you dear if you were to tell me but do not think i am curious besides i dare say i could tell you more than you could tell me is it about philippas hopeless attachment for the man who will never marry her and her cruelty to the reverend gentleman who will nono it is nothing about philippa i know nothing about any attachments well you will tell me when you please zoe relapsed into warmth and silence but she watched the girl from under her heavy eyelids something had happenedsomething serious armorel pursued her meditations but in a different line she now remembered that the leader in this fraud was the man whom zoe professed to honour above all other living men could she tell this disciple what she had discovered one might as well inform kadysha that her prophet mohammed was an epileptic impostor and again he was philippas first cousin and she regarded him with pride if notas zoe suggestedwith a warmer feeling still how could she bring this trouble upon philippa and again it was rolands secret how could she reveal a thing which would cover him with ridicule and discredit for the rest of his life she must be silent for the sake of everybody zoe she sprang to her feet dont ask me anything more forget what i said it is not my own secret my dear child zoe murmured if nobody has run away with your money and if you have found out no mares nests about me i dont mind anything i have already quite forgotten why should i remember of course armorel repeated impatientlythis companion of hers often made her impatientthere is nothing about you it concerns mr feilding it was only an innocent maid who opened the door to announce an afternoon caller but armorel started for really it was the right completion to her sentence though not the completion she meant to make he came inthe man of whom her mind was fulltall handsome calm and selfpossessed authority sat visible to all upon his brow his dress his manner his voice proclaimed the man who had succeededwho deserved to succeed oh how could it be possible armorel mechanically gave him her hand wondering then quite in the old style and as a survival of samson island there passed rapidly through her mind the whole procession of those texts which refer to liars for the moment she felt curious and nervously excited as one who should talk with a man condemned then she came back to london and to the exigencies of the situation yet it was really quite wonderful for he sat down and began to talk for all the world as if he was a perfectly truthful person and she rang the bell for tea and poured it out for him as if she knew nothing to the contrary that he being what he was should so carry himself that she who knew everything should sit down calmly and put milk and sugar in his tea were two facts so extraordinary that her head reeled presently however she began to feel amused it was like knowing beforehand so that the mind is free to think of other things the story and the plot of a comedy she considered the acting and the makeup and both were admirable the part of successful genius could not be better played one has known genius too modest to accept the position happiest while sitting in a dark corner here however was genius stepping to the front and standing there boldly in sight of all as if the place was his by the double right of birth and of conquest he sat down and began to talk of art he seldom indeed talked about anything else but art has many branches and he talked about them all today however he discoursed on drawing and painting he was accustomed to patient listeners and therefore he assumed that his discourse was received with respect and did not observe the preoccupied look on the face of the girl to whom he discoursedfor zoe made no pretence of listening except when the conversation seemed likely to take a personal turn nor did he observe how from time to time armorel turned her eyes upon himeyes full of astonishmenteyes struck with amazement presently he descended for awhile from the heights of principle to the lower level of personal topic mrs elstree tells me he said smiling with some condescension that you paintof course as an amateuras well as play if you can draw as well as you can play you are indeed to be envied but that is perhaps too much to be expected will you show me some of your work and will youwithout being offendedsuffer me to be a candid critic armorel went gravely to her own room and returned with a small portfolio full of drawings which she placed before him still with the wonder in her eyes what would he saythis man who passed off another mans pictures for his own she stood at the table over him looking down upon him waiting to see him betray himselfthe first criminal personthe first really wicked manshe had ever encountered in the flesh you are not afraid of the truth he asked turning over the sketches in arttruthtruth is everything without truth there is no art truth and sincerity should be our aim in criticism as well as in art itself oh what kind of conscience could this man have who was able so to talk about art seeing what manner of man he was armorel glanced at zoe half afraid that he would convict himself in her presence but she seemed asleep lying back in her cushions his remarks were judgments once pronounced there was no appeal yet his judgments produced no effect upon the girl not the least she listened she heard she acquiesced in silence perhaps because he was struck with her coldness he left off examining the sketches and began a learned little discourse about composition and harmony selection and grouping he illustrated these remarks not obtrusively but quite naturally by referring to his own pictures appealing to zoe who lazily raised her head and murmured response as one who knew it all beforehand now as to the discourse itself armorel recognised every word of it already she had read and had been taught these very things it showed she thought what a pretender the man must be not to understand work that had been done by one who had studied seriously and already knew all that he was laboriously enforcing but she said nothing it was moreover the lesson of a professor not of an artist between the professional critic who can neither paint nor draw and the smallest of the men who can paint and draw there is if you please a gulf fixed that cannot be passed over this drawing for instance he concluded taking up one from the table betrays exactly the weakness of which i have been speaking it has some merit there is a desire for truthwithout truth what are we the lights are managed with some dexterity the colour has real feeling but consider this figure from sheer ignorance of the elementary considerations which i have been laying down you have placed it exactly in front had it been here at the right the effect of the figure in bringing up the whole of the picture would have been heightened tenfold for my own part i always like a figure in a paintinga single figure for choicea girl because the treatment of the hair and the dress lends itself to effect his famous girl echoed zoe that model whom nobody is allowed to see now the figure was placed in the middle for very excellent reasons and in full consideration of those very principles which this expounder had been setting forth but what yesterday would have puzzled her now amused her one moment and irritated her the next he took up a crayon shall i show you he asked exactly what i mean if you please here is a piece of paper which will do he spoke in the style which matthew arnold so much admiredthe grand stylethe words clear and articulate the emphasis just the manner authoritative i will just indicate your background he said poising the pencil professionallyhe looked as if the grand style really belonged to himin two or three strokes and then i will sketch in your figure in the placeherewhere it properly belongs you will see immediately though of courseyour eyecannot he played with the chalk as one considering where to beginbut he did not begin armorel remembered a certain day when roland gave her his first lesson pencil in hand never was that pencil idle it moved about of its own accord it was drawing all the time it seemed to be drawing out of its own head mr feilding on the other hand never touched the paper at all his pencil was dumb and lifeless but armorel waited anxiously for him to begin now at any rate she should see if he could draw she was disappointed the clock on the overmantel suddenly struck six mr feilding dropped the crayon good heavens he cried you make one forget everything miss rosevean we must put off the rest of this talk for another day but you will persevere dear young lady will you not promise me that you will persevere even if the highest peak cannot be attainedwe may not all reach that heightit is something to stand upon the lower slope if it is only to recognise the greatness of those who are above and the depths belowhow deep they areof the world which knows no art perseverepersevere i will call again and help you if i may he pressed her hand warmly and departed i really think said zoe that he believes you worth teaching armorel i have never known him give so much time to any one girl before and if you only knew how they flock about him zoe said armorel without answering this remark you have seen all mr feildings pictures have you not i believe all do they all treat the same subject up to the present he has exhibited nothing but sea and coast pieces headlands low tide on the rocks and so forth always with this blackhaired girlsomething like you but not much more than a child did you ever see him actually at work you mean working at an unfinished thing no never he cannot endure anyone in his studio while he is at work did he ever draw anything for youany penandink sketchpencil sketch have you got any of his sketchesrough things no alec has a secretive side to his character it comes out in odd ways no one suspected that he could paint or even draw until three or four years ago he suddenly burst upon us with a finished picture and then it came out that he had been secretly drawing all his life and studying seriously for years where he will break out next i dont know he may break out anywhere said armorel except upon the fiddle i think that he will never play the fiddle yes zoe he really is a very very clever man he is certainly the very cleverest man in all london chapter xii to make that promise sure there are few instincts and impulses of imperfect human nature more deeply rooted or more certain to act upon us than the desire to have it out with some other human creature women are especially led or driven by this impulse even among the less highly civilised to the tearing out of nose and earrings you may hear every day at all hours in every back street of every city the ladies having it out with each other in fact there is a perpetual court of common pleas being held in these streets without respite of holiday or truce in which the folk have it out with each other while friendssympathetic friendsstand by and act as judges jury arbitrators lawyers and all things are reported things are said things are done a personal explanation is absolutely necessary before peace of mind can be restored or the way to future action become clearly visible the two parties must have it out in armorels case she found that before doing anything she must see that member of the conspiracyif indeed there was a conspiracywho was her own friend she must see roland she must know exactly what it meant if only to find out how it could be stopped in plain words she must have it out those who obey a natural impulse generally believe that they are acting by deliberate choice thus the doctrine of free will came to be invented and thus armorel when she took a cab to the other studio had no idea but that she was acting the most original part ever devised for any comedy as before she found the artist in his dingy back room alone but the picture was advancing when she saw it a fortnight before it was little more than the ghost of a rock with a spectral sea and a shadowy girl beside the sea now it was advanced so far that one could see the beginnings of a fine painting in it roland stepped forward and greeted his old friend whyhe was already transformed what had he done to himself the black bar was gone from his forehead his eyes were bright his cheeks had got something of their old colour his hair was trimmed and his dress as well as his manner showed a return to selfrespect what happy thought brings you here again armorel he asked with the familiarity of an old friend i came to see you at work last time i came only to see you is it permitted behold me i am at work see my pictureall there is of it armorel looked at it long and carefully then she murmured unintelligibly yes of course but there never could have been any doubt she turned to the artist a face full of encouragement what did i prophesy for you roland that you should be a great painter well my prophecy will come true i hope but i fear i am beginning the world again not quite because you have never ceased to work your hand is firmer and your eye is truer now than it was four years ago when youceased to exhibit but you have never ceased to work so that you go back to the world with better things they refused to buy my things before they will not refuse now nay i am certain dont think of money my old friend you must notyou shall not think of money think of nothing but your workand your name what ought to be done to a man who should forget his name he deserves to be deprived of his genius and to be cast out among the stupid but you roland you were always keen for distinctionwere you not he made no reply how well i know the place she said standing before the picture it is the narrow channel between round island and camber rock oh the dear terrible place when you and i were there you remember roland the water was smooth and the seabirds were flying quietly i have seen them driven by the wind off the island and beating up against it like a sailing ship but in september there are no puffins and i have seen the water racing and roaring through the channel dashing up the black sides of the rockswhile we lay off afraid to venture near it was low tide when you made your sketch i remember the long yellow fringing seaweed hanging from the rock six feet deep and there is your girl sitting in the boat oh i remember her very well what a happy time she had while you were with her roland you were the very first person to show her something of the outer world it seemed when you were gone as if you had taken that girl and planted her on a high rock so that she could see right across the water to the world of men and art you always keep this girl in your pictures always in these pictures of coast and rock roland i want you to make a change do not paint the girl of sixteen in this picture let me be your model instead put me into the picture it is my fancy will you let me sit for you again surely armorel if i may it will beoh but you cannotyou must not come to this den of a place indeed i think it is not a nice place at all but i shall stipulate that you take another and a more decent studio immediately will you do this i will do anythinganythingthat you command you know what i want the return of my old friend he is on his way back already i knowi know but whether he ever can come back again i know not a shade or spectre of him perhaps or himself besmirched and smudged armoreldragged through the mud no he shall come backhimselfin spotless robes now you shall take a studio and i will come and sit to you i may bring my little friend effie wilmot with me that is agreed then you will go sir this very morning and find a studio have you gone back to your old friends not yet i had very few friends i shall go back to them when i have got work to show not before i think you should go back as soon as you have taken your new studio it will be safer and better you have been too much alone and there is another thinga very important thingthe other night you made me a promise you tore up something that looked like a cheque and you assured me that this meant nothing less than a return to the old paths when i tore up that accursed cheque armorel i became a free man so i understood but when one talks of free men one implies the existence of the master or owner of men who are not free have you signified to that master or owner your intention to be his bondman no longer no i have not this man roland she laid her hand on his tell me frankly has he any hold upon you none can he injure you in any way can he revenge himself upon you is there any old folly or past wickedness that he can bring up against you none i have to begin the world again that is the outside mischief all your pictures you have sold to this man roland with me in every one yes all spare me armorel with you in every one forgive me if you can i understand now my poor friend why you were so cast down and ashamed what you sold your geniusyour holy sacred geniusthe spirit that is within you you flung yourself awayyour name which is yourselfyou became nothing while this man pretends that the picturesyourswere his he puts his name to them not your ownhe shows them to his friends in the room that he calls his studiohe sends them to the exhibition as his ownand yet you have been able to live oh how could youhow could you oh it was shamefulshamefulshameful how could you roland oh my masteri have loaded you with honouroh how could youhow could you the vehemence of her indignation soon revived the old shame roland hung his head how could i he repeated yes say it againask the question a thousand timeshow could i forgive me roland i have been thinking about it continually it is a thing so dreadful and yesterday somethingan unexpected somethingbrought it back to my mindandandmade me understand more what it meant and oh roland how could you i thought before that you had only idled and trifled away your time but now i know and againagainagainhow could you it is no excusebut it is an explanationi do not defend myself not the least in the worldbut armorel i was starving starving i could not sell my pictures no one wanted them the dealers would give me nothing but a few shillings apiece for them i was penniless and i was in debt a man who drops into london out of australia has no circle of friends and cousins who will stand by him i was alone perhaps i loved too well the luxurious life i tried for employment on the magazines and papers but without success in truth i knew not where to look for the next weeks rent and the next weeks meals i was a failure and i was penniless do you ask more then the man came he camemy name was worth nothinghe asked me to suppress it my workwhich no one would buyhe offered to buy for what seemed in my poverty substantial prices if i would let him call it his own what was the bargain a life of ease against the bare chance of a name with the certainty of hard times i was so desperate that i accepted you accepted yes but you might have given it up at any moment to be plunged back again into the penniless state for the life of ease mark you brought no ease but a bare subsistence only quite lately terrified by the success of the last picture my employer has offered to give me two thirds of all he gets the cheque you saw me tear up and burn was the first considerable sum i have ever received it is gone and i am penniless again and now that you are penniless now i shall pawn my watch and chain and everything else that i possess i shall finish this picture and i will sell it for what the dealers will give me for it too late this year for exhibition and so we shall see if the worst comes i can carry a pair of boards up and down piccadilly opposite to the royal academy and dream of the artistic life that once i hoped would be my own you will do better than that roland said armorel moved to tears oh you will make a great name yet but this mandont tell me his name roland promise me please not to tell me his name i want youjust nowto think that it is your own secretto yourself if i should find it out by accident that would bejust nowmy secretto myself this manyou have not yet broken with him not yet will you go to him and tell him that it is all over or will you write to him i thought that i would wait and let him come to me i would not if i were you i would write and tell him at once and plainly sit down roland and write nowat oncewithout delay then you will feel happier i will do what you command me he replied meekly he had indeed resolved with all his might and main that the rupture should be made but as yet he had not made it get paper then and write he obeyed and sat down what shall i say he asked write after four years of slavery i mean to become a man once more our compact is over you shall no longer put your name to my works and i will no longer share in the infamy of this fraud find if you can some other starving painter and buy him i have torn up your cheque and i am now at work on a picture which will be my own if there is any awkwardness about the subject and the style in connection with the name upon it that awkwardness will be yours not mine sowill you read it aloud i think said armorel that it will do he will probably come here and bluster a little he may even threaten he may weep you willrolandare you sureyou will be adamant i swear armorel i will be true to my promise armorel heaved a sigh would he stand steadfast he might have much to endure would he be able to endure hardness it is only the very young man who can be happy in a garret and live contentedly on a crust at twentysix or twentyseven the age at which roland had now arrived one is no longer quite so young the garret is dismal the crust is insipid unless there are solid grounds for hope yet he had the solid grounds of improved workgood work should you be afraid of him she asked afraid of him roland laughed why i never meet him but i curse him aloud afraid of him no i have never been afraid of anything but of becoming penniless povertydestitutionis an awful spectre and not only poverty buti confess with shame oh man of little faithshe did not want to hear the end of that confessionyou could not endure a single hour you did this awful thing for want of money i did said roland meekly the way of pleasure and the way of wealth i rememberyou told me long agothey draw the young man by ropes but not the girl why not the girl i have never felt this strange yearning for riot and excess in all the poetry the novels the pictures and the plays the young men are always being dragged by ropes to the way of pleasure are men so different from women what does it meanthis yearning i cannot understand it what is your way of pleasure that it should attract you so your poetry and your novels cannot explain it i see feasting in the way of pleasure drinking singing dancing gambling sitting up all night and lovemaking as for work there is none why should the young man want to feast it is like a city alderman to be always thinking of banquets why should you want to drink wine perpetually i suppose you do not actually get tipsy if you can sing and like singing you can sing over your work i suppose as for lovemakingshe paused the subject where a young man and a maiden discuss it has to be treated delicately i have always supposedshe added with hesitation for experience was lackingthat two people fall in love when they are fitted for each other but in this your wonderful way of pleasure the poets write as if every man was always wanting to make love to every woman if she is pleasant to look at and without troubling whether she is good or bad wise or silly oh every woman any woman there is neither dignity of manhood nor selfrespect nor respect to woman in this folly you cannot understand any of it armorel said roland we ought all of us to be flogged from newgate to tyburn that would not make me understand flora chloe daphne amaryllisthey are all the same to the poet a pretty girl seems all that he cares for can that be love and back again said roland still i should not understand in the poetry i think that lovemaking comes first and eating and drinking afterwards as for lovemaking she spoke philosophically as one in search of truth as for lovemaking i believe i could wait contentedly without it until i found exactly the one man i could love but that i should take a delight in writing or singing songs about making love to every man who was a handsome fellowany manevery manoh can one conceive such a thing there is but one way of pleasure to such as you roland if i could paint so good a picture as this is going to be it would be a lifelong joy i should never never never tire of it i should want no other pleasurenothing betterthan to work day after day to work and study to watch and observe to feel the mastery of hand and eye oh rolandwith this before youwith thisshe pointed to the pictureyou sold your soulyouyouyoufor feasting and drinking andandperhaps no armorel no everything else if you like but not lovemaking chapter xiii the dramatist if mrs elstree was armorels official and authorised companion her private unpaid companion was effie wilmot the official companion was resident in the chambers and was seen with her charge at the theatres and concerts the private unpaid companion went about with her all day long sat with her in her own room knew what she thought and talked with her of the things she loved to discuss so that though the representative of order and propriety had less to do the unpaid attachee had a much more lively time fortunately the official companion was best pleased when there was nothing to do in those days when london was as yet an unknown land to both of them the girls went together to see things nobody knows what a great quantity of things there are to see in london when you once set yourself seriously to explore this great unknown continent captain magalhaens himself crossing the pacific ocean for the first time did not experience a more interesting and exciting time than these two girls in their walks in and about the great town new to both they were as ravenous as american tourists beginning their european round and like them they consulted their baedeker their hare and their peter cunningham pictures there are all in the westend museums with every kind of treasure historic housesalas not many libraries art galleries of all kinds cathedrals churches ancient and modern old streets whose pavingstones are inscribed in the closest print with the most wonderful recollections old sites broken fragments even every morning the two girls wandered forth sometimes not coming home until late in the afternoon then effie went back to her lodging and spent the evening working at her verses while armorel practised her violin or read and dreamed away the time opposite her companion who sat for the most part in silence gazing into the firelight lying back in her easychair beside the fire these ramblings belong to another bookthe book of the things left out i could show you dear reader many curious and interesting places visited by these two pilgrims but one must not in this place write these down because armorels story is not armorels history let us always be careful to distinguish besides the events which have to be related destroyed as you will see the calm and tranquillity necessary for the proper enjoyment of such ramblings first this discovery concerning the pictures who can visit old churches and museums with a mind full of wrath and bitterness so wrathful was armorel in considering the impudence of the fraud she had discovered so bitter was she in considering the cowardice of her old hero that she even failed to observe the unmistakable signs of trouble which at this time showed themselves in her friends face if not a beautiful face it was expressive when the projecting forehead showed a thick black line when the deepset eyes were ringed with dark circles when the pale cheeks grew paler and more hollow and when the girl who was generally so bright and animated became silent and distraite something was wrong what is it effie armorel asked waking up i have asked you three questions and have received no answer and you are looking ill has anything gone wrong oh cried effie it is horrid you are in troubles of your own and you want me to add to them by telling you about mine i am in trouble dear and it makes me selfish and blind you know partly what it is about it is about the life that has gone wrong i have found out why and how but i can never tell you or anybody never mind tell me about yourself it is more about my brother than myself you know that archie has been writing a play yes you write verses which you have never shown me and your brother writes plays i shall see both some day perhaps whenever you like but archie has now finished his play yes that means to him more than i can possibly tell you he has been living for that play and for nothing else it has filled his brain day and night never was so much trouble given to a play before i am sure it is himself i understand wellthenyou will understand also what he feels when he has been told that his play is utterly worthless who told him that a great authoritya writer of great reputationthe only living writer whom we have ever known wellbuteffie if a great authority says this it is frightful it would be but for one thing which you shall hear afterwards however he did confess that some of the situations were fine but the dialogue he said was unfitted for the stage and no manager would so much as look at the play poor archie what a dreadful blow what does he say he is utterly cast down he sits at home and broods sometimes he swears that he will tear up the thing and throw it into the fire sometimes he recovers a little of his old confidence in it he will not eat anything and he does not sleep and i can find nothing to say that will comfort him if i knew anyone who would give him another opinionthe play cannot be so bad armorel will you read the play but my dear i am no critic what would be the good of my reading it i would rather have your criticism thanshe hesitatedthan anybodys because you can feeland you have the artists soul and everybody has notthough he may paint such beautiful pictures she added rather obscurely well i will read the play or hear him read it if you think it will do him any good effie i will go with you at once oh will you really archie will be shy at first the last criticism caused him so much agony that he dreads another but yours will be sympathetic at least you will understand what he meant even if he has not succeededpoor boyin putting on the stage what was in his heart when he sees that you do feel for him it will be different oh armorelthe tears rose to her eyesyou cannot know what that play has been to both of us we have talked over every situation we have rehearsed all the dialogue i know it by heart i think i could recite the whole of it straight through we have cried over it and laughed over it i have dressed dolls for all the parts and one of us made them act while the other read the play and after all to be told that it is worthless oh it is a shame it is a shame and it isnt worthless it is a great a beautiful play it is full of tenderness and of strength as well let us go at once effie what a good thing it was for me that the head of the reading room sent me to you i little thought i was going to make such a friendshe took armorels handwe had no friendsyes there was one but he is no true friend we have had no friends at all and we thought to make our way without any you came to london to conquer the worldsuch a great giant of a worldyou and your brother jack the giant killer ah but we had read somewhere that the world is a goodnatured giant he only asks to be amused if you make him laugh or cry and forget somehow his own troublesthe world is full of troubleshe will give in at once archie was going to make him laugh and cry i was going to tickle him with pretty rhymes but you may play for him act for him dance for him paint for him sing for him make stories for himanything that you will and he will be subdued that is what we read and we kept on repeating this assurance to each other but as yet we have not got very far the great difficulty seems to make him look at you and listen to you my dear you shall succeed the young dramatist was sitting at his table as melancholy as keats might have been after the quarterly reviews belabouring he looked wretched there was no pretence at anything else it was unmitigated wretchedness despair sat upon his countenance visible for all to see his hair had not apparently been brushed nor his collar changed since the misery began he seemed to have gone to bed in his clothes trouble does thus affect many men it attacks even their clothes as well as their hair and their minds the manuscript was lying on the table before him but the pen was dry he had no longer any heart to correct the worthless thing it was the hour of his deepest dejection the day before he had plucked up a little courage perhaps the critic was wrong today all was blackness here is armorel archie cried effie with the assumption of cheerfulness i have come to ask a favour said armorel taking the hand that was mechanically extended i hear that your play is finished and i am told that it is a beautiful play noit isnt said the author and that an unkind critic has said horrid and unkind things about it and i want to read it if i may oh i am not a great critic but indeed archie i have some feeling for art and for things beautiful may i read it the play is perfectly worthless he replied sternly but with signs of softening it is only waste of time to read it better throw it behind the fire he seized the manuscript as he spoke but he did not throw it behind the fire is your critic a dramatist no he has never written a play that i know of but he is a great authority everybody would acknowledge that a critic who has never written a play may very easily make mistakes said armorel you have only to read the critiques of pictures in the papers written by men who cannot paint they are full of mistakes this man would not make a mistake would he effie well dear i think he might and besides remember what he said at the conclusion armorel sat down now she said tell me first what the play is about and then read it or let effie read it i am sure she will read it a great deal better than you he hesitated he was ashamed to show his miserable work to a second critic and yet he longed to have another opinion because when he came to think about it he could not understand why the thing could be called worthless he yielded he read with faltering accents the scenario which he had prepared with so much pride now it was like unrolling a canvas daubed for the scenery of richardsons show he took no more pride in it oh cried armorel interrupting this seems to me a very fine situation my critic said that some of the situations were fine he went on to the end without further interruption now effie said armorel you will read it aloud while your brother plays it with his dolls then i am sure to catch the points archie sat up and began to place his dolls while effie read he was so expert in manipulating his puppets that he made them actually represent the piece changing the groups every moment while effie dropping the manuscript folded her arms and recited the play watching armorels face this was quite another kind of critic it was such a critic as the playwright loves when he sits in his box and watches the people in the housea face which is easily moved to laughter or to tears which catches the points and feels the story there are thousands of such faces in every theatre every night it is for them that the play is written and not for the critic who comes to show his superiority by picking out faults and watching for slips for two hours not pausing for the division of the acts effie went on her soft voice rising and falling the passion indicated but repressed and archie watched and moved his groups and the audience of one sat motionless but not unmoved what she cried springing to her feet and clasping her hands it is easy for this fine gesture to become theatrical and unreal but armorel was never unreal he dared to call this splendid playthis glorious playoh this beautiful sweet and noble playhere archies eyes began to fill and his lips to quiver he was but a young dramatist and of praise he had as yet had nonehe dared to call this worthless he said it was utterly worthless said effie he said archie added that the language was wholly unfitted for the stage and thenthenafter hed said that he offered to give me fifty pounds for it fifty pounds for a play quite worthless on the condition that he was to bring it out himself if he pleased under his own name oh but this is monstrous can there be asked armorel thinking of the pictures two such men in london if i would let him call it his own he wants to take my playmineto do what he likes with itto bring it out as if it was his own never never i would rather starve first what did you tell him he said that he would wait for an answer i have sent him none as yet when you do said armorel let there be no hesitation or possibility of mistaking oh if i could tell you a thing that i know i will put it quite plainly effie am i the same man i feel transformed what a difference it makes only to think that perhaps after all one is not such a dreadful failure in fact he looked transformed the trouble had gone out of himout of his faceout of his hairout of his clothesout of his attitude armorel even fancied that his limp daybeforeyesterdays collar had become white and starched again that may have been mere fancy but joy certainly produces very strange effects i would have sent an answer before he said but it is so unlucky for effie this great manthis criticis the only editor who would ever take her verses and now of course he will be offended and will never take any more he shall not have any more said effie with red cheeks oh but that would be horribly mean well archie i will begin by taking advice i know a dramatic critichis name is stephenson i will ask him what you should do next and i will ask him about your verses effie toothose verses which you are always going to show me i tell her said her brother that she will easily find another editor you would say so too if you were to see her verses i am always telling her she ought to show them to you the poet blushed some day perhaps when i am very courageous notoday archie opened a drawer and took out a manuscript book bound in limp brown leather i will read you one he said of course you will say kind things said the poet but you cannot deceive me armorel i shall tell by your eyes and by your face if you really like my rhymes well i will read one and i will lend you the volume and then you will see whether effie hasnt got her gifts as well as anybody else he turned over the pages selected a poem and read it the lines showed first of all the command that comes of long and constant practice and next they were sweet simple and pure in tone strange said armorel i seem to have heard something like them beforea phrase perhaps where did i read only the other day never mind but effie this is not ordinary girls verse oh you really like it of course i like it but it is so strangei seemed to know the style may i borrow the whole volume i will be very careful with it thank you i will carry it home with me and nowi have thought of a plan listen archie you know that many young dramatists bring out their pieces first at a matinee now suppose that you read your piece archie in my rooms in the evening should you like to do so i read badly he said could effie read or recite it the very thing bring your dolls along and arrange your groups while effie recites you will do that effie i will do anything that will help archie very well then we will get an evening fixed as soon as possible i fear we shall have to wait a week at least i will get my dramatic critic and a few more people and we will have a private performance of our own and then we shall defy this critic who said the piece was worthlessand then wanted to buy it and to bring it out as his own i could not have believed she added that there were two such impudent pretenders and liars to be found in the whole of london two asked ellie changing colour there can be only one chapter xiv an honourable proposal at the same time mr alec feilding whose ears ought to have been burning was engaged in a serious conversation in his own studio with armorels companion the conversation took the form of reproach i expected he saidi had a right to expectgreater devotionmore attention to business it was not for play that you undertook the charge of this girl how long have you been with her three months and no more influence with her than when you began not a bit more mrs elstree replied she had of course taken the most comfortable chair by the fire not a bit my dear alec what is more i never shall have any influence over her a society girl i could manage i know what she wants and how she looks at things with such a girl as armorel i am powerless she is a woman i suppose he occupied a commanding position on his own hearthrug towering above his visitor but yet he did not command her therefore you think open to flattery and artful wiles she is a woman and yet strange to say not open to flattery rubbish it is because you are too stupid or too careless to find out the weak point to return alec i have failed i have no influence at all upon this girl i have spent hours and hours in singing your praise i have enlarged upon the absolute necessity of giving you a rest from business cares i have proposed that she and i togetherthat was the way i put itshould buy a share in the paper and that she should advance my half oh i grew eloquent on the glory that two women thus coming to the relief of a man like yourself would achieve in after years i tried to speak from my heart alec the woman caught his hand but he drew it away oh you deserve no help you are hardhearted and you are selfish you have broken every promise you ever made me you spend all that you have in selfish pleasures you leave me almost without assistance when i have got you into the easiest and most luxurious berth that can be imagined when i have asked you for nothing but a simple yes dear alec but you see that an honest acknowledgment would be worth all this goodness well i say that i spoke from my heart because in spite of all i was proud of my manmine yes though philippa still imagines poor wretch do leave my cousins name out of it will you zoe he said a little less roughly i am proud of the man who is acknowledged to be the cleverest man in london she got up and began to walk about the studio she stopped before the picture do you know aleci am not a critic but i can feel a thingthat this is quite the best work you have ever done oh those waves they live and dance and those birds they fly and the air is so warm and softyou are a great painter odd your girl is curiously like armorel one would fancy your model was armorel at sixteen or soa lovely girl she must have been then and a lovely woman she is now zoe left the picture and began to look at the papers on the table what is thisthe new story is it good to you zoe i may confess that it is as good as anything i have ever done you are really splendid alec what is this she took up a very neatly written page in his handwriting poetry those are some verses for next weeks journal i think there is no falling off there zoe have you got another copy there is the copy that has gone to the printers then i will take this it will do for a presentthe autograph original draft of the poemor i may keep it zoe come back and sit down we must talk seriously she returned and took up her old position by the fire as seriously as you please it means something disagreeablesomething to do with money let us get it over to go back to what we were saying therefore i cannot get you that money from armorel and at the very word of money she refers one to her lawyer no confidence at all as between friends who love each other that is the position alec she sat with her hands clasped over her right knee i must have some money he said then as i have before remarked alecmake it if one cannot have money zoe one may get credit which is sometimes just as good i cannot help you in getting credit perhaps you can you can help me zoe by keeping quite quiet oh i am always quiet i have remained quiet for three years and more while you flirt with countesses and cousins how much more quiet do you wish me to remain while you marry them not quite that my child but next door to it while i get engaged to one of themto one who has money notphilippa noi told you before what the devil is the good of harping on philippa you see if i can let it be understood that i am going to marry an heiress the difficulties will be tided over therefore i shall get engaged to your chargearmorel rosevean oh zoe received this proposition with coldness this is a charming thing for me to sanction isnt it it will do you no harm i have certainly endured things as bad you see zoe one could always break off the thing when the time came certainly and you would know all the time that it was a mere pretence i should certainly know that well is there any other observation you would make it an open engagementgo about with herhave it publicly known of course the whole point is publicity i must be known to be engaged to an heiress and it would last as long as might prove necessary one could find an excuse at any time for breaking it off or i could just so it really amounts to nothing at all to nothing at all zoe neither raised her voice nor her eyes here is a man who proposes to pretend love and to win a girls affections when he can never marry her he also proposes to throw her over as soon as she has served his purpose it is nothing at all of course alec you are really a wonderful man nonsense the thing is done every day nonot every day if you are the cleverest man in london you are also the most heartless you know that you can say what you please he replied without any outward sign of annoyance even heroics but she said nursing her knee and swinging backwards and forwards we have forgotten one thingthe most important thing of all in fact my poor boy there is no more chance of your being engaged to armorel than of your entering into the kingdom of heaven why other girls you might catch you are tall and big and handsome and you have the reputation of being so very very clever most girls would be carried away but not armorel she is not subdued by bigness in men and she doesnt especially care for a clever man she is actually so oldfashionedthink of itthat she wantscharacter well what objection would that raise i should like to know zoe laughed softly and sweetly dont you see dear alec oh but you must let armorel explain to you chapter xv not two men but one great is the power of coincidence things have got a habit of happening just when they are most likely to be useful it is not on the stage alone that the longlost uncle turns up or the longmissing will is found in the cupboard and you cannot invent for fiction anything half so strange as the daily coincidence of common life a tolerably long experience of the common life has convinced me of this great truth therefore the coincidence which happened to armorel on the very day when the young dramatist unfolded his griefs will not by wise men be thought at all strange it was in the evening she was sitting with her companion thinking over archie and his play was it really good was it good enough to hold the stage and to command the attention of the audience to her it seemed a singularly beautiful poetical and romantic piece but armorel was of a lowly and humble mind she knew that she had no experience in things dramatic had it been a picture now oh cried her companion suddenly starting upright in the cushioned chair where she was lying apparently asleep i had almost forgotten my dear i have got a present for you from yourself zoe yes from myself it is a present which cost me nothing but is worth a good deal the making of it cost nobody anything yet it is a very precious thing the material of which it is made is worth nothing yet the thing is worth anything you please it must be a picture then it is a work of art but not a picture guess again no i will not guess any more may i have it without guessing zoe held in her hands a small roll of blue paper this she now opened and gazed at the writing upon it with idolatry but it hardly carried conviction with itperhaps it was a little overdone least imaginative of girls she said it pleased her to consider armorels refusal to join in that little scheme of hers as proving a lack of imagination i have brought you though you do not deserve it what any other girl in london would givewould givea dance perhaps to obtain and you shall have it for nothing i want to hear what it is it is nothing less armorel nothing lessi got it today from the table in his studiothan an autograph it is the copy used by the printersan autograph poem of alecs an autograph poem as yet unpublished is that all replied the least imaginative of girls you must not give it to me really you will value it far more than i shall besides i suppose it is to be published some day but the original manuscriptthe autograph poem dear child dont you know the value of such a thing take it you shall be enriched in spite of yourself take it and put it aside somewhere in your desk in some safe place heavens if one had the autograph of a poem of byron for example mr feilding is not byron said armorel coldly he may write pretty feminine verses but he is not byron thank you however i will take it and i will keep it and value it because you think it valuable i do not suppose the autograph verses of small poets are worth keeping but stillas you value it this was very ungracious and ungrateful but she was really tired of mr feildings praises and after the discovery of the pictures and after the strange story she had heard only that morningno she wanted to hear no more for the present of the praises of this manthe cleverest man in london however she unrolled the paper and began to read the contents at first carelessly then oh what is this she cried what is what asked mrs elstree this is a copy they were the same words as she had used concerning the pictures she remembered this and a strange suspicion seized her a copy she repeated wondering a copy not at all they are the verses which are to appear in the next number of the journalor the number after next alecs own verses of course sweetly pretty i think what makes you say that they are copied i thought that i had seen themsomething like themsomewhere before she went on reading as she read she remembered the lines more clearly what is the matter armorel asked zoe what makes you look so fierce heaven help your husband when you look like that did i look fierce it must have been something that i remembered yesthat was it may i read the verses again zoe read them suspiciously there was something in them which had startled armorel what was it she could see nothing to account for this emotion certainly she was not fond of poetry and failed to appreciate the fine turns and subtle tones the felicitous phrase and the unexpected thought with which the poet delights his readers in this little poem she could find nothing but a few jingling rhymes why should armorel behave so strangely what is it my dear she asked again something i rememberednothing of any importance armorel has alec said anything to you has hehas he wanted to make love to you has he offended you by speaking no there has been no question of lovemaking between us and there never will be one cannot say zoe looked at the matter from experience one can never say men are strange creatures and alec certainly thinks a great deal of you i cannot imagine his making loveany more than i can imagine his painting a picture or writing a poem perhaps he would make love as he paints well he paints very well very well indeed i dare say she got up i am going to leave you tonight zoe i want to go to my own room i have things to write you dont mind my dear child mind of course one would rather have your company but since you must leave meshe sank back in her chair with a sigh give me that book dearif you pleasethe french novel when one has been married one can read french novels without trying to conceal the fact they are mostly wicked and sometimes witty not always goodnight dear i shall not expect you back this evening armorel in her own room opened the manuscript book of poems which archie had given her and foundthe very last of allthe lines which she had remembered she laid the precious autograph beside effies poem word for wordcomma for commathey were exactly the same there was not the slightest difference and again armorel thought of the two pictures then she thought of the little dainty volume in white parchment containing the second series of voice and echo by alec feilding she had tossed it aside impatient with the man when zoe gave it to her now she looked for it and found it after a little search she opened it side by side with effies manuscript book presently she found the page in effies book which corresponded with the first page of the printed volume there were about thirty or forty poems in the little book in the manuscript book there were double that number but the same poems followed each other one after the other in the same order and without the difference of a single word both in book and manuscript this discovery justifies my remarks about the common coincidences of daily life again armorel remembered that zoe possessed another volumethe first series of voice and echo by alec feilding it was lyingshe had seen it in the afternoonin the drawingroom she went in search of it and returned without waking her companion who had apparently fallen asleep over her novel as a matter of fact mrs elstree was not sleeping she was broad awake but she was curious she desired to know what it all meant why armorel was suddenly struck with hardness why her cheek burned and her eyes flashed and what she wanted in the drawingroom she perceived that armorel had come in search of alecs first volume of verse oh alecs first volume of verse nowwhat might armorel want with that book at the end of march it is light at about halfpast five everybody is then in their soundest sleep but at that hour mrs elstree came softly out of her bedroom wrapped in a dressinggown her feet in soft slippers of white wool and looked at the books and papers on the table in armorels room there was a manuscript volume of verse professing to be by one effie wilmot there were also two printed little volumes bound in whiteandgold containing verses by one alec feilding strange and wonderful the verses in both books were exactly the same mrs elstree returned to bed thoughtful armorel for her part when she returned to her own room compared the first series of poems as she had compared the second with the manuscript book and the first series too word for word was the same as the earlier poems in the book good heavens cried armorel the man steals his verses as he steals his pictures poor effie she is as bad as roland this was thought the first one has already seen how the three thoughts treated her before this time it was just the same thought the second came next and began to argue a very capable logician is thought the second once distinguished for what oxford men call science if said thought the second the manuscript and the volumes agree it seems to show that effie has copied the latter into her own book and now tries to pass the poems off as her own such things have been done if this was the caseand why noteffie would be indeed a girl full of deceit and desperately wicked but then how came effie to have in her volume a poem hitherto unpublished which was lying on mr feildings table yet surely it was quite as probable that the girl should deceive her as that the man should deceive the world next thought the third this sage remarked calmly the man is full of villany he has deceived the world in the matter of the pictures why not also in the matter of the poems but let us consider the character of the verses take internal evidence then armorel read the whole series right through in the two little printed volumes oh they were feminine only a woman could write these lines womanhood breathed in every one now that the key was supplied she understood she recognised the voice eager passionate of her friend they are all effies she cried again allall the man has stolen his verses as well as his pictures this discovery when she had quite made up her mind that it was as true as the former entirely fell in with all that effie had told her concerning herself she had sold her poems all to one editorhe was the only editor who would ever take themand now she was afraid that he would take no more whywhybecauseoh now she understood allbecause he wanted to be a dramatist in the same way that he was a painter and a poet and neither archie nor his sister would consent yes she said he is indeed the cleverest man in london before she went to bed that night she had devised a little planquite an ingenious clever little plan you shall hear what it was and how it came off chapter xvi the play and the comedy armorel arranged for the reading of the play one evening four or five days later it was a short notice but she secured the people whom she wanted most and trusted to chance for the others she occupied herself in the interval in arranging the details and leading situations for a little comedy drama of her owna play of some melodramatic force in which as in hamlet a certain guilty person was to discover by a kind of dumb show that his guilt was known to her it was to be a comedy which no one except herself was to understand you shall see directly what an extremely clever little comedy it was and how effective to the person principally concerned she said nothing at all about this comedy even to effie as for words there were none they were left to the principal character this is indeed the ancient and original drama the situations were at the outset devised beforehand the actors filled in the dialogue this form of drama is still kept up and with vigour when the schoolboy sets the boobytrap or sews up the shirtsleeves or greases the sidewalkif that old situation is still rememberedor practises any other kindly and mirthful sally the victim supplies the words the confidence trick in all its branches is another form of the primitive drama and this evenings performance with reference to a certain person was only another example you will hear presently what admirable dialogue was elicited by armorels situations by halfpast eight she had completed the mounting of her piece first for the reading of the play she placed a table at the side of the room with a space at the back sufficient for a chair or for a person to sit a readinglamp with one of those silver cowls that throw the whole light upon the table stood at either end illuminating a small space in the middle this was for the manipulation of the dolls for though the people had been asked to come for a reading armorel had determined to try the experiment of a recitation accompanied by the presentment of those puppets which effie had dressed with such care and her brother manipulated so deftly needless to say that more than one rehearsal had been held in front of the table she placed a semicircle of chairs for some of her audience at one side of the table was the piano a musicstand with a violin case gave promise of an overture between the musicstand and the table was room for a person to stand and on the table a waterdecanter and a glass showed that this was the place for the reciter on the other side of the table in the corner of the room stood an easel and on it a picture with curtains arranged so that they could fall over and cover it up the picture was lighted up by two lamps the room had no other lights in it at all so that if these two lamps were lowered or extinguished the only light would be that thrown by the readinglamps upon the table as for the picture it was as yet unfinished but nearly finished of course it was roland lees new picture this evening indeed which professed to be the simple reading of a new play by a new writer included a great deal more it included in fact rolands return to the arena he had deserted and as you shall see the stepping upon the stage of both the twins brother and sister when one adds that mr alec feilding would be one of the company you understand dear reader the nature of armorels comedy and the kind of situation devised and prepared by that artful and vindictive young lady how long will it take dear asked mrs elstree wearily contemplating these preparations i should say that the play will take an hour and a half or two hours to recite then there will be a little music between the acts i dare say it will last two hours and a half oh that will bring us to halfpast eleven at least and then it will be too late for anything else we dont want anything else tonight no dear the play will be quite enough for us i wish it was over i am so constituted armorel that i cannot see the least use in going out of my way to help anybody if you succeed in helping people to climb up they only trample on you as soon as they get the chance if you fail they are a burden upon you for life these two wilmot people for instance what are you going to do with them when you have read their play and stuff you cant get a manager to play it any the more for having it read the two are no further advanced yes i shall have made the young man known he will be introduced mr stephenson promised to bring some critics with him and you have asked mr feilding to do the same an introductionperhaps the creation of some personal interestmay be to archie of the greatest advantage then he will rise by your help and he will proceed to trample upon you that is if the brother is like the sister if ever i saw trampler written plain on any womans face it is written on the great square block of bone that effie wilmot calls a forehead they may trample on me if they please armorel replied smiling the tramplers were naturally the first to arrive they were both pale and they trembled especially the one who was not going to speak he came in limping on his crutches and looked around with terror at the preparations one does not realise before the night comes what a serious thing is a first appearance in public besides the strong light on the table the expectant chairs the arrangement of everything presented an aspect at once critical and threatening the manuscript play and the box of puppets were in readiness now archie said armorel it is not yet nine oclock you shall have a cup of coffee to steady your nerves so shall you effie after that we will settle ourselves she talked about other things to distract their thoughts see effie that is roland lees new picture it is not yet finished the central figure is myself you see it is as yet only sketched in i am going to sit for him but he has caught a good likeness has he not it will be a lovely picture when it is completed and i am going to give him permission to flatter me as much as ever he pleases the scene is among the outer rocks of scilly we will go there some day and sail about the western islands and i will show you camber rock and the channel and castle bryher and menovawr and maiden bower and all the lovely places where i lived till i was sixteen years of age are you in good voice tonight effie i dont know i hope so she has eaten nothing all day said archie you are not really frightened are you effie the girl was white with nervousness a little excited and anxious will you have another cup of coffee a little jelly remember i shall be close beside you with the play in my hand to prompt i like your dress you look very well in white dear oh armorel i am horribly frightened if i should break down archies chance will be ruined and if i recite it badly i shall spoil the play you will not break down dear you will think of nothing but the play you will forget the people besides it will be so dark that you will hardly see them i will try my best perhaps when i beginoh for archies sake i would stand up on the stage at the theatre and speak before all the people and yet she had no sleep last night said her brother i think after all i had better read it only i read so badly armorels face fell she had thought so much of the reciting then mrs elstree came to the rescue nonsense she said you three people are making yourselves so nervous that you will most certainly break down now mr wilmot go into your own place set out your dolls heres your cardboard back scene she arranged it while archie got himself and his crutches into the chair behind and began to take the dolls out of their box so now dont speak to your sister you will only make her worse and as for you effie if you break down now you will be a most disgraceful coward with your brothers future perhaps dependent on your courage for shame pull yourself together effie thus rudely stimulated and by a person she disliked greatly lost her limpness and stood upright her face also put on a little colour and her lips stiffened the tonic worked in fact then zoe went on now she said take up your position here how are you going to stand fold your hands so that is a very good attitude to begin with of course you understand nothing of gesture dont try it change your hands a littlesofrontrightleftlike that and dontdontdont hold your head like that facing the crowd hold it uplike this look at the corner of that cornicestraight up oh you will lower your head as you go on but to begin with and at the opening of each act look up to that corner remember if you break down she held up a forefinger threatening admonitory and left her standing in position you will do now she said besides said armorel no one will look at you they will all be looking at archies actors the dramatist relegated to the humble position of fantocciniman would be also in complete shade behind the table he would not be seen whatever emotion of anxiety he should feel and for dexterity of manipulation with his puppets he could vie even with the firm of codlin and short the noise of cups and saucers in the diningroom proclaimed the arrival of guests the first to come was roland lee still a little shy as alexander selkirk might have been or philip quarles or mr penrose on his return to civilised society he looked about the room mrs elstreelooking resignedand armorel standing by the fire and the two performers nobody else and in a place of honour his unfinished picture it looks very well doesnt it said armorel i wish it was a little more complete but it will do to show are you quite sure it is wise quite sure the sooner you show everybody what you can do the better i have found a new studio he told her in low tones i have moved in today it is among the old lot of men that i used to know a little i have gone back to them just as if i had only been gone for a day i dont find that they have got on very much perhaps they spend too much time smoking pipes and cigarettes and talking they chaff me but with respect because i believe they think i have been staying in a lunatic asylum respect you know is due to madmen and to old men i hope it is the kind of studio you want it will do i am anxious to begin your sittings when can you come any day you please tomorrow the next day i can begin at once then came a small party of menjournalists and criticscaptured by dick stephenson at the club and bribed to come by the promise of an introduction to the beautiful miss armorel rosevean i do not think they expected much joy from the amateur reading of an unacted piece it is melancholy indeed to consider that though the preliminary and tentative performance of the unacted playlong prayed forhas been at last established the promised appearance of the great dramatist has not yet come offnay the theatrical critic weeps swears and growls at the mention of a matinee and when he is requested to attend one passes it on if he can to his younger brother in the calling and yet such great treasures were expected of the matinee however they agreed to come and listen on this occasion it shall be put down to their credit as a samaritan deed dick stephenson said armorel with an assumption of old friendship which filled him with pride i hope you are come here tonight in a really serious frame of mindyou and your friends we are always serious i mean that you are going to hear an ambitious piece of work all i ask of you is to listen seriously and to remember that it is really the work of a man who aims at the very highest will he reach the very highest i do not know but i am quite certain that there are very few artists in any branch who dare to aim high listen and try to understand what the poet has attemptedwhat has been in his mind promise me this certainly i will promise you so much thank you it was for this that i asked you tonight and seehere is your old friend roland lee the two young men shook hands rather sheepishlythe one because he had been an assa longeared ass and the other because he was not guiltless of letting his friend slip out of his hands without a remonstrance and so away into paths unknown i hear said armorel with her beautiful seriousness that you two have suffered yourselves to drift apart of late i hope that will be all over now oh you must never give up the early friendships have you seen rolands new picture he has lent it to me for this evening come and look at it why cried one of the men it is an unfinished picture of alec feildings roland turned hot and red not at all said armorel this is a sketch made in the isles of scilly and in my presence five years ago as for the figure you see it is not yet completed i am the model you remember scilly dick stephenson to be sure you were not with us when we used to go sailing about among the rocks i have reason to remember scilly seeing that you saved my life there and rolands too but the picture is curiously in feildings style only it seems to me better than any of his old manhe laid his hand on rolands shoulder it was the renewal of the ancient friendshipold man youve done the trick at last philippa came next with her father and two or three girls they in their turn called out upon the striking similarity in style a few more people came and it was a quarter past nine but the man for whom armorel had especially arranged her little comedy did not come he was late perhaps he would not come at all we must wait no longer said armorel will everybody please to sit down philippa placed herself at the piano armorel took out her violin and tuned it first however she made a little speech i have asked you she said to come this evening in order to hear a play read it is a play written by a young gentleman in whom some of us take the deepest interest i hope greatly that it will succeed but we want your judgment and opinion as well as our own the play belongs to all time and to no time the scene is laid in italy and in the sixteenth century but it might as well have been laid in london and in the nineteenthonly that we are more selfgoverned than a dramatist likes and we conceal our emotions it is a play of romance and of human passion i entreat you to consider it seriouslyas seriously as the author himself considers it we have arranged for you a list of the dramatis personae with a little scenario of each actthere are threeand we think that if instead of hearing it read we have it recited while the author himself plays the piece before us by puppets on this little stage we shall get a clearer idea of the dramatic merits of the piece this speech done everybody took up the little book of the play and began to read the scenario while armorel played an overture with philippa she played a hungarian piece one of the things that are now played everywherea quite short piece when it was finished roland lowered the lamps beside his picture and covered them with crimson shades then there was no other light in the room but that from the two readinglamps on the table just before the lamps were lowered mr alec feilding arrived with half a dozen men whom he had brought with him she saw his startled face as he caught sight of the picture as the lights were lowered in the twilight she could still distinguish his face among the men who stood behind the chairs and she watched him then effie who had not seen the latest arrival took her place and the play began the effect was new and very curious the people saw a girl standing up beside the tableonly the shadow of a girla ghostly figure in whitethe spectre of a white facetwo bright eyes flashing in the dim light and they heard her voice a rich low contralto beginning to recite the play it is not the nervous creature who breaks down he may generally be trusted he lies awake for whole nights before the time arrives he reaches the spot weakkneed trembling and pale but when the hour strikes he braces himself stands up and goes through with it effie had been partly pulled together it is true by the rough exhortation of mrs elstree but some credit must be given to her own resolution she began with a little hesitation fearing that she should forget the words then they came back to her she saw them written plainly before her eyes in that friendly corner of the cornice she hesitated no longer in full and flowing flood she poured forth the dialogue helped to right modulation by the strength of her own feeling and her belief in the beauty and the splendour of the drama armorel meantime watched her man he had seen the picture now he recognised the play and he knew the reciter as he stood at the back tall above the rest she saw his face change from astonishment gradually to dismay it was rather a wooden face but it passed plainly and successively through the phases of doubt and certainty to that of dismay yes dismay was written on that face with discomfiture and suspicion in a more demonstrative age he would have sat gnawing his nails every wicked man overtaken by the consequence of his own wickedness used formerly to gnaw his nails on the stage of the last century he would have turned upon his persecutors with a death and confusion before he banged off the scene we no longer use those fine old phrases on the modern stage he would stand with straightened arms and bowed head while the rest of the company pointed fingers of scorn at him crushed but defiant in armorels drawingroom he stood quiet and motionless trying to collect himself he saw first of all roland lees new picture in the corner he saw roland lee himself no longer the negligent despairing sloven but once more a gentleman to outer view and in his right mind next he observed that effie his own poet was reciting the play and thirdly that the play was that for which he had himself made a bid thus all threepainter poet and dramatistwere friends of this girl armorel and they had all three he knew quite well slipped clean out of his hands for ever and were lost to him and all three he suspected had already related to each other the history of his doings and dealings with themselves therefore while the play proceeded his heart sank lowlowerlower there were three acts when the first was finished armorel stood up again and with philippa played another little piece but not long and so between the second and the third watching the people armorel became aware that the play had gripped them and held them fast no one moved the little space upon the table between the two lamps where the puppets stood before the painted screen of cardboard became a scene richly mounted it was a garden or a dancinghall or an arbour or a library just as those little books told them and the puppets were men and women we want so little of mounting to fire the imagination if only the poet has the strength to seize it and to hold it by his words nothing in this case but a modulated voice reciting a dramatic poem and to help it out a dozen dressed dolls six or seven inches high standing stiffly on a little stage yet even when passion was at its highest in the great scene of the third act they were not ridiculous nobody laughed at the dolls that was because the showman knew their capabilities when they stood in their place they indicated the nature of the situation and explained the words had he tried to make them act he would have spoiled the whole they made a series of groupstableaux vivants poses plastiquesconstantly changed by the deft hands of the showman finding relief in this occupation for the anxiety in his soul for he less fortunate than effie who had grasped the cheering truth could not read in the circle of still faces before him their rapt and magnetised condition and now the end of the third act was neared the reciter rose to the concluding situation her voice firm and clear rang out in the dim light the younger girls in the audience caught each others hands the lines were good lines strong and nervous rapid and yet intense equal to the strength and intensity of the situation at last the play was finished effie armorel caught her in her arms you have done splendidly but the girl drew back the honours of the evening were not for her but for her brother she stood aside armorel took the cowls from the readinglamps and the room returned to light then the people began all to press round the dramatist and to shake hands solemnly with him to murmur to assure to congratulate and to prophesy and the loud voice of mr alec feilding arose as he stepped forward among the first and grasped the young mans hand archie he said with astounding friendliness this is better than i expected let me congratulate you i have had the privilege he explained to the multitude of hearing this playat least a part of italready i told you my dear boy that your situations were splendid but your dialogue wanted pulling together in parts you have attended to my advice i am glad of it the result promises to be a splendid success what say you he turned to a very wellknown dramatic critic whom he had brought with him if you can get the proper man to play the leading part he replied more quietly the play seems to me full of promise frankly mr wilmot i think you have written a most poetical and most romantic piece it is valuable not only for itself but for the promise it contains for its promise repeated alec feilding blandly as i told you my dear boy for its promiseits admirable promise i shall not rest now until this play is producedeither at the lyceum or at the haymarket once more again he grasped archie by the hand then another and another followed it was not until the next day the dramatist recovered presence of mind enough to remember that mr feilding had not given him any advice that he had not said it was a work of promise that he had offered to buy it for fifty pounds and bring it out as his own with his own name put to it and that no alteration of any kind had been made in it when mr alec feilding stepped back he perceived that some one had turned up the lamps beside the picture he was a man of great presence of mind and resource he instantly stepped over to the picture and began to examine it curiously armorel followed him this is by my old friend mr roland lee she said do you know him let me introduce him to you the men bowed distantly as those who having met for the first time in a crowd see no reason for desiring to meet each other again that they should so meet with such an assumption of never having met before struck armorel with admiration the picture is a good deal in your own style feilding said one of the critics perhaps replied the successful painter in that style briefly it is taken from a sketch armorel explained made by mr lee while he was staying at the same spot as myself he made a great number at the timewhich is now five years ago mr alec feilding heard this statement with outward composure inwardly he was raging it is in fact exactly in your style said the same critic one would say that it was a copy of one of your pictures perhaps he replied again if said roland mr feilding sends another picture in the same style for exhibition this year i hope that the similarity of style may be tested by their hanging side by side shall you send anything this yearin the same style asked armorel i hardly know i have not decided the critic looked at the picture more closely strange he murmured one would swear the same styleso individualand belonging to two different men then roland covered his picture over with the curtain there had been enough said now said armorel after our emotions and our fatigues of the play we are exhausted there is supper in the next room before we go in i want to sing you a song i am not a singer you know and you must only expect simple warbling but i want you to like the song she sat down to the piano and played a few bars of introduction then she sang the first verseit was effies latest song that which mr feilding had accepted but not yet published he heard and recognised this third blow finished him he sat down on the nearest chair speechless mrs elstree watched him wondering what was the matter with him for he was in a speechless rage lucky for him that it was speechless because for the moment he was beside himself and might have said anything that is the first verse said armorel i have set it to an old french air which i found in a book the words seem written for the music there are two more verses she sang them through her voice was pleasing though not strong she sang sweetly and with feeling just as she had sung in the old days on the shores of samson to the accompaniment of the waves lapping along the white sands and she watched the man whom she had been torturing the whole evening through would not even this rouse him to some word or deed which might proclaim him a pretender and an impostor discovered she knew you see that the lines were actually in type ready to appear as another poem by the editor she finished and rose do you like the song philippa she said i have even had it printed and set to music anybody that pleases may carry away a copy i hope everybody will and keep it in remembrance of this evening for the words are written by miss effie wilmot who has recited so beautifully her brothers play we will share the honours of the evening between them archie will you give me your arm rolandin her excitement she called him by his christian name which caused a little surprisewill you take effie do you like the words mr feilding very much indeed i had seen them before you i think yes then you recognised them you have seen other poems by the same hand i believe goodnight miss rosevean i have had a delightful evening he retired without any supper on his way out he passed effie you should have trusted me he whispered hoarsely i expected at least common confidence you will find that i have kept my promiseand you have broken yours he passed on and disappeared then they trooped in to the diningroom where they found spread that kind of midnight refection which is dear to the hearts of those who are yet young enough to love champagne and chicken and after supper they went back to the drawingroom and danced mrs elstree played to themnobody could play a waltz better roland danced with armorel you make me believe he said at the end of the waltz that i am really back again of course you are back again then armorel danced with the critics and talked about the play and they all promised to go to great actors and speak about this wonderful drama and so all went away at last and all to bed well content but said zoe when the last was gone what was the matter with alec why did he look so glum what made him in such an awful rage he can get into a blind rage armorelblind and speechless as for that i would not give a button for a man who could not but what was the matter with him was he in a rage perhaps he wished that he had written the play himself such a clever man as that would be sorry perhaps that anything good was written except by himself mr alec feilding rushed down the stairs and into the street he hailed a cab and jumped into it fleet street quick his printers he knew had work which kept them at work on thursday nights till long past midnight it was not too late to make a correction his paper would be printed in the morning and ready for issue by five oclock in the afternoon in fact effie received a note from him on saturday morning my dear effie he wrote i send you a copy of my new number you will find on looking into the editorial columns that i have performed what i promised not only have i accepted and published your very charming verses but i have added a brief note introducing the writer as a debutante of promise so much i am very pleased to have been able to do for you now as one writer introducing another i leave you with your public give them of your best let your first set of published verses prove your worst aim at the best and highest write in a spirit of truth let your art be sincere and selfrespectful i am sorry that this note written on tuesday could not contain what i should much have wished to add had i known it that your verses have been adapted to an old air by miss armorel rosevean you did not however think fit to take me into your confidence i cannot hope to give you more than an occasional appearance in my columns i should advise you with this introduction of mine and the credentials of being published in my paper to send verses to the magazines i think you will have little difficulty with the help of my name in gaining admission allow me to add my congratulations on your brothers undoubted success his play is admirable as a chamber play it may also succeed on the stage but of this it is impossible to be certain meantime it is very cheering to find that he listens to the advice of those who have a right to speak and that he follows that advice it is both cheering to his friends and promising as regards his own future i do not regret the time that i spent in advising upon that play i remain my dear effie very sincerely yours alec feilding the paper which contained the verses contained also the following paragraph in place of the usual editorial versesmy editorial duties do not always give me leisure for the service of the musei have great pleasure in inserting a set of verses from the pen of a young lady whose name is new to my readers she makes her bow to my readers in this column i venture however to prophesy that she will not long remain unknown wherever the english language is spoken before many years the name of effie wilmot shall be known and loved this is the prophecy of one who at least can recognise good work when he sees it effie read both letter and paragraph to her brother who raged and stormed about the alleged advice and assistance she also read them both to armorel who only laughed a little but said effie he never helped archie at all he gave him no advice my dear if he chooses to say that he did what does it matter time goes on and every day will make your brother rise higher and mr feilding sink lower and as to the verses effie and youryour first appearanceeffie turned away her shamefaced cheekwhy we will take his advice and try other editors mr feilding is indeed the cleverest man in london chapter xvii the national gallery contrary to all reasonable expectation alec feilding called at armorels rooms the very next morningand quite early in the morning when it was not yet eleven armorel however had already gone out he was received by mrs elstree who was as usual sitting apparently asleep by the fire you have come in the hope of seeing armorel alone i suppose she said yes you remember zoe he replied quicklyshe observed that he was pale and that he fidgeted nervously and that his eyes restless and scared looked as if somebody was hunting himthat we had a talk about it you said you wouldnt make a row you know you did you consented oh yes i remember i am to play another part and quite a new one you too are about to play a new partone not generally desiredquite the stage villain he made a gesture of impatience consider however she went on quickly before he could speak do you think this morningthe day after yesterdayquite propitious for your purpose what do you mean he asked quickly why not the day after yesterday nothing still if i might advise zoe you know nothing at all and time presses if there was reason a week ago for me to be the reputed and accepted lover of this girl there is tenfold more reason now you dont know i say for heavens sake dont spoil things now by any interference he was at least in earnest mrs elstree contemplated him with curiosity it seemed as if she had never seen him really in earnest before but now she understood he knew by this time that armorel had discovered the source the origins of his greatness she might destroy him by a word this knowledge would pierce the hide of the most pachydermatous his strength you see was like that of samsonit depended on a secret it also now resembled that of samson in that it lay at the mercy of a woman alec said mrs elstree softly you were greatly moved last night by several thingsby the play by the picture by the song i watched you while the rest were listening to the play i watched you the room was dark and you thought no one could see you but i could make out your features armorel watched you too but for other motives i was wondering she was triumphant you know why what do you know your face which is generally so well under command expressed surprise rage disgust and terrorall these passions dear alec on the stage we study how to express them we represent an exaggeration so that the gallery shall understand and we call it art but i know the symptoms what else do you know i ask this morning you are nervous and agitated you are afraid of something alec you know what i think of the cruelty and hardheartedness of this project of yoursto sustain your credit on an engagement which will certainly not last a monthi could not possibly suffer the girl to be entangled longer than thatnow give it over i cannot give it over it is my only chance zoe you dont know the mischief she has done me and will do me again it is ruinruin well then alec dont go after her today indeed i advise you not you are not in a condition to approach the subject and she is not in a condition to be approached i do not ask your reasons or the kind of mischief you mean i sit here and watch in the course of time i find out all things how much do you know zoe what have you found out knowledge alec is power should i part in a moment and for nothing with what i have acquired at the expense of a great deal of contriving and putting together certainly not you can go and find armorel if you persist in choosing such a day for such a purpose she has gone i believe to the national gallery i must find her today i must bring things to a head good heavens i dont know what new mischief they may be designing go home and wait alec no one will do anything to you today you are nervous and excited you dont understand i say tell me did the men talk last nightabout mein your hearing not in my hearing certainly go home and rest alec i cannot rest i must find the girl well if you want hergo and find her alec remember if you stood the faintest chance of success with her i think i should have to get up and warn her even for your sake i do not think i could suffer this wickedness to be done but you have no chancenonenot on any day particularly on this dayand after last night go howevergo when things have gone so far that assignations and appointments are made and places of secret meeting agreed upon there is hardly any place in the whole of london more central more convenient or safer than the national gallery here the young lady of society may be perfectly certain of remaining undiscovered at the south kensington no one is quite safe because in the modern enthusiasm for art all kinds of peopleeven people in societysometimes go there to see embroideries and hangings and handiwork of every sort the india museum is perhaps safer even than the national gallerysafer for such a purpose than any other spot in the world but there is a loneliness in its galleries which strikes a chill to the most ardent heart and damps the spirit of the most resolute lover in the national gallery there are plenty of people but they are all country visitors or americans or copyists never any people of the young ladys own set and there is never any crowd one can sit and talk undisturbed and quiet the copyists chatter or go on with their work regardless of anything the attendants slumber the visitors pass round room after room looking for pictures which have a story to telland a story which they can read that you see is the only kind of pictureunless it be a picture of a pretty facewhich the ordinary visitor commonly understands not many young people know of this place and those who do keep the knowledge to themselves the upper rooms of the british museum are also commended by some for the same reason but the approaches are difficult this use of the national gallery once understood the thing which happened here the day after the reading of the play will not seem incredible though it certainly was not intended by the architect when he designed the building otherwise there might have been convenient arbours armorel went often to the gallery the english girl reserves as a rule her study of pictures and art generally till she gets to florence armorel who had also studied art in florence found much to learn in our own neglected gallery sometimes she went alone sometimes she went with effie and then being quite a learned person in the matter of pictures and their makers she would discourse from room to room till the day was all too short the country visitors streamed past her in languid procession the lovers met by appointment at her very elbow the copyists flirted talked scandal wasted time and sighed for commissions but armorel had not learned to watch people she came to see the pictures she had not begun to detach an individual from the crowd as a representative in other words she was not a novelist this morning she was alone she carried a notebook and pencil and was standing before a picture making notes it was a wet morning the rooms were nearly empty and the galleries were very quiet she heard a manly step striding across the floor she half turned as it approached her mr alec feilding took off his hat mrs elstree told me you were here he said i ventured to follow yes youyoucome often i believe he looked pale and for the first time in armorels recollection of him he was nervous there is i believe a good deal to be learned here there is especially by those who want to paintof course i meanwho want to do their own paintings by themselves mr feilding frankly what do you want why do you come here in search of me her face hardened her eyes were cold and resolved but the man was full of himself he noted not these symptoms i came because i have something to say of importance of great importance not i hope connected with art do not talk to me about art if you please mr feildingnot about any kind of art he bowed gravely one cannot always listen to conversation involving canons and first principles he said with much condescension let me however congratulate you on the promise of your proteges archie and effie wilmot they are clever they are distinctly clever he repeated recovering his usual selfpossession effie as perhaps she has told you has been my pupil for a long time she has told me in fact something about her relations to you yes the man was preoccupied and rather dense by nature therefore he caught only imperfectly these side meanings in armorels replies yesquite soi have been able to be useful to her and to her brother alsovery useful indeed happily and toto othersas wellvery useful indeed armorel echoed he understood that there was some kind of menace in these words but the very air this morning was full of menace he passed them by it is a curious coincidence that you should also have taken up this interesting pair it ought to bring us closer quite the contrary mr feilding it puts us far more widely apart i do not understand that we have a common interest for instance only the other day i accepted a poem of effies only the other day mr feilding yes the day before yesterday i had it set up and i added a few words introducing the writer that was the day before yesterday judge of my astonishment when only yesterday you sang that very song and handed it round printed with the accompaniment i have made no alteration the verses will appear tonight with my laudatory introduction some men might complain that they had not been taken into confidence but i do not effie is a little genius in her way she is not practical she does not understand that having disposed of her verses to one editor she is not free to give them to another but i do not complain if your action in her cause brings her into notice here was a turning of tables now some men overdo a thing they smile too much they rub their hands nervously they show a nervous anxiety to be believed not so this man he spoke naturallyhe had now recovered his usual equanimity he looked blankly unconscious that any doubt could possibly be thrown upon his word since he said it the thing must be so men of honour have always claimed and exacted this concession therefore the following syllogism mr alec feilding is a man of honour everybody must acknowledge so much a man of honour cannot lie elsewhat becomes of his honour therefore any statement made by mr alec feilding is literally true armorel showed no doubt in her face why should she there was no doubt in her mind the man was a liar the wilmots will get on she said coldly without any help from anybody now mr feilding you came to say something important to me shall we go on to that important communication she took a seat on the divan in the middle of the room he stood over her there is no one here this morning she said you can speak as freely as in your own study among your many fine qualities miss rosevean he began floridly but with heightened colour a certain artistic reserve is reckoned by your friends perhaps the highest it makes you queenly mr feilding i cannot possibly discuss my own qualities with any but my friends your friends surely i also my friends mr feilding armorel repeated bristling like the fretful porcupine but the man preoccupied and thick of skin and full of vainglory and conceit actually did not perceive these quills erect armorels pointed remarks did not prick his hide her coldness he took for her customary reserve therefore he hurried to his doom give me he said the right to speak to you as your dearest friend you cannot possibly mistake the attentions that i have paid to you for the last few weeks they must have indicated to youthey were indeed deliberately designed to indicatea preferencedeepening into a passion i think you had better stop at once mr feilding there are many men who honestly believe that they are irresistible it seems incredible but it is really true it is the consciousness of masculine superiority carried to an extreme they think that they have only to repeat the conventional words in the conventional manner for the woman to be subjugated they come they conquer now this man who plainly saw that he was to a certain extenthe did not know how fardetected actually imagined that the woman who had detected him in a gigantic fraud one day would accept his proffered hand and heart the very next day there are no bounds you see to personal vanity besides for this man if it was necessary that he should appear as the accepted suitor of a rich girl it was doubly necessary that the girl should be the one woman in the world who could do mischief he was anxious to discover how much she knew but of his wooing he had no anxiety at all he should speak she would yield she could do nothing else permit me he replied blandly to go on i am as you know a leader in the world of art i am known as a painter a poet and a writer of fiction i have other ambitions still doubtless you will succeed in these as you have succeeded in those three arts thank you he really did not see the meaning of her words i take your words as of happy augury armorel no sir not my christian name if you please give me the right to call you by your christian name you are asking me to marry you is that what you mean it is nothing less really when i tell you mr feilding that i know youthat i know youit will be plain to you that the thing is absolutely impossible to know me he replied showing no outward emotion should make it more than possible what could i wish better than to be known to you she looked him full in the face he neither dropped his eyes nor changed colour what could be better for me he repeated what could i hope for better than to be known oh this man is truly wonderful she cried must i tell you what i know it would be better perhaps you look as if you knew something to myactuallyif i may say soactually to my discredit armorel gasped his impudence was colossal to your discredit oh actually to your discredit sir i know the whole of your disgraceful historythe history of the past three or four years i know by what frauds you have passed yourself off as a painter and as a poet i know by what pretences you thought to lay the foundation for a reputation as a dramatist i know that your talk is borrowedthat you do not know art when you see it that you could never write a single line of verseand that of all the humbugs and quacks that ever imposed themselves upon the credulity of people you are the worst and biggest he stared with a wonder which was at least admirably acted good heavens he said these wordsthese accusationsfrom you from armorel roseveancousin of my cousinwhom i had believed to be a friend can this be possible who has put this wonderful array of charges into your head that matters nothing they are true and you know it they are so true he replied sternly that if anyone were to dare to repeat these things before a third person i should instantlyinstantlyinstruct my solicitors to bring an action for libel remember youth and sex would not avail to protect that libeller if anyoneanyonedares i say oh say no more go and do not speak to me again what will be done with this knowledge i cannot say perhaps it will be used for the exposure which will drive you from the houses of honest people go i say illustration oh say no more go and do not speak to me again she stamped her foot and raised her voice insomuch that two drowsy attendants woke up and looked round thinking they had dreamed something unusual the injured man of art and letters obeyed he strode away he who had come pale and hesitating now on learning the truth which he had suspected and on receiving this unmistakable rejection walked away with head erect and lofty mien he showed at least by outward bearing the courage which is awakened by a declaration of war chapter xviii congratulations in the afternoon of the same day armorel received a visit from a certain lady frances of whom mention has already been made she was sitting in her own room alone the excitements of the last night and of the morning were succeeded by a gentle melancholy these things had not been expected when she took her rooms and plunged into london life besides after these excitements the afternoon was flat lady frances came in dressed beautifully gracious and cordial she took both armorels hands in her own and looked as if she would have kissed her but for conscientious scruples she was fiveandforty or perhaps fifty fat comfortable and rosycheeked and she began to talk volubly not in the common and breathless way of volubility which leaves out the stops but steadily and irresistibly so that her companion should not be able to get in one single word wellbred persons do not leave out their commas and their full stops but they do sometimes talk continuously like a cataract or a westmoreland force at least my dear she said i told your maid that i wanted to see you alone and in your own room she said mrs elstree was out so i came in it is a very pretty little room they tell me you play wonderfully this is where you practise i suppose she put up her glasses and looked round as if to see what impression had been produced on the walls by the music and i hear also that you paint and draw my dear you are the very person for him again she looked round a very pretty room reallywonderful to observe how the taste for decoration and domestic art has spread of late years a doubtful compliment when you consider it well my dear as an old friend of hisat all events a very useful friend of hisi am come to congratulate you to congratulate me yes i thought i would be one of the first i asked him two or three days ago if it was settled and he confessed the truth but begged me not to spread it abroad because there were lawyers and people to see of course his secrets are mine and except my own very intimate friends and one or two who can be perfectly trusted i dont think i have mentioned the thing to a soul i dare say however the news is all over the town by this time wonderful how things get carrieda bird of the airthe flying thistledown i do not understand lady frances my dear you need not pretend because he confessed and i think you are a very lucky girl to catch the cleverest man in all london and he certainly is a lucky man to catch such a pretty girl as you they say that he has got through all his moneymen of genius are always bad men of businessbut your own fortune will set him up againa hundred thousand i am toldmind you have it all settled on yourself no one knows what may happen i could tell you a heartrending story of a girl who trusted her lover with her money but your lawyers will of course look after that i assure you he tells me the lady went on without taking any notice of the interruption that the thing will not come off for some time yet i wouldnt keep it waiting too long if i were you engagements easily get stale like buns well i suppose you have learned all his secrets by this time of course he is madly in love and can keep nothing from you indeed has he told you yet who writes his stories for him eh has he told you that the lady bent forward and lowered her voice and spoke earnestly has he told you i assure you that he has told me nothingand that is in reality what i came about because my dear there must be a little plain speaking oh but let me speaki when i have said what i came to saylady frances motioned with her hand gently but with authoritythen you shall have your turn men are so foolish that they tell their sweethearts everything the chief reason why they fall in love i believe is a burning desire to have somebody to whom they can tell everything i know a man who drove his wife mad by constantly telling her all his difficulties he was always swimming in difficulties well alec is bound to tell you before long even if he has not told you yet which i can hardly believe now my dear child it matters very little to him if all the world knew the truth all the world to be sure credits him with those stories though he has been very careful not to claim them he knows better i say to such a clever man as alec a few stories more or less matter nothing but it matters a great deal to mewhat was this person talking aboutbecause you see if it were to come out that i had been putting together old family scandals and forgotten stories and sending them to the papersthere would bethere would beheaven knows what there would be yes my dearyou can tell alec that you knowi am the person who has written those stories i wrote them every one they are all family storiesevery good old family has got thousands of stories and i have been collecting themsome of my own people some of my husbands and some of other peopleand writing them down changing names and scenes and dates so that they should not be identified except by the few who knew them armorel made no further attempt to stem the tide of communication i have come to make you understand clearly young lady that it is not his secret alone but mine you would do him a little harm perhapsi dont knowby letting it out but you would do me an infinity of harm i write them down you see and i take them to alec and he alters themputs the style rightor says he doesthough i never see any difference in them when they come out in the paper and everybody who knows the story asks how in the name of wonder he got it oh but i do assure you that i know nothing at all of this dont you well never mind now you do know and you know also that you cant talk about it because it is his secret as well as mine why you dont suppose that the man really does all he says he does do you nobody could it isnt in nature everybody who knows anything at all agrees that there must be a ghostperhaps more than one im the story ghost i dare say theres a picture ghost and a poetry ghost hes a wonderful clever man no doubtits the cleverest thing in the world to make other people work for you but dont imagine pray that he can write stories of society bourgeois storiesabout the middle classhis own classperhaps but not stories about us my stories belong to quite another level well my dear that is off my mind remember that this secret would do a great deal of harm to him as well as to me if it were to get about oh you are altogetherwhollywrong my dear i really do not care if i am wrong you will not however damage his reputation by letting out his secrets a wife can help her husband in a thousand ways and especially in keeping up the little deceptions thousands of wives i am told pass their whole lives in the pretence that they and their husbands are gentlefolk alec has been received into a few good houses and though it is of course more difficult to get a woman in than a man i will really do what i can for you with a good face good eyes a good figure and a little addition of style you ought to get on very well by degrees or you might take the town by storm and become a professional beauty thank youbut and theres another thing as an old friend of alecs i feel that i can give advice to you let me advise you earnestly my dear to make all the haste you can to get rid of your companion i know all about it she was sent to your lawyers by alec himself why well it is an old story and i suppose he wanted to place her comfortablyor he had some other reason hes always been a crafty man you can see that in his eyes oh but i cannot listen to this cried armorel nonsense my dear you do not expect your husband to be an angel i suppose only silly middleclass girls who read novels do that it will do you no harm to know that the man is no better than his neighbours and i am sure he is no worse i am speaking in fact for your own good my dear child alec ran after the woman years ago she was rich then and used to go about certain houses do not mind who enter within their gates they lived in palace gardens and monsieur le papa was richoh rich a millionsand the daughter was sugarsweet and as innocent as an angelfluffy hair all tangled and rebelliousyou know the kindand large blue wondering eyes generally lowered until the time came for lifting them in the faces of young men it was deadly my dear i believe she might have married anybody she pleased there was the young earl of silchesterhe wanted her what a fool she was not to take him no she was spoony on alec feilding oh i must not cried armorel again my dear im telling you her papa went smashpoor thinga grand awful impossible smash other peoples money mixed up in it a dozen workhouses were filled with the victims i believe that kind of smash out of which it is impossible to pull yourself anyhow killed himself therefore went out of the world without invitation by means of a coarse vulgar common piece of twopenny rope tied round his great fat neck i remember him what did the girl do ran away from society went on the stage as one of a travelling company why i saw her myself three years ago at leamington i knew her instantly aha i said theres miss fluffy with the appealing wondering eyes poor thing here is a come down in the world now i find her hereyour companiona widowwidow of one jerome elstree deceasedartist i am told i never heard of the gentleman and i confess i have my doubts as to his existence at all armorel ceased to offer any further opposition to the stream the innocent appealing blue eyes the childish face oh i remember my dear i hope you will not have any reason to be jealous of mrs elstree but take care there were other girls too now i come to think about it there was his cousin philippa rosevean everybody knows that he went as far with her as a man can go short of an actual engagement canon langley of st pauls wants to marry her shes an admirable person for an ecclesiastical dignitarys wifebeautiful cold and dignified but as yet she has not accepted him they say he will be a bishop and they say she loves her cousin alec still women are generally dreadful fools about men but i dont know i dont think if i were you i should be jealous of philippa theres another little girl too i have seen coming out of his studio but shes only a model or something if you begin to be jealous about the models there will be no end then there are hundreds of girls about townespecially those who can draw and paint a little or write a silly little songwho think they are greatly endowed with genius and would give their heads to get your chance you are a lucky girl miss armorel rosevean but i would advise you in order to make the most of your good fortune to change your companion quickly persuade her to try the climate of australia else there may be family jars here she stopped she had said what was in her mind whether she came to say this out of the goodness of her heart or whether she intended to make a little mischief between the girl and her lover or whether she supposed armorel to be a young lady who accepts a lover with no illusions as to imaginary perfections so that a new weakness discovered here and there would not lower him in her opinion i cannot say lady frances was generally considered a goodnatured kind of person and certainly she had no illusions about perfection in any man may i speak now asked armorel certainly my dear it was very good of you to hear me patiently and ive said all i wanted to keep my secret and get rid of your companion and ill take you in hand thank you but you would not suffer me to explain that you are entirely mistaken i am not engaged to mr feilding at all but he told me that you were yes but he also tells the world or allows the world to believe that he writes your stories i am not engaged to mr feilding lady frances and what is more i never shall be engaged to that mannever have you quarrelled already we have not quarrelled because before people quarrel they must be on terms of some intimacy we have never been more than acquaintances wellbutchildhe has been seen with you constantly at theatres at concerts in the park in gallerieseverywhere he has been walking with you as if he had the right i could not help that besides i never thought never thought why where were you brought up never thought good gracious what do young ladies go into society for i am not a young lady of society i am afraid wellbutwhat was your companion about to allow ohlady frances nodded her headoh now i understand now one can understand why he got her placed here now one understands her business my dear you have been placed in a very dangerous positionmost dangerous your guardians or lawyers are very much to blame and you really never suspected anything how should i suspect i was always told that mr feilding was not the man to begin that kind of thing were you your companion told you that i suppose oh i suppose so there seems a horrid network of deception all about me lady frances armorel rose and her visitor followed her example you have put a secret into my hands i shall respect it henceforth i desire but one more interview with this man oh he is all liesthrough and through there is no part of him that is true nonsense my dear you take things too seriously we all have our little reservations and some deceptions are necessary when you get to my age you will understand why wont you marry the man he is young his manners are pretty good he is a man of the world he is really clever he is quite sure to get on particularly if his wife help him he means to get on he is the kind of man to get on you see he is clever enough to take the credit of other peoples work to make others work for you is the first rule in the art of getting on oh he will do i shall live to see him made a baronet and in the next generation his son will marry money and go up into the lords that is the way my dear you had better take him you will never get a more promising offer you seem to me rather an unworldly kind of girl you should really take advice of those who know the world i could nevernevermarry mr feilding wealth position society rank considerationthese are the only things in life worth having and you are going to throw them away my dear is there actually nothing between you at all was it all a fib actually nothing at all except that he offered himself to me this very morning and he received an answer which was i hope plain enough ah now i see lady frances laughed now i understand my dear the vanity of the man the creature when he told me that fib thought it was the truth because he had made up his mind to ask you and of course he concluded that no one could say no to him now i understand you need not fall into a rage about it my dear it was only his vanity poor dear alec well hell get another pretty girl i dare say but my dear i doubt whether rising men are scarce you know goodbye child keep that little secret and dont bear malice the vanitythe vanity of the men wonderful wonderful and now cried armorel alonenow there is nothing left everything has been torn from him he can do nothingnothing the cleverest manthe very cleverest man in all london chapter xix what next roland had moved into his new studio before armorel became as she had promised his model in the new picture she began to go there nearly every morning accompanied by effie and faithfully sat for two or three hours while the painting went on it was the picture which he had begun under the old conditions her own figure being substituted for that of the girl which the artist originally designed the studio was one of a nest of such offices crowded together under a great roof and lying on many floors the others were i dare say prettily furnished and decorated with the customary furniture of a studio with pictures sketches screens and pretty things of all kinds this studio was nothing but a great gaunt room with a big window and no furniture in it except an easel a table and two or three chairs there was simply nothing else under the pressure of want and failure the unfortunate artist had long ago parted with all the pretty things with which he had begun his career and the present was no time to replace them i have got the studio he said for the remainder of a lease pretty cheap unfortunately i cannot furnish it yet wait until the tide turns i am full of hope then this arid wall and this great staring sahara of a floor shall blossom with all manner of lovely thingsarmour and weapons bits of carving and tapestry drawings you shall see how jolly it will be next to the studio there were two rooms in one of these his bedroom he had placed the barest necessaries the other was empty and unfurnished so that he had no place to sit in during the evening but his gaunt and ghostly studio however the tide had turned in one respect he was now full of hope there is no better time for conversation than when one is sitting for a portrait or standing for a model the subject has to remain motionless this would be irksome if silence were imposed as well as inaction happily the painter finds that his sitter only exhibits a natural expression when he or she is talking and thinking about something else and which is certainly a providential arrangement the painter alone among mortals if we except the cobbler can talk and work at the same time i do not mean that he can talk about the differential calculus or about the relations of capital and labour or about a hot corner in politics but he can talk of things light pleasant and on the surface i feel myself back in scilly said armorel whenever i come here and think of what you are painting i am in the boat watching the race of the tide through the channel the puffins are swarming on camber rock and swimming in the smooth water outside there is the head of a seal black above the water shining in the sunlighthow he flounders in the current the seagulls are flying and crying overhead the shags stand in rows upon the farthest rocks the seabreeze blows upon my cheek i suppose i have changed so much that when i go back i shall have lost the old feeling but it was joy enough in those days only to sit in the boat and watch it all do you remember roland i remember very well you are not changed a bit armorel you have only grown larger and more beautiful he would have added but refrained you will find that the old joy will return againla joie de vivreonly to breathe and feel and look around but it will be then ten times as joyous if you loved scilly when you were a child and had seen nothing else how much more will you love the place now that you have travelled and seen strange lands and other coasts and the islands of the mediterranean i fear that i shall find the place small the house will have shrunkchildrens houses always shrink i hope that holy farm will not have become mean mean with the verbenatrees the fuchsias the tall pampasgrass and the palms mean with the old ships lanthorn and the gilded figurehead mean armorel with the old orchard behind and the twisted trees with their fringe of grey moss you talk rank blasphemy something dreadful will happen to you perhaps it will be i myself then that will have grown mean enough to think the old house mean but samson is a very little place isnt it one cannot make out samson to be a big place i could no longer live there always we will go there for three or four months every year just for refreshment of the soul and then return here among men and women or travel abroad together effie we could be happy for a time there we could sail and row about the rocks in calm weather and in stormy weather we should watch the waves breaking over the headlands and in the evening i would play the chirping of the lark i am ready to go tomorrow if you will take me with you said effie then they were silent again roland walked backwards and forwards brush and palette in hand looking at his model and at his canvas effie stood beside the picture watching it grow to one who cannot paint the growth of a portrait on the canvas is a kind of magic the bare outline and shape of head and face the colour of the eyes the curve of the neck the lines of the lipsanyone might draw these but to transfer to the canvas the very soul that lies beneath the featuresthat if you please is different oh how does the painter catch the soul of the man and show it in his face one must be oneself an artist of some kind even to appreciate the greatness of the portrait painter when this picture is finished said armorel there will be nothing to keep me in london and we will go then at the very beginning of the season the season is nothing to me my companion mrs elstree who was to have launched me so beautifully into the very best society turns out not to have any friends so that there is no society for me after all perhaps it is as well will mrs elstree go to scilly with you asked roland no said armorel with decision on samson at least one needs no companion again they relapsed into silence for a space conversation in the studio is fitful i have a thing to talk over with you two she said first i thought it would be best to talk about it to you singly but now i think that you should both hear the whole story and so we can all three take counsel as to what is best your head a little moreso roland indicated the movement with his forefinger that will do now pray go on armorel once there was a man she began as if she was telling a story to childrenand indeed there is no better way ever found out of beginning a storya man who was in no sense at all and could never become try as much as he could an artist he was in fact entirely devoid of the artistic faculty he had no ear for music or for poetry no eye for beauty of form or for colour no hand for drawing no brain to conceive he was quite a prosaic person whether he was clever in things that do not require the artistic faculty i do not know i should hardly think he could be clever in anything perhaps he might be good at buying cheap and selling dear wont you take five minutes rest asked the painter hardly listening at all to the beginning which as you see promised very little in the way of amusement there are however many ways by which the storyteller gets a grip of his hearer and a dull beginning is not always the least effective he put down his palette you must be tired he said come and tell me what you think he looked thoughtfully at his picture armorels poor little beginning of a story was slighted you are satisfied so far she asked i will tell you when it is finished is the water quite right we are in shoal close behind us are the broad black rock ledges the water might be even more transparent still it is the dark water racing through the narrow ravine that i think of most it will be a great picture roland now i will take my place again she did so and with your permission i will go on with my story you heard the beginning roland oh yes unfortunate man with no eyes and no ears he replied unsuspecting worse than a oneeyed calender this preposterous person then with neither eye nor ear nor hand nor understanding had the absurd ambition to succeed this you will hardly believe but he did and what is more he had no patience but wanted to succeed all at once i am told that lots of young men nowadays are consumed with that yearning to succeed all at once it seems such a pity when they should be happily dancing and singing and playing at the time when they were not working i think they would succeed so very much better afterwards well this person very soon found that in the lawdid i say he was a barristerhe had no chance of success except after long years then he looked round the fields of art and literature mind he could neither write nor practise any art what was he to do every day the ambition to seem great filled his soul more and more and every day the thing appeared to him more hopeless because you see he had no imagination and therefore could not send his soul to sleep with illusions i wonder he did not go mad perhaps he did for he resolved to pretend first he thought he would pretend to be a painterhere roland who had been listening languidly started and became attentive he could neither paint nor draw remember he began i think by learning the language of art he frequented studios heard the talk and read the books it must have been weary work for him but of course he was no nearer his object than before and then a great chance came to him he found a young artist full of promisea real artistone filled with the whole spirit of art but he was starving he was actually penniless and he had no friends who could help him because he was an australian by birth this young man was not only penniless but in despair he was ready to do anything i suppose when one is actually starving and sees no prospect of success or any hope ambition dies away and even selfrespect may seem a foolish thing roland listened now his picture forgotten what was armorel intending it must be a most dreadful kind of temptation there can be nothing like it in the world that is why we pray for our daily bread oh a terrible temptation i never understood before how great and terrible a temptation it is then the man without eye or hand or brain saw a chance for himself he would profit by his brothers weakness he proposed to buy the work of this painter and to call it his own armorel must you tell this story patience roland in his despair the artist gave way he consented for three years and more he received the wages ofof sin but his food was like ashes in his mouth and his front was stampedyes stampedby the curse of those who sin against their own soul armorel but she went on ruthless the pictures were very good they were exhibited praised and sold and the man grew quickly in reputation but he wasnt satisfied he thought that as it was so easy to be a painter it would be equally easy to become a poet all the arts are allied many painters have been also poets he had never written a single line of poetry i do not know that he had ever read any he found a girl who was struggling working and hoping effie started and turned roseate red he took her poemsbought themand on the pretence of having improved them and so made them his own he published them in his own name they were pretty bright verses and presently people began to look for them and to like them so he got a double reputation but the poor girl remained unknown at first she was so pleased at seeing her verses in printit looked so much like successthat she hardly minded seeing his name at the end but presently he brought out a little volume of them with his name on the titlepage and then a second volumealso with his name the scoundrel cried roland he cribbed his poetry too effie bowed her face ashamed and then the girl grew unhappy for she perceived that she was in a bondage from which there was no escape except by sacrificing the money which he gave her and that was necessary for her brothers sake so she became very unhappy very unhappy echoed effie both painter and poet stood confused and ashamed then this clever manthe cleverest man in londonbegan to go about in society a good deal because he was so great a genius there he met a lady who was full of stories oh said roland is there nothing in him at all nothing at all there is really nothing at all this man persuaded the lady to write down these stories which were all based on old family scandals and episodes unknown or forgotten by the world they form a most charming series of stories i believe they are written in a most sparkling stylefull of wit and life well he did not put his name to them but he allowed the whole world to believe that they were his own good heavens cried roland and still he was not satisfied he found a young dramatist who had written a most charming play he tried to persuade the poor lad that his play was worthless and he offered to take it himself alter itbut there needed no alterationand convert it into a play that could be acted he would give fifty pounds for the play but it was to be his own yes said effie savagely he made that offer but he will not get the play you have heard now what manner of man he was very well i tell you two the story because i want to consult you the other day i arranged a little play of my own that is i invited people to hear the reciting of that drama i invited the pretender himself among the rest but he did not know or guess what the play was going to be and at the same time i invited the painter and the poet the former brought his unfinished picturethe latter brought her latest poem which the pretender was going that very week to bring out in his own name i had set it to music and i sang it i meant that he should learn in this way without being told that everything was discovered i watched his face during the recital of the play and i saw the dismay of the discovery creeping gradually over him as he realised that he had lost his painter his poet and his dramatist there remained nothing more but to discover the author of the storiesand that too i have found out and i think he will lose his storyteller as well he will be deprived of all his borrowed plumes at one blow he saw himself ruined neither of the two made answer for a space then spoke roland dux femina facti a woman hath done this he is ruined unless he can find others to take your places the question i want you to consider iswhat shall be done next roland it is your name and fame that he has stolenyour pictures that he has called his own effie they are your poems that he has published under his name what will you do will you demand your own again think he must exhibit no more pictures of mine said roland he has one in his studio that he has already sold that one must not go to any gallery that is all i have to say he cannot publish any more poems of mine said effie because he hasnt got any and i shall give him no more what about the past are we so proud of the past and of the part we have played in itasked rolandthat we should desire its story published to all the world effie shook her head approvingly as for me he continued i wish never to hear of it again it makes me sick and ashamed even to think of it let it be forgotten i was an unknown artisti had few friendsi had exhibited one picture onlyso that my work was unknowni had painted for him six or seven pictures which are mostly bought by an american as for the resemblance of style that may make a few men talk for a season then it will be forgotten i shall remainhe will have disappeared i am content to take my chance with future work even if at first i may appear to be a mere copyist of mr alec feilding and you effie i agree with mr lee she replied briefly let the past alone i shall write more verses and perhaps better verses then i will go to him and tell him that he need fear nothing we shall hold our tongues but he is not to exhibit the picture that is in his studio i will tell him that you will not actually go to him yourself armorelaloneafter what has passed asked effie why not he can do me no harm he knows that he has been found out and he is tormented by the fear of what we shall do next i bring him relief his reputation is securedthat is to say it will be the reputation of a man who stopped at thirty in the fulness of his first promise and his best powers and did no more work oh cried effie i thought he was so clever i thought that his desire to be thought a poet was only a little infirmity of temper which would pass and after all to think that here the poet looked at the painter and the painter looked at the poetbut neither spoke the thought how could youyou with your pencil how could youyou with your penconsent to the iniquity of so great a fraud chapter xx a recovery and a flight amid all these excitements armorel became aware that somethingsomething of a painful and disagreeable character was going on with her companion they were at this time very little together mrs elstree took her breakfast in bed at luncheon she was just now nearly always out at dinner she sat silent pale and anxious in the evening she lay back in her chair as if she was asleep one night armorel heard her weeping and sobbing in her room she knocked at the door with intent to offer her help if she was ill no no cried mrs elstree you need not come in i have nothing but a headache this thing as well disquieted her she remembered what lady frances had suggestedit is always the suggestion rather than the bare fact which sticks and pricks like a thorn and will not come out or suffer itself to be removed armorel thought nothing of the allegation concerning the stagewhy should not a girl go upon the stage if she wished the suggestion which pricked was that mrs elstree had been sent to her by the man whom she now knew to be fraudulent through and through in order to carry out some underhand and secret design there is nothing more horrid than the suspicion that the people about one are treacherous it reduces one to the condition of primitive man for whom every grassy glade concealed a snake and every bush a wild beast she tried to shake off the suspicion yet a hundred things confirmed it her constant praise of this child of genius his persistence in meeting them wherever they went the attempt to make her find money for his schemes the girl thus irritated began to have uneasy dreams she was as one caught in the meshes she was lured into a garden whence there was no escape she was hunted by a cunning and relentless creature she was in a prison and could not get out always in her dreams zoe stood on one side of her crying oh the great and glorious creatureoh the cleverness of the manoh the wonder and the marvel of him and on the other side stood lady frances saying why dont you take him he is a liar it is true but he is no worse than his neighboursall men are liars you cant get a man made on purpose for you what is your business in life at all but to find a husband why are girls in society at all except to catch husbands and they are scarce i assure you why dont you take the man you will never again have such a chancea rising mana man who can make other people work for hima clever man besides you are as good as engaged to him you have made people talk you have been seen with him everywhere if you are not engaged to him you ought to be it was about a week after the reading of the play when this condition of suspicion and unquiet was brought to an end in a very unexpected manner mr jagenal called at the rooms in the morning about ten oclock mrs elstree was taking breakfast in bed as usual armorel was alone painting my dear young lady said her kindly adviser i would not have disturbed you at this early hour but for a very important matter you are well and happy i trust no you are not well and happy you look pale i have been a little worried lately armorel replied but never mind now are you quite alone here your companion mrs elstree she has not yet left her room we are quite alone very well then the lawyer sat down and began nursing his right knee very well you remember i dare say making a certain communication to me touching a collection of precious stones in your possession you made that communication to me five years ago when first you came from scilly you returned to it again when you arrived at your twentyfirst birthday and i handed over to your own keeping all your portable property of course i remember perfectly well then does your purpose still hold it is still and always my duty to hand over those rubies to their rightful ownerthe heir of robert fletcher as soon as he can be found it is also my duty to warn you again as i have done already that there is no reason at all why you should do so you are the sole heiress of your greatgreatgrandmothers estate she died worth a great sum of money in gold besides treasures in plate works of art lace and jewels cut and uncut the rambling story of an aged woman cannot be received as evidence on the strength of which you should hand over valuable property to persons unknown who do not even claim it and know nothing about it i must hand over those rubies armorel repeated to the person to whom they belong it is a very valuable property if the estimate which was made for me was correcti see no reason to doubt itthose jewels could be sold separately or in small parcels for nearly thirtyfive thousand poundsa fortune larger than all the rest of your property put togetherthirtyfive thousand pounds that has nothing to do with the question has it i have got to restore those jewels you see to their rightful owner as soon as he can be discovered wellbutconsider again what have you got to go upon the story about robert fletcher may or may not be true no one can tell after this lapse of time the things were found by you lying in the old seachest with other thingsall your own who was this robert fletcher where are his heirs if they claim the property and can prove their claim give it up at once if not keep your own the jewels are undoubtedly your own as much as the lace and the silks and the silver cups which were all i take it recovered from wrecks do you disbelieve my greatgreatgrandmothers story then i have neither to believe nor to disbelieve i say it isnt evidence your report of what she said being then in her dotage amounts to just nothing considered as evidence i am perfectly certain that the story is true the leathern thong by which the case hung round the mans neck has been cut by a knife just as granny described it in her story and there is the writing in the case itself nothing will persuade me that the story is anything but true in every particular it may be true i cannot say at the same time the property is your own and you would be perfectly justified in keeping it mr jagenalarmorel turned upon him sharplyyou have found out robert fletchers heir i am certain you have that is the reason why you are here this morning mr jagenal laid upon the table a pocketbook full of papers i will tell you what i have discovered that is why i came here there has been unfortunately a good deal of trouble in discovering this robert fletcher and in identifying one of the robert fletchers we did discover with your man we discovered in fact ten robert fletchers before we came to the man who may reasonably be supposed but you shall see he opened the pocketbook and found a paper of memoranda from which he read his narrative there was one robert fletcher the eleventh whom we unearthed this man promised nothing at first he became a broker in the city in the year in the same year he married a cousin daughter of another broker with whom he entered into partnership he did so well that when he died in the year then aged sixtynine his will was proved under l he left three daughters among whom the estate was divided in equal shares the eldest of the daughters eleanor remained unmarried and died two years ago at the age of seventyseven leaving the whole of her fortunegreatly increased by accumulationsto hospitals and charities i believe she was in early life alienated from her family on account of some real or fancied slight however she died and her papers came into the hands of my friends denham mansfield westbury and co of new square lincolns inn solicitors her second sister frances born in the year married in had one son francis alexander who was born in and married in both frances and her son are now dead but one son remained frederick alexander born in the year the third daughter catharine born in the year married in and emigrated to australia with her husband a man named temple i have no knowledge of this branch of the family then said armorel i suppose the eldest son or grandson of the second sister must have the rubies you are really in a mighty hurry to get rid of your property the next questionit should have come earlierishow do i connect this robert fletcher with your robert fletcher how do we know that robert fletcher the broker was robert fletcher the shipwrecked passenger well eleanor the eldest left a bundle of family papers and letters behind her among them is a packet endorsed from my son robert in india those letters signed robert fletcher are partly dated from burmah whither the writer had gone on business he gives his observations on the manners and customs of the country then little known or visited he says that he is doing very well indeed so well he says presently that thanks to a gift made to him by the king he is able to think about returning home with the means of staying at home and doing no more work for the end of his natural days of course he had those jewels then he writes from calcutta he has returned in safety from burmah and the king whose capricious temper had made him tremble for his life he is putting his affairs in order he has brought his property from burmah in a portable form which he can best realise in london lastly he is going to sail in a few weeks this is in the year according to your story it was somewhere about that date that the wreck took place on the scilly isles and he was washed ashore saved and robbed said armorel as we have no evidence of the fact answered the man of law i prefer to say that the real story ends with the last of the letters it remained however to compare the handwriting of the letters with that of the fragment of writing in your leather case i took the liberty to have a photograph made of that fragment while it was in my possession and i now ask you to compare the handwriting he drew out of his pocketbook a letterone of the good old kind on large paper brown with age and unprovided with any envelopeand the photograph of which he was speaking there he said judge for yourself why cried armorel the writing corresponds exactly it certainly does letter for letter well the conclusion of the whole matter is that i believe the story of the old lady to be correct in the main on the other hand there is nothing in the papers to show the existence in the family of any recollection of so great a loss one would imagine that a man who had droppedor thought he had droppeda bag full of rubies worth thirtyfive thousand pounds into the sea would have told his children about it and bemoaned the loss all his life perhaps however he was so philosophic as to grieve no more after what was hopelessly gone he was still in the years of hope when the misfortune befell him possibly his children knew in general terms that the shipwreck had caused a destruction of property again a man of the city with the instincts of the city would not like it to be known that he had returned to his native country a pauper while it would help him in his business to be considered somewhat of a nabob of this i cannot speak from any knowledge i have or from any discovery that i have made oh cried armorel i cannot tell you what a weight has been lifted from me i have never ceased to long for the restoration of those jewels ever since i found them in the seachest there isas i saidonly one descendant of the second sistera mana man still young you will give me your instructions in writing i am to hand over to this young manthis fortunate young manalready trebly fortunate in another sensethis precious packet of jewels it is still i suppose in the bank it is where you placed it for me when i came of age very well i have brought you an order for its delivery to me will you sign it armorel heaved a great sigh with what relief she said have you got it here mr jagenal gave her the order on the bank for the delivery of sealed packet numbered iii to himself she signed it to think she said that by a simple stroke of the pen i can remove the curse of those illgotten rubies it is like getting rid of all your sins at once it is like christian dropping his bundle i hope the rubies will not carry on this supposed curse of yours oh cried armorel with a profound sigh i feel as if the poor old lady was present listening since i could understand anything i have understood that the possession of those rubies brought disaster upon my people from generation to generation they have been drowned one after the othermy fathermy grandfathermy greatgrandfathermy mothermy brothersallall drowned can you wonder if i rejoice that the things will threaten me no longer this is sheer superstition oh yes i know and yet i cannot choose but to believe it i have heard the story so often and always with the same ending now they are gone not quite gone nearly as good as gone however dismiss this superstitious dread from your mind my dear young lady the rubies are gone there will be no more of us swallowed up in the cruel sea no more of you repeated mr jagenal with the incredulous smile of one who has never had in his family a ghost or a legend or a curse or a doom or a banshee or anything at all distinguished and now you will be happy you dont ask me the name of the fortunate young man no i do not want to know anything more about the horrid things what am i to say to him tell him the truth i shall tell him that you discovered the rubies in an old seachest with other property accumulated during a great many years that a scrap of paper with writing on it gave a clue to the owner and that by means of other investigation he has been discovered that it was next to impossible for your greatgrandfather captain rosevean to have purchased these jewels and that the presumption is that he recovered them from the wreck and laid them in the chest saying nothing and that the chest was never opened until your succession to the property that my dear young lady is all the story that i have to tell and now i will go away with congratulations to donna quixote in getting rid of thirtyfive thousand pounds an hour or two afterwards mrs elstree appeared she glided into the room and threw herself into her chair as if she desired to sleep again she looked harassed and anxious zoe cried armorel you are surely ill what is it can i do nothing for you nothing i only wish it was all over or that i could go to sleep for fifty years and wake up an old womanin an almshouse or somewhereall the troubles over what a beautiful thing it must be to be old and past work with fifteen shillings a week say and nothing to think about all day except to try and forget the black box if it wasnt for the black boxi know i should see them always coming along the road with itit must be the loveliest time wellbutwhat makes you look so ill nothing i am not ill i am never ill i would rather be ill thanwhat i am a tearing rending neuralgia would be a welcome change dont ask me any more questions armorel you look radiant for your part has anything happened to youanything good you are one of those happy girls to whom only good things come do you remember the story i told youabout the rubies yes she turned her face to the fire i remember very well i have at lastcongratulate me zoei have got rid of them you have got rid of them mrs elstree started up where are they then mr jagenal has been here he has found a greatgrandson of robert fletcher who is entitled to have them i have never been so relieved the dreadful things are out of my hands now and in mr jagenals he will give them to this grandson zoe what is the matter mrs elstree rose to her feet and stood facing armorel with eyes in which wild terror was the only passion visible and white cheeks and as armorel was still speaking she staggered reeled and fell forwards in a faint armorel caught her and bore her to the sofa when she presently came to herself again but the fainting fit was followed by hysterical weeping and laughing she knew not what she said she raved about somebody who had bought something armorel paid no heed to what she said she lamented the hour of her birth she had been pursued by evil all her life she lamented the hour when she met a certain man unnamed who had dragged her down to his own level and so on when she had calmed a little armorel persuaded her to lie down it is a womans chief medicine it is better than all the drugs in the museum of the college of physicians mrs elstree pale and trembling tearful and agitated lay down armorel covered her with a warm wrapper and left her a little while afterwards she looked in the patient was quite calm now apparently asleep and breathing gently armorel satisfied with the result of her medicine left her in charge of her maid and went out for an hour she went out in fact to tell effie wilmot the joyful news concerning those abominable rubies when she came back in time for luncheon she was met by her maid who gave her a letter and told her a strange thing mrs elstree had gone away the sick woman who had been raving in hysterics hardly able to support herself to her bed had got up the moment after armorel left the house packed all her boxes hurriedly sent her for a cab and had driven away but she had left this note for armorel it was brief i am obliged to go away unexpectedly in order to avoid explanations and questions and farewells i have thought it best to go away quietly i could not choose but go for certain reasons i must leave you for the same reasons i hope that we may never meet again i ought never to have come here forgive me and forget me i will write to mr jagenal today zoe there was no reason given she had gone nor if one may anticipate has armorel yet discovered the reasons for this sudden flight nor as you will presently discover will armorel ever be able to discover those reasons chapter xxi all lost but mr alec feilding paced the thick carpet of his studio with a restless step and an unquiet mind never before had he faced a more gloomy outlook black clouds storm and rain everywhere bad indeed is it for the honest tradesman when there is no money left and no credit but a man can always begin the world again if he has a trade the devil of it is when a man has no trade at all except that of lying and cheating in the abstract many men it is true combine cheatery and falsehood with their trade few are so unfortunate as to have no trade on which to base their frauds and adulterations everything threatened and all at once nay it seemed as if everything was actually taken from him and all at once not something here which might be repaired and something there a little later on but all at onceeverything nothing at all left even his furniture and his books might be seized he would be stripped of his house his journal his name his credit his positioneven his genius therefore his facethat face which armorel found so woodenwas now full of expression but of the terrorstricken hunted kind that of the man who has been found out and is going to be exposed on the table lay three or four letters they had arrived that morning he took them up and read them one after the other it was line upon line blow upon blow the first was from roland lee i see no object he said in granting you the interview which you propose there is not really anything that requires discussion as to our interests being identical as you sayif they have been so hitherto they will remain so no longer as to the market price of the pictures which you claim to have raised by your judicious management i am satisfied to see my work rise to its own level by its own worth as to your threat that the influence which has been exerted for an artist may be also exerted against himyou will do what you please your last demand for gratitude needs no reply i start again exactly where i was when you found me i am still as poor and as little known the halfdozen pictures which you have sold as your own will not help me in any way your assertion that i am about to reap the harvest of your labours is absurd i begin the world over again the last picturethe one now in your studioyou will be good enough not to exhibitwont i though asked the ownerat the penalty of certain inconveniences which you will learn immediately i have torn up and burned your chequeso much the better for me said the purchaseryou say that you will not let me go without a personal interview if you insist upon one you must have it you will find me here any morning but as you can only want an interview in the hope of renewing the old arrangement i am bound to warn you that it is hopeless and impossible and to beg that you will not trouble yourself to come here at all understand that no earthly consideration will induce me to bear any further share in the deception in which i have been too long a confederate the guilty knowledge of the past should separate us as wide apart as the poles to see you will be to revive a guilty memory since we must meet perhaps from time to time let us meet as a pair of criminals who avoid each others conversation for fear of stirring up the noisome past what has been resolved upon so far as iand anotherare concerned miss armorel rosevean has undertaken to inform your l deception criminals i suppose there is no depth of wickedness into which men may not descend step by step getting daily deeper in the mire of falsehood and crime yet walking always with head erect and meeting the world with the front of rectitude had anyone told mr alec feilding years before what he would do in the future he would have kicked that foul and obscene prophet well he had done these things and deliberately he had posed before the world as painter poet and writer of fiction as time went on and the world accepted his pretensions they became a part of himself nay he even excused himself everybody does the same thing or just the same everybody would do it given the chance it is a world of pretension makebelieve and seeming besides he was no highwayman he bought the things he paid for them they were his property and yetdeception criminals the words astonished and pained him and the base ingratitude of the man he was starving no one would buy his things nobody knew his work when he stepped in then by dexterity in the art of puff which the moderns call reclamehe actually believed this being so ignorant of arthe had forced these pictures into notice he had run up their price until for that picture on the easel he had been offered and had taken l ungrateful deception criminals why the man had actually received a cheque for l for that very picture what more could he want or expect true he had refused to cash the cheque more fool he and now he was going absolutely to withdraw from the partnership and work for himself wellpoor devil he would starve he stood in front of the picture and looked at it mournfully the beautiful thingfar more beautiful than any he had exhibited before it cut him to the heart to thinknot that he had been such a fraud butthat he could have no more from the same source his career was cut short at the outset his ambitions blasted by this unlucky accident yet a year or two and the academy would have made him an associate a few more years and he would have become ra perhaps in the end president and now it was all over no royal academy for him unlessa thing almost desperatehe could find some other roland leesome genius as poor as reckless of himself and it might be yearsyearsbefore he could find such a one meantime what was he to show what was he to say deception criminals confound the fellow the words banged about his head and boxed his ears the second letter was from effiethe girl to whom he had paid such vast sums of money whom he had surrounded with luxurieson whom he had bestowed the precious gift of his personal friendship this girl also wrote without the least sense of gratitude she said in fact writing straight to the point i beg to inform you that i shall not in future be able to continue those contributions to your paper which you have thought fit to publish in two volumes with your own name attached i have submitted my original manuscript of those verses to a friend who has compared them with your published volume and has ascertained that there is not the alteration of a single word so that your pretence of having altered and improved them until they became your own is absurd my brother begs me to add that your statement made before all the people at the reading was false you made no suggestions you offered no advice you said that the play was worthless my brother has made no alterations you offered to give him fifty pounds for the whole rights in the play with the right of bringing it out under your own name this offer he refuses absolutely i sincerely wish i could restore the money you have given me i now understand that it was the price of my silencethe wages of sin e w no more verses from that quarter poets however there are in plenty writers of glib and flowing rhymes to be sure they are as a race consumed by vanity and want to have their absurd names stuck to everything they do very well henceforth he would have anonymous verses and engage a small army of poets the letter moved him little except that it came by the same post as the other it proved taken with the evening of the play concerted action as for comparing the girls manuscript verses with the volume how was she to prove that the manuscript verses were not copied out of the volume then there was a third letter a very angry letter from lady frances his storyteller i learn she said that you have chosen me as the fittest person upon whom to practise your deceptions you assured me that you were engaged to miss armorel rosevean i learn from the young lady herself that this is entirely false you did offer yourself it is true a week after you had assured me of the engagement you were promptly and decidedly refused and you had no reason whatever for believing that you would be accepted i should like you to consider that you owe your introduction into society to me you also owe to me whatever name you have acquired as a storyteller every one of the society stories told in your paper has been communicated to you by me and this is the way in which you repay my kindness to you under the circumstances i think you cannot complain if i request that in future we cease to meet even as acquaintances of course my contributions to your paper will be discontinued and if you venture to state anywhere that they are your own work i will publicly contradict the statement f h he stood irresolute what was to be done for the moment he could think of nothing it is that cursed girl he cried why did she ever come here by what unlucky accident did she meet these tworoland lee and effie why was i such a fool as to ask lady frances to call upon her why did i send zoe to her it is all folly together if it had not been for her we should have been all going on as before i am certain we shouldand going on comfortably i should have made rolands fortune as well as my own nameand his hand was getting stronger and better every day and i should have kept that girl in comfort and made a very pretty little name for myself that way she was improving tooa bright and clever girla real treasure in proper hands and i had the boy as well or should have had good heavens what losses what a splendid possession to have destroyed no man ever before had such a chanceto say nothing of lady frances it was maddening we use the word lightly and for small cause but it really was maddening what will they say what are they going to do what can they say if it comes to a question of affirmation i can swear as well as anyone i suppose if roland pretends that he painted my picturesif effie says she wrote my poemshow will they prove it what can they do but things stick if it is whispered about that there will be no more pictures and no more poemsoh it is the hardest luck one more letter reached him by that mornings post dearest aleci have left armorel and am no longer a companion the gilt could not disguise the pill i have however a communication to make of a more comfortable character than this it is true that i am like a housemaid out of a situation but i think you will change the natural irritation caused by this announcement for a more joyful countenance when you see me i shall arrive with my communication about noon tomorrow be at home and be aloneyour affectionate zoe what had she got to say at the present crisis what could it matter what she had to say if she had only got that money out of armorel or succeeded in making the girl his servant but she could not do the only really useful thing he ever asked of her he laid down the letter on the table beside one from his printersthree days old in this communication the printers pointed out that his account was very large that no satisfactory arrangement had been proposed that they were going to discontinue printing his paper unless something practical was effected and that they hoped to hear from him without delay there was a knock at the door the discreet manservant brought a card with the silence and confidential manner of one who announces a secret emissarysay a hired assassin the visitor was mr jagenal he came in friendly and expansive my dear boy he said with a warm grasp always at workalways at work alec dexterously swept the letters into an open drawer always at work he said but i must be hard pressed when i cannot give you five minutes what is it i will come to the point at once you know mrs elstree very well i believe very well indeedi knew her before her fathers failure before her marriage quite so then what do you make of this he handed over a note which the other man read dear sirunexpected circumstances have made it necessary for me to give up my charge of armorel rosevean at once i have not even been able to wait a single day i have been compelled to leave her without even wishing her farewellvery truly yours zoe elstree it is very odd he said truthfully i know nothing of these circumstances i cannot tell you why she has resigned oh i thought i would ask you well she has actually gone she has vanished she has left the girl quite alone this is all very irregular isnt it not quite what one expects of a lady is it very irregular indeed well i am responsible for her introduction to you and i will find out if i can what it means she is coming here today she writes no doubt to give me her reasons what will miss rosevean do oh she is an independent girl she tells me that she has found a young lady about her own age and they are going to live together alec i dont quite understand why you thought mrs elstree so likely a person for companion philippa tells me that she has no friends and we appointed her because we thought she had so many pleasingattractiveaccomplishedwhat more did you want and as for friends she must have had plenty but it seems she had none nobody has ever called upon her and she never went into any society are you sure that you were not misled about her my dear boy i have heard for instance rumours about her and the provincial stage oh rumours are nothing i dont think i could have been mistaken in her however she has gone i will find out why as for armorel rosevean alecwhat a splendid girl was there no chance there for you are you so critical that even armorel is not good enough for you not my style he said shortly never mind the girl wellthere is one

nearly to as muchvery nearlyha hato nearly as much as that i dare sayho ho he chuckled and wagged his white head very nearly a thousand pounds i dare say he walked over to look at the picture really alec he said you deserve all the luck you get nobody can possibly grudge it to you this picture is charming i dont know when i have seen a sweeter thing you have the finest feeling for rock and seashore and water well my dear boy i am very sorry that you havent as fine a feeling for armorel roseveanthe sweetest girl and the best i believe in the world goodbyegoodbye till the day after tomorrowthe day after tomorrow it will certainly reach to a thousandor very near ho ho lucky dog mr jagenal went away nodding and smiling there are moments when it is very good to be a solicitor they are moments rich in blessing they compensate in some measure for those other moments when the guilty are brought to bay and the thriftless are made to tremble they are the moments when the solicitor announces a windfallthe return of the longlost nabobthe discovery of a willthe favourable decision of the court alec sat down and seized a pen he wrote hurriedly to his printers let the present arrangements he said continue unchanged i shall be in a position in two or three days to make a very considerable payment and after that we will start on a more regular understanding another knock and again the discreet manservant came in on tiptoe lady refused her card he whispered the lady was none other than armorel herselfin morning dress wearing a hat he bowed coldly there was a light in her eyes and a heightened colour on her cheek which hardly looked like a friendly call but that of course one could not expect after our recent interview he said and after the very remarkable string of accusations which fell from your lips i could hardly expect to see you in my studio miss rosevean i came only to communicate a resolution arrived at by my friends mr roland lee and miss effie wilmot from your friends mr roland lee and miss effie wilmot may i offer you a chair thank you no my message is only to tell you this they have resolved to let the past remain unknown to let the past remain unknown he tried to appear careless but the girl watched the sudden light of satisfaction in his eyes and the sudden expression of relief in his face the past remain unknown he repeated yescertainly am imay i askinterested in this decision that you know best mr feilding it seems hardly necessary to try to carry it off with mei know everything butas you please they agree that they have been themselves deeply to blame they cannot acquit themselves certainly it is a pitiful thing for an artist to own that he has sold his name and fame in a moment of despair it would be indeed a pitiful thing if it were ever done nothing more therefore will be said by either of them as to the pictures or poems indeed from what you have already told me from the gracious freedom of your utterances at the national gallery i seem to connect those two names with the charges you then brought they refuse to bring forward or to endorse those charges then do you withdraw them they do not refuse to bring forward the charges they have never made those charges i made them and i mr feildingshe raised her voice a littlei do not withdraw them oh you do not withdraw them may i ask what your word in the matter is worth unsupported by their evidenceeven if their evidence were worth anything you shall hear what my word is worth this pictureshe placed herself before itis painted by mr roland lee perhaps he will not say so oh it is a beautiful pictureit is quite the best he has ever paintedyet it is a true picture you cannot understand either its beauty or its truth you have never been to the place you do not even know where it is why sir it is my birthplace i lived there until i was sixteen years of age the scene like all the scenes in those pictures you call your own was taken in the scilly archipelago he started you do not even know the girl who stands in the foregroundyour own model whyit is my portraitminelook at me sirit is my portrait now you know what my word is worth i have only to stand before this picture and tell the world that this is my portrait he started and changed colour this was unexpected if the girl was to go on talking in this way outside it would be difficult to reply what was he to say if the words were reported to him because you see once pointed out there could be no doubt at all about the portrait a portrait of myself she repeated permit me to observe he said with some assumption of dignity that you will find it very difficult to prove these statementsmost difficultand at the same time highly dangerous because libellous no not dangerous mr feilding would you dare to go into a court of justice and swear that these pictures are yours when did you go to scilly where did you stay under what circumstances did you have me for a model on what island did you find this view he was silent will you dare to paint anythingthe merest sketchto show that this picture is in your own style you cannot anyone he said may bring chargesthe most reckless charges but i think you would hardly dare i will do this then if you dare to exhibit this picture as your own i will most assuredly take all my friends and stand in front of it and tell them when and where it was painted and by whom and show them my own portrait the resolution of this threat quelled him i have no intention he said of exhibiting this picture it is sold to an american and will go to new york immediately next year perhaps i may take up your challenge she laughed scornfully i promised roland she said that you should not show this picture that is settled then you shall not you dare not she left the picture reluctantly it was dreadful to her to think that it must go with his name upon it on a sidetable lay among a pile of books the dainty whiteandgold volume of poems bearing the name of this great genius she took it up and laughed oh she said was there ever greater impudence every line in this volume was written by effie wilmotevery line indeed who says so i say so i have compared the manuscript with the volume there is not the difference of a word if miss effie wilmot for purposes of her own and for base purposes of deception has copied out my verses in her own handwriting probably a wonderful agreement may be found shame cried armorel you see the force of that remark it is a great shame some girls take to lying naturally others acquire proficiency in the art effie i suppose took to it naturally i am sorry for effie i used to think better of her oh he tries even now how can you pretendyouto have written this sweet and dainty verse oh you dare to put your signature to these poems of course said the divine maker with brazen front and calmly dignified speech if these things are said in public or outside the studio i shall be compelled to bring an action for libel i have warned you already before repeating what you have said here you had better make quite sure that you can prove your words ask miss effie wilmot what proofs she has of her assertion if it is hers and not an invention of your own armorel threw down the volume poor effie she said she has been robbed of the firstfruits of her genius how dare you talk of proofs she took up the current number of the journal that is not all she said look here this is one of your stories is it not i read in a paper yesterday that no frenchman ever had so light a touch that there are no modern stories anywhere so artistic in treatment and in construction as your ownyour ownyour very own mr feilding yet they are written for you every one of them they are written by lady frances hollington you are a triple impostor i believe that you really are the very greatest pretenderthe most gigantic pretender in the whole world of course he went on a little abashed by her impetuosity i cannot stop your tongue you may say what you please we shall say nothing more that is what i came to say on behalf of my friends i wished to spare them the pain of further communication with you kind and thoughtful i have one more question to ask you mr feilding pray why did you tell people that i was engaged to you probably he replied unabashed because i wished it to be believed why did you wish it to be believed probably for private reasons it was a vile and horrible falsehood come miss rosevean we will not call each other names otherwise i might ask you what the world calls a girl who encourages a man to dangle after her for weeks till everybody talks about her and then throws him over oh you cannot mean before those flashing eyes his own dropped i mean that this is exactly what you have done he said but without looking up is it possible that a man can be so base what encouragement did i ever give you you surely are not going to deny the thing after all why it has been patent for all the world to see you i have been with you everywhere in all public places what hint did you ever give me that my addresses were disagreeable to you how can one reply to such insinuations asked armorel with flaming face and so you followed me about in order to be able to say that i encouraged you what a man what a man you have taught me to understand now why one man may sometimes take a stick and beat another if i were a man at this moment i would beat you with a stick no other treatment is fit for such a man i to encourage youwhen for a month and more i have known what an impostor and pretender you are you dare to say that i have encouraged youyouthe robber of other mens name and fame well if you come to that i do dare to say as much come miss armorel rosevean i certainly do dare to say as much she turned with a gesture of impatience i have said what i came to say i will go stop a moment said alec feilding is it not rather a bold proceeding for a beautiful girl like you a day or two after you have refused a man to visit him alone at his studio is it altogether the way to let the world distinctly understand that there never has been anything between us and that it is all over i am less afraid of the world than you think my world is my very little circle of friends i am very much afraid of what they think but it is on their account and with their knowledge that i am here alone and unprotected alone it is true i can always protect myself indeed he turned an uglya villanousface towards her we shall see you come here with your charges and your fine phrases we shall see he had been standing all this time before his study table he now stepped quickly to the door the key was in the lock he turned it drew it out and dropped it in his pocket illustration you have had your innings and i am going to have mine now my lovely lady he said grinning you have had your innings and i am going to have mine you have come to this studio in order to have a row with me you have had that row you can use your tongue in a manner that does credit to your early education as for your nonsense about roland lee and effie and lady frances no one is going to believe that stuff you know as for your question i did tell lady frances that you were engaged to me and i told others because of course you wereor ought to have been it was only by some kind of accident that i did not speak before as i intended to speak the next day i anticipated the thing by twelve hours or so what of that well i shall now have to explain that you seem not to know your own mind it will be awkward for younot for me you have thrown me over and all you have got to say in explanation is a long rigmarole of abuse this not my own painting these not my own poems these again not my own stories really miss armorel rosevean you know so very little of the worldyou are so inexperiencedyou are so easily imposed uponthat i am inclined to pity rather than to blame you of course you have tried to do me harm and i ought to be angry with you but i cannot you are much too beautiful to a lovely woman everything even mischief is forgiven will you open the door and let me go all in good time when i please it will do you no harm to be caught alone in my studioalone with me it will look so like returning to the lover whom in a moment of temper you threw over i will take care that it shall bear that interpretation if necessary you have changed your mind sweet armorel have you not you have repented of that cruel decision he advanced a little nearer i really believe that he was still confident in his own power of subjugating the sex feminineheaven knows why some men always retain this confidence armorel looked round the room the window was high too high for her to reach there was no way of escape except through the door then she saw something hanging on the wall within her reach and she took courage he drew still nearer he held out his hands and laughed you are a really lovely girl he said i believe there is not a more beautiful girl in the whole world before you go let us make friends and forgive it is not too late to change your mind i will forget all you have said and all the mischief you have done me my man is very discreet he will say nothing about your visit here unless i give him permission to speak this i will never allow unless i am compelled come armorel once more let me be your loveronce more give me your hands he bowed suppliant he looked in her face with baleful eyes he tried to take her hands armorel sprang from him and darted to the other end of the room the thing she had observed was hanging up among the weapons and armour and tapestry which decorated this wall of the studio it was an axe from foreign parts i think from indian parts with a stout wooden handle and a boss of steel at the upper part armorel seized this lethal weapon it was so heavy that no ordinary girl could have lifted it but her arm strengthened by a thousand days upon the water tugging at the oar wielded it easily open the door she cried open the door this moment her wooer made no reply he shrank back before the girl who handled this heavy axe as lightly as a paperknife but he did not open the door open it i say he only shrank back farther he was cowed before the wrath in her face he did not know what she would do next i think he even forgot that the key was in his pocket the door a dainty piece of furniture was not one of the common machinemade things which the competitive germanor is it the thrifty swedeis so good as to send over to us it was a planned and fitted door the panels painted with reeds and grasses the gift of some admirer of genius armorel raised the axeand looked at him he did not move crash it went through the panel crash again and again the upper part of the door was a gaping wreck of splinters outside the discreet manservant waited in silence and expectation often ladies had held interviews alone with his master but this was the first time that an interview had ended with such a crash will you open the door she asked again the man replied by a curse the locka piece of imitation mediaevalism in ironwas fitted on to the inner part of the door a very pretty ornament armorel raised her axe again and brought the square boss at the top of it down upon the dainty fragile lock breaking it and tearing it from the wood there was no more difficulty in opening the door she did so she threw the hatchet on the carpet and walked away the discreet manservant opening the door for her with unchanged countenance as if the deplorable incident had not happened at all chapter xxii the end of worldly troubles not more than five minutes afterwards mrs elstree arrived upon this scene of wreck the splintered panels the broken lock the axe lying on the floor proclaimed aloud that there had been an incident of some gravitycertainly what we have called a deplorable incident such a thing as a deplorable incident in such a place and with such a man was indeed remarkable mrs elstree gazed upon the wreck with astonishment unfeigned she turned to the tenant of the studio who stood exactly where armorel had left him as the sea when the storm has ceased continues to heave in sullen anger so that majestic spirit still heaved with wrath as yet unappeased in answer to the mute question of her eyes he growled and threw himself into his studychair when she picked up the axe and bore it back to its place he growled when she pointed to the door he growled again she looked at his angry face and she laughed gently the last time we saw her she was pale and hysterical she was now smiling apparently in perfect health of body and ease of mind perhaps she was a very good actressoff the stage perhaps she shook off things easily otherwise one does not always step from a highly nervous and hysterical condition to one of happiness and cheerfulness there appears to have been a little unpleasantness she said softly something apparently an axesomething hard and sharphas been brought into contact with the door it has been awkward for the door there has been i suppose an earthquake he said nothing but drummed the table with his fingersa sign of impatient and enforced listening earthquakes are dangerous things sometimes meanwhile alec if i were you i would have the broken bits taken away she touched the bell on the table fordthis was the name of the discreet manservantwill you kindly take the door which you see is broken off its hinges and send it away to be mended we will manage with the curtain what do you want zoewhen this operation had been effectedwhat is the important news you have to bring me and why have you given up your berth i suppose you think i am able to find you a place just by lifting up my little finger and i hear you have gone without a moments notice just as if you had run away i did run away alec she replied after what hasbeen doneshe caught her breathi was obliged to run away i could no longer stay what has been done then did armorel tell you noshe couldnt she has told me nothing i have hardly seen her at all during the last few days of course i know that you proposed to herbecause you went off with that purpose and that she refused youbecause that was certain and now dont begin scolding and questioning because we have got something much more important to discuss i have given up my charge of armorel and i have come here if you possibly can alec clear up your face a little forget the earthquake and behave with some attempt at politeness i insist she added sharply upon being treated with some pretence at politeness mind i am in no mood to listen to a pack of complaints and squabbles and jealousies whatever mind you are in my dear alec it wants the sweetening you shall have no squabbles or jealousies i will not even ask who brought along the earthquakethough of course it was an angel in the house they are generally the cause of all the earthquakes fortunately for you i am not jealous the important thing about which i want to talk to you is money alecmoney something in her manner seemed to hold out promise a drowning man catches at a straw alec lifted his gloomy face whats the use he said you have failed to get money in the way i suggested i havent got any left at all and we are now at the very end all is over and done zoe the game is ended we must throw up the sponge not just yet dear alec she said softly look here zoehe softened a little i have thought over things i shall have to disappear for a while i believe till things blow over now heres just a gleam of luck jagenal the lawyer has been here today he came to tell me that he has discovered somehow something belonging to me he says it will run up to nearly a thousand pounds it isnt much but it is something now zoe i mean to convert that thousand into cashnotesportable propertyand i shall keep it in my pocket dont think i am going to let the creditors have much of that if the smash has to come off i will then give you half and keep the other half myself meantime the possession of the money may stave off the smash but if it comes we will go awaydifferent ways you knowand own each other no more not exactly my dear alec you may go away if you please but i shall go with you for the future i mean to go the same way as youwith youbeside you oh his face did not betray immoderate joy at this prospect i suppose you have got something else to say if that was all i should ask how you propose to pay for your railway ticket and your hotel bill of course i have got something else to say it must be something substantial then look here zoe this is really no time for fooling everything i tell you has gone and all at once i cant explain crediteverything i have read said zoe taking the most comfortable chair and lying well back in it that the wise man once discovered that everybody must be either a hammer or an anvil i think it was voltaire he resolved on becoming the hammer you alec made the same useful discovery you also became a hammer so far you have done pretty well considering but now there is a sudden check and you are thrown out altogether well that seems to show that your plans were incomplete your ideas were sound but they were not fully developed i dont know you this morning zoe i have never heard you talk like this before you have never known me alec she replied perhaps a little sadly you have never tried to know me welli know all mr roland lee the painter was one anvilyou played upon him very harmoniously effie wilmot was another now alec dontshe knew the premonitory symptomsdont begin to deny either with the d or without because i assure you i know everything you are like the ostrich who buries his head in the sand and thinks himself invisible dont deny things because it is quite useless before we go a step farther i am going to make you understand exactly i know the whole story i have suspected things for a long time and now i have learned the truth i learned it bit by bit through the fortunate accident of living with armorel who has been the real discoverer first i saw the mans work and i saw at once where you got your pictures from and what was the meaning of certain words that had passed from armorel why armorel was the modelyour model and you didnt know it and the coast scenery is her scenerythe scilly isles where you have never been i wont tell you how i pieced things together till i had made a connected story and had no longer any doubt but remember the night of the reading why did armorel hold that reading why did she show the unfinished picture why did she sing that song it was for you alec it was to tell you a great deal more than it told the people it was to let you know that everything was discovered do you deny it now i suppose that infernal girlshe is capable of everything even of earthquakes no alec she has told me nothing theyve got into the habit of talkingshe and effie and the painter manas if i was asleep you see i lie about a good deal by the fireside and i dont want to talk and so i lie with my eyes shut and listen then armorel leaves everything aboutmanuscript poems sketches letterseverything and i read them a companion of course must see that her ward is not getting into mischief it is her duty to read private letters when they talk in the evening effie who worships armorel tells her everything including your magnificent attempt to become a dramatic poet my dear boywrongwrongyou should not get more than one ghost from one family you should not put all your ghosts into one basket when the painter comesarmorel is in love with him and he is in love with her but he has been a naughty boy and has to show true repentance before oh its very pretty and sentimental they play the fiddle and talk about scilly and the old times and effie sighs with sympathy it is really very pretty especially as it all helped me to understand their ghostlinesses and to unravel the whole story fortunately my dear alec you have had to do with a girl who is not of the ordinary society stamp otherwise your story would have been given to the society papers long ago and then even i could have done nothing for you armorel is a girl of quite extinct virtuesforbearing unrevengeful honourable unselfish you my dear alec could never appreciate or understand such a girl the girl isa girl what is there to understand in one girl more than in another nothingnothing o great poet and greater painternothing o man of fine insight and delicate fancy and subtle intellectnothing only a girl i know already that they are not going to say anything more about it they are going to let the whole business be forgotten if anything comes out through you nothing will come out i told you because it is well that we should perfectly understand each other you will never again be able to parade before me in the disguise of genius this is a great pity because you have always enjoyed playing the part never again alec because i have found you out should you ever find me out i shall not be able to walk with you in the disguise of but you must find out first what do you mean oh you must find out first when you do find out you will be able to hold out your arms and cry we are alike at last you have come down to my level we are now in the same depths come to my arms sister in pretence come my bride she spread out her arms with an exaggerated gesture and laughed but not mirthfully what on earth do you mean zoe i never saw you like this before no we change sometimes quite suddenly it is very unaccountable and now i shall never be anything else than what i am nowwhat you have made me what have you done then done nothing to do something is polite for committing a crime could i have done something do you think could i actually commit a crime o alecmy dear aleca crime well the really important thing is that your troubles are over by jove they are only just beginning it is only money that troubles you if it was conscience or the sense of honour i could not help you as it is only moneyhow much actually will put a period to the trouble if i were to use jagenals promised thousand i could really manage with two thousand more oh then my dear alec what do you think of this she drew out of her pocket a new clean white bankbook and handed it to him he opened it heavens zoe what is the meaning of this you can read alec it means what it says four thousand two hundred and twentyfive pounds standing to my credit observe the namemrs alexander feildingmrs alexander feildingwife that is of alec mrs elstree has vanished she has gone to join the limbo of ghosts who never existed her adored jerome is there too what does it mean it means again that i have four thousand two hundred and twentyfive pounds of my own who the day before yesterday had nothing where i got that money from is my own business perhaps armorel relented and has advanced this moneyperhaps some old friends of my fathershe had friends though he was reputed so rich and died so miserablyhave quietly subscribed this amountperhaps my cousins whom you forced me to abandon have found me out and endowed me with this suma late but still acceptable act of generosityperhaps my mothers sister who swore she would never forgive me for going on the stage has given way at last in short my dear alec four thousand pounds where could you raise that money make any conjecture you please i shall not tell you the main point is that the money is heresafely deposited in my name and to my credit it is mine you see my dear alec and it can only be used for your purposes with my consentunder my conditions how on earth he repeated slowly did you get four thousand pounds it is difficult for you to find an answer to that question she replied isnt it especially as i shall not answer it about my conditions now what conditions the possession of this capitali have thought it all outwill enable us first of all to pay off your creditors in full if you mustor at least to satisfy them next it will restore your credit thirdly it will enable you to live while i am laying the foundations of a new and more stable business you i my dear boy i mean in future to be the active working and contriving partner in the firm i have the plans and method worked out already in my head you struck out i must say a line of audacity there is something novel about it but your plan wanted elasticity you kept a ghost well i suppose other people have done this before you kept three or four ghosts each in his own line nobody thought of setting up as the universal genius beforeat least not to my knowledge but then you placed your whole dependence upon your one single family of ghosts once deprived of himwhether your painter your poet your storytellerand where were you lost you are stranded this has happened to you now your paper is to come out as usual and you have got nothing to put into it your patrons will be flocking to your studio and you have got nothing to show you have made a grievous blunder now alec i am going to remedy all this you you shall see what i am capable of doing you shall no longer waste your time and money in going about to great houses your wife shall have her salon which shall be a centre of action far more useful and effective you shall become through her help a far greater leader with a far greater name than you have ever dreamed of and your paper shall be a bigger thing you zoe you to talk like this you thought i was a helpless creature because i never succeeded on the stage and could not even carry out your poor little schemes upon armorels purse i suppose and because i well you shall be undeceived if i could only believe this you will find alec that my stage experiences will not go for nothing why even if i was a poor actress i did learn the whole business of stage management i am going to transfer that business from the stage to the drawingroom which shall be at first this room we shall play our little comedy together you and i she sprang to her feet and began to act as if she was on the stageit will be a duologue your role will still be that of the universal genius mine will be that of the supposed extinct ladythe lady of the saloni shall be at home one evening a weeksay on sunday and it shall be an evening remembered and expected we shall both take art seriously you as the master i as the sympathetic and intelligent worshipper of art we shall attract to our rooms artists of every kind and those who hang about artistic circles our furniture shall show the latest artistic craze foreigners shall come here as to the art centre of londonwe will cultivate the foreign element young people shall come for advice for encouragement for introduction reputations shall be made and marred in this room you shall be the leader and chief of the world of art if there is here and there one who knows that you are a humbug what matters alecshe struck a most effective attituderise to the prospect have a little imagination i see before me the most splendid futureoh the most splendid future all very well but theres the present staring us in the face how and where are we to find thethe successors to lady frances and effie and where to find ghosts leave that to me i know where there are plenty only too glad to be employed they can be had very cheap my dear alec i can assure you oh i have not been so low down in the social levels for nothing you paid a ridiculous price for your ghostsquite ridiculous i will find you ghosts enough never fear where are they when one goes about the country with a travelling company one hears strange things i have heard of paintersgood painterswho once promised to become royal academicians and anything you please but took to waysdownward ways you knowand now sit in publichouses and sell their work for fifteen shillings a picture i will find you such a genius and will make him take pains and produce a picture worthy of his better days and you shall have it for a guinea and a pint of champagne alec feilding gasped the vista before him was too splendid or if you want verses i know of a poet who used to write little dainty pieceslevers de rideau libretti for little operettas and so forth he carries the boards about the streets when he is very hard up i can catch that creature and lock him up without drink till he has written a poem far bettermore manlythan anything that girl of yours could ever produce for halfacrown and he will never ask what becomes of it if you want stories i know a manquite a young fellowwho gets about fifteen shillings a week in his travelling company this fellow is wonderful at stories for ten shillings a column he will reel you out as many as you wantgood stuff mindand the papers have never found him out and he will never ask what has become of them because he is never sober for more than an hour or two at a time in the middle of the day and he will forget his own handiwork alec i declare that i can find you as many ghosts as you like and bettermore popularmore interesting than your old lot if i could only believe he repeated you say that because you have never even begun to believe that a woman can do anything well i do not ask you to believe i say that you shall see i owe to you the idea all the working out shall be my own all the assistance you can give me will be your own big and important presence and your manner of authority yes some men get rich by the labours of others you alec shall become famousperhaps immortalby the geniusthe collected genius of others his imagination was not strong enough to understand the vision that she spread out before him in a wooden way he saw that she intended something big he only half believed it he only half understood it but he did understand that ghosts were to be had theres next weeks paper zoe he said helplessly nothing for it yet we mustnt have a breakdownit would be fatal breakdown of course not even if i write it all myself you dont believe that i can write even i suppose well you shall do as you like he got up and stood over the fire again sighing his relief at all events we have got this money good heavens what a chance and what a day i stood here this morning zoe thinking all was lost then old jagenal comes in and tells me of a thousand poundssaid it would run to nearly a thousand and then you come in with a bankbook of four thousand oh its providential its enough to make a man humble zoe i confesshe took her hands in his stooped and kissed her tenderlyi dont deserve such treatment from you i do not indeed are you sure about those ghosts as for me of course you are right i cant paint a stroke i cant make a rhyme i cant write stories i can do nothingbut live upon those who can do everything

palace gardens i believe he said folding the paper that was the date it was three years ago wasnt it i say zoe wont it be awkward having to explain thingslong interval you knowengagement as companionwrong name i have thought of that but it would be more awkward pretending that we were married today and being found out no there are not halfadozen people who will ever know that i was

a buoyant dancing step with a smiling faceor so she hung a dejected head and crawled sadly by gad its wonderful he cried looking at her with astonishment and indeed who would recognise the quiet

repeated the words with flashing eyes fraudshampretencethese are our servants we command them by them we live and by them we climb what matterso we reach the topby what ladders we have climbed she looked around with a gesture of defiance fine and free the world is all alike she said there is no truth or honour anywhere we are all in the same swim the man dropped into his vacant chair we are saved he cried saved she echoed saved did you ever see a court of justice alec i have once when our company was playing at winchester i went to see the assizes i remember then wondering how it would feel to be a prisoner henceforth i shall understand his sensations there they stand two prisoners side by sidea man and a womana pair of them found out at last and arrested and brought up for trial there sits the judge stern and cold there are the twelve men of the jury grave and cold there are the policemen stonyhearted there are the lawyers laughing and talking there are the people behind all grave and cold no pity in any single facenot a gleam of pityfor the poor prisoners some people go stealing and cheating because they are driven by poverty these people did not they were driven by

you poor unlucky wretchis like mecuriously comically like me they will be found guilty what punishment will they get as for her it was for her husbands sake that she did it but i suppose that will not help her what will they get alec he sat up in the chair and heaved a great sigh of relief what are you talking about my dear i was not listening well we are saved it has been a mighty close shave another day and i must have thrown up the sponge we have a world of work before us but if you are only half or quarter as clever as you think yourself we shall do splendidly he laid his arm round her waist and drew her gently and kissed her again sonow you are sensiblewhat were you talking about prisoners for no more separations now let me kiss away these tears and now zoenowtime presses i am anxious to repair my losses where are we to find these ghosts sit down to work to work chapter xxiii the hour of triumph a man may do a great many things without receiving from the world the least sign of regard or interest he may write the most lovely versesand no one will read them he may design and invent the most beautiful playwhich no one will act he may advocate a measure certain to bring about universal happinessbut no one will so much as read it there is one thing however by which he may awaken a spirit of earnest curiosity and interest concerning himself he may get married everybody will read the announcement of his marriage in the paper everybody will immediately begin to talk about him the bridegrooms present position and future prospects his actual income and the style in which he will live the question whether he has done well for himself or whether he has thrown himself away the brides family her age her beauty her dot if she has got any the question whether she had not a right to expect a better marriageall these points are raised and debated when a man is married also which is even more remarkable whatever a man does shall be forgotten by the world but the story of his marriage shall never be forgotten a man may live down calumny he may hold up his head though he has been the defendant in a disgraceful cause he may survive the scandal of follies and profligacies he may ride triumphant over misfortune but he can never live down his own marriage all those who have married beneath themwhether beneath them in social rank in manners in morals character in spiritual or in mental elevation will bear unwilling and grievous testimony to this great truth when therefore the times announced the marriage of mr alexander feilding together with the fact that the announcement was no less than three years late great amazement fell upon all men and all womenyea and dismay upon all those girls who knew this universal geniusand upon all who knew or remembered the lady daughter of the financial city person who let in everybody to so frightful a tune and then like another treacherous person went away and hanged himself and as many questions were asked at the breakfasttables of london as there were riddles asked at the famous dinnerparty at the town of mansoul to these riddles there were answers but to those none for instance why had alec feilding concealed his marriage where had he hidden his wife and among a very few how could he permit her to go about the country in a provincial troupe to these replies there have never been any answers the lady herself who certainly ought to know sometimes among her intimate friends alludes to the cruelty of relations and the power which ones own people have of making mischief she also speaks of the hard necessity owing to these cruelties of concealing her marriage this throws the glamour and magic of romancethe romance of moneyover the story but there are some who remain unconvinced the bridegroom wrote one letter and only one of explanation it was to mr jagenal the family solicitor to so old a friend he wrote the fullest explanations are due concerning things which may appear strange until the day before yesterday there were still existing certain family reasons which rendered it absolutely necessary for us to conceal our marriage and to act with so much prudence that no one should so much as suspect the fact this will explain to you why we lent ourselves to the little harmlessperfectly harmlesspretence by which my wife appeared in the character of a widow it also explains why she was unwillingwhile under false coloursto go into general society the unexpected disappearance of these family reasons caused her to abandon her charge hurriedly i had not learned the fact when you called yesterday now i hope that we may receive though late the congratulations of our friendsa f this said mr jagenal is an explanation which explains nothing well it is all very irregular and there is something behind and it is no concern of mine most things in the world are irregular the little windfall of which i told him yesterday will be doubly welcome now that he has a wife to spend his money for him and now we understand why he was always dangling after armorelbecause his wife was with herand why he did not fall in love with that most beautiful creature he folded up the note put it with a few words of his own into an envelope and sent it to philippa then he went on with the cases in his hands among these were the materials for many other studies into the workings of the feminine heart and the masculine brain the solicitors tin boxes the doctors notebook the priests memory should furnish full materials for that exhaustive psychological research which science will some day insist upon conducting in the afternoon of the same day was the private view of the grosvenor gallery there was the usual private view crowdso private now that everybody goes there it would have been incomplete without the presence of mr alec feilding now at the very thickest and most crowded time when the rooms were at their fullest and when the talk was at its noisiest he appeared bearing on his arm a young beautiful and beautifully dressed woman he calmly entered the room where half the people were talking of himself and of his marriage concealed for three years with as much coolness as if he had been about in public with his wife all that time he spoke to his friends as if nothing had happened and he introduced them to his wife as if it was by the merest accident that they had not already met nothing could exceed the unconsciousness of his manner unless it was the simple and natural ease of his wife no one could possibly guess that there was or could be the least awkwardness in the situation the thing itself and the manner of carrying it through constituted a coup of the most brilliant kind this public appearance deprived the situation in fact of all its awkwardness no one could ask them at the grosvenor gallery what it meant there were one or two to whom the bridegroom whispered that it was a long and romantic story that there had been a bar to the completion of his happiness by a public avowal that this bara purely private and family matterhad only yesterday been removed nothing was really explained but it was generally felt that the mystery added another to the eccentricities of genius there was a something they seemed to remember dimly about the marriages and lovepassages of shelley coleridge and lord byron mrs feilding clearly was a woman born to be an artists wife herself artistic in her dress her manner and her appearance sympathetic in her caressing voice gracious in her manners and openly proud of a husband so richly endowed alec presented a great many men to her she had it seemed already made acquaintance with their works which she knew by name she betrayed involuntarily by her gracious smile and the interested curious gaze of her large and limpid eyes the genuine admiration which she felt for these works and the very great pleasure with which she made the acquaintance of this very distinguished author if any of them were on the walls she bestowed upon them the flattery of measured and appreciative praise she knew something of the technique alec is not exhibiting this year she said i think he is right he had but one picture and that was in his old style people will think he can do nothing but seacoast rock and spray so he is going to send his one picture awayif you want to see it you must make haste to the studioand he is goingthis is a profound secretto break out in a new linequite a new line but you must not know anything about it a paragraph in a column of personal news published the fact the very next day which shows how difficult it is to keep a secret before mrs feilding left the gallery she had made twenty friends for life and had laid a solid foundation for her sunday evenings in the evening there was a first night no first nights are possible without the appearance of certain people of whom mr alec feilding was one he attended bringing with him his wife some of the men who had been at the private view were also present at the performance but not many because the followers of one art do notas they shouldrally round any other but all the dramatic critics were there and all the regular firstnighters including the wreckerswho go to pit and galleryand the friends of the author and those of the actors between the acts there was a good deal of circulation and talking alec presented a good many more gentlemen to his wife before they went home mrs feilding had made a dozen more friends for life and placed her sunday evenings on a firm and solid basis her social successat least among the menwas assured from this first day chapter xxiv the cup and the lip two days after the private view alec feilding repaired by special invitation to mr jagenals office i have sent for you alec said the solicitor ami de famille in continuance of our conversation of the other dayabout that little windfall you know i am not likely to forget it little windfalls of a thousand pounds do not come too often they do not meantime another very important event has happened i saw the announcement in the paper and i received your note you are the only personbelieve meto whom i have thought it right to explain the circumstances yes the explanation at all events is one that may be given in the same wordsto all the world i have no knowledge of mrs feildings friends or of any obstacles that have been raised to her marriage but i am rather sorry alec that you sent her to me under a false name because these things if they get about are apt to make mischief i assure you that this plan was only adopted in order the more effectually to divert suspicion it was with the greatest reluctance that we consented to enter upon a path of deception i knew however in whose hands i was at any moment i was in readiness to confess the truth to you in the case of a stranger the thing would have been impossible you however i knew would appreciate the motive of our action and sympathise with the necessity mr jagenal laughed gentlybehind the specious words he discernedsomethingthe shapeless spectre which suspicion calls up or creates but he only laughed well alec he said marriage is a perfectly personal matter you are a married man you had reasons of your own for concealing the fact you are now enabled to proclaim the fact that is all anybody need know we condone the little pretence of the widowhood armorel rosevean has lost her companion whether she has also lost her friend i do not know the rest concerns yourself alone very good you are a married man all the more reason that this little windfall should be acceptable it will be extremely acceptable i assure you whether it is money or moneys worth to save trouble i should prefer money you must take it as it comes my dear boy well what is it it is replied mr jagenal solemnly nothing short of the sea giving up its treasures the dead giving up her secrets and the restoration of what was never known to be lost you a maker of conundrums you shall hear before we come to the thing itselfthe treasure the windfall the thing picked up on the beachlet me again recall to you two or three points in your own family history your mothers maiden name was isabel needham she was the daughter of henry needham and frances his wife frances was the daughter of robert fletcher very good i believe that is the case your money came to you from this robert fletcher your maternal greatgrandfather you should therefore remember him i recognise said alec sententiously the respect that should be paid to the memory of every man who makes money for his children very good now this robert fletcher as a young man went out to india in search of fortune he was apparently an adventurous young man not disposed to sit down at the desk after the usual fashion of young men who go out to india we find him in burmah for instancethen a country little known by englishmen while there he managed to attract the notice and the favour of the king who employed him in some capacitytraded with him perhaps and at all events advanced his interestsso that while still a young man he found himself in the possession of a fortune ample enough for his wants which he left to his daughters dont be in a hurry that was quite another fortune oh another fortune what became of the first having enough he resolved to return to his native country but in burmah there were then no banks merchants drafts or cheques he therefore converted his fortune into portable property which he carried about his person no one i take it knowing anything at all about it thus carrying his treasure with him he sailed for england have you heard anything of this nothing at all the beginning of the story however is interesting you will enjoy the end still better the ship in which he sailed met with disaster she was wrecked on the isles of scilly it is saidbut this i do not knowthat the only man saved from the wreck was your greatgrandfather he was saved by one emanuel rosevean greatgreatgrandfather to armorel the girl whose charge your own wife undertook always that cursed girl murmured alec robert fletcher was clinging to a spar when he was picked up and dragged ashore he recovered consciousness after a long illness and then found that the leather case in which all his fortune lay had slipped from his neck and was lost therefore he had to begin the world again he went away therefore he went away mr jagenal paused at this point rattled his keys and looked about him he was not a storyteller by profession but he knew instinctively that every story in order to be dramaticand he wished this to be a very dramatic historyshould be cut up into paragraphs illustrated by dialogue and divided into sections dialogue being impossible he stopped and rattled his keys this meant the end of one chapter and the beginning of another do pray get along cried his client now growing interested and impatient he went away the narrator repeated his treasure lost to begin the world again he came here became a stockbroker made moneyand the rest you know he appears never to have told his daughters of his loss i have been in communication with the solicitors of the late eleanor fletcher your greataunt and i cannot learn from them that she ever spoke of this calamity yet had she known of it she must have remembered it to bring all your fortunea considerable fortunehome in a bag tied round your neck and to lose it in a shipwreck is a disaster which would one thinks be remembered to the third and fourth generations i should think so but you said something about the sea giving up its treasure that we come to next five years ago by the death of a very aged lady her greatgreatgrandmother armorel rosevean succeeded to an inheritance which turned out to be nothing less than the accumulated savings of many generations among other possessions she found in this old ladys room a seachest containing things apparently recovered from wrecks or drowned men or washed ashore by the seaa very curious and interesting collection there were snuffboxes watches chains rings all kinds of things among these treasures she turned out at the bottom of the chest a case of shagreen with a leather thong on opening this armorel found it to contain a quantity of precious stones and a scrap of paper which seemed to show that they had formerly been the property of one robert fletcher we may suppose if we please that the case containing the jewels was cast up on the beach after the storm and tossed into the chest without much knowledge of its contents or their value we may suppose that emanuel rosevean found the case we may suppose what we please because we can prove nothing for my own part i think there is no reasonable doubt that the case actually contained the fortune of robert fletcher the dates of the story seem to correspond the handwriting appears to be his we have letters of his speaking of his intention to return and of his property being in convenient portable shape wellthenthis portable fortune belongs to robert fletchers heirs not so quick how are you going to prove your claim you have nothing to go by but a fragment of writing with part of his name on it you cannot prove that he was shipwrecked and if you could do that you could not prove that these jewels belonged to him if there is no doubt she ought to give them up she is bound in honour i said that in my mind there is no reasonable doubt that is because i have heard a great deal more than could be admitted in evidence but nowlisten again without interrupting when five years ago the young lady placed the management of her affairs in my hands through the vicar of her parish i had every part of her very miscellaneous fortune valued and a part of it sold i had these rubies examined by a merchant in jewels and how much were they worth one with anothersome being large and very valuable indeed and others smallthey were said by my expert to be worth thirtyfive thousand pounds they might under favourable circumstances and if judiciously placed in the market realise much more thirtyfive thousand pounds what he literally opened his mouth how much do you say thirtyfive thousand pounds oh but the stones are not hersthey belongthey belongto usto the descendants of robert fletcher no one would have called that face wooden now it was full of excitementthe excitement of a newly awakened hope does she propose to buy me off with a thousand pounds does she think i am to be bought off at any price the jewels are mineminethat is i have a share in them gentlygentlygently what proof have you got of this story nothing you never heard of it your greatgrandfather never spoke of it nothing would have been heard of it at all but for this old lady from whom armorel inherited the property is hers as much as anything else if she gives up anything it is by her own free and uncompelled will she need give nothing remember that then she offers me a miserable thousand pounds for my sharewhich ought to be at least a third jagenalhe turned purple and the veins stood out on his foreheadthat infernal girl hates me she has done mei cannot tell you how much mischief she persecutes me now she offers to buy me out of my share of thirtyfive thousand poundsa third sharenaya half because my greataunt left no childrenfor a thousand pounds down i did not say so you told me that the windfall would amount to a thousand pounds that was in joke my boy you are perfectly wrong about armorel hating you how can she hate you you are so far wrong in this instance that she has instructed me to give you the whole of this fortuneactually to make you a free gift of the whole propertythe whole mindthirtyfive thousand pounds to me armorel gives memethe whole of this fortune blank astonishment fell upon him he stood staringopenmouthed to me he repeated to you she does not to be sure know to whom she gives it she is only desirous of restoring the jewels which she insists in believing to belong to robert fletchers family therefore as it would be obviously impossible to find out and to divide this fortune among all the descendants of robert fletcher who are scattered about the globe she was resolved to give them to the eldest descendant of the second daughter oh alec turned pale and dropped into a chair broken up to the eldest descendant of the secondthe second daughter then then to you as the only grandson of the second daughterfrances the second daughter was he checked himself he sighed he sat up his eyes always small and too close together grew smaller and closer together the other branch of the family he said slowly has vanishedas you sayit is scattered over the face of the globe i do not know anything about my cousinsif i have any cousins perhaps when you have carried on the search a little further but i am not going to carry it on any further at all why should i we have nothing more to learn i am instructed by armorel to give the rubies to you it is a giftnot a right it is not an inheritance rememberit is a free gift she says these rubies used to belong to robert fletcher i will restore them to someone of his kin you are that someone why should i inquire further oh alec sank back in his chair and closed his eyes as one who recovers from a sharp pang and sighed deeply if you are satisfied then but if other cousins should turn up they will have nothing because nobody is entitled to anything come alec my boy you look a little overcome it is natural pull yourself together and look at the facts you will have thirtyfive thousand poundsperhaps a little more at four per centi think i can put you in the way of getting so much with safetyyou will have fourteen hundred a year you will have that apart from your literary and artistic income it is not a gigantic fortune it is true but let me tell you that it is a very handsome addition indeed to any mans income you will not be able to live in kensington palace gardens where your wife lived as a girl but you can take a good house and see your friends and have anything in reason well that is all i have to say except to congratulate you which i do my aleche seized the fortunate young mans hand and shook it warmlymost heartily i do indeed you deserve your good luckevery bit of the good luck that has befallen you everybody who knows you will rejoice and it comes just at the right momentjust when you have acknowledged your marriage and taken your wife home really said alec now completely recovered i am overwhelmed with this stroke of luck it is the most unexpected thing in the world i could never have dreamed of such a thing to find out on the same day that ones greatgrandfather once made a fortune and lost it and that it has been recovered and that it is all given to meit naturally takes ones breath away at first you would like to gaze upon this fortune from the ruby mines of burmah would you not mr jagenal threw open the door of a safe and took out a parcel in brown paper it is here he opened the parcel and disclosed the shagreen case which we have already seen in the seachest he laid it on the table and unrolled the silk in which the stones were rolled there they arelook common enough dont they one seems to have picked up stones twice as pretty on the seashore here are two or three cut and polishedbits of red glass would look as pretty thirtyfive thousand pounds alec cried laying a hand as if in episcopal benediction upon the treasure is it possible that this little bundle of stones should be worth so much quite possible nowthey are yourswhat will you do with them first i will ask you to put them back in the safe i will send them to your bank if you please nokeep them herei will consult you immediately about their disposition thirtyfive thousand pounds thirtyfiveperhaps we may get more for them what am i to say to this girl perhaps when she learns who has got the rubies she will refuse to let them go i am sure she would never consent nonsenseabout persecution and annoyance armorel hate you why should she hate you the sweetest girl in the world you men of genius are too ready to take offence the things are yours i have given them to you by her instructions i have written you a letter formally conveying the jewels to you here it is and now go home my dear fellow and when you feel like taking a holiday do it with a tranquil mind remembering that youve got fourteen hundred pounds a year given you for nothing at all by this young lady who wasnt obliged to give you a penny why in surrendering these jewels she has surrendered a good half of her whole fortune find me another girl anywhere who would give up half her fortune for a scruple and now go away and tell your wife let her rejoice tell her it is armorels wedding present alec feilding walked home he was worth thirtyfive thousand poundsfourteen hundred pounds a year when one comes to think of it though we call ourselves such a very wealthy country there are comparatively few indeed among us who can boast that they enjoy an income of fourteen hundred pounds a year with no duties responsibilities or cares about their incomeand with nothing to do for it fourteen hundred pounds a year is not great wealth but it will enable a man to keep up a very respectable style of living many people in society have got to live on a great deal less he and his wife were going to live on nothing a year except what they could get by their wits fourteen hundred a year they could still exercise their wits that is to say he should expect his wife now the thinking partner to exercise her wits with zeal but what a happiness for a man to feel that he does not live by his wits alone alas it is a joy that is given to few indeed of us as for his late literary and artistic successes how poor and paltry did they appear to this man who had no touch of the artist nature beside this solid lump of money worth all the artistic or poetic fame that ever was achieved he went home dancing he was at peace with all mankind he found it in his heart to forgive everybody roland lee who had so basely deserted him effie that snake in the grass lady frances the most treacherous of women armorel herself oh heavens what could not be forgiven to the girl who had made him such a gift even the revolt against his authority even the broken panel the shattered lock and the earthquake in this mood he arrived home his wife the thinking partner was hard at work in the interests of the new firm in her hand was a manuscript volume of verse on the table beside her lay an open portfolio of sketches and drawings you see alec she looked up smiling already the ghosts have begun to appear at my call if you ask me where i found them i reply as before that when one travels about with a country company one has opportunities all kinds of queer people may be heard of your ghosts in future my dear boy must be of the tribe which has broken down and given in not of those who are still young and hopeful i have found a man who can drawhere is a portfolio full of his things in black and white they can be reproduced by some photographic process he is in an advanced stage of misery and will never know or ask what becomes of his things he ought to have made his fortune long ago he hasnt because he is always drunk and disreputable it will do you good to illustrate the paper with your own drawings theres a painter i have heard of he drinks every afternoon and all the evening at a certain place where you must go and find him he has long since been turned out of every civilised kind of society and you can get his pictures for anything you like he cant draw much i believe but his colouring is wonderful there is an elderly lady too of whom i have heard she can draw too and shes got no friends and can be got cheap and this book is full of the verses of a poor wretch who was once a rising literary man and now carries a banner at drurylane theatre whenever they want a super as for your stories i have got a brokendown actorhe writes better than he can actto write stories of the boards they will appear anonymously and if people attribute them to you he will not be able to complain oh i know what i am about alec your paper shall double its circulation in a month and shall multiply its circulation by ten in six months and without the least fear of such complications as have happened lately they must lie avoided for the futureproposals as well as earthquakesmy dear alec alec sat down on the table and laughed carelessly zoe he said you are the cleverest woman in the world it was a lucky day for us both when you came here i made a big mistake for three years now ive got some news for yougood news that can only meanmoney it does meanmoney as you say money my dear money that makes the mare to go how much alec more than your four thousand twenty times as much as that little balance in your book oh alec is it possible twenty times as much eighty thousand pounds about that sum he replied exaggerating with the instincts of the city inherited no doubt from robert fletcher perhaps quite that sum if i manage certain sales cleverly is it a legacyor an inheritancehow did you get it it is not exactly a legacy it is a kind of restoration to an unknown person a gift not made to me personally but to me unknown you talk to me in riddles alec i would talk in blank verse if i could it is indeed literally true i have received anestatein portable property worth nearly forty thousand pounds oh then we shall be really rich and not have to pretend quite so much a little pretence alec i like it makes me feel like returning to society too much pretence reminds one of the policeman dont you want to know how i have come into this money i am not curious alec i like everything to be done for me when i was a girl there were carriages and horses and everything that i wantedall readyall done for me you know then i was stripped of all i had nothing to do or to say in the matter it was done for me now you tell me you have got eighty thousand pounds oh heavens it is done for me the ways of fate are so wonderful things are given and things are taken away why should i inquire how things come perhaps this will be taken away in its turn not quite zoe i have got my hand over it you can trust your husband i think to keep what he has got indeed he looked at this moment cunning enough to be trusted with keeping the national debt itself eighty thousand pounds she said let me write it down eighty thousand pounds eight and one two three four oughts she wrote them down and clasped her hands saying oh the beautythe incomparable beautyof the last ought perhaps not quite so much said her husband thinking that the exaggeration was a little too much dont take off one of my oughtsnot my fourth not my napoleon of oughts nono keep your four oughts well my dear if it is only sixty thousand or so there is two thousand a year for us two thousand a year dont alec dont not all at once break it gently we will carry on the paper and perhaps do something or othercarefully you knowin art there is no need to knock things off and if you can make the paper succeed as you think there will be so much the more well we can use it all for my part zoe my dear i dont care how big the income is i am equal to ten thousand of course and you will still pronounce judgments and be a leader now let us talk of what we will dowhere we will liveand all two thousand is pretty big to begin with after three years tight fit but the paper will bring in another two thousand easily ive been looking through the accountsbills and returnsand i am sure it has been villanously managed we will run it up we will have ten thousand a year to spend a vast deal may be done with ten thousand a year we will have a big weekly dinner as well as an at home we will draw all the best people in london to the house we will she enlarged with great freedom on what could be done with this income she displayed all the powers of a rich imagination not even the milkmaid of the fable more largely anticipated the joys of the future and oh alec she cried to be rich again rich only to the limited extent of ten thousand a year is too great happiness when my father was ruined i thought the world was ended well it was ended for me because you made me leave it and disappear the last four years i should like to be clean forgotten and driven out of my mindhorrid years of failing and enduring and waiting and now we are rich again oh we are rich again it is too much happiness the tears rose to her eyes her soft and murmuring voice broke my poor zoe her husband laid his hand on hers i am rejoiced he said as much for your sake as for my own how did you get this wonderful fortune alec through mr jagenal the lawyer its a long story a greatgrandfather of mine was wrecked and lost his property that was eighty years ago now his property was found who do you think found it armorel rosevean and she has restored itto me what she sprang to her feet her face suddenly turning white what armorel yes certainly curious coincidence isnt it the very girl who has done me so much mischief the man was wrecked on the island where her people lived yesyesyes the propertywhat was it what was it quick it was a leather case filled with rubiesrubies worth at least thirtyfive thousand pounds whats the matter rubies her rubies oh armorels rubies nonononot that anythinganything but that armorels rubiesarmorels rubies what is the matter zoe what is it she gasped her eyes were wild her cheek was white she was like one who is seized with some sudden horrible and unintelligible pain or she was like one who has suddenly heard the most dreadful and most terrible news possible what is it zoe her husband asked again you oh you have brought me this newsyou i thought perhaps someonearmorelor some other might find me out but youyou again zoehe tried to be calm but a dreadful doubt seized himwhat does this mean i remember she laughed wildly what i said when i gave you the bankbook if you found me out i said we should be both on the same level you would be able to hold out your arms i said and to cry you have come down to my level come to my heart sister in wickedness that is what i said oh i little thoughtit was a prophecymy words have come true she caught her head with her handit is a stagey gesture she had learned it on the stage yet at this moment of trouble it was simple and natural what the devil do you mean he cried with exasperation they were your rubies all the time and i did not know your rubies if i had only known oh what have i done what have i done tell me quick what you have done he caught her by the arm roughly he actually shook her his own face now was almost as white as hers quicktell metell metell me you wanted money badly she gasped her words came with difficulty you told me so every time i saw you it was to get money that i went to live with armorel i could not get it in that way but i found another way she told me about the rubies i knew where they were kept in the bank in a sealed packet i had seen an inventory of the things in the bank armorel told me the story of the rubies and i never believed iti never thought that there would be any search for the mans heirs i never thought the story was true she told me besides all about her other thingsher miniatures and snuffboxes and watches and rings she showed me all her beautiful lace worth thousands and as for the gold things and the jewels they were all in the bank in separate sealed parcels numbered she showed me the bank receipts opposite each number was written the contents of each and opposite number three was written the case containing the rubies well well hush what did i do let me think i am going mad i believe it was for your sakeall for your sake alec all for your sake that i have ruined you ruined me quick what have you done it was for your sake alecall for your sake oh for your own sake i have lost and ruined you you will drive me mad i think he gasped i wrote a letter one day to the manager of the bank i wrote it in imitation of armorels hand i signed her name at the end so that no one could have told it was a forgery my letter told him to give the sealed packet numbered three to the bearer who was waiting i sent the letter by a commissionaire he returned bringing the packet with him and then oh thenthenalec you will kill meyou will surely kill me when you know you care for nothing in the world but for moneyand ii have stolen away your money it is goneit is gone you stole those rubies but i have seen them they are in jagenals safe what do you mean he cried hoarsely i have sold them i stole them and i sold them allthey were worthhow much did you say fiftysixtyeighty thousand pounds i sold them all alec for four thousand two hundred and twentyfive pounds i sold them to a dutchman in hatton garden you are raving mad you dream i have seen them i have handled them what you have seen were the worthless imitation jewels that i substituted i found out where to get sham rubies made of paste or somethingsome cut and some uncut i bought them and i substituted them in the case then i returned the packet to the bank i had the packet in my possession no more than one morning the man who bought the stones swore they were worth no more he said he should lose money by them he was going away to america immediately and wanted to settle at once otherwise he would not give so much that is what i have done alec oh he stood over her his eyes glaring he roared like a wild beast he raised his hand as if to slay her with a single blow but he could find no words his hand remained raisedhe was speechlesshe was motionlesshe was helpless with blind rage and madness illustration his hand remained raisedhe was speechlesshe was motionlesshe was helpless with blind rage and madness his wife looked up and waited now that she had told her tale she was calm if you are going to kill me she said you had better do it at once i think i do not care about living any longer kill me if you like he dropped his arm he straightened himself and stood upright you are a thief he said hoarsely you are a wretched miserable thief she pointed to the picture on the easel and youmy husband he threw himself into a chair then he got up and paced the room he beat the air with his hands his face was distorted his eyes were wild he abandoned himself to one of those magnificent rages of which we read in history william the conquerorking richardking johnmany mediaeval kings used to fall into these rages they are less common of late but then such provocation as this is rare in any age when at last speech came to him it was at first stuttering and broken speech of the elementary kind speech of primitive man in a rage speech ejaculatory speech interjectional speech of railing and cursing he walkedor rather trampedabout the room he stamped with his foot he banged the table with his fist he roared he threatened he cleared the dictionary of its words of scorn contempt and loathing he hurled all these words at his wife as a tigress bereft of her young so is such a man bereft of his money his wife meantime sat watching silent she waited for the storm to pass as for what he said it was no more than the rolling of thunder she made no answer to his reproaches but for her white face you would have thought she neither heard nor felt nor cared outside the discreet manservant heard every word once when his master threatened violence he thought it might be his duty to interfere as the storm continued he began to feel that this was no place for a manservant who respected himself he remembered the earthquake he had then been called upon to remove from its hinges a door fractured in a row that was a blow he was now compelled to listen while a master unworthy of such a servant brutally swore at his wife he perceived that his personal character and his dignity no longer allowed him to remain with such a person he resigned therefore that very day when the bereaved sufferer could say no morefor there comes a time when even to shriek fails to bring reliefhe threw himself into a chair and began to cry yes he cried like a child he wept and sobbed and lamented the tears ran down his cheeks his voice was choked with sobs the discreet manservant outside blushed with shame that such a thing should happen under his roof the wife looked on without a sign or a word we break down and cry when we have lost the thing which most we loveit may be a wife it may be a child in the case of this young man the thing which most he loved and desired was money it had been granted to himin large and generous measure and lo it was torn from his hands before his fingers had even closed around it oh the pitythe pity of it this fit too passed away half an hour later when he was quite quiet exhausted with his rage his wife laid her hand upon his shoulder alec she said i have always longed for one thing most of all it was the only thing i once thought that made it worth the trouble to live an hour ago it seemed that the thing had been granted to me and i was happy even with this guilt upon my soul i know you for what you are yet i desired your love henceforth this dreadful thing stands between us you can no longer love methat is certain because i have ruined youany more than i can hold you in respect yet we will continue to walk togetherhand in handi will work and you shall enjoy if we do not love each other we can continue in partnership and show to the world faces full of affection at least you cannot reproach me i am a thief it is truemost true and youalec youoh my husbandwhat are you chapter xxv to forget it all when philippa read the announcement in the times she held her breath for a space it was at breakfast her father was reading the news she was looking through that column which interests us all more than any other her eye fell upon her cousins name she read she changed colour she read again her selfcontrol returned she laid down the paper here she said is a very astonishing announcement a very astonishing announcement indeed an hour later she called upon armorel at her rooms you are left quite alone in consequence of thisthis amazing revelation quite not that i mind being alone and effie wilmot is coming nothing in the world said philippa could have astonished me more it is not so much the fact of the marriageindeed my cousins name was mentioned at one time a good deal in connection with hersbut the dreadful duplicity he sent her to youshe came to usas a widow and for three years they have been married is it possible indeed said armorel i know nothing she left me without a cause and now i hear of her marriage that is all my dear the thing reflects upon us it is my cousin who has brought this trouble upon you oh no philippa as if you could be held responsible for his actions and indeed you must not speak of trouble i have had none my companion was never my friend in any sense we had nothing in common we must have parted company very soon she irritated me in many ways especially in her blind praise of the man who now turns out to be her husband i really feel much happier now that she has gone but you have no companionno chaperon i dont want any chaperon i assure you but you cannot go into society alone i never do go into society you know that nobody ever called upon mrs elstreeor mrs feilding as we must now call her there are only two houses in the whole of this great london into which i have found an entranceyours and mr jagenals yes i know now and most disgraceful it is that you should have been so sacrificed that also is my cousins doing he represented his wifeit seems difficult to believe that he has got a wifeas a person belonging to a wide and very desirable circle of friends not a soul called upon her the world cannot continue to know a woman who has disappeared bodily for three long years during which she was reported to have been seen on the stage of a country theatre what has she been doing why has she been in hiding it was culpable negligence in mr jagenal not to make inquiries what it must be called in my cousin others may determine as for you armorel you have been most disgracefully and shamefully treated i suppose i ought to have had a companion who was recognised by society but it seems to matter very little i have made one or two new friends and i have found an old friend it is not too late of course even for this season now my dear armorel i am charged with a mission it is to bring you back with meto get you to stay with us for the season and at least until the summer holidays that is if you would be satisfied with our friends thank you philippa a thousand times i do not think i can accept your kindness however because i feel as if i must go away somewhere i have had a great deal of anxiety and worry it has been wretched to feelas i have been made to feelthat i was in the midst of intrigues and designs the nature of which i hardly understood i must go away out of the atmosphere i will return to london when i have forgotten this time i cannot tell you all that has been going on except that i have discovered one deception after another she is an abominable woman said philippa on the island of samson at least there will be no wives who call themselves widows and no men who call themselvespainters and poets she was going to say but she checked herselfcall themselves she substituted single men when they are already married but surely you will not go away nowjust at the very beginning of the season the season is nothing at all to me oh but armorelthink you ought to belong to society you are wealthy you are a most beautiful girl you are quite young and you have so many gifts and accomplishments my dear cousin you might do so well so very well there is no position to which you could not aspire armorel laughed not in that way she said i have already told you dear philippa that i am not able to think of things in that way always that dream of girlhood dear well then come and show yourself if only to make the men go mad with love and the women with envy stay with us or if you prefer it i will find you a companion who really does belong to the world no no for the present i have had enough of companions i want nothing more than to go home and rest i feel just a little battered my first experience of london has not been you see quite what i expected let me go away and come back when i feel more charitable towards my fellowcreatures you have had a most horrid experience said philippa i trembled for you when i learned who your companion was i was at school with her andwell i do not love her but what could i do mr jagenal said she had been most strongly recommendedi could not interfere it was too late and besides after what had happened years before it would have looked vindictive and then she has been rich and is now poor and perhaps i thought she wanted money and when one has quarrelled it is best to say nothing against your enemy besides i knew nothing definite against her she said she was a widowmy cousin alec said that he had been an old friend of her husband he spoke of having helped him oh he made up quite a long and touching story about his dead friend so you see i refrained and if i could say nothing good i would say nothing bad i am sure that no one can possibly blame you in the matter philippa yet i blame myself for if i had caused a few questions to be asked at first all the lies about the widowhood might have been avoided others would have been invented perhaps wellshe is married and i dont suppose her stay here will have done you any real harm as for her to go masquerading as a widow and to tell a thousand lies daily can hardly do any woman much good have you made up your mind how you will treat her if you should meet she has settled that question she wrote me a letter saying that she has behaved so badly that she wishes never to see me again and if we should meet she begs that it will be as perfect strangers reallyafter all that has been donethat is the very least so we are to meet as strangers i suppose that will be best it would be impossible to ask for explanations poor zoe one does not know all her history she told me once that she had been very unhappy i have heard her crying in her room at night perhaps she is to be more pitied than blamed it is her husband whom i find it difficult to forgive and to forget he is like a nightmare he cannot be put so easily out of my mind unfortunately no i who have thought of him all my life must continue to think of him you will forgive him philippa you must besides you have less to forgive he has never offered his hand and heart to you philippa blushed a rosy red and confusion gathered to her eyes because there had in fact been many occasions when things were said which armorel was sorry that she had said this you mean armorel that he actuallydid thisto you yes it was only the other daythe morning after we read the play he came to the national gallery where i often go in the morning and in one of the rooms he told me how much he loved mewords however go for nothing in such thingsand kindly said that marriage with me would complete his happiness oh he is a villaina villain indeed her voice rose and her cheeks flushed forgive him armorel never considering that it was only a day or two before he was going to announce in the paper the fact that he had been married for three years it does seem pretty bad doesnt it and you armorel fortunately i was able to dismiss him unmistakably oh philippa cried in exasperation my cousin has been guilty of many treacherous and base actions but this is quite the worst thing that i have heard of himworse even than sending you his own wife under a false name and disguised with a lying story on her lips no armorel i will never forgive him never her eyes gleamed and her lips trembled she meant what she said never it is the worst the most wicked thing he has ever donebecause he might have succeeded i suppose he meant to get something by the pretence he wanted i suppose to have it reported that he was going to marry a rich girl i had heard that he was continually seen with you and i had also heard that he had confessed to an engagement which was not to be announced my father has found out that his affairs are in great confusion but what good would an engagement of twentyfour hours do for him indeed i do not understand perhaps after all he had allowed himself to fall in lovebut i do not know men sometimes seem to behave like mad creatures with no reason or rule of selfcontrolas if there was no such thing as consequence and no such thing as the morrow i do not understand anything about him why are his affairs in confusion he had to begin with a fortune of more than twelve thousand pounds from his mother his pictures latterly commanded a good price and his paper is supposed to be doing well to be sure he keeps horses and goes a great deal into society and perhaps his wife has been a source of expense to him but it is no use trying to explain or to find out things meantime to you his conduct has been simply outrageous a man who sends his own wife as companion to a girl and then makes love to her ismy dear there is no other wordhe is a wretch i will never forgive him armorel felt that she would keep her word this pale calm selfcontained philippa could be moved to anger and again she heard her companions soft voice murmuring my dear the woman shows that she loves him still fortunately for me said armorel my heart has remained untouched i was never attracted by him and latterly when i had learned certain things it became impossible for me to regard him with common kindliness and besides his pretence and affectation of love were too transparent to deceive anybody he was like the worst actor you ever saw on any stagewooden unrealincapable of impressing anyone with the idea that he meant what he said i wonder how far zoehis wifeknew of this i would rather not consider the question philippa but indeed one cannot help just at first thinking about it and i am compelled to believe that she was his servant and his agent throughout i believe she was instigated to get money from me if she could and i believe she knew his intentions as regards me and that she consented she must have known and she must have consented she would excuse herself on the ground of being his wife for their husbands some women will do anything perhaps she worships him his genius very likely overshadows and awes her armorel smiled but made no objection to this conjecture some women worship the genius in a man as if it was the man himself some women worship the man quite apart from his genius i used to worship alec long before he was discovered to be a genius at all when i was a schoolgirl alec was my knightmy galahadpuresthearted and bravest of all the knights there was no one in the worldno living man and very few dead menbayard sidney charles the first and two or three more onlywho could stand beside him he was so handsome so brave so great and so good that other men seemed small beside him well my hero passed through cambridge without the least distinction i thought it was because he was too proud to show other men how easily he could beat them then he was called to the bar but he did not immediately show his eloquence and his abilities that was because he wanted an opportunity and then i went out into the world and made the discovery that my hero was in reality quite an ordinary young manrather big and goodlooking perhapswith as we all thought then no very great abilities and he certainly was alwaysand he is stillheavy in conversation but he was still my cousin though he ceased to be my hero he was more than a cousinhe was almost my brother and brothers as you do not know perhaps armorel sometimes do things which require vast quantities of patience and forgiveness i am sure no girls brother ever wanted forgiveness more than my cousin alec her face cold and pale had in fact the sisterly expression philippas enemies always declared that in the composition and making of her the goddess venus who presumably takes a large personal interest in the feminine department had no lot or part at all yet certain wordsthe late companions wordskept ringing in armorels ears my dear the woman loves him still she has never ceased to love him there was nothing to forgive at first she went on on the contrary everything to admire yet his career has been throughout so unexpected as to puzzle and bewilder us consider armorel here was a young man who had never in boyhood or later shown the least love or leaning towards art or the least tinge of poetical feeling or the smallest power as a raconteur or any charm of writingsuddenly becoming a fine paintera really fine paintera respectable poet and an admirable storyteller when he began with the first picture there grew up in my head a very imaginative and certain set of ideas connecting the painters mind with his art i saw a grave mind dwelling gravely and earnestly on the interpretation of nature it seemed impossible that one who should so paint sea and shore should be otherwise than grave and serious impossible said armorel what we had called in our stupidity dulness now became only seriousness he took his art seriously but then he began to write verses and then i found that there was a new mindnot a part of the old mind but a new mind altogether it was a mind with a light vein of fancy and merriment it was affectionate sympathetic and happy and it seemed distinctly a feminine mind i cannot tell you how difficult it was to fit that mind to my cousin alecit was like dressing him up in an illfitting womans ridinghabit and then he began those stories of hisand behold another mind altogetherthis time a worldly mindcynical sarcastic distrustful epigrammatic and heartlessnot at all a pleasant mind so that you see i had four different minds all going about in the same set of bonesthe original alec feilding handsome and commonplace but a man of honour the serious student of art the light and gayhearted poet sparkling in his verses like a glass of champagne and the cynical man of the world who does not believe that there are any men of honour or any good women why how can one man be at the same time four men it is impossible and now we have a fifth development of alec he has becomeat the same timea creature who marries a wife secretlyno one knows why and hides her away for three years and then suddenly produces herno one knows why what does he hide her away for why does she consent to be hidden away then the very day before he has got to produce his wife for all the world to seei am perfectly certain that she herself forced him to take that stephe makes love to a young lady and formally asks her to marry him reconcile if you can all these contradictions they cannot possibly be reconciled we have heard of seven devils entering into one man but never of angels and devils mixed my dear such a man cannot be explained any more than the lady melusina herself do not let us try as for me i am going to forget the existence of mr alec feilding if i can in order to do this the quicker i mean to go home and stay there come and see me on the island of samson philippa but you must not bring your father or he may be disappointed at the loss of his ancestral hall to you i shall not mind showing the little house where your ancestors lived i should like very muchabove all thingsto see the place i will bribe you to come i have got a great silver punchbowlold silver such as you lovefor you you shall have a choice of rings a choice of snuffboxes there is a roll of lace put away in the cupboard that would make you a lovely dress it will be like the receiving of presents which we read of in the old books i will try to come armorel after the season armorel laughed there is the difference between us philippa you belong to the world and i do not oh i will come back again some day and look at it again but it will always be a strange land to me you will leave london after the season i am leaving it before the season come however when you can scilly is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter instead of a carriage you shall have a boat and instead of a coachman you shall have my boy peter we will sail about and visit the islands we will carry our midday dinner with us and in the evening we will play and sing nobody will call upon you there there are no dinnerparties and you need not bring an evening dress the only audience to our music will be my old servants justinian and dorcas his wife and chessun and peter the boy there were no preparations to make there was nothing to prevent armorel from going away immediately she asked effie to go with her she opened the subject in the evening when she and her brother and roland were all sitting together in her drawingroom by the light of the fire alone which she loved they were thoughtful and rather silent conscious of recent events while we were in regent street this afternoon effie said armorel i was thinking of the many happy faces that we met the street seemed filled with happiness i was wondering if it was all real are they all as happy as they seem is there no falsehood in their lives the streets are filled with happy people the theatres are filled with happy faces society shows none but happy faces it ought to be the happiest of worlds have we alone fallen among pretenders and intriguers they are gone from you armorel can you not forget them effie murmured i seem to hear the murmuring voice of my companion always she whispers in her caressing voice oh my dear he is so good and great he is so full of truth and honour will you lend him a thousand pounds he thinks so highly of you a thousand poundstwo thousand pounds if i had it to lay at the feet of so much genius and all the time she is his wife and in my thoughts i am always hearing his voice which i learned to hate laying down a commonplace and in my dreams i awake with a start because he is making love to me while zoe listens at the door you must go away somewhere said roland i shall go hometo my own place effie will you come with me go with you oh to scilly to the land of lyonesse i have arranged it all dear archie shall have these rooms of mine to live in you shall come with me it is two years since you have been out of london your cheeks are pale you want our seabreezes and our upland downs will you come with me effie she held out her hand i will go with you said the girl round the whole world if you order me then that is settled archie you must stay because your future demands it i met mr stephenson yesterday he told me that he is in great hopes about the play and that meantime he will be able to put some work into your hands you are always thinking about me said archie come to us in the summer take your holiday on samson oh effie we will be perfectly happy we will forget london and everything that has happened thank heaven the rubies are gone i will send a piano there we will carry with us loads of books and music we will have a perfectly lovely time with no one but ourselves roland will tell you how we will live you will do nothing for a time while you are drinking in the fresh air and getting strong thenthenyou shall have ideasgreat and glorious ideasand you shall write far far better poetry than any you have attempted yet and meantimewe who have to remain behind asked roland what shall we do when you are gone it takes longer to get to penzance than to edinburgh because the train ceases to run and begins to crawl as soon as it leaves plymouth the best way is to take the nine oclock train and to travel all night then you will probably sleep from reading to bristol from bristol to exeter and from exeter to plymouth after that you will keep awake in this way and by this train armorel and effie travelled to penzance effie fell asleep very soon and remained asleep all night long waking up somewhere between lostwithiel and marazion armorel sat up wakeful the whole night through yet was not tired in the morning partly she was thinking of her stay in london the crowning of her apprenticeship five years long nothing had happened as she had expected nothing in this life ever does she had found the hero of her dreams defeated and fallen a pitiable object but he stood erect again better armed and in better heart his face turned upwards partly another thing filled her heart and made her wakeful roland and archie came with them to the station shall i ever be permitted to visit again the land of lyonesse whispered the former at the window just before the guards whistle gave the signal for the train to start she gave him her hand goodbye roland you will come to scillywhen you pleaseas soon as you can he held her hand i live only in that hope he replied the train began to move he bent and kissed her fingers she leaned forward roland she said i also live only in that hope chapter xxvi not the heir after all the storm expended itself the gale cannot go on blowing the injured man cannot go on raging cursing or weeping alec feilding became calm yet a settled gloom rested like a dark cloud upon his front he had lost somethinga good partof his pristine confidence that enviable quality which so much impresses itself upon otherscalled swaggerhad been knocked out of him indeed he had sustained a blow from which he would never wholly recover such a man could never get over the loss of such a fortune his greatgrandfather so far as could be learned lost his fortune and began again with cheerful heart alec would begin again because he must but with rage and bitterness it was like being struck down by an incurable disease it might be alleviated but it would never be driven out from time to time in spite of the physicians the patient writhes and groans in the agony of this disease so from time to time will this man until the end of time groan and lament over the wicked waste and loss of that superb inheritance of course he disguised from himselfthis is one of the things men always do hide awaythe fact that he himself was part and parcel of the deed he had destroyed himself by his own craft and cunning had he not placed his wife with armorel under instructions to persuade and coax her into advancing money for his own purposes the thing could never have happened henceforth though the pair should have the desire of their hearts though they should march on to wealth and success though the wife should invent and contrive with the cleverness of ten for the good of the firm though the husband should grow more and more in the estimation of the outer world into the position of a master and an authority between the two will lie the memory of fraud and crime to divide them and keep them apart on the day after the revelation a thought came into the mind of the inheritor of the rubies the thing that had happened unto himcould he cause it to happen unto another perhaps one remembers how on learning that the rubies were to be given to the eldest grandson of the second daughter he had dropped limp and pale into a chair one may also remember how on learning that no further investigation would be made he recovered again the fact was you see that mr jagenal had made a little mistake his searchers had altered the order of the three sisters frances alec feildings grandmother was not the second but the third daughter when the rubies were actually waiting and ready for him it would have been foolish to mention that fact especially as no further search was to be made and the elder branch wherever it was would never know anything of the matter at all therefore he then held his tongue now on the other hand the jewels being worthless he thought first of all that it would look extremely scrupulous to inform mr jagenal of the discovery that his grandmother was really the third daughter next if the other branch should be discovered the fortunate heir would like himself be raised to the heavens only to be dashed down again to earth let someone else as well as himself experience the agonies of that fall he chuckled grimly as he considered the torments in store for this fortunate unknown cousin as for danger to his wife he considered rightly that there was none the stones had been consigned to the bank by armorel and in her own name she signed an order for their delivery to mr jagenal he had kept them in his safe they would certainly lie there some time before he found the new heir nay they had been in his custody for five years before he gave them over formally to armorel who could say when the robbery had been effected who would think of asking the bank whether during the short time the parcel was held in the name of armorel it had been taken out clearly the whole blame and responsibility lay with mr jagenal himself he would have a very curious problem to solvenamely how the rubies had been changed in his own safe well alec come to take away your rubies asked mr jagenal cheerily there they are in that safe no he replied sadly i am grieved indeed to say that i have not come for the rubies i shall never come for the rubies why not because they are not for me according to your instructions i have no claim to them no claim i understand that miss rosevean intends to give these jewels to the first representative of the family of robert fletcher that is to say to the eldest grandchild of the first second or third daughter as the case may be that is so very well the eldest daughter left no children you therefore sent for me as the eldestand onlygrandchild of the second daughter i did then i have to tell you that you are wrong my grandmother was the third daughter is it possible quite possible she was the third daughter i was not very accurately acquainted with that part of my genealogy and the other day i could not have told you whether i came from the second or the third daughter i have since ascertained the facts it was the second daughter who went away to australia or new zealand or somewhere i do not know anything at all about my cousins but i think it very unlikely that there are none in existence very unlikely what proof have you that your grandmother was the second daughter i have an old family biblei can show it you if you like in this has been entered the date of the birth the place and date of baptism the names of the sponsors of all three sisters there is also a note on the second sisters marriage and on her emigration i assure you there can be no doubt on the subject at all oh this is very disastrous my dear boy how could my people have made such a mistake alec i feel for youi do indeed it is most disastrous alec echoed with a groan i have been in the unfortunate position of a man who is suddenly put into possession of a great fortune one day and as suddenly deprived of it the next of course as soon as i discovered the real facts it became my duty to acquaint you with them by george cried mr jagenal if you had kept the facts to yourself no one would ever have been any wiser no one because the transfer of the property is a sheer gift made by my client to you without any compulsion at all it is a private transaction of which i should never have spoken to anyone well alec i must not say that you are wrong but many menmost men perhapswith a less keen sense of honour than youwelli say no more yet the loss and disappointment must be a bitter pill for you it is a bitter pill he replied truthfully more bitter than you would suspect you will have the satisfaction of feeling that you have behaved in this matter as a man of the strictest honour i am very glad considering all things that i have not had the rubies in my own possession even for a single hour that is nothing of course they would have been safe in your hands well alec i am sorry for you but you are young you are clever you are succeeding hand over hand pay a little more attention to your daily expenses put down your horses and live for a few years quietly and you will make your own fortuneay a fortune greater far than was contained in this unlucky case of precious stones i suppose you will renew your search now after the descendants of the second daughter i suppose we must do not forget that if there are no descendantsor which is much the same thing if we cannot find them in a reasonable time i shall advise my client to transfer the jewels to the grandson of the third daughter and i hope my dear boyi hope i say that we may never find those descendants alec departed a little cheered by the consolation that he had passed on the disappointment to another he went home and found his wife in the studio apparently waiting for him there were dark rings round her eyes she had been weeping since the storm they had not spoken to each other he sat down at his tableit was perfectly bare of papersno sign of any work at all upon itand waited for her to begin is it not time she asked that this should cease you have reproached me enough i think remember we are on the same level but whatever i have done it was done for your sake whatever you have done was done for your own sake now is there going to be an end to this situation illustration is it not time she asked that this should cease he made a gesture of impatience understand clearlyif i am to help you for the future if i am going to pull you through this crisis if i am to direct and invent and combine for you i mean to be treated with the semblance of kindnessthe show of politeness at least he sat up moved by this appeal which indeed was to his pursethat is to his heart i say my husband she repeated you must understand me clearly again what i have done was done for youfor you unless you agree to my conditions it shall have been donefor myself i have four thousand pounds in the bank in my own name you cannot touch it i shall go away and live upon that moneyapart from you and you shall have nothingnothingunless unless what he shook off his wrath with a mighty effort as a sulky boy shakes off his sulks when he perceives that he must and that instantly he threw off his wrath and sat up with a wan semblance of a smile a spectral smile feebly painted on his lips unless what zoe my dear child can you not make allowance for a man tried in this terrible fashion i dont believe that any man was ever so mocked by fortune i have been crushed yes any terms any condition you please let us forget the past come dear let us forget what has happened he sprang to his feet and held out his arms she hesitated a moment there is no other place for me now she murmured we are on the same level i am all yoursnow then she drew herself away and turned again to the table come alecshe said to business time presses sit down and give me all your attention chapter xxvii the desert island the train proceeded slowly along the head of mounts bay the waters of the high tide washing up almost to the sleepers on the line armorel let down the window and looked out across the bay where the great vision of the guarded mount looks towards namancos and bayonas hold see effie she cried there is mounts bay there is the lizard there is penzance and thereoh there is the mount itself st michaels mount always weird and mysterious rose out of the waters wrapped in a thin white cloud which the early sun had not yet been able to dissipate i am told there is a very fine modern house upon the mount i prefer not to believe that story the place should always remain lonely awful full of mystery and wonder there is also said to be a battery with guns upon it perhaps but there are much more wonderful things than these to tell of the rock upon its highest point those gallant minerscaptain caractac and captain caerleon both of boadicea whealwere wont to stand gazing out upon the stretch of waters expecting the white sails and flashing oars of the phoenician fleet come to buy their white and precious tin with strong wines from syria and spices from the far east and purple robes and bronze swords and spearheads far better than those made by flint jack of the ordnance department hither came whiterobed priests with flowing beards and solemn facesfaces supernaturally solemn till they were alone upon the rock then perhaps an eyelid trembled what they did i know not nor did the people but it was something truly awful with majestic rites and ineffable mysteries and mumbojumbo of the very noblest here st michael himself once in the ages of faith condescended to appear it was to a hermit such appearances were the prizes of the profession many went ahermiting in hopes of getting a personal call from a saint who would otherwise have fought and lived and died quite like the rest of the world and indeed there were so many cornish saintssuch as st buryan st levan st ives st just st keverne st anthony not to speak of st erth st gulval st austell st wennall kindly disposed saints anxious to encourage hermits and pleased to extend their own sphere of usefulness that few of these holy men were disappointed in the bay the blue water danced lightly in the morning breeze the low level sunlight shone upon penzance on the western side the fishingboats back from the nights cruise lay at their moorings their brown sails lowered the merchantmen and trading craft were crowded in the port beyond the white curves chased each other across the water and showed that outside the breeze was fresh and the water lively we are almost at home said armorel there is our steamer lying off the quayshe looks very little doesnt she only a short voyage of forty milesoh effie i do hope you are a good sailorand we shall be at hugh town are we really arrived i believe i have slept the whole night through said effie sitting up and pulling herself straight oh how lovelyas she too looked out of window have you slept well armorel i dont think i have been asleep much but i am quite happy effie dearquite as happy as if i had been sound asleep all night there are dreams you know which come to people in the night when they are awake as well as when they are asleep i have been dreaming all night longone dream which lasted all the nightone voice in my earsone hand in mine oh effie i have been quite happy she showed her happiness by kissing her companion i am happier than i ever thought to be some day perhaps i shall be able to tell you why and then the train rolled in to penzance station it was only halfpast seven in the morning the steamer would not start till halfpast ten the girls sent their luggage on board and then went to one of the hotels which stand all in a row facing the esplanade here they repaired the ravages of the night which makes even a beautiful girl like armorel show like beauty neglected and then they took breakfast and in due time went on board now behold they had left in london a pitiless noreaster and a black sky they found at penzance a clear blue overhead light and sunshine and a glorious northwesterly breeze that is not certainly the quarter whose winds allay the angry waves and soothe the heaving surge not at all it is when the wind is from the northwest that the waves rise highest and heaviest then the boat bound to scilly tosses and rolls like a round cork yet persistently forces her way westward diving ploughing climbing slipping sliding and rolling shipping great seas and shaking them off again always getting ahead somehow then those who come forth at the start with elastic step and lofty looks lie low and wish that some friend would prod father time with a bradawl and make him run and those who enjoy the sea sir and are never sick are fain to put down the pipe with which they proudly started and sink into nothingness for taking the conceit out of a young man there is nothing better than the voyage from penzance to scilly especially if it be a trippers voyagethat is back again the same day there is on the scilly boat a cabin or rather a roofed and walled apartment within which is the companion to the saloon nobody ever goes into the saloon though it is magnificent with red velvet but round this roofed space there is a divan or sofa and here lie the weak and fearful and all those who give in and oppose no further resistance to the soft influences of ocean effie lay here white of cheek and motionless she had never been on the sea before and she had a rough and tumbling day to begin with and the sea in glory and grandeurbut all was lost and thrown away so far as she was concerned armorel stood outside holding to the ropes with both hands she was dressed in a waterproof the spray flew over her her cheek was wet with it her eyes were bright with it the heavy seas dashed over her she laughed and shook her waterproof as for wet boots what scillonian regardeth them and the windhow it blew through and through her how friendly was its rough welcome how splendid to be once more on rough water the boat fighting against a head wind and rolling waves how glorious to look out once more upon the wild ungoverned waves it was not until the boat had rounded the point and was well out in the open that these things became really enjoyable away south stood the wolf with its tall lighthouse you could see the white waves boiling and fighting around it and climbing halfway up beyond the wolf a great ocean steamer plunged through the water outward bound presently there came flying past them the most beautiful thing ever invented by the wit of man or made by his craft a threemasted schooner under full sailall sails spreadnot forging slowly along under povertystricken stays which proclaim an insufficient crew but flying over the water under all her canvas she was a french boat of havre there is scilly miss said the steward pointing out to sea yes low down the land lay west by north it looked like a cloud at first every moment it grew clearer but always low down what one sees at first are the eastern shores of st agnes and gugh st marys and the eastern islands they are all massed together so that the eye cannot distinguish one from the other but all seem to form continuous land by degrees they separated then one could discover the south channel and the north channel when the tide is high and the weather fair the boat takes the former at low tide the latter today the captain chose the south channel and now they were so near the land that armorel could make out porthellick bay and her heart beat though she was going home to no kith or kin and to nothing but her familia her serving folk next she made out giants castle then the old town then peninnis head black and threatening and now they were so near that every carn and every boulder upon it could be made out clearly and one could see the water rising and falling at the foot of the rock and hear it roaring as it was driven into the dark caves and the narrow places where the rocks opened out and made makebelieve of a port or haven of refuge and now porthcressa bay and now the garrison and smooth water then armorel brought out effie pale and languid now dear the voyage is over we are in smooth water and shall be in port in ten minutes look roundit is all over we are in the road and over thereseewith his twin hillsis my dear old samson there was a little crowd on the quay waiting to see the boat arrive all of themboatmen fishermen and flowerfarmers men to say nothing of those representing the interests of commercepressed forward to welcome armorel everybody remembered her but now she was a grand young lady who had left them a simple child they shook hands with her and stepped aside and then peter came forward looking no older but certainly no younger and armorel shook hands with him too he had the boat alongside and in five minutes more the luggage was on board the mast was up the sail set and armorel was sitting in her old place the strings in her hand while peter held the rope and looked out ahead shading his eyes with his right hand in the old familiar style it is as if i never left home at all said armorel i sailed like this with peter yesterdayand the day before youve growed said peter after an inquiring gaze being for the moment satisfied that there was nothing ahead and that there was no immediate danger of shipwreck on the nut rock or green island i am five years older armorel replied its been a rare harvest this year he went on i thought we should never come to the end of the daffodils now i am at home indeed said armorel when i hear the old old talk about the flowers tomorrow effie i will show you our little fields where we grow all the lovely flowersthe anemone and jonquilthe narcissus and the daffodil this afternoon when we have had dinner and rested a little i will take you all round samson and show you the glories of the place they are principally views of other islands but there is a headland and two bays and there are the tombs of the kingsthe ancient kings of lyonessein one of them roland leeshe blushed and turned away her headhenceforth she understood this was a name to be treated with more reverencefound a golden torque which you have seen me wear and oh my dearyou shall be so happy the seabreeze shall fill your soul with music the seabirds shall sing to you the very waves shall lap on the shore in rhyme and rhythm for you and the sun of scilly which is so warm and glowing but never too warm shall colour that pale cheek of yours and fill out that spare form and oh effie i hope you will not get tired of samson and of me we are two maidens living on a desert island there is nobody to talk to except each other we shall wander about together as we list oh i am so happy effieand oh my dear i am so hungry the boat ran up over the white sand of the beach they jumped out and armorel leaving peter to bring along the trunks by the assistance of the donkey led the way over the southern hill to holy farm effie she said i have been tormented this morning with the fear that everything would look small i was afraid that my old memoriesa childs memorieswould seem distorted and exaggerated now i am not in the least afraid samson has got all his acres still he looks quite as big and quite as homely as ever he didthe boulders are as huge the rocks are as steep i remember every boulder effie and every bush and every patch of brown fern and almost every trailing branch of bramble how glorious it is here how the seabreeze sweeps across the hillit comes all the way from americaacross the atlantic effie i declare you are looking rosier already i must singi must indeedi always used to sing she threw up her arms in the old gesture and sang a loud and clear and joyous burst of songsang like the lark springing from the ground because it cannot choose but sing i used to jump too but i do not want somehow to jump any more ah effie i was quite certain there would be some fallingoff but i could not tell in what direction i can no longer jump that comes of getting old to be sure i did not jump when i took roland lee about the islands sometimes i sang but i was ashamed to jump here we are upon the top it is not a mighty alp is itbut it serves look roundbut only for a moment because chessun will have dinner waiting for us and you are exhausted by your bad passageyou poor thing this is our way down the narrow lanes here our fields begin they are each about as big as a dinnertable see the tall hedges to keep off the north wind there is a field of narcissus but there are no more flowers and the leaves are dying away this way ah here we are the house did not look in the least mean or any smaller than armorel expected she became even prouder of it where else could one find a row of palms with great verbenatrees and prickly pear and aloes not to speak of the creepers over the porch the gilt figurehead and the big ships lantern hung in the porch within the sunlight poured into the low roomsall of them looking southand made them bright in the room where formerly the ancient lady passed her time in the hooded chairthe lady passed away and the chair gonethe cloth was spread for dinner and in the porch were gathered the servingfolkjustinian not a day older dorcas unchanged and chessun thin and worn almost as old to look at as her mother and as soon as the greetings were over and the questions asked and answered and the news told of the harvest and the prices and the girls had run all over the house chessun brought in the dinner it is a blessed thing that we must eat because upon this necessity we have woven so many pretty customs we eat a welcome home we eat a godspeed we eat together because we love each other we eat to celebrate anything and everything above all upon such an event as the return of one who has long been parted from us we make a little banquet thought and pains had been bestowed upon the dinner which chessun placed upon the table dorcas stood by the table watching the effect of her cares first there was a chicken roasted with bread crumbsa bird blessed with a delicacy of flavour and a tenderness of flesh and a willingness to separate at the joints unknown beyond the shores of scilly dorcas said so and the girls believed iteffie at least willing to believe that nothing in the world was so good as in this happy realm of queen armorel dorcas also invited special attention to the homecured ham which was she justly remarked mild as a peach the potatoes served in their skins were miracles of mealinesshad armorel met with such potatoes out of samson had the young lady her visitor ever seen or dreamed of such potatoes there was spinach grown on the farm freshly cut redolent of the earth fragrant with the seabreeze and there was homemade bread sweet wholesome and firm there was also placed upon the table a brown george filled with homebrewed furnished with a head snowwhite venerable and benevolent such a head as not all the breweries of burtonor even of the whole house of lords combinedcould furnish alas that head smiled in vain upon this degenerate pair they would not drink the nutbrown sparkling beer it was not wasted however peter had it when he brought the packass to the porch laden with the last trunk nor did they so much as remove the stopper from the decanter containing a bottle of the famous blackberry wine the primest cru of samson opened expressly for this dinner yet this was not wasted either for justinian who knew a glass of good wine took it with three successive suppers is it beneath the dignity of history to mention pudding consider pudding is festive pudding contributes largely to the happiness of youth armorel and effie tackled the pudding as only the young and hungry can and this day perhaps from the promptings of simple piety being rejoiced that armorel was back again perhaps from some undeveloped touch of poetry in her nature chessun placed upon the table that delicacy seldom seen at the tables of the unfortunate greatwho really get so few of the good thingsknown as grateful pudding you know the ingredients of this delightful dish more to mark the day chessun actually made it with cream instead of milk tomorrow said armorel fired with emulation i will show you effie what i can do in the way of puddings and cakes i always used to make them and unless my lightness of hand has left me i think you will admire my teacakes if not my puddings roland lee praised them both but to be sure he was so easily pleased he liked everything on the island he even likedoh effiehe liked me that was truly wonderful armorel now effie dear lie down in this chair beside the window you can look straight out to seathat is bishops rock with its lighthouse lie down and rest and i will talk to you about scilly and samson and my own people or i will play to you if you like i am glad the new piano has arrived safely i like to look round this beautiful old room how strange it is i have never seen such a roomwith things so odd they are all things from foreign lands and things cast up by the sea if you like odd things i will show you presently my punchbowls and the snuffboxes and watches and things i did not give all of them to the care of mr jagenal five years ago it is wonderful it is lovely as if one could ever tire of such a place lie down dear and rest you have had such a tossing about that you must rest after it or you may be ill it promises to be a fine and clear evening if it is we will go out byandby and see the sun set behind the western rocks we are on a desert island effie murmured obediently lying down and closing her eyes nobody here but ourselves we can do exactly what we please think of it armorel nobody wants any money here nobody jostles his neighbour nobody tramples upon his friend it is like a dream of the primitive life with improvements dear effie my ancestors used to lead the primitive life when samson was a holy island and the cemetery of the kings of lyonesse they went about barefooted and they were dressed in skins they fought the wolves and bears and if they did not kill the creatures why the creatures killed them they were always fighting the nearest tribe and they sucked the marrowbones effie think of that oh we have made a wonderful advance in the civilisation of samson island chapter xxviii at home i am so very pleased to see you here mr stephenson mrs feilding welcomed him with her sweetest and most gracious smile to attract our few really sincere criticsthere are so many incompetent pretendersas well as the leaders in all the arts is my great ambition and now you have come you are very kind said dick blushing i dare say he is a really great critic at the hours when he is not a most superior clerk in the admiralty at the same time one is not often told the whole the naked the gratifying truth to have a salon that is my desire to fill it with men of light and leading now you have broken the ice you will come often will you not every sunday evening at least my husband will be most pleased to find you here again you are very kind we saw you yesterday afternoon at that poor boys matinee did we not the crush was too great for us to exchange a word with you what do you think of the piece i always liked it i was present you know at the reading that night oh yes the readingarmorel roseveans reading yes though that hardly gave one an idea of the play the piece went very well indeed i should think it will catch on but of course the public are very capricious one never knows whether they will take to a thing or not to my mind there is every prospect of success in any case young wilmot has shown that he possesses poetical and dramatic powers of a very high order indeed he seems the most promising of the men before us at present that is if he keeps up to the standard of this first effort yees of course we must discount some of the promise you have heard for instance that my husband lent his advice and assistance he said so after the reading did he not nobody knows mr stephenson she clasped her hands and turned those eyes of limpid blue upon the young man how many successes my husband has helped to make by his timely assistance what he did to this particular play i do not know of course during the reading and during yesterdays performance i seemed to hear his voice through all the acts it haunted me but alec said nothing he sat in silence smiling as if he had never heard the words before oh it is wonderful and nownot a word of recognition you help people to climb up and then they pretendthey pretendto have got up by their own exertions not that alec expects gratitude or troubles himself much about these things but naturally i feel hurt and oh mr stephenson what must be the conscience of the manhow can he bear to livewho goes about the world pretendingpretending she shook her head sadly pretending to have written other mens works men will do anything i suppose this kind of assistance ought however to be recognised i will make some allusion to it in my notice of the play meantime if i can read the future at all master archie wilmots fortune is made and he will mr roland lee showed his picture that night he had just come out of a madhouse had he not not quite that he failed and dropped out but what he did with himself or how he lived for three years i do not exactly know he has returned and never alludes to that time and he exactly imitates my husband i am told no nonot exactly the resemblance is close only an experienced criticoh dick stephensoncould discern the real differences of treatment mrs feilding smiled but i knew him before he disappeared and i assure you his method was then the same as it is now very much like your husbands style yet with a difference i am glad there is a difference an artist ought at least to have a style of his own you know i suppose that armorel has gone away i have heard so it became possible for us at last to acknowledge things so i joined my husband armorel went hometo her own home in the scilly islands she took effie wilmot with her indeed the girls flatteries have become necessary to her i fear she was unhappy poor child i sometimes think mr stephenson that she saw too much of alec of course he was a good deal with us and i could not tell her the whole truth andandgirls heads are easily turned you know when genius seems to be attracted poor armorel she sighed playing with her fan time i dare say will help her to forget it is a pity said dick stephenson changing the subject because he did not quite believe this version it is a pity that mr feilding who can give such admirable advice to a young dramatist does not write a play himself hush she looked all round nobody is listening alec has written a play mr stephenson it is a threeact dramaa tragedystrongoh so strongso strong she clasped her hands again letting the fan dangle from her wrist so effective i dont know when i have seen a play with more striking situations it is accepted but not a word has yet been said about it may i say something about it will you let me be the first to announce it and to give some little account of it i will ask alec if he consents i will tell you more about the play and my dear mr stephenson you one of our old friends really ought to do some work for the paper i have not been asked he replied colouring for he was still at that stage when the dramatic critic is flattered by being invited to write for a paper you shall be how do you like the paper it has so completely changed its character one would think that the whole staff had been changed everybody reads it now and everybody takes it i believe the circulation has gone up by leaps and bounds it is really wonderful but mr stephenson here is one of the reasons give me a little creditpoor me i cannot write but i can look on and i have a pair of eyes and i can see things now i saw that alec was killing himself with writing every week a story also every week a poem every week an original article and then those notes i made him stop i said to him stamp your own individuality on every line of the paper but write it yourself no longer edit it you see it is not as if alec had to prove his powers he has proved them already so he can afford to let others do the hard work while he adds the magic touchthe touch of geniusthat touch that goes to the heart and the result you see yes the brightestcleverestmost varied paper that exists with a large staff formerly alec and one or two others formed the whole staff well mr stephenson i know that alec is going to ask you to do some of the dramatic criticism and if you consent i shall be very pleased to have been the first to mention it it will be understood from this conversation that the new methods of managing the business of the firm were essentially different from the old the paper had taken a new departure it prospered it was understood that the editor put less of his own work into it but the articles verses and stories were all unsigned and no one could tell exactly which were his papers therefore as all were clever his reputation remained on the same level also there was a thick and solid mass of advertisements each week which represented public confidence widespread and deep give me cries the proprietor of a paper the confidence of advertisers that is proof enough of popularity mrs feilding moved to another part of the room and began to talk with another man my husband she said has prepared a little surprise for us this evening i say for us because i have not seen what he has to showsince it came back from the framemaker it is a picture then a picture in a new style he has abandoned for a time his coast and seashore studies this is in quite a new style i thinki hopethat it will be liked as well as his old he is indeed a wonderful man is he not she laugheda low and musicala contented and a happy laugh is he not you never know what alec may be going to do next mrs feildings sundays have already become a great success such a success as a woman of the world may desire and a clever woman can achieve there is once more as she says proudly a salon in london if it does not quite take the lead that she pretends in art and letters it is always full men who go there once go again they find the kind of entertainment that they like plenty of people for talk to begin with then every man is made by the hostess to feel that his own position in the literary and artistic world is above even his own estimate that is soothing in fact the note of the salon is appreciationnot mutual admiration as the envious do enviously affirm moreover everybody in the salon has done somethingperhaps not much but something and then the place is one where the talk is delightfully free almost as free as in a club smokingroom every evening again there is some kind of entertainment but not too much because the salon has to keep up its reputation for conversation and music destroys conversation let us said mrs feilding revive the dead art of conversation let the men in this room make their reputation as they did a hundred years ago for brilliant talk i have not heard that mrs feilding has yet developed a talker like the mighty men of old perhaps one will come along later those however who have looked into the subject with an ambition in that line and have ascertained the nature of the epigrams repartees retorts quips jokes and personal observations attributed to messrs douglas jerrold and his brilliant circle are doubtful of reviving that art except in a modified and a greatly chastened even an effeminate form the entertainments provided by mrs feilding consisted of a little music or a little singingalways by a young and littleknown professional there was generally something in the fashionyoung lady with a banjo or a tumtum or anything which was popular young gentleman to whistle young actor or actress to give a character sketch sometimes a picture sent in for private exhibition sometimes a little poem printed for the evening and handed aboutone never knew what would be done but always the hostess would be gracious winning caressing smiling and talking incessantly always she would be gliding about the room making her friends talk the happy wife of the most accomplished and most versatile man in london and always that illustrious genius himself calm and grave taking art seriously laying down with authority the opinion that should be held to a circle who surrounded him the circle consisted chiefly of women and of young men older men with that reluctance to listen to the voice of authority which distinguishes many after thirty held aloof and talked with each other alec feilding said one of them expressing the general opinion may be a mighty clever fellow but he talks like a dull book youve heard it all before and youve heard it better put its wonderful that such a clever dog should be such a dull dog they came however in spite of the dulness the wife would have carried off a hundred dull dogs as in certain earlier and betterknown circles the men greatly outnumbered the women i am not in love with my own sex said mrs feilding quite openly i prefer the society of men but some women came of their own accord and some were brought by their fathers husbands lovers and brothers no one could say that ladies kept away from mrs feildings sunday evenings this evening the principal thing was the uncovering of a new picturemr feildings new picture at ten oclock the painterpoet in obedience to a whisper from his wife moved slowly followed by his ring of disciplesmale and femaleall younga callow broodto the upper end of the room where was an easel a picture stood upon it but a large green cloth was thrown over it i thought said mr alec feilding in his most dignified manner that you would like to see this picture before anyone else it is one of the little privileges of our sunday evenings to show things to each other some of you may remember he said with the true humility of genius that i have exhibited hitherto chiefly pictures of coast scenery i have always been of opinion that a man should not confine himself to one class of subjects his purchasing public may demand it but the true artist should disregard all and any considerations connected with money your true artist hasnt always got a weekly journal to fall back upon growled a young ara who did stick to one class of subjects he had been brought there as a rule artists are not found at mrs feildings nor do they rally round the cleverest man in london i say repeated the really great man that the wishes of buyers must not be weighed for an instant in comparison with the true interests of art like a copybook murmured the associate therefore i have attempted a new line altogether i have made new studies they have cost a great deal of time and trouble and anxious thought it is quite a new departure i anticipate beforehand what you will say at first buteccolo he lifted the green cloth at the same moment his wife turned up a light that stood beside the painting he disclosed a really very beautiful painting a group of trees beside a shallow pool of water the trees were leafless a little snow lay at their roots the pool was frozen over there was a little mist over the ground and between the trunks one saw the setting sun illustration he disclosed a really very beautiful painting by jove its a belgian picture cried the associate and indeed you may see hundreds of pictures exactly in this style in the brussels galleries where the artists are never tired of painting the flat country and the trees at every season and under every light precisely said the painter that is the remark which i anticipated let us call itif you likea belgian picture the subject is english the treatment perhaps belgian for my part i am not too proud to learn something from the belgians the associate touched the man nearest himan artist not yet an associateby the arm ghosts he murmured spooks and ghosts spectres replied the other phantoms and bogies a haunted studio said the associate my knees totter my hair stands on end i tremblei have gooseflesh replied his friend let uslet us run to the society of psychical research whispered the associate let us swiftly run said the other they fled swiftly and softly only mrs feilding observed their flight she also gathered from their looks the subject of their talk and she resolved that she would not henceforth encourage artists at her sunday evenings she turned to dick stephenson you mr stephenson she said who are a true critic and understand work tell me what you think of the picture the great critiche was not really a humbug he was very fond of looking at pictures only you see he was not an artistadvanced to the front bent forward considered a few moments and then spoke a dexterous piece of worktruly dexterous in the highest sense full of observation intelligently and poetically rendered careful truthful with intense feeling i could hardly have believed that any english painter was capable of work in this genre the people all gazed upon the canvas with rapt admiration they murmured that it was wonderful and beautiful then alec covered up the picture and somebody began to play something alec said mr jagenal who seldom came to these gatherings i congratulate you your picture is very good and in a new style when will you be content to settle down in the jogtrot that the british public love let me change my subject sometimes when i am tired of trees i will go back perhaps to the coast and seapieces ah but take care theres a fellow coming along by the way alec i have made a discovery lately what is it about those rubies why manfor alec turned suddenly paleyou remember that business still indeed i do he replied and i am not likely to forget it in a hurry my dear boy to paint such pictures is worth many such bags of precious stones if you will only think so whats your discovery alec asked hoarsely well i have found quite accidentally the eldest grandchild of the second daughteryour greataunt oh again he changed colour then you will i suppose hand him over the things yes certainly i have sent for him he does not yet know what i want him for and i shall give him the jewels in obedience to armorels instructions alec i have always been desperately sorry for your unfortunate discovery it caused a pang certainly and who is my cousin well alec i will not tell you until i have made quite sure not that there is any doubt but i had better not you will perhaps like to make his acquaintance perhaps you know him already i dont say mind well sir said alec when he realises the extent and value of this windfall i expect he will show a depth of gratitude which will astonish you i do indeed zoe he said when everybody was gone are you quite sure that in the matter of those rubies your action can never be discovered anything may be discovered but i thinki believethat it will be difficult why because my cousin the grandson of robert fletchers second daughter has been found and he will receive the jewels tomorrow and when he finds out what they are worth then alec it will be asked who had the jewels they were taken to the bank by mr jagenal and taken thence to mr jagenal what have youwhat have ito do with them dont think about it alec it has nothing to do with us no suspicion can possibly attach to us forget the whole business the evening went off very well the picture struck everybody very much and ive laid the foundation for curiosity about the play and as for the paper i was going into the accounts this morning it is paying at the rate of three thousand a year alec you have never until now been really and truly the cleverest man in london chapter xxix the trespass offering it was a day in midwinter over the adjacent island of great britain there was either a yellow fog or a white fog or a black fog perhaps there was no fog at all but a black east wind or there was melting snow or there was cold sleet and rain whatever there was to be out of doors brought no joy and the early darkness was tolerable because it closed and hid and put away the day in the archipelago of scilly the sky was bright and clear the sea was blue except in the shallow places where it was a light transparent green the waves danced and sparkled round the ledges of the rocks the white foam rolled and leaped the sunshine was warm the air was fresh the girls stood on the northern carn of samson they had been on the island now for eight months for the greater part of that time they were alone only in the summer archie came to pay them a visit his play was accepted it would probably be brought out in january perhaps not till later according to the success of the piece then running meantime he had got introductions thanks to armorels evening and now found work enough to keep him going on one or two journals where his occasional papersthe papers of a young and clever man feeling his way to stylewere taken and published and he was of course writing another play he was in love with another heroinehappy if he knew his own happiness in starting on that rare career in which a man is always in love and blamelessly even with the knowledge of his wife with a succession of the loveliest and most delightful damselscountry girls and princesseslasses of the city and of the milking pathdolly and molly and stately kate and the duchess of dainty device as yet he had only lost his heart to two and was now raving over the second of his sweethearts one such youth i have known and followed as he passed from the twenties to the thirtiesto the fortieseven to the fifties he has always loved one girl after the other he knows not how life can exist unless a man is in love he is a mere slave and votary of love yet never with a goddess of the earth he loves an imagea simulacruma phantom and he looks on with joy and satisfactionyea the tears of happiness rise to his eyes when he sees that phantom at the last after many cruel delays fondly embracednot by himselfbut by another phantom happy lover so to have lost the substance yet to be satisfied with the shadow except for archies visit they had no guests all through the summer the holiday visitors mostly arrive at hugh town sail across to tresco gardens and back some the same day some the next day thinking they have seen scilly none of them land on samson few there are who sail about the outer islands where armorel mostly loved to steer her boat the two girls spent the whole time alone with each other for company i do not know whether the literature of the country will be enriched by effies sojourn in lyonesse but one hopes at least she lost her pale cheeks and thin form she put on roses and she filled out she became almost as strong as armorel almost as dexterous with the sheet and almost as handy with the oar but of verses i fear that few came to her with the best intentions with piles of books these two maidens idled away the summer basking on the headlands lying among the fern walking over the downs of bryher and st martins sailing in and out among the channels bathing in porth bay or off the lonely beach of ganilly in the eastern group always something to see or something to do once they ventured to sail by themselvesa parlous voyage but the day was calmall the way round bishops rock and back another time they sailedbut this time they took peteramong the dogs of scilly climbed up on black rosevean and stood on gorregan with the cruel teeth once on a very calm day in july they even threaded the narrow channel between the twin rocks known together as the scilly always there was something new to do or to see so the morning and the afternoon passed away and there was nothing left but tea and a little music and a stroll in the moonlight or beneath the stars and a talk together and so to bed and if there came a rainy day the cakes to make and the puddings to compose a happy lazy idle profitable time we have been six months here and more effie said armorel they were sitting in the sunshine in the sheltered orchard among the wrinkled and twisted old appletrees what next when shall we think of going back to london we must not stay here altogether lest we rust we will go backshall weas soon as the short dark days are over and we will make a new departure somehow but in what direction i do not quite know shall we travel shall we cultivate society what shall we do we will go back to london as soon as archies play is produced dear armorel i do not want ever to go away i should like to stay here with you always and always it has been a time of peace and quiet never before have i known such peace and such quiet but we must go we must go while the spell of the place is still upon us perhaps if we were to stay too longnature does not expect us to outstay her welcomenot that her welcome is exhausted yetbut if we go away shall we ever come back and if so will it be quite the same nothing ever returns said armorel the sage we shall go away and we shall come back again and there will be changes everything changes daily the very music of the sea changes from day to day but it is always music my old grandmother in the great chair used to hold her hand to her earsoto catch the lapping of the waves and the washing of the tide among the rocks it was the music that she had known all her life but the tune was differentthe words of the song in her head were differentthe key was changedbut always the music oh my dear i never tire of this music we will go away effie we must not stay too long here lest we fall in love with solitude and renounce the world but we will come back and hear the same music again with a new song we must go back she sighed eight months we must go and see archies play archie it will be a proud and glorious day for him if it succeeds it must succeed and not a word or a sign all this time from roland what is he doing why she stopped effie laid a hand on hers you have been restless for some days armorel she said yesyes i do not doubt him nonohe has returned to himself he can nevernever againi do not doubt him she sprang to her feet oh effie i do not doubt but sometimes i fear what do i fear why i know there may be failure but there can never again be disgrace you think of him so much armorel said effie with a touch of jealousy i cannot think of him too much she looked out upon the sunlit sea at their feet talking as one who talks to herself how can i think of him too much i have thought of him every day for five yearsevery day i love him effie how can you think too much of the man you love suppose i were to hear that he had failed again that would make no difference suppose he were to sink lowlowdeep down among the worst of menthat would make no difference i love the man as he may beas he shall beby the help of god if not in this world then in the world to come i love him effie she stopped because her voice choked with a sob the strength of her passionnot for nothing was the castilian invader wrecked upon scillyfrightened the other girl she had never dreamed of such a passion yet she knew that armorel thought continually of this man she did not dare to speak she looked on with clasped hands in silence armorel softened again the tumult of her heart subsided she turned to effie and kissed her forgive me dear you know nowbut you have guessed already let us say no more but i must see him soon i must go to see him if he cannot come to see me let us go over the hill this little orchard is like a hothouse this morning when they reached the top of the hill they saw the steamer from penzance rounding bar point on st marys and coming through the north channel they have had a fine passage said armorel the boat must have done it in three hours i wonder if she brings anything for us it is too early for the magazines i wrote for those books but i doubt if there has been time and i wrote to philippa but i do not expect a letter in reply by this post and i wrote to archie but i do not know whether i shall get a letter today suppose there should come a visitor few visitors come to scilly in the winterand none to samson we are alone on our desert island effie see the steamer is entering the port the tide is low she cannot get alongside the quay it is such a fine day that it is a pity we did not sail over this morning and meet the steamer there goes the steamlaunch from tresco it is quite a mile from samson to the quay of hugh town but the air was so clear that armorel whose eyes were as good as any ordinary fieldglass could plainly make out the agitation and bustle on the quay caused by the arrival of the steamer the boat always carries my thoughts back to london said armorel and we have been talking about london have we not when i was a child the boat came into the road out of the unknown and next day went back to the unknown what was the other side like i filled it up with the vague splendour of a childs imagination the unknown to me was like the sunrise or the sunset well now i know the poets say that knowledge makes us no happier i think they are quite wrong it is always better to know everything even though its little joy to feel that heaven is farther off than when one was a boy there is a boat she went on after a while she is putting out from the port i wonder what boat it is perhaps she is going to bryheror to st martinsor to st agnes it is not the lighthouse boat she is sailing as if for samson but she cannot be coming here what a lovely breeze she would be here in a quarter of an hour i suppose she must be going to tresco see what comes of living on a desert island we are actually speculating about the voyage of a sailingboat across the road effie we are little better than village gossips you shall marry mr paul pry she looks very pretty said effie heeling over with the wind wherever she is going they are steering south of green island said armorel that is very odd if she had been making for bryher or tresco she would leave green island on the lee and steer up the channel past puffin i really believe that she is coming to samson i expect there is a parcel for us let us run down to the beach effie we shall get there just in time they ran down the hill as the boatman lowered the sail and the boat grounded on the firm white sand of the beach the girls arrived the boat brought however no packet oh cried effie it is roland lee it was none other than that young man of whom they had been speaking armorel changed colour she blushed a rosy red then she recovered quickly and stepped forward as roland leaped out upon the sand welcome back to samson she said giving him her hand with her old frankness we expected you to come but we did not know when may i stay he murmured taking her hand and looking into her face you knowyourself she replied he made answer by shouldering his portmanteau no new road has been made i suppose he said shall i go first how well i remember the way over the hill samson has changed little since i was here last he led the way all laughing and chatting as if his visit was expected and as if it were the most natural thing in the world and the most common thing to run down to the beach and meet a morning caller from london town but effie who was as observant as a poet ought to be saw how roland kept looking round as he led as if he would be still catching sight of armorel come dorcas cried armorel when they arrived at the house come chessunhere is mr roland lee you have not forgotten mr lee he has come to stay with us again the servingwomen came out and shook hands with him in friendly fashion forgotten mr lee why he was the only young man who had been seen at holy farm since armorels brothers were drownedvictims to the relentless wrath of those execrable rubies you shall have your old room said dorcas chessun will air the bed for you and light a fire to warm the room well mr lee you are not much altered your beard is grown and youre a bit stouter not much changed youre married yet not yet dorcas armorel shes a woman now when you left her she was little better than a child i say shes improved but perhaps you wish she was a child again indeed no said roland everything was quite commonplace there was not the least romance about the return of the wanderer it was halfpast two he had had nothing to eat since breakfast and after three hours and more upon the sea one is naturally hungry chessun laid the cloth and put the cold beefcold boiled beefupon the table pickles were also produceda pickled walnut is not a romantic object the young man was madly in love he had come all the way from town on purpose to explain and dilate upon that wonderful accident yet he took a pickled walnut nay he was in a famishing condition and he tackled the beef and beerthat old brown george full of the homebrewed with a head of foam like the head of a venerable bishopas if he was not in love at all and armorel sat opposite to him at the table talking to him about the voyage and his studio and whether he had furnished it and all kinds of things and chessun hovered over him suggesting more pickles and he laughed and armorel laughedwhy not they were both as happy as they could be but effie wondered how armorel whose heart was so full whose soul was so charged and heavy with love could laugh thus gaily and talk thus idly after luncheon which of course was in samson fashion dinner roland got up and stood in the square window looking out to sea armorel stood beside him i remember standing here he said one morning five years ago a great deal has happened since then a great deal we are olderwe know more of the world we are stronger armoreltheir eyes metelse i should not be here it was quite natural that armorel should put on her jacket and take her hat and that they should go out together effie took her seat in the window and lay in the sunshine a book neglected in her lap armorel had got her lover back she loved him oh she loved him so heavenly is the contemplation of human love that effie found it more soothing than the words of wisdom in her book more full of comfort than any printed page human love she knew well would never fall to her lot all the more should she meditate on love in others well she has her compensations while others act she looks on while others feel she will tell the world in her verse what and how they feel to be loved is the chief and crowning blessing for a woman but such as effie have their consolations she looked up and saw old dorcas standing in the door they have gone out in the boat she said when i saw him coming over the hill i said to chessun hes come again hes come for armorel at last i always knew he would and now theyve gone out in the boat to be quite alone is he worth her miss effie is he worth my girl if he is not she will make him worth her but nobody could be worth armorel are you sure you are not mistaken dorcas nonono i am not mistaken the lovelight is in his eyes and the answering love in hers i know the child she loved him six years ago she is as steadfast as the compass she can never change once love always love and no other love she has thought about him ever since why did she go away and leave us alone without her for five long years she wanted to learn things so as to make herself fit for him as if he would care what things she knew if only he loved her twas the beautiful maid he would love with her soft heart and her tender voice and her steadfast waysnot what she knew oh but dorcas perhapsyou are not quite surewe do not knowone may be mistaken you may be mistaken miss effie as for me ive been married for fiveandfifty years a woman of my age is never mistaken i saw the lovelight in his eyes and i saw the answering love in hers and i know my own girl that ive nursed and brought up since the cruel sea swallowed up her father and her mother and her brothers no miss effie i know what i can see one does not as a rule go in a small open boat upon the water in december even in scilly whose winter hath nor frost nor snow but these two young people quite naturally and without so much as asking whether it was summer or winter got into the boat roland took the oarsarmorel sat in the stern they put out from samson what time the midwinter sun was sinking low the tide was rising fast and the wind was from the southeast when they were clear of green island roland hoisted the sail i have a fancy he said to sail out to round island and to see camber rock again this first day of my return shall we have time we can let the sun go down there will be light enough yet for an hour you can steer the craft in the dark armorel you are captain of this boat and i am your crew you can steer me safely home even on the darkest nightin the blackest time he added with a deeper meaning than lay in his simple words the sail caught the breeze and the boat heeled over roland sat holding the rope while armorel steered neither spoke they sailed up new grinsey channel between tresco and bryher past hangmans island past cromwells castle they sailed right through beyond the rocks and ledges outlying tresco outside menovawr the great triple rock with his two narrow channels and so to the north of round island the sky was aflame the waters were splendid with the colours of the west they rounded the island then roland lowered the sail and put out the oars we must row now he said how glorious it all is i am back again nine short months agoyou remember armorelhow could i have hoped to come here againto sail with you in your boat yet you are here she said simply i have so much to say and i could not say it except in the boat yes roland first of all i have sold that picture it is not a great price that i have taken but i have sold it you will be pleased to hear that next i have two commissions at a better price dont believe armorel that i am thinking about nothing but money the first step towards success remember is to be selfsupporting welli have taken that first step i have also obtained some work on an illustrated paper that keeps me going i have regained my lost positionand moremore armorel the way is open to me at last everything is open to me now if i can force myself to the front no man can ask for more can he no he cannot as for the time armorel the horrible shameful time roland you said you would not come here until the shame of that time belonged altogether to the past it does it does yet the memory lingerssometimes at night i think of itand i am abased we cannot forgeti suppose we can never forget that is the burden which we lay upon ourselves oh we must all walk humbly because we have all fallen so far short of the best and because we cannot forget butto be forgiven that also is so hard oh roland you mistake we can always forgive those we loveyeseverythingeverythinguntil seventy times seven how can we love if we cannot forgive the difficulty is to forgive ourselves we shall do that when we have risen high enough to understand how great a thing is the souli dont know how to put what i wish to say once i read in a book that there was a soul who wishedwho would notto enter into heaven the doors were wide open the hands of the angels were held out in love and welcome but the soul shrank back i cannot enter he said i cannot forgive myself you must learn to forgive yourself roland as for those who love you they ask for nothing more than to see your foot upon the upward slope it is there armorel twice you have saved me once from death by drowning once from a worse death stillthe second death twice your arms have been stretched out to save me from destruction they were silent again the boat rocked gently in the water the setting sun upon armorels face lent her cheek a warmer softer glow and lit her eyes which were suffused with tears roland sitting in his place started up and dipped the oars again it is nearly halftide now he said let us row through the camber pass i want to see that dark ravine again it is the place i painted with youyou of the present not of the pastin it i have sold the picture but i have a copy now i have two paintings with you in each one hangs in the studio and the other in my own room so that by night as well as by day i feel that my guardian angel is always with me through the narrow ravine between camber rock and round island the water races and boils and roars when the tide runs strongly now it was flowing gentlyalmost still the sun was so low that the rock on the east side was obscured by the great mass of round island the channel was quite dark the dipping of the oars echoed along the black walls of rock but overhead there was the soft and glowing sky and in the light blue already appeared two or three stars a strange thing has happened to me armorel roland said speaking low as if in a churcha very strange and wonderful thing it is a thing which connects me with you and with your people and with the island of samson you remember the story told us one eveningthe evening before i left youby the ancient lady of course she told that story so often and i used to suffer such agonies of shame that my ancestor should act so basely and such terrors in thinking of the fate of his soul that i am not likely to forget the story you remember that she mistook me for robert fletcher yes i remember she was not so very far wrong armorel because you see i am robert fletchers greatgrandson oh roland is it possible i suppose that there may have been some resemblance she forgot the present and was carried back in imagination to the past eighty years ago oh and you did not know if you think of it armorel very few middleclass people are able to tell the maiden name of their grandmother we do not keep our genealogies as we should then how did you find it out mr jagenal your lawyer found it out he sent for me and proved it quite clearly robert fletcher left three daughters the eldest died unmarried the second and third married i am the grandson of the second daughter who went to australia now which is very odd the only grandson of the third daughter is a man whose name you may remember they call him alec feilding he is at once a painter a poet a novelist and is about to become i hear a dramatist he is my own cousin this is strange is it not oh it is wonderful mr jagenal at the same time made me a communication he was instructed he said by you therefore you know the nature of the communication he gave you the rubies yes he gave them to me i have brought them back they are in my pocket i restore them to you armorel he drew forth the packetthe case of shagreenand laid it in armorels lap keep them i will not have them let me never see them she gave them back to him quickly keep them out of my sight roland they are horrible things they bring disaster and destruction you will not have them you positively refuse to have them then i can keep them to myself whythat is brave he opened the case and unrolled the silken wrapper see armorel the pretty things they sparkle in the dying light do you know that they are worth many thousands you have given me a fortune i am rich at last what is there in the world to compare with being rich now i can buy anything i want the way of wealth is the way of pleasure what did i tell you my feet were dragged into that way as if with ropes now they can go dancing of their own accordno need to drag them they flythey tripthey have wings what is artwhat is workwhat is the soulnothing herehe took up a handful of the stones and dropped them back againhere armorel is what will purchase pleasuresolid comfort i shall live in ease and sloth i shall do nothing i shall feast every day everybody will call me a great painter because i am rich oh i have a splendid vision of the days to come when i have turned these glittering things into cash farewell drudgeryi am rich farewell disappointmenti am rich farewell servitudei am rich farewell work and strugglei am rich why should i care any more for art i am rich armorel i am rich that is not all you are going to say about the rubies roland come to the conclusion not quite all in the old days i flung away everything for the way of wealth and the way of pleasureas i thought good heavens what wealth came to me what pleasure well armorel in your presence i now throw away the wealth since you will not have it i will not he seized the case as if he would throw it overboard she leaned forward eagerly and stopped him will you really do this roland stop a moment think it is a great sacrifice you might use that wealth for all kinds of good and useful things you could command the making of beautiful things you could help yourself in your art you could travel and studyyou could do a great deal you know with all this money think before you do what can never be undone roland for reply laid the rubies again in her lap it was as if one should bring a trespass offering and lay it upon the altar the case was open and the light was still strong enough overhead for the rubies to be seen in a glittering heap he took them up again do you consent armorel she bowed her head he took a handful of the stones and dropped them in the water there was a little splash and the precious stones the fortune of robert fletcher the gems of the burmah mines dropped like a shower upon the surface they were as we know nothing but bits of paste and glass but this he did not know and therefore the trespass offering was rich and precious then he took the silken kerchief which had wrapped them and threw the rest away as one throws into the sea a handful of pebbles picked up on the beach so he said that is done and now i am poor again you shall keep the empty case armorel if you like nono i do not want even the case i want never to be reminded again of the rubies and the story of robert fletcher roland dipped the oars again and with two or three vigorous strokes pulled the boat out of the dark channelthe tomb of his wealthinto the open water beyond there in the dying light the puffins swam and dived and the seagulls screamed as they flew overhead and on the edge of the rocks the shags stood in meditative rows far away in the studio of the poetpainterthe cleverest man in londonsat two who were uneasy with the same gnawing anxiety roland leethey knew by this timehad the rubies when would the discovery be made when would there be an inquiry what would come out as the time goes on this anxiety will grow less but it will never wholly vanish it will change perhaps into curiosity as to what has been done with those bits of glass and paste why has not roland found out he must have given them to his wife and she must have kept them locked up some day it will be discovered that they are valueless but then it will be far too late for any inquiry as yet they do not speak to each other of the thing it is too recent roland lee has but just acquired his fortune he is still gloating over the stones he is building castles in the air he is planning his future when he finds out the truth about themwhat will happen then i have had a bad dream of temptation with rubies armorel temptation harder than you would believe how calm is the sea tonight how warm the air the last light of the west lies on your cheek andarmorel oh armorel it was nearly six oclock long after dark when the two came home they walked over the hill hand in hand they entered the room hand in hand their faces grave and solemn i know not what things had been said between them but they were things quite sacred only the lighter thingsthe things of the surfacethe things that everybody expectscan be set down concerning love the tears stood in armorels eyes and as if effie had not been in the room at all she held out both her hands for her lover to take and when he bent his head she raised her face to meet his lips you have come back to me roland she said you have grown so tallso tallgrown to your full height welcome home at seven the door opened and the servingfolk came in first marched justinian bowed and bent but still active then dorcas also bowed and bent but active then chessun effie turned down the lamp dorcas stood for a moment while chessun placed the chairs gazing upon roland who stood erect as a soldier surveyed by his captain you have got a good face she said if a loving face is a good face if you love her you will make her happy if she loves you your lot is happy if you deserve her you are not far from the kingdom of heaven your words dorcas he replied are of good omen chessun shall make a posset tonight she said if ever a posset was made one shall be made tonighta sherry posset i remember the posset for your mother armorel and for your grandmother the first day she came here with her sweetheart a sherry posset you shall havehot and strong the old man sat down and threw small lumps of coal upon the fire then the flames leaped up and the red light played about the room and showed the golden torque round armorels neck and played upon her glowing face as she took her fiddle and stood up in the old place to play to them in the old fashion dorcas sat opposite her husband at her left hand chessun with her spinningwheel it was allexcept for the ancient lady and the hooded chairall exactly as roland remembered it nearly six years before yet as armorel said though outside there was the music of the waves and within the music of her violinthe music was set to other words and arranged for another key between himself of that time and of the present how great a gulf armorel finished tuning and looked towards her master dissembling love he commanded tis a moving piece and you play it rarely dissembling love spottiswoode co printers
