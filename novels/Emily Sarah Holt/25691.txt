joyce morrells harvest by emily sarah holt this book is one of a series involving the same late sixteenth century family its predecessor is lettice eden and its successor is it might have been readers may find a little difficulty with the language for it is written in elizabethan english though that wont bother you if you are familiar with the plays of shakespeare three young teenage girls and their aunt joyce are chatting together one evening when one of the girls suggests they might all try to keep a journal the idea is scoffed at because it was said nothing ever happens in their neck of the woods a few exaggerated examples of the daily events that might be recorded were given but nonetheless they applied to their father for the paper pens and ink that they would need and set to work taking it in turns to write up the journal it is slightly annoying that every proper name is written in italics which your reviewer found rather unusual but you can get used to anything and once you have done that it doesnt seem too bad the author was said to be a good historian and so you will find the book informative and interesting as the great issues of the day are discussed many of them being of a religious nature joyce morrells harvest by emily sarah holt preface those to whom lettice eden is an old friend will meet with many acquaintances in these pages the lesson is partly of the same type the difference between that which seems and that which is between the gold which will stand the fire and the imitation which the flame will dissolve in a moment between the true diamond small though it be which is worth a fortune and the glittering paste which is worth little more than nothing but here there is a further lesson beyond this it is one which god takes great pains to teach us and which we alas are very slow to learn tarry thou the lords leisure in the dim eyes of frail children of earth gods steps are often very slow we are too apt to forget that they are very sure but he will not be hurried he has eternity to work in if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us how many of us who fancied their prayers unheard because they could not see the answer may find that answer rich abundant eternal in that land where they shall know as they are known let us wait for god we shall find some day that it was worth while chapter one the dwellers at selwick hall he would be on the mountains top without the toil and travail of the climbingtupper selwick hall lake derwentwater october ye first mdlxxix it came about as i have oft noted things to do after a metely deal of talk yet right suddenly in the end aunt joyce milly edith and i were in the long gallery we had been talking a while touching olden times whereof aunt joyce is a rare hand at telling of stories and mothers chronicle she was wont to keep and hath shown us and such like matter when all at once quoth edith why should not we keep a chronicle ay why not saith aunt joyce busied with her sewing milly fell alaughing dear heart edith and what should we put in a chronicle saith she monday the cat washed her face tuesday it rained wednesday nell made a tansy pudding thursday i lost my temper friday i found it again saturday edith looked in the mirror and aunt joyce made an end of a piece of sewing good lack it shall be a rare jolly book nay i would never set down such stuff as that answered edith why what else is there saith milly we have dwelt hither ever since we were born saving when we go to visit aunt joyce and one day is the very cut of an other saving when master stuyvesant came hither nought never happened in this house since i was born wouldst love better a life wherein matters should happen milly saith aunt joyce looking up at her with a manner of face that i knew it was a little mirthful yet sorrowful withal ay i would so quoth she child aunt joyce makes answer happy is the man that hath no history but things do happen milly saith edith thou hast forgot anstace her wedding that something happening pouts milly stupid humdrum business do but think to wed a man that dwelleth the next door which thou hast known all thy life why i would as lief not be wed at all very nigh it seemed to suit anstace puts in edith aught should do that ay saith aunt joyce something drily godliness is great riches if a man be content with that he hath note easy enough trow when you have plenty quoth milly nay it is hardest then saith she much would have more what wist aunt joyce thereabout murmurs milly so that i could just hear she never lacked nought she wanted getting oldish milly but not going deaf thank god saith aunt joyce of her dry fashion nay child thou art out there time was when i desired one thing far beyond all other things in this world and did not get it never aunt never milly and a somewhat pained look came into her face that is wont to seem so calm what was it aunt joyce sweet heart well i took it for fine gold and it turned out to be pinchbeck saith she theres a deal of that sort of stuff in this world methought milly feared to ask further and all was still till edith saith would you avise us aunt joyce to keep a chronicle even though things did not happen things will happen trust me she made answer ay dear maids methinks it should be profitable for you now aunt joyce i would you had not said that why milly by reason that things which be profitable be alway dry and gloomsome not alway lettice edens daughter i could not help but smile when aunt joyce said this for indeed mother hath oft told us how when she was a young maid like milly she did sorely hate all gloom and sorrowfulness nor could not abide for to think thereon and milly is much of that turn then which of us shall keep the grand chronicle saith edith when we had made an end of laughing why not all of you quoth aunt joyce let each keep it a month apiece turn about and you aunt joyce nay i will keep no chronicles i would not mind an i writ my thoughts down of the last page when it was finished but who shall read it said i there spake nell quoth milly who shall read it why all the world for sure from the queens majesty down to cat and kitling these be our two servingmaids kate and caitlin which milly doth affect dearly to call cat and kitling and truly the names come pat the rather that kate is tall and big and fair of complexion she being westmoreland born while caitlin which is cumberland born is little and wiry and of dark complexion the queens majesty shall have other fish to fry i reckon saith aunt joyce and so shall kate and caitlinif they could read but who is to make a beginning of this mighty chronicle saith edith some other than i as i do trust for i would never know what to set down first let nell begin then as she is eldest of the three quoth aunt joyce so here am i making this same beginning of the family chronicle for when father and mother heard thereof both laughed at the first and afterward grew sad then saith mother methinks dear hearts it shall be well for youat the least an ye keep it truly let each set down what verily she doth think and not what she reckons she ought to think saith aunt joyce then father will it please you give us some pens and paper said i for i see not how elsewise we shall write a chronicle that speech is right nell puts in milly why if we dwelt on the banks of the nile in egypt saith father reeds and bulrushes should serve your turn or were ye old romans a waxen tablet and iron stylus but for english maidens dwelling by lake derwentwater i count paper and pens shall be wantedand ink too belike thou shalt have thy need supplied nell and as this morning when he came into the parlour where we sat asewing what should father set down afore me in the stead of the sheets of rough paper i looked to see but this beautiful book all full of fair blank paper ready to be writ inand an whole bundle of pens with a great inkhorn milly fell alaughing oh dear dear saith she be we three to write up all those verily father under your good pleasure but methinks you should pen a good half of this chronicle yourself nay not so much as one line saith he saving those few i have writ already on the first leaf let nell read them aloud so i read them as i set them down here for without i do copy them cannot i put in what was said fees and charges of the chronicle of selwick hallimprimis to be writ turn about by a month at each by helen milisent and editha louvaine milly was stuffing her kerchief into her mouth to let her from laughing right out item the said helen to begin the said book item for every blot therein made one penny to the poor oh good lack from milly i care not so father give us the pennies from edith i reckon that is what men call a dividing of labour saith father in his dry way i to pay the pennies and edith to make the blots nay my maid the two must come of one hand then both of yours father saith milly saucily item for every unkind sentence touching an other two pence to the poor lackadaisy cries milly i shall be ruined truth for once quoth aunt joyce i am sorry to hear it my maid saith father item for every sentence disrespectful to any in lawful authority over the writer thereof sixpence to the poor father quoth milly by how much mean you to increase mine income while this book is awriting father smiled but made no further answer item for a gap of so much as one week without a line herein writ two pence to the poor that is it which shall work my ruin saith edith alaughing therein art thou convict of laziness quoth father item on the ending of the said book each of them that hath writ the same shall read over her own part therein from the beginning and for so many times as she hath gainsaid her own words therein writ shall forfeit each time one penny to the poor that will bring both edith and me to beggary quoth milly only nell shall come off scotfree father have you writ nought that will catch her item the said book shall when ended but not aforetime be open to the reading of aubrey louvaine lettice louvaine joyce morrell and anstace banaster and none else alack the day saith milly i said not whom else quoth father be that as it like you but i know well what should like meand that were not so much as one pair of eyes beyond milly i dare reckonbut if i go on it shall cost me two pence so i will forbear well saith edith one thing will i say your leave granted father and that is i am fain you shall not read my part till it be done i would lief be at my wisest on the last page dear heart i look to be wise on no page cries milly nay said i i would trust to be wise on all there spake our nell cries milly i could swear it were she though mine eyes were shut close this book doth somewhat divert me joyce quoth father looking at her here be three writers of whom one shall be wise on each page and one on none and one on the last only i reckon it shall be pleasant reading and i reckon saith aunt joyce they shall be reasonable true to themselves an it be thus and i saith milly that my pages shall be the pleasantest of any ergo quoth father wisdom is displeasant matter so it is millyto unwise folks then father of a surety my chronicling shall ill please you saith she alaughing father arose and laid his hand upon millys head as he passed by her the wise can love the unwise my maid saith he how could the only wise god love any one of us else selwick hall october ye ii milly saith and edith likewise that i must needs set down somewhat touching all uswho we be and how many and our names and such like truly it seemeth me somewhat lost labour if none but ourselves are to read the same but as milly will have it the queens majesty and all her council shall be highly diverted thereby though little as methinks they should care to know of us i reckon to please these my sisters i must needs do their bidding we therefore that dwell in selwick hall be sir aubrey louvaine the owner thereof that is father and dame lettice his wife and us their daughters helen milisent and editha moreover there is aunt joyce morrell that dwelleth in oxfordshire at minster lovel but doth once every five year tarry six months with us and we with her the like so that we see each the other once in every two or three years tis but a week aunt joyce hath been hither so all the six months be to run and here i should note she is not truly our aunt but fathers cousin her mother being sister unto his mother but father had never no brother nor sister and was bred up along with these his cousins aunt joyce and aunt anstace after whom mine eldest sister hath her name but aunt anstace hath been dead these many years afore any of us were born i would i had known her for to hear them talk of herfather and mother and aunt joycei could wellnigh think her an angel in human flesh now wherefore is it for i have ofttimes marvelled that we speak more tenderly and reverently of folk that be dead than of the living were i to die a young maid should milly that loves to mock me now tell her children henceforward of their aunt helen as though she had been somewhat better than other women maybe if we could only use folks we love while they do live with the like loving reverence as we shall do after they be dead if we overlive them wherefore do we not so we do seem for to forget then all that we loved not in them could we not essay to do the same a little sooner and when milly cometh hither in her reading as sure as her name is milisent shall she saynow mistress nell there you go ariding your high horse of philosophy prithee keep to common earth beside those i have named in the house dwelleth mynheer floris stuyvesant a dutch gentleman that did flee from his country when the persecution was in holland eleven years gone and father which had a little known him aforetime when he made the grand tour did most gladly welcome him hither and made him of his own desire governor to ned and wat our brothers these our brothers dwell not now at home for wat is squire unto my very good lord of oxenford that is fathers kinsman and ned is at sea with sir humphrey gilbert we therefore see them but rarely then beyond there is likewise in the house mistress elizabeth wolvercot that is a cousin of mother whom all we do alway call cousin bess she dwelleth with us at all times also be kate and caitlin of whom i have aforetime spoken and old matthias our servingman and the boy adam o bills o old malls and here i should note that once were two of us more aubrey and julian of whom aubrey died a babe three years afore i was born and julian a little maid of eleven years between millys birth and ediths i mind her well for she was two years elder than i so that i was nine years old when she departed but milly that was only three cannot remember her our eldest of all anstace is wife unto master henry banaster and dwelleth as milly saith next door he having the estate joining fathers own she hath two children aubrey that is of seven years and cicely that is four beside her eldest lettice which did decease in the cradle i reckon i have told all now without i name the cows which be daisy and molly and buttercup and rose and ladybird and june and the great housedog which is clover and the cat which is a spanish cat a tortoiseshell cat then a rarity her name hermosa the which ned gave her saying a spanish cat should have a spanish name and hermosa signifieth beautiful in that tongue but caitlin will make it moses and methinks she is called moses more than aught else she hath two kits that be particoloured like herself their names given of milly dan and nan and now i feel wellnigh sure i have said all nay and forgat the horses milly will laugh at me for she dearly loveth an horse we have six ridinghorses with two baggagehorses but only four of them have namesto wit fathers that is favelle because he is favelcolour chestnut and mothers garnet and mine cowslip and the last that milly or edith doth commonly ride when we journey is called starlight and now i have verily told every thing at this point the handwriting of the chronicle changes tis not yet my turn to write but needs must or it shall cause me to split in twain with laughter here is our nell reckoning three times oer that she hath told all and finding somewhat fresh every time and with all her telling hath set down never a note of what we be like nor so much as the colour of one of our eyes so having gat hold of her chronicle i shall do it for her i dare reckon she was feared it should cost her two pence each one but nothing venture nothing have and mother laid down that we should write our true thoughts so what i think shall i write and how to make fathers two pence rhyme with mothers avisement i leave to mistress nell and her philosophy father is a gentleman of metely good height and wellpresenced but something heavy built of a dark brown hair a broad white brow and dark grey eyes that be rare sweet and lovesome of old time was he squire of the body unto my right noble lord of surrey that was execute in old king henrys days moreover he is of far kin yet not so far neither unto my most worthy lord of oxenford now sithence i am to write my thoughts i must say that i would father had a better nose i cannot speak very truth and set down that i did ever admire fathers nose but he hath good white teeth and a right pleasant smile the which go far to make amends for his nose mother was right fair when she was a young maid and is none so ill now she is graceful of carriage very fair of complexion and hath the sweetest shining golden hair was ever seen her eyes be pale grey blue right like the sky of us three maids edith is bestfavoured and all that see her do say she is right the very picture of mother when she was young next her am i for though i say it i am a deal fairer than either anstace or nell both which favour resemble father though nell is the liker by reason she hath his mind as well as his face now nell is all ways slower than edith and me and nothing like so wellfavoured but for beauty the least i did ever see in any man is in mynheer stuyvesant which hath a flat nose and a stoop in the shoulders and is high and thin as a scarecrow cousin bess is metely wellshe is rosy and throddy plump for aunt joyce i do stand in some fear of her sharp speeches and will say nought of her saving that which she can not deny she hath rosy cheeks and dark brown hair yet not so dark as fathers and was i guess a comely young maid when she were none elder than we as for ned and wat ned is the betterfavoured he having mothers nose and the rest of him father but wat which favoureth mother of his colouring yet is not so comely a deal the courtlier now when they shall all come to read this same trow shall they know their own portraits or shall they every one cry out this is not me so now i leave the rest to mistress helen till it shall come to me next month when i will say what i think yet again selwick hall october ye v in helens handwriting dear heart but what hath milly been adoing i could not think last night where was my book but i was rare sleepy and let it abe and here this morrow do i find a good two pages all scribbled oer of millys writing well tis not my fault so i trust shall not be my blame and it is true as milly saith that she is betterfavoured than i as for anstace i wis not only i know and am well assured that i am least comely of the four but she should never have writ what she did touching fathers nose and if it cost me two pence that must i say i do love every bit of father right down to the tip of his nose and i never thought if it were wellfavoured or no tis father and that is all for me and so should it be for millythough it be two pence more to say so selwick hall october ye vi we had been sat at our sewing a good hour this morrowthat is mother and aunt joyce and we three maidswhen all at once milly casts hers down with a sigh fetched from ever so far weary of sewing milly saith mother with a smile aynonot right that mother quoth she but here have i been this hour gone awishing i had been a man till it seemed me as if i could not abide for to be a woman no longer the general end of impossible wishes saith mother laughing a little well quoth aunt joyce abiting off her thread in all my wishing never yet wished i that wherefore is it milly saith mother oh a man has more of his own way than a woman milly makes answer and he can make some noise in the world he is not tied down to stupid humdrum matters such like as sewing and cooking and distilling and picking of flowers with a song or twain by now and then to cheer you a man can preach and fight and write books and make folk listen i misdoubt if thou art right milly to say that a man hath the more of his own way always saith mother methinks there be many women get much of that then a man is not tied down to one corner he can go and see the world saith milly in short quoth aunt joyce the moral of thy words milly isuntie me i wish i were so mutters milly and what should happen next saith aunt joyce why i reckon i could not do much without money answereth milly oh grant all that quoth aunt joycemoney and leave and all needed and mistress milisent setting forth to do according to her will what then well i would first go up to london saith she and cut some figure in the court aunt joyce gave a dry little laugh there be figures of more shapes than one milly saith she howbeitwhat next why then methinks i would go to the wars and bring back as many heads arms and legs as thou tookest thither oh for sure saith milly i would not be killed just very wellmistress milisent back from the wars and covered with glory and then wellmethinks i would love to be a judge for a bit dry work saith aunt joyce and then a bishop ay if you will and then why i might as well be a king while i went about it quite as well i am astonished thou hast come thither no sooner and then welli know not what then you drive one on aunt joyce methinks then i would come home and see you all and recount mine aventures oh mightily obliged to your highness quoth aunt joyce i had thought when your majesty were thus up at top of the tree you should forget utterly so mean a place as selwick hall and the contemptible things that inhabit there and then come i will make an end saith milly laughing i reckon i should be a bit wearied by then and fain to bide at home and take mine ease and pray what hindereth that your grace should do that now saith aunt joyce looking up with a comical face well but i am not aweary and have no aventures to tell milly makes answer go into the garden and jump five hundred times milly and i will warrant thee to be aweary and thankful for rest and as to aventures eh my maid my maid and aunt joyce and mother smiled one upon the other now mother and aunt may i say what i think cries milly prithee so do my maid then why do you folks that be no longer young ever damp and chill young folks that would fain see the world and have some jollity by reason milly that we have been through the world and we know it to be a damp place and a cold but all folks do not find it so god have mercy on them that do not now aunt what mean you dear heart the brighter the colour of the poisoned sweetmeat the more like is the babe to put in his mouth your parable is above me aunt joyce milly a maiden must give her heart to something the lords word unto us all is give me thine heart but most of us will try every thing else first and every thing else doth chill and disappoint us yet thou never sawest man nor woman that had given the heart to god which could ever say with truth that disappointment had come of it i reckon they should be unready to confess the same saith she they be ready enough to confess it of other things quoth aunt joyce but few folks will learn by the blunders of any but their own selves i would thou didst by whose blunders would you have me learn aunt saith milly in her saucy fashion that is yet so bright and coaxing that she rarely gets flitten scolded for the same by those of whomsoever thou seest to blunder quoth she that must needs be thee edith saith milly in a demure voice for it standeth with reason as thou very well wist that i shall never see mine elders to make no blunders of no sort whatever thou art a saucy baggage milly quoth aunt joyce that shall cost thee six pence an it go down in the chronicle oh tis not yet my turn for to write aunt and i am well assured nell shall pay no sixpences fewer than thou i dare guess saith aunt joyce who has been to visit old jack benn this week not i aunt quoth edith somewhat wearily as if she feared aunt joyce should bid her go oh ill go and see him cries milly there is nought one half so diverting in all the vale as old jack aunt be all brownists as queer as he nay i reckon jack hath some queer notions of his own apart from his brownery quoth she but millybe diverted as much as thou wilt but let not the old man see that thou art alaughing at him all right aunt saith milly cheerily come nell edith shall bide at home that can i see so milly and i set forth to visit old jack and mother gave us a bottle of cordial water and a little basket of fresh eggs for to take withal he dwells all alone doth old jack in a mud cot partway up the mountain that he did build himself ere the aches in his bones gan trouble him that he might scantly work he is one of those queer folk that call themselves brownists and would fain have some better religion than they may find at church jack is nigh alway reading of his bible but never no man could so much as guess the strange meanings he brings forth of the words i reckon as aunt joyce saith there is more jack than brownist in them we found jack sitting in the porch his great bible on his knees he looked up when he heard our voices get out saith he i never want no women folk tis not oft we have fairer greeting of jack nay truly jack saith milly right demurely they be a rare bad handfulnigh as ill as men folk what thou lackest is eggs and cordial water the which women can carry as well as jackasses she held forth her basket as she spake humph grunts old jack id liever have the jackasses i am assured thou wouldst quoth milly each loveth best his own kind old jack was fingering of the eggs they be all hens eggs so they be saith milly i dare guess thou shouldst have loved goose eggs better ducks answereth old jack the ducks be gone aswimming saith she i now drew forth my bottle of cordial water the which the old man took off me with never a thank you and after smelling thereto set of the ground at his side what art reading jack saith milly what pauls got to say again th law quoth he tis a rare ill thing th law mistress milisent and so be magistrates and catchpolls constables and all the lawyer folk rascals mistress milisentall rascals every man jack of em do but read paul and you shall see so much saith the apostle so quoth milly and gave me a look which nigh oerset me he saith the law is not given unto a righteous man so how can they be aught but ill folk that be alway apoking in it tell me that mistress if birds of a feather will flock together then a chap thats shaking hands every day wi th law mun be an ill un and no mistake go to jack it signifies not that milly makes answer saint paul meant that the law of god was given for the sake of ill men not good men the laws of england be other matter get out wi ye saith jack do ye think i wis not what paul means as well as a woman it says th law and it means th law and if hed signified as you say hed have said as th law wasnt given again a righteous man not to him you gie oer comin arumpagin like yon for me i scarce knew which way to look to let me from laughing but milly goes on sad as any judge well but if lawyers be thus bad jackthough my sisters husband is a lawyer mind thou hes a rascal then breaks in jack theyre all rascals every wastrel an unprincipled goodfornothing fellow of em but what fashion of folk be better saith milly thou seest jack we maids be nigh

tribulation i see how it isi shall be forced to wed a leadminer i was verily thankful that milly did come away for i could bear no longer we ran fast down the steep track and once at the bottom we laughed till the tears ran down when we were something composed said i shall we look in on old isaac crewdson gramercy not this morrow quoth milly jacks enough for one day old isaac alway gives me the horrors i cannot do with him atop of jack so we came home but if milly love it not then will i go by myself to see old isaac for he liketh me well selwick hall october ye ix aunt joyce went with me

oer yonder so we home bidding god be wi ye to old mall in passing and had but a grunt in answer but we won home afore the rain and found father and mynheer atalking in the great chamber and mother above laying of sweet herbs in the linen with edith note passages from the new testament are quoted from cranmers or the geneva version both then in common use chapter two wherein ideas differ o man little hast thou learned of truth in things most truemartin farquhar tupper in helens handwriting selwick hall october the xii well milly saith nought never happens in this house lackadaisy but i would fain it were so one may love ones friends and must ones enemies father saith but how should one feel towards them that be nowise enemies for they mean right kindly and yet not friends seeing they make your life a burden unto you now all our lives have i known master lewthwaite of mere lea and mistress lewthwaite his wife and their lads and lasses nym jack and robin and alice and blanche many a game at hunt the slipper and blind mans buff have we had at mere lea and i would have said yet may had not a thing happed this morrow which i would right fain should neer have happened while the world stood what in all this world should have made nym so to do cannot i so much as conceive he might have found a deal fairer lasses why our milly and edith are ever so much betterfavoured but to want me nor only that but to come with so pitiful a tale that he should go straight to ruin an i would not wed with him that i was the only maid in all the world that should serve against the same and that if i refused all his sins thereafter should be laid at my door heard any ever the like and i have no list to wed with nym i like himas a dozen other lads but that is all and meseems that before i could think to leave father and mother and all and go away with a man for all my life he must be as the whole world to me or i could never do it i cannot think what nym would be at and he saith it shall be my blame and my sin if i do it not must i wed nym lewthwaite i sat and pondered drearily oer my trouble for a season and then went to look for aunt joyce whom i found in the long gallery at her sewing in a window well nell what hast ado maid saith she pray you aunt joyce tell me a thing said i that will i with a very good will my maid saith she aunt joyce if a man were to come to you and entreat you to wed with him by reason that he could not should he say keep in the right way without you did help him and that you refusing you should be blameworthy of all his after sinswhat should you say to him i listened right earnestly for her answer i was woeful feared she should say wed with him nell for sure and thus save him say quoth aunt joyce looking up with it seemed me somewhat like laughter in her eyes fetch him a good buffet of his ear forsooth and ask at him by what right he called himself a man then you should not think you bound to save him aunt poor weak creature not i saith aunt joyce but whatso nell hast had any such a simpleton at thee aunt said i tis nym lewthwaite who saith an i wed him not he shall go straight to ruin and that i must answer unto god for all his sins if so be ask him where he found that in the bible saith aunt joyce take no thought about him nell trust me if a man cannot keep straight without thee he will not keep straight with thee poor limping soul to come halting up and plead with a weak woman to leave him put his hand on her shoulder to help him oer the stones carry me prithee good mistress oer this rough place use thine own two legs would i say to him and be ashamed of thy meanness and i dare be sworn he calls himself one of the nobler sex ends aunt joyce with a snort of scorn o aunt i am so thankful you see it thus said i drawing a long breath i was so afeard you should bid me do as nym would nay not this while quoth she of her dry fashion when we lack stuff for to mend the foul roads nell well find somewhat fitter to break up than thee if young lewthwaite harry thee again send him to me hell not want to see me twice ill warrant i was feared i was wicked to shrink from it aunt i made answer nym said so he said twas all selfloving and seeking of mine ease that alone did make me for to hesitate and that if i had loved god and my neighbour better than myself i would have strake hands with him at once and i was feared lest it should be true ay it is none so difficult to paint black white saith aunt joyce tis alway the selflovers that cry out upon the unkindliness of other folks and thou art one of them nell my maid that be prone to reckon that must needs be right which goes against the grain there be that make selfdenial run of all fours in that fashion they think duty and pleasure must needs be enemies why child they are the best friends in the world only duty is the elder sister and is jealous to be put first run thou after duty and see if pleasure come not running after thee to beseech thee of better acquaintance but run after pleasure and shell fly thee shes a rare bashful one then you count it not wrong that one should desire to be happy aunt the lord seems not to count it so nell he had scarce methinks told us so much touching the happiness of heaven had he meant us to think it ill to be happy but remember maid she that findeth her happiness in god hath it alway ready to her hand while she that findeth her happiness in this world must wait till it come to seek her i would i were as good as father said i and i believe i fetched a sigh go a little higher nell while thou art aclimbing quoth aunt joyce i would i were as good as christ eh aunt but who could said i none she made answer but nell he that shoots up into the sky is more like to rise than he that aims at a hollybush methinks father is higher than i am ever like to get said i and if thou overtop him she made answer all shall see it but thyself climb on nell thou wilt not grow giddy so long as thine eyes be turned above i am so glad that aunt joyce seeth thus touching nym selwick hall october ye ii there goeth my first two pence for a blank week in good sooth i have been in ill case to write this weary nym would in no wise leave me be but went to anstace and hal and gat their instance persuaded them to intercede unto father and mother which did send for me and would know at me if i list to wed with nym or no and verily so bashful am i and afeared to speak when i am took on the sudden thus that i count they gat not much of me but were something troubled to make out what i would be at nor wis i what should have befallen not for that father nor mother were ever so little hard unto me good lack but only that i was stupid had not aunt joyce come in who no sooner saw how matters stood than she up and spake for me now aubrey and lettice saith she both of you fall acatechising me in the stead of nell the maid hath no list to wed with nym lewthwaite and hath told me so much aforetime leave her be and send him away the other side of jericho where he belongs and let him an he list fetch back a syrian maiden with a horn oer her forehead and a ring of her nose wherefore didst thou not tell us so much nell my lass saith father right kindlily laying of his hand on my shoulder but in the stead of answering him thankfully as a dutiful daughter should what did i but burst forth o crying as though he had been angered with me yea nor might i stop the same but went on truly i knew not wherefore till mother came up and put her arms around me and hushed me as she wont to do when i was a little child the poor child is oerwrought quoth she tenderly let us leave her be aubrey till she calms downthere come to me and have it out my nelly and none shall trouble thee trust me lackadaisy i sobbed all the harder for a season but in time i calmed down as mother says and when so were i prayed her of pardon for that i could be so foolish nay my lass saith she we be made of body and soul and either comes uppermost at times tis no good trying to live with one which so it be ah the old monks made that blunder saith father and thought they could live with souls only or wellnigh so and there be scores of other that essay to live with nought but bodies a man that starves his body is ill off but a man that starves his soul is yet worser no is it thus mynheer mynheer van stuyvesant had come in while father was aspeaking ah saith he there be in my country certain called mennonites that do starve their natures of yonder fashion which half of thembody or soul saith father nay i would say both two he makes answer they run right to the further end of every matter because they read in their bibles that in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin therefore they do forbid all speech that is not of very necessityeven a word more than needful is sin in their eyes if you shall say sit you down in that chair to your comfort there are eight words more than you need you see there are eight sins sit were enough so one mouthful more bread than you needno nothat is a sin one drop of syrup to your breadnot at all you could eat your bread without syrup all that is joyous all that is comfortable all that you like to doall so many sins those are the mennonites what sinful men they must be saith father good lack master stuyvesant but think you all those folks tarried in holland saith aunt joyce marry i could count you a round dozen i have met in this country and they be trying i warrant you my fingers have itched to shake them ere now how do they serve them when they would get them wed saith father quoth master john to mistress bess wed me and no moreand saith she ay and no more a kiss i ween shall be a sin for tis no wise necessary i could not help to laugh and so did aunt joyce and mother wed makes answer mynheer the mennonites wed why tis the biggest of all their sins the wedding therell not be many of them i reckon saith aunt joyce more than you should think saith he there be to join them every year well ill not join them this bout quoth she now wherein doth that differ from the old monks saith father as in meditation be we setting up monasteries for protestants already mynheer shrugged up his shoulders they say the mennonites he made answer that all pleasing of self is contrary unto gods word i must do nothing that pleases me are there two dishes for my dinner i like this i like not that good i take that i love not elsewise i please me a christian man must not please himselfhe must please god and they say he cannot please both ah therein lieth the fallacy saith father all pleasing of self counter unto god no doubt is forbidden in holy scripture but surely i am not bid to avoid doing gods commandments if he command a thing i like why at that rate quoth aunt joyce one should never search gods word nor pray unto himexcept such as did not love it methinks these mennonites stand o their heads with their heels in air ah but they say it is gods command that thou shalt not please thyself saith mynheer therefore that which pleases thee cannot be his will you see they do but run the old monks notions to ground quoth father they go a bit furtherthat is all i take it that whensoever my will is contrary unto gods my will must go down but when my will runneth alongside of his surely i am at liberty to take as much pleasure in doing his will as i may ye have been called unto liberty saith paul only let not your liberty be an occasion to the flesh but in love serve one another and if serving one another be pleasant unto thee then give oer quoth aunt joyce good lack this world doth hold some fools pure truth joyce saith father yet for that of monks in good sooth i do look to see them back only under other guise monachism is human nature and human nature will out if he make not way at one door trust him to creep forth of an other but aubrey the church is reformed there is no room for monks and nuns and such rubbish saith aunt joyce the church is reformeday saith he but human nature is not that shall not be until we see the king in his beautywhether by our going to him in death or by his coming to us in the clouds of heaven dear heart manbe not alway on the watch for black clouds quoth she as well turn mennonite at once well sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof father makes answer and so far thou art right joyce yet it is well we should remember at times that we be not yet in heaven at times quoth aunt joyce with a laugh what a blessed life must be thine if those that be about thee suffer thee to forget the same save at times i never made that blunder yet i can tell thee and so she and i away and left all laughing selwick hall october ye xxii this afternoon come hal and anstace with their childre milly soon carried off the childre for she is a very child herself and can lake play with childre a deal better than i and hal went said he to seek father with whom i found him an hour later in the great chamber and both right deep in public matter whereof i do love to hear them talk at times but milly and edith be no wise compatient the lost adjective of compassion therewith anstace came with me to our chamber and said she had list for a good chat whereof be we to chat said i something laughing oh there is plenty saith she we shall not be done with the childre this hour thou wilt not anstace said i for in very deed all mothers do love rarely to talk over their childre and i need not save thee but i am no great talker as thou well wist that do i saith she for of all young maids ever i saw thou hast the least list inclination to discourse but nell i want to know somewhat of thee what ails thee at nym lewthwaite why nothing at all i made answer save that i do right heartily desire him to leave me be good sooth but i thought it a rare chance for thee quoth she and i was fair astonied when edith told me thou wouldst have none ado with him but thou must mind thy shooting nell if thou pitchest all thine arrows over high thou wilt catch nought i want to pitch no arrows said i well but i do desire thee to conceive saith she that too much niceness is not good for a young maid tis all very well to go apicking and achoosing ere thou art twenty but trust me nell by the time thou comest to thirty thou shouldst be thankful to take any man that will have thee nay said i that shall i not eh but thou wilt quoth she yea if it were nym lewthwaite i wont said i anstace fell alaughing then thou wilt have to go without saith she well said i that could i do maybe nor break my heart oer it neither but to take any that should have meanstace i would as soon sell me for a slave come nellwhere didst pick up such notions quoth she verily i might answer thee of the queens majesty said i and if i be not in good company enough search thou for better only for pitys sake sister anstace do let me abe eh ill let thee be saith she and wagged her head and laughed but in good sooth nell thou art a right queer body and if it should please the queens highness to wed with mounseer note as tis thought of many it shall then thou wilt be out of her company and i shall be in what shalt thou do then for company marry i can content me with aunt joyce and cousin bess quoth i and none so bad neither so at after that we gat to other discourse and after a while when milly came in with the childre we all went down into the great chamber where father and hal and mynheer were yet at their weighty debates cousin bess was sat in the window asewing on some flannel and aunt joyce in the same window but the other corner was busied with tapestrywork being a cushion that she is fashioning for a christmas gift for some dame that is her friend at minster lovel tis wellnigh done and when it shall be finished it shall go hence by old postlethwaite the carrier for six weeks is not too much betwixt here and minster lovel as we came in i heard father to say truly there is no end of the diverse fantasy of mens minds and then he brought forth some latin which i conceived not but whispering unto aunt joyce which is something learned in that tongue to say what it were she made answer so many men so many minds quot homines tot sententiae ha saith mynheer was it not that which the emperor charles did discover with his clocks and watches he was very curious in clocks and watchesthe emperor charles the fifthyou knowand in his chamber at the monastery of san yuste he had so many and watching them each day he found they went not all at one the big clock was five minutes to twelve when the little watch was two minutes past so he tried to make them at one but they would not no no the big clock and the little watch they go their own way then said the emperor now i see something i saw not aforetime i thought i could make these clocks go together but no yet they are only the work of men like me ah the foolish man to think that i could compel men to think all alike who are the work of the great god you see if his majesty had seen it a bit sooner quoth hal there should have been spared some ill work both in spain and the low countries mynheer saith ah more than once and wagged his head right sadly why quoth hal something earnestly mind you not some dozen years gone of the stir was made all over this realm when the ministers were appointed to wear their surplices at all times of their ministration and no longer to minister in gowns ne cloaks with their hats on as they had been wont yea what tumult had we then against the order taken by the queen and council and against the archbishop and bishops for consenting thereto and all said what was the mighty ado about why whether a man should wear a black gown or a white heard one ever such stuff ah hal that shall scantly serve saith father mind i pray thee that the question to the eyes of these men was somewhat far otherwise thou wouldst not say that adam and eva were turned forth of paradise by reason they plucked an apple but i pray you sir aubrey what was the question saith mynheer for i do not well know as i fain should look you quoth father in the beginning of the book of common prayer and you shall find a rubric that such ornaments of the church and of the ministers thereof at all times of their ministration shall be retained and be in use as were in this church of england by the authority of parliament in the second year of king edward the sixth but they were not retained breaks in hal that will alway be first to speak of aught lackaday shall that cost me two pence they were not retained repeateth father but the clergy took to ministering in their gowns and other common apparel such as they ware every day with no manner of vestments of no sort whereupon such negligence being thought unseemly it pleased the queens majesty sitting in her council and with consent of the archbishop and bishops to issue certain injunctions for the better ordering of the church to wit that at all times of their ministration the clergy should wear a decent white surplice and no other vestment nor should minister in their common apparel as aforetime then the rubric touching the garments as worn under king edward was done away saith mynheer done away completely quoth hal afore father could speak but not by parliament answers mynheer good lack what matter saith hal the queens majesty is supreme in this church of england if she issue her injunctions through her great council or her little council or her bishops they are all one so they be her true injunctions these were issued through the bishops saith father though determined on in the privy council then did the ministers not obey asks mynheer many did but some counted the surplice a return towards popery and utterly refused to wear it i mind remember there was a burying at that time at saint giles church in london without outside cripplegate where were six clerks that ware the white surplice and master crowley the vicar stood in the church door to withstand their entering saying that no such superstitious rags of rome should come into his church there should have been a bitter tumult there had not the clerks had the wit to give way and tarry withoutside the door and about the same time a scots minister did preach in london right vehemently against the order taken for the apparel of ministers why at saint mildreds in bread street where a minister that had conformed was brought of the worshipful of that parish for the communion service he was so withstood by the minister of the church and his adherents that the deputy of the ward and other were fain to stand beside him in the chancel to defend him during the service or the parson and his side should have plucked him down with violence and at long last saith father laughing the scots minister that had so inveighed against them was brought to conform but no sooner did he show himself in the pulpit of saint margaret pattens in a surplice than divers wives rose up and pulled him forth of the pulpit tearing his surplice and scratting his face right willingly eh good lack cries mynheer your women they keep silence in the churches after such a manner there was not much silence that morrow i warrant quoth hal laughing right merrily eh my gentlemen i pray you of pardon saith cousin bess looking up earnestly from her flannel but had i been in yon church id have done the like thing id none have scrat his face but id have rent a good tear in that surplice thou didst not so bess the last sunday morrow quoth father laughing as he turned to look at her nay tis all done and settled by now saith she i should but get took up for brawling but i warrant you that flying white thing sticketh sore in my throat and ever did an i had my way no parson should minister but in his common coat but that were unseemly and undecent bess quoth aunt joyce nay mistress joyce but methinks tis a deal decenter answers she wherefore if a man can speak to me of earthly things in a black gown must he needs don a white when he cometh to speak to me of heavenly things there is no wit in such stuff see you mynheer saith father again laughing even here in selwick hall where i trust we be little given to quarrel yet the clocks keep not all one time eh no saith mynheer shrugging of his shoulders and smiling the gentlewomen they be very determined in their own opinions well i own i like to see things decent saith aunt joyce i desire not to have back the popish albs and such like superstitious gaudsnot i but i do like to see a parson in a clean white surplice and i would be right sorry were it laid aside cousin bess said nought but wagged her head and tare her flannel in twain now i dare be bound bess thou countest me gone halfway back to rome saith aunt joyce that were nigh the via mala quoth father eh mistress joyce ill judge no man nor no woman makes answer cousin bess the lord looketh on the heart and tis well for us he doth for if we were judged by what other folk think of us i reckon we should none of us come so well off but them white flying kites be rags of popery that will i sayyea and stand to which side be you father asks anstace well my lass saith he though i see not mine own self the pope and all his cardinals to lurk in the folds of dr meades white surplice and i am bound to say his tall portly figure carrieth it off rarely yet i do right heartily respect bess her scruple and desire to abstain from that which she counteth the beginnings of evil now i warrant you bess shall reckon that of carrying it off well to be the lust of the eye saith aunt joyce shes a bit of a mennonite is bess eh mistress joyce pray you give me not such an ill word saith cousin bess reproachfully i never cared for mammon not i id be thankful for a crust of bread and a cup of water and say grace oer him with amen we all laughed and father saith nay bess thou takest joyce wrong in that of the mennonites she would say certain men of whom mynheer told us a few days gone that should think all things pleasurable and easeful to be wrong good lack mistress joyce but im none so bad as that saith bess im sure when i make gruel for whoso it be i leave no lumps in nor let it burn neither no dear heart thou art only a mennonite to thyself not to other folk saith aunt joyce thou shouldst be right well content of a board for thy bed but if any one of us had the blanket creased under our backs it should cost thee thy nights rest i know thee bess wolvercot well and i do dearly love to see folk comfortable quoth she as for me what recketh i thank the lord my health is good enough and a very fool were i to grumble at every bit of discomfort why only do think mistress joyce how much worser i might have been off had i been born of that country i heard master banaster atelling of where they never see the sun but of the summer and dwell of huts full o smoke with neer a chimneywhy i never could see if my face were clean nor my table rubbed bright eh but i wouldnt like that fashion of living they have no tables in greenland for to rub bess quoth hal nor oer many clean faces i take it saith father ah did you hear sir saith mynheer of mynheer heningsens voyage to greenland the last year i have not mynheer saith father pray you what was notable therein ah he was not far from the coast of greenland when he found the ship go out of her course he turned the rudder or how you say to guide the shipi am not sealearned i ask your pardon if i mistake but the ship would not move then they found beneath a sunken rock and it washow you saymagnetical that drew to it the iron of the ship then mynheer heningsen he look to his charts for he know no rock just there and what think you he found why two hundred years back exactlyin the year of our lord there were certain venetians the brothers zeni sailing in these seas and they brought word home to venice that on this very spot where heningsen found nothing but a sunken rock they found a beautiful large island where were one hundred villages inhabited by christian people in a state of great civility civilisation but so simple and guileless that hardly you can conceive think you nothing now but a sunken rock but what name hath the island asks hal no name at all no eyes ever saw it but the brothers zeni of venice nay mynheer i cry you mercy saith father of his thoughtful fashion if the brothers zeni told truth as i mean to signify no doubt there was one that saw it from the time when he pronounced all things very good to the day when some convulsion of nature whatso it were by his commandment engulfed that fair isle in the waters whatsoever the lord pleased that did hein heaven and in earth and in the sea and in all deep places not one hair from the head of those unknown christians that were christians in truth perished in those north waters we shall know it when we meet them in the land that is very far off selwick hall october ye xxxi mine hand was so weary when i was come to the last sentence afore this that i set down no more truly there was little at after that demerited the same and now i be come to the end of my month i have been areading over what i writ to see how much i must needs pay there be but two blots the which shall be so many pence and two blank spaces of one week or over the which at two pence each brings the account to sixpence i cannot perceive that i have at any time writ disrespectfully of my betterswhich i take it be father and mother and aunt joyce and cousin bess and mynheer stuyvesant but for speaking unkindly of other i fear i am not blameless i can count six twopences which shall be one shilling and sixpence i must try and do better when my month cometh round again verily i had not thought that i should speak unkindly six times in one month tis well to find out a bodys faults so now i pass my book over to millyand do right earnestly desire that she may be less faultful than i what poor infirm things be we in very sooth note francois duke of anjou who visited the queen in september to urge his suit elizabeth hesitated for some time before she gave a decided negative chapter three milisent makes a friend the inward depths of that deceitful fount where many a sin lies sleeping but not dead in milisents handwriting selwick hall november ye first things be alway going awry with me elsewise this jolly book should neer have come into my hands first of a sunday i would love dearly to read oer what my philosophical sister hath writ and comment on the same but i reckon i must tarry till tomorrow now mother said i was to write what i thought and i mean to do the same as to the pennies and the twopences they may count up themselves for all i care theyll not outrun halfacrown i reckon and having paid the same at my month end i shall just worry the life out of father till he give me an other so here goes it well the first thing i think iswhy must everything pleasant be set aside while monday father saith happiness and wickedness be not alike though quoth he some folk think so much now it seems me that happiness and holiness should be the same thing why should a matter not be right simply by reason that i like it i want to know and i will ask somebody some of these days howbeit of one thing am i assurednamely that it cannot be wicked to write on sunday what it is not wicked to do so i shall tell what we did now there some folk are so queer they will take down a gown and shake out the folds and talk an halfhour oer ithow this gimp should be better to run that way and next week the bottom must needs be fresh bound all of a sunday but to stick a neeld in and make the gimp run that way and fresh bind the bottomgood lack they should count you a very heathen an you asked them now i want to know how the one is a bit better than the other i cannot see a pin to choose betwixt them well we gat out of bed this morrowi reckon that is the first thing beyond opening ones eyes nell is alway the first up and edith the last she is rare hard to wake is edith or rather not to wake but to make her rise up when she is woke she takes a deal of shaking and talking to some mornings specially nell does the talking and i do the shaking and i warrant you i give it her howbeit we were all up at long lastand if one of us be late of a sunday morrow father looks as if we had brake his heart our sunday gowns at this season be of green satin of sixteen shillings the yardeh good lack should i have set that down of a sunday well never mind tis now doneand furred with pampilion an unknown species of fur our outdoor hoods be black velvet and in this gear went we to church at keswick and i would with all mine heart we had a church nearer unto us than three weary miles though every body saith tis mighty near father rid on favelle with edith behind him and mother on garnet behind master stuyvesant and nell and i on cowslip and aunt joyce of her own hackney that is called hermit with old matthias cousin bess come ambling after on starlight with adam afore her and behind trudged kate and kitling and by the same token moses came amewing to the door to see us depart so came we to the church and there found afore us my lord dilston and his following that had rowed over from lords island whereon of old time the barons of dilston the radcliffes subsequently created earls of derwentwater have had an house i am mindful of strangers the which shall read our chronicle which is more i reckon than nell shall have been and in good sooth but mistress jane is fair of face and i do love to look upon her well of course father being but a knight we stood of one side to let pass a baron and when all they were gone up went up we in due order father handing mother and mynheer with aunt joyce and then cousin bess and we three maids and there was dr meade with his white rag of popery as cousin bess will have it aflying behind him as he came from the vestry and i might not forbear to give a little pinch to edith as i saw it fly tis to no good to pinch nell for she doth but kill me with a look and there of either side which i had nigh forgot stood the common folk the townsfolk and the leadminers from vicars island anciently belonging to fountains abbey and such like all agaping and astaring on us as we went by to see the baron and the knight and eh but i do love to be gaped on tis the best bit of all the sunday for me now mother you said i was to write what i thought then come matins which one has to sit through of course the only good matter being the chants i can sing out and i do then come the sermon which is unto me sore weariness and i gape through it as i best may dear heart what matter is it to me if peter were ever at rome or no or if saint james and paul do both say the same thing touching faith and works we have all faithsay we not the creed every sunday and what would you have more and as to works i hate good works good works always means doing the very thing you would rather not tis good works to carry a pudding to old nanny crewdson through a lane where i nigh lose my shoes in the mire right at the time when i want to bide at home and play the virginals or tis sitting of a chair and reading of luthers commentary on the galatians to one of my betters when my very toes be tingling to be out in the sunshine good lack but i do owe a pretty penny to master doctor luther for that commentary i have had to sit and read it a good score of times when it should have done me marvellous ease to have boxed his ears with it had i been mistress katherine it should have gone hard with me but i would have pulled master doctor out of his study and made him lake with little jack and maudlin in the stead of toiling oer yon old musty commentary nell saith she loveth to read it in good sooth but i wish she may well matins oer come the communion for which all tarried but edith she not being yet confirmed is alway packed off ere it begin and when that were oerand i do love the last amen of allwent all we to dinner with mistress huthwaite at whose house we do ever dine of a sunday and mighty late it is of a communion sunday and i am wellnigh famished ere i break bread and for dinner was corned beef and carrots and for drink sherrissack and muscadel then at three o the clock all we again to church and by the same token if dr meade gave us not two full hours of a sermon then will i sell my gold chain for two pence and at after church in the porch were my lord dilston and fair mistress jane and my lord was pleased to take father by the hand and mother and aunt joyce likewise but did but kiss us maids note but mistress jane took us all three by the hand and did say unto me that she would fain be better acquainted and in very deed it should be a feather in my cap were i to come unto close friendship with my lord dilston his daughter as i do right heartily trust i may nor after all were it any such great preferment for me that am daughter unto sir aubrey louvaine of selwick hall knight which is cousin unto my right honourable lord the earl of oxenford and not so far off neither for my most honourable lord sir aubrey de vere sometime earl of oxenford was greatgreatgreatgrandfather unto my lord that now is and his sister my lady margaret wife to sir nicholas louvaine was greatgreatgrandmother unto father so they twain be cousins but four and an half times removed and good lack what is this surely i need not to plume me upon mistress jane radcliffe her notice and favour if the radcliffes be an old house as in very deed they be so be the veres and the louvaines both to say nought of the edens that have dwelt in kentdale these thousand years at the least but one thing will i never own and that is of mynheer stuyvesant which shall say and hold to it like a leech that our family be all dutch folk he will have it that the louvaines must needs have sprung from louvain in the low countries but of all things doth he make me mad angry a word still used in the north of england when he saith the great house of vere is dutch of origin for he will have it a weir to catch fish when all the world doth know that veritas is latin for truth and vere cometh of that or else of vir as though it should say one that is verily a man and no base coward loon and tis all foolishness for to say as doth mynheer that the old romans had no surnames like ours but only the name of the family such like as cornelius or julius which ran more akin unto our christian names i believe it not and i wont why was there not an emperor or a prince at the least that was called lucius verus and what is that but vere tis as plain as the barbers pole for all mynheer and that will i say howbeit i am forgetting my business and wellnigh that it is sunday so have back church over all we come home in the very order as we went and in the hall come moses apurring to us and arubbing of her head against nell and there was dan aturning round and round after his tail and nan that had a ball of paper on her back alaking therewith so we to doff our hoods and then down into the hall where was supper served for it was over late for fourhours note and of a communion sunday we never get none then nell to read a chapter from master doctor luther his magnifical commentary and by the mass i was glad it was not me theneh happy woman be my dole but if father shall see that last line it shall be a broad shilling out of my pocket at the least he is most mighty nice is father touching that make of talk i believe i catched it up of old matthias i must in very deed essay to leave it off and i do own tis not over seemly to swear of a sunday for i suppose it is swearing though tis not profane talk come father you must oerlook it this once and i will never do so no moreat the least not till the next time well then had we a chapter of luke and a long prayer of father and i am sore afeared i missed a good ten minutes thereof for i wis not well what happed nor how i gat there but assuredly i was adancing with my lord of oxenford and the queens majesty and my lord dilston alooking on and mistress jane as black as thunder because i danced better than she i reckon fathers stopping woke me and i said amen as well as any body then the hundredth psalm nell aplaying on the virginals and then best of all the blessing and then with goodnight all round to bed i reckon my nap at prayers had made me something wakeful for i heard both nell and edith asleep afore me selwick hall november ye iii now have i read oer every line my philosophical sister hath writ and very nigh smothered me o laughing at divers parts the long discourses she putteth in touching all manner of dreary matters i warrant you shall not see me to deal with the queens majestys injunctions touching the apparel of parsons nor with the dutch mennonites nor with philosophical questions touching folks thoughts and characters nor no such rubbish i like sunlight i do catch me asetting down master stuyvesant his dreary speeches i go not further for then should it cost me sixpence but master stuyvesant hath no authority over me so i may say what i will of him for two pence but it seemeth me for all her soberness and her killing looks that mistress helena is something diverted with my speeches else had she not put so many in but i ought not to have said what i did quotha touching fathers nose ought i not forsooth mistress helena that shall cost you two pence and i shall be fain to see the fine paid eh lackaday but that shall cost me two pence dear heart whatever was father athinking of i shall be as clean ruined as the velvet doublet that ned dropped in the fishpond it seemeth me father must have desired to make a good box for the poor i would it had not been at my cost one thing is plainthat mistress nell keeps a conscience i scarce think i do there is a cushion full of pins somewhere down near my stomach and now and then i get a prick but i do but cry pish and turn the pin end into the cushion nell on the contrary pulleth forth the pin and looketh on it holding it in all lights but there was one time i mind that i did not cry pish and methinks every pin in the cushion had set awork to prick me hard twas ever so long gone when wat and i dressed up the mop in a white sheet and set it on the stairs for to make anstace and nell scream forth ataking it for a ghost but as ill luck would have it the first came by was mother with edith in her arms that was then but a babe and it so frighted her she went white as the very sheet and dropped down of a dead faint and what should have come of edith i wis not had not anstace that came after been quick to catch at her eh but in all my life never saw i father as he then were it was long time ere mother come to and until after said he never a word for he was all busied with her but when she was come to herself and well at easemy word but he did serve out wat and me wat gat the worst by reason he was the elder and had said father played the serpent to mine eva but i warrant you i forgat not that birch rod for a week or twain good lack we never frighted nobody again and after all i do think fathers talk was worser than the fustigation whipping how he did insense it into us that we might have been the death of our mother and sister both and how it was rare wicked and cruel to seek to fright any and had been known to turn folks heads ere this you see father i have not forgot it and i reckon i never shall but one thing father alway doth and so belike do all in this house which i hear not other folks elders for to do when alice lewthwaite gets chidden mistress lewthwaite saith such matters be unseemly or undutiful and such like but father he must needs pull forth his bible and give you chapter and verse for every word he saith and it makes things look so much worser some how tis like being judged of god instead of men and where mistress lewthwaite talks of faults father and mother say sins and it makes ever so much difference to my thinking whether a matter be but a fault you need be told of or a sin that you must repent then mistress lewthwaite and i have noted it in other always takes things as they touch her whereas father and mother do look on them rather as they touch god and it doth seem ever so much more awfuller thus methinks it should be a sight comfortabler world if men had no consciences and could do as it listed them at all times without those pinpricks i am well assured folks should mostly do right i should at any rate tis but exceeding seldom i do aught wrong and then mostly because i am teased with forbiddance of the same i should never have touched the firefork when i was a little maid and nigh got the house afire had not old dame conyers that was my godmother bidden me not do the same had she but held her peace i should neer have thought thereon folks do not well to put matters into childres heads and then if aught go wrong the childre get the blame and in this world things be ever agoing wrong but wherefore must i be blamed for that forsooth tis the things go wrong not me i should be a very angel for goodness if only folks gave oer a putting of me out and gainsaying of me and forbidding things to be done in good sooth tis hard on a poor maid that cannot be suffered to be as good as she should were she but let abe selwick hall november ye vi yesterday the afternoon was so fair and sunshine that edith and i mother giving us leave rowed oer to saint huberts isle where edith sat her down of a great stone and said she would draw the lakes picture in little so i having no list to stand behind and look on went off to see if i could find aught such as a squirrel or a pie to divert me withal as for adam which had rowed us oer he gathered up his nose and his heels all of a lump on the grass and in five minutes he was snoring like an owl for me i wandered on a while and went all over the ruins of the hermitage and could find nought to look at save one robin that sat on a bough and stared at me after a while i sat me down and i reckon i should have been asnoring like adam afore long but i heard a little bruit noise that caused me turn mine head and all suddenly i was aware of a right goodly gentleman and well clad that leaned against a tree and gazed upon me yet with mighty respect and courtesy he was something past his youth yet right comely to look to of a fair hair and beard and soft eyes grey blue as the sky truly i was something fluttered for he ware a brave velvet jerkin and a gold chain as thick as master mayors and while i meditated if i should speak unto him or no he spake first i pray you fair my mistress or madam then restricted to noble ladies and knights wives if so be of your good pleasure to do a stranger to wit of the name of this charming isle saint huberts isle sir quoth i of old time as tis said saint hubert had an hermitage hereon the ruins whereof you may see down yonder truly the isle is better accommodated at this present saith he and smiled one of the comeliest smiles ever saw i on a mans face and who was saint hubert if it please my fair damosel in good sooth sir that know i not said i save that he were one of the old saints now done away if the old saints be done away saith he thank goodness the new at least be left good lack but i wist not what to answer to so courtly compliments and the better liked i my neighbour every minute methought i had never seen a gentleman so grand and amiable not to say of so good words and i pray you sweet mistress saith he yet aleaning against the tree which was an oak and i could find it again this minute is it lawful for the snared bird to request the name of the fowler sir i pray you of pardon i made answer and i could not help to laugh a little but i am all unused to so courtly and flattering words may it please you to put what you would say into something plainer english surely saith he the rose is not unaccustomed to the delightsome inhalation of her fragrance well fairest mistress may i know your name is that english plain enough to do you a pleasure sir quoth i my name is milisent louvaine to serve you truly saith he and it shall serve me right well to know so mellifluous a name note and what dwelling is honoured by being your fair home my honeysweet damsel sir said i i dwell at selwick hall oer the lake in yonder quarter it must be a delightsome dwelling he made answer andelders have you fairest mistress i thank the lord ay sir sir aubrey louvaine is my father and dame lettice sometime named eden my mother lettice eden saith he and methought something sorrowfully as though mothers old name should have waked some regrets within him i do mind me long time gone of a fair maiden of that name that was with my sometime lady of surrey and might now and then be seen at the court with her lady or with the fair lady of richmond her lords sister could it have been the same i marvel sir said i i cast no doubt thereon my mother was bowermaiden unto my lady of surrey afore she were wed ah saith he and fetched a great sigh she was the fairest maiden that ever mine eyes beheld at the leasti thought so yesterday my sister is more like her than i i did observe she is round by yonder aplaying the painter ah quoth he something carelessly i did see a young damsel sitting of a stone oer yonder very fair in good sooth yet i have seen fairereven within the compass of saint huberts isle and i do marvel that she should be regarded as favouring my good lady your mother more than you sweet mistress milisent i was astonished for i know edith is reckoned bestfavoured of all us and most like to mother but well as it liked me to sit and listen methought somehow i had better get me up and return to edith alas saith he when he saw me rise miserable man am i driving hence the fairest floweret of the isle not in no wise sir answered i but i count it time to return and my sister shall be coming to look for me then sweet mistress give me leave to hand you oer these rough paths so i put mine hand into his which was shapely and well cased in fair spanish leather and as we walked he asked me of divers matters as how many brothers i had and if they dwelt at home and if father were at home and the number and names of my sisters and such like all which i told him moreover he would know if we had any guests which with much more seeing he had been of old time acquainted with mother i told only i forgat to make mention of aunt joyce so at long lastfor he being unacquainted with the isle took the longest way round and i thought it good manners not to check himat long last come we to edith which was gat up from her stone and was putting by her paper and pencils in the bag which she had brought for them we shall be something late for fourhours milly saith she prithee wake adam whilst i make an end off went i and gave adam a good shake and coming back found edith in discourse with my gentleman i cannot tell why but i would as lief he had not conversed with any but me sir said i may we set you down of the lakeside no i thank you much saith he and lifting his bonnet from his head i saw how gleaming golden was yet his hair i have a boat oer the other side farewell my sweet mistresses both i trust we shall meet again methinks i owe it you howbeit to tell you my name i am sir edwin tregarvon of cornwall and very much your servant so away went he with a graceful mien and we home oer the lake all the way edith saith nought butmilly where didst thou pick up thy cavaliero nay said i he it was who picked me up he was leaning of a tree of tother side over against borrowdale and i sat me down of a log and saw him not till he spake edith said no more at that time but in the even when we were doffing us and nell was not yet come up quoth she milly is sir edwin something free to ask questions oh meterly tolerably said i i trust thou gavest him not oer full answers oh nought of import said i beside edith he is an old friend of mother is he so quoth she then we can ask mother touching him now i could not have told any wherefore but i had no list to ask mother nor had i told her so much as one word touching him i believe i was half afeared she might forbid me to encourage him in talk i trust edith shall forget the same for she hath not an over good memory selwick hall november ye ix i wellnigh do wish i had not writ down that same o friday last howbeit there is no penalty against tearing out o leaves and that must i do if need be meanwhile i will go right forward with my chronicling i did verily think i saw sir edwin partway up the hill behind us o saturday even but o sunday he was not in church for i looked for him i reckon he must have left this vicinage or he should scarce run the risk of a twenty pound fine the penalty per month for nonattendance at the parish church without he be fairly arolling in riches as his gold chain looked not unlike thank goodness edith hath forgot to say aught to mother and tis not like she shall think on now selwick hall november ye xii mother bid me this morrow carry a basket of eggs and a spicecake the northern name for a plumcake to old jack they were ducks eggs for i had told her what jack said the last time we visited him i bade edith go with me note but she would not the day being somewhat foul i did never see a maid so unwilling to mire her shoes as our edith so i all alone up to jack benns which saw me from his hut door and gave me his customary courteous welcome theres a woman acoming quoth he get away wi ye i hate women nay jack said i thou alway savest me as thou wist here be eggs for theeducks every one and a spicecake which i know thou lovest i love nought so much as i hate women saith he but he took the cake and the eggs off me notwithstanding theyre fleshly folk is women quoth old jack nay what signifiest said i women have no more flesh than men i reckon mistress milisent does thou wit what paul says to th romans touching th flesh and th spirit oh ay jack i have read it afore now well and does thou mind how he threaps again th flesh to be sure said i now look ye here saith he heres my handand he reacheth forth a great brown paw does thou see it ay i am thankful i have eyes good enough for that jack wellthis hands made o flesh does thou wit i reckon so much jack good well paul he says were none to mind th things o th flesh but only th things o th spirit your spirits your thoughts and meditations like and thats why womens such ill unsbecause they are alway minding th things o th flesh scrubbing and washing and baking and sewing and such like and it stands to reason mistress milisent that what ye do wi th flesh mun be th things o th flesh does thou see well jack i am afeared i do not entirely get thee gone saith he women never can see nought theyre ill uns i tell yetheyre ill uns but jack the sins of the flesh have nought to do with cooking and washing does thou think i dunna know better nor a woman thee be off or ill let fly th broom at thee jack thou art a very uncivil companion said i but i gathered up my gown for to go i never were civil to a woman yet saith he and i hope i never shall be thats a sin ill none have to answer for in very deed it is jack said i and i will bear witness for thee to that end if need be farewell so away turned i from the grim old man but had not run many steps down ere i was aware of an hand very different from jacks held forth to me and a voice saluting me in exceeding diverse language fairest mistress milisent well met this cloudy morrow i see the flowers be out though the sun shine not give me leave i pray you to aid your graceful steps down this rough hillside so down the hill with me came sir edwin and mighty pleasant discourse had weall the fairer for coming after jack and much he told me of his estate in cornwall where he hath a fair castle built of old time and mines like to ours saving they be tin not lead and these cornish mines as he told me were worked of old time by the jews but when i did demand of him how jews should come to work them that quoth he could he not say and at times in these mines deep down in the old workings do they hear the ghosts of them that worked them a thousand years ago aknocking with the pickaxe and when they do break into the ancient workings they come on the olden pickaxes of stags horn used of these old jews and romans that did labour in these mines of old time good lack cried i and be these the very pickaxes used of these ghosts verily i would be feared for to touch them nay the tools themselves be no ghosts saith he laughing and i do ensure you fair my mistress i have seen and handled divers thereof then he told me moreover of a new custom is risen up in the queens majestys court for right courtly discourse he hath and the names of dukes and earls do fly about in his talk as though he were hand and glove with every man of them i do love to hear such discourse and that right dearly many a time have i essayed for to win mother to enter into talk touching those days when she dwelt in surrey place with my good lady countess of surrey but i wis not well wherefore she ever seemeth to have no list to talk of that time she will tell us of her prisonment in the counter and how father brought the little shell for to comfort her and at after how he fetched her out and rode away with her and had a care of her when as she was let forth but even in that there seems me like as there should be a gap which she never filleth up i marvel if there were somewhat of that time the which she would not we should know note i did once whisper a word of this make unto nell but mistress helena that doth alway the right and meet thing did seem so mighty shocked that i should desire to ferret forth somewhat that mother had no list for me to know that i let her abe but for all that would i dearly love to know it i do take delight in digging up of other folks secrets as much as in keeping of mine own howbeit here am i a great way off from sir edwin and his discourse of the new court custom the which hath name euphuism and is a right fair conceit whereby divers gentlemen and gentlewomen do swear friendship unto one the other by divers quaint names the which they do confer thus the queens majesty herself is pleased to honour some of her servants as my lord of burleigh who is her spirit and sir walter raleigh her water and mr vicechamberlain sir christopher hatton her sheep and mr secretary sir francis walsingham her moon sir edwin saith he had himself such a friendship with some mighty great lady whose name he would not utter though i did my best to provoke him thereto he calling her his discretion and she naming him her fortitude which is pleasant and witty matter note and quoth sir edwin mine honeysweet mistress if it may stand with your pleasure let us two follow the court fashion you shall be mine amiability loveliness not loveableness and if it shall please you shall call me your protection have i well said my fairest indeed sir and i thank you i made answer and should you do me so much honour it should like me right well by this time we were come to the turn nigh the garden gate and i dared not be seen with sir edwin no nearer the house the which he seemed to guess and would there take his leave demanding of me which road led the shortest way to kirkstone pass so i home and into our chamber to doff my raiment where as ill luck would have it was nell now our chamber window is the only one in all the house whence the path to jacks hut can be seen wherefore i reckoned me fairly safe but how did mine heart jump into my mouth when nell saith as i was afolding of my kerchief who was that with thee milly well i do hope it was not wicked that i should answera gentleman nell that would know his shortest way to kirkstone pass in good sooth it was a right true answer for sir edwin is a gentleman and he did ask me which were the shortest way thereto but good lack it seemed me as all the pins that ever were in a cushion started o pricking me when i thus spake yet what ill had i done forsooth i had said no falsehood only shut nells mouth for she asked no further and dear heart may i not make so much as a friend to divert me withal but i must send round the towncrier to proclaim the same after i had writ thus much down come i to the great chamber where i found anstace and hal come and hal with father and mynheer were fallen of mighty grave discourse touching the news of late come that the pope hath pretended to deprive the queens majesty of all right to ireland welladay as though her majesty should think to let go ireland or any other land because a foreign bishop should bid her methinks this companion the pope must needs be clean wood mad hal moreover is well pleased that the common council of london should forbid all plays in the city the which as he will have it be ill and foolish matter truly it maketh little matter to me here in derwent dale but methinks if i dwelt in london town i should be but little pleased therewith why should folk not divert them being aweary of master hals grave discourse went i over to anstace whom i found mighty busied of more lighter matterto wit the sumptuary laws of late set forth against long cloaks and wide ruffs which do ill please her for anstace loveth to ruffle it of a good ruff thence gat she to their cicely which is but ill at ease and dr bell was fetched to her this last even who saith that on friday and saturday the sign of the zodiac shall be in the heart and from sunday to tuesday in the stomach during which time it shall be no safe dealing with physic preservative whereof he reckoneth her need to be so she must needs tarry until wednesday come sevennight and from that time to fifteen days forward shall be passing good howbeit we gat back ere long to the fashions whereof anstace had of late a parcel of news from her husbands sister mistress parker that dwelleth but fifty miles from london and is an useful sister for to have as to the newest fashion of sleeves quoth she nothing is more certain than the uncertainty and likewise of hoods cypress saith she is out of fashion the which hath put me right out of conceit with my cypress kirtle that was made but last year and napped taffeta is now thought but servingmanlike all this and a deal more anstace told us as we sat in the compassed window bay window dr meades

at once so great and so small chapter four in bypath meadow i thought that i was strong lord and did not need thine arm though dangers thronged around me my heart felt no alarm i thought i nothing needed riches nor dress nor sight and on i walked in darkness and still i thought it light selwick hall november ye xv i have but now read oer what i writ these last few days and have meditated much whether i should go on to tell of sir edwin for it shall neer serve to have folk read the same and methinketh it best for to go straight on and at the end if need be tear out the leaves for it doth me a mighty pleasure to write and think upon the same and i can make some excuse when i come to it though mistress nell i guess right well of neatness should be heedful yet i will tear the leaves out fair if it shall so be needful there who saith i cannot write poesy this morrow again i being but just without the garden gate i met with my protection who doffed his plumed bonnet and saluted me as his most fair amiability i do see him most days though but for a minute and in truth i think long from one time to another coming back i meditated what i should say to mistress nell that loveth somewhat too much to meddle should she have caught sight of him for it shall not serve every time to send him to kirkstone nor of course could i think to tell a lie thereabout so i called to mind that he had once asked me what name we called the eyebright in these parts though it were not this morrow but i should not need to say that and it should be no lie seeing he did say so much metrusteth the cushion should not prick me for that and right sure am i there should be no need selwick hall november ye xvii truly as saith the old saw tis best not to halloo till thou be out of the wood this very afternoon what should edith say without one word of warning as we were sat asewing but mother do you mind a gentleman by name tregarvon what name saidst edith asks mother tregarvon quoth she sir edwin tregarvon of cornwall nay i never knew no gentleman of that name saith mother where heardst of him child twas when we went oer to saint huberts isle mother she made answerwhat day were it millyabout ten days gone aye i mind it saith mother well while i sat of the rock adrawing come up a gentleman to me saith she and asked at me if louvaine were not my name why then he knew us thought i i said aye and he went on to ask me if father were at home for he had list to have speech of him and he said he knew you mother of old time when you were mistress lettice i told him father was at home and he desired to know what time should be the best to find him when i told him the early morrow for he was oft away in the afternoon and then well my lass saith mother for edith was at a point well mother methinks i had better tell you saith she alooking up for i cannot be easy till i have so done and i wis well you will not lay to my charge a thing that was no blame of mine sothen he gan to speak of a fashion that little liked me and i am assured should have liked you no better commending my drawing and mine hair and mine eyes and all such matter as that till at the last i said unto him sir i pray you of pardon but i am not used to such like talk and in truth i know not what to answer if your aim be to find favour with me you were best hold your peace from such words for see you mother i thought he might have some petition unto father and might take a fantasy that i could win father to grant him and so would the rather if he talked such matter as should flatter my foolish vanity as though father should be one to be swayed by such a fantasy as that but then of course he did not know father i trust i did not aught to your displeasance mother so far as i can judge dear child thou didst very well saith mother and i am right glad thou wert thus discreet for thy years but what said he in answer oh he tarried not after that quoth she he did only mutter somewhat that methought should be to ask pardon and then went off in another minute mother laid down her work with a glow in her eyes o edith saith she i am so thankful thou art notbut all suddenly she shut up tight and the glow went out of her eyes and into her cheeks i never know what that signifieth and i have seen it to hap aforetime but she took up her sewing again and said no more till she saith all at once right the thing which i desired her not to say did this gentleman speak with thee milly i made my voice as cool and heedless as i could well mother i reckon it was the same that i saw leaning against a tree at the other side of the isle which spake to me and asked me what the isle was called and who saint hubert were he told me the same as edith that he had known you aforetime didst get a poem unto thy sweet eyes milly saith edith laughing nay said i mine eyes be not so sweet as thine did he ask at thee if father were at home ay he asked that herein told i no falsehood for that day he said not a word touching mine eyes then cousin bess looks up cousin bess was by but not aunt joyce what manner of man my lasses saith she i left edith to make answer why saith she i reckon he might be ten years younger than father or maybe more and oh not a young man then saith mother as though she were fain it so were oh nay quoth edith but wellfavoured and of a fair hair and beard and clad of a dark green velvet jerkin saith cousin bess and tawny hose with a rare white feather in s velvet bonnet that is he saith edith good lack then cousin bess makes answer but he up to me only yestermorrow on the keswick road as i come back from isaacs my word but he doth desire for to see sir aubrey some for he asked at us all three if he were at home was he a man thou shouldest feel to trust bess asks mother trust saith she id none trust yon dandified companion not for to sell a suckingpig dear heart but what queer things doth she say at times i would cousin bess were somewhat more civiler to think of a gentleman such as he is aselling of pigs yet i must say i was not oer well pleased to hear of his complimenting of edith though tis true that was ere he had seen me what like is he bess saith mother i would know the thought he gave to thee marry the first were that he was like to have no wife or she should have amended a corner of his rare slashed sleeve that was ravelling forth o the stitching saith she and the second were that he were like the folk in this vicinage with his golden hair and grey eyen and the third that he were not for that his speech was not of these parts and the fourth that his satin slashed sleeves and his silver buckles of his shoes must have cost him a pretty penny and the last that id be fain to see the back of him any more betwixt cousin saith edith laughing eh there was a cartload betwixt saith she i mattered him nought i warrant you well neither did i oer much saith edith dear heart thought i but where were their eyes both twain that they saw not the lovesomeness and gentilesse of that my gallant protection but as for cousin bess she never had no high fantasies all her likings be what the french call bourgeois but i was something surprised that edith should make no count of him i marvel if she meant the same well there must needs be some blunder saith mother when we had sat silent a while for i never knew no man of that name nor no gentleman of cornwall to boot maybe he minds you mother though you knew not him quoth edith soothly saith she there were knights in the court whose names i knew not but if they saw me so much as thrice methinks that were all and never spake word unto me see you now cousin lettice saith bess if this man wanted somewhat of you hed be fain enough to make out that he had known you any way he might ay very like saith mother and if he come up to the door like an honest companion and desire speech of sir aubrey well he may be a decent man for all his slashed sleeves and flying feathers but if not so then i write him down no better than he should be though what he is after it passeth my wit to see i do believe quoth edith alaughing that cousin bess hates every thing that flies what with dr meades surplice and sir edwins long featherverily i would marvel what shall come aflying next nay my lass i love the songbirds as well as any saith cousin bess tis only i am not compatient with matter flying that is not meant to fly if god almighty had meant men and women to fly hed have put wings on them and i never can see why men should deck themselves out o birds feathers without they be poor savages that take coloured beads to be worth so much as gold angels and as for yon surplice tis a rag o poperythats what it is and id as lief tell dr meade so as an other man i did tell mistress meade so t other day but poor soul she could not see it a whit twas but a decent garment that the priest must needs bear and such like and mistress meade says i ill tell you what it is says i you are none grounded well in hebrews says i either dr meades no priest or else the lord isnt says i so you may pick and choose says i eh dear but she looked on me as if id spake some ill words o the queens majestynot a bit less and mistress wolvercot says she what ever do you mean says she well mistress meade says i thats what i meanthat there can be no christian priests so long as christ our lord is alive so if dr meades a priest he must be dead and if so says i why then i dont see how there can be no christians of no sort priests or no says i why mistress wolvercot says she you must have lost your wits well says i some folks has but i dont rightly think im oneand so home i came edith was rarely taken and laughed merrily for me i was so glad to see the talk win round to mistress meade that i was fain to join thou art right bess saith mother why saith she im with paul and hes good company enough for me though maybe being but a tentmaker by trade hed scarce be meet for dr meade i thought wed done with bishops and priests and such like i can tell you when the church were reformed but eh dear theyre a coming up again every bit as bad as them aforetime i cannot see why they kept no bishops lawn sleeves forsooth and rochets and cassocks and them square capstheyre uncommon like the beast i make no count of em and rochets can fly cries edith merrily why cousin bess said i you shall be a brownist in a week or twain nay ill be ruled by the law but i reckon i may call out if it pinches saith she so with mirth we ended the matter and thankful was i when the talk were oer selwick hall november ye xix i do keep my book right needfully locked up for i would not for all the world that nell nor edith should read this last fortnight yester even just as it grew to dusk met i with my protection outside the garden door that would fain win me to meet with him some whither on the hills where said he we might talk more freely but so feared was i to vex father and mother that this i did deny though i could see it vexed him and it went to mine heart to do thus and he asked at me if i loved him not and did very hard press me to say that i would love him for he saith he loveth me better than all the world yet that would i not fully grant him but plagued him a bit thereon tis rare fun plaguing a man but methought i would try this even if i could not wring a fashion of consent out of father without his knowing the same so when none was there but he and i and moses quoth i father is it ever wrong to love any love is of god he made answer surely no and therewith should i have been content and flattered me that i had fathers assent to the loving of my protection but as ill luck would have it he that was going forth of the chamber tarried with the door in his hand to say but mind that it be very love my maid that is not love but unlove which will help a friend to break gods commandments i had liefer he had let that last alone it sticketh in my throat somewhat yet have i fathers consent to loving and surely none need break gods commandments because they love each other tis no breaking thereof for me to meet and talk with sir edwinof that am i as certain as that my name is milisent and i have not told a single lie about it sithence my good protection revealed in mine ear the right way not to tell lies namely should mother ask me milly hast thou seen again that gentleman that i should say out loud no motherand whisper to myself under my breath this morrowthe which should make it perfectly true and right glad was i to hear of this most neat and delicate way of saving the truth and yet not uttering your secrets selwick hall november ye xxii if mistress helena louvaine could ever hold her peace from saying just the very matter that i would give her a broad shilling to be quiet on here now this even when all we were sat in hall what should she begin with but father there is a thing i would ask at you say on my maid quoth he right kindly as his wont is for father is alway ready to counsel us maids whensoever we may desire it then father saith she what is falsehood where doth it begin and end put a case that i am talking with alice lewthwaite and she shall ask me somewhat that i list not to tell her should i commit sin if i told her but the half hardly plain enough my maid saith father as to where falsehood begins and endsit begins in thine heart but where it ends who shall tell but god but set forth thy case something plainer well saith she suppose father that mother or you had showed to me that wat was coming home but had for some cause you wist and i not bidden me not to tell the same if alice should say hast heard aught of late touching wat nell must i say to her plain i cannot answer theethe which should show her there was a secret or should there be no ill to say not today or nought much or some such matter as that should there be any wrong in that father saith edith as though she could not think there should dear hearts saith father i cannot but think a mans heart is gone something wrong when he begins to meddle with casuistry the very minute that adam fell from innocence he took refuge in casuistry there was not one word of untruth in what he said to the lord he was afraid and he did hide himself yet there was deception for it was not all the truthno nor the half as methinks tis alway safest to tell out the plain truth and leave the rest to god jack lewthwaite said once quoth edith that at the grammar school at kendal where he was there was a lad that should speak out to the master that which served his turn and whisper the rest into his cap yet did he maintain stoutly that he told the whole truth what should you call that father a shift got straight from the father of lies he made answer trust me that lad shall come to no good without he repent and change his course then aunt joyce said somewhat that moved the discourse other whither but i had heard enough to make me rare diseaseful when i thought i had hit on so excellent a fashion of telling the truth and yet hiding my secrets to have father say such things came straight from satan it liketh me not at all i would nell would let things abe selwick hall november ye xxiv my good protection tells me tis country fashion to count such matter deceit and should never obtain in the court at all and he asked me if father were not given to be a little puritanhe smiling the while as though to be a puritan were somewhat not over wellliked of the great then i told him that i knew not well his meaning for that word was strange unto me so he said that word puritan was of late come up to denote certain precise folk that did desire for to be better than their neighbours and most of them only to make a talk and get themselves well accounted of by such common minds as should take them at their own appraisement not of course saith he that such could ever be the case with a gentleman of sir audreys worshipfulness and with such an angel in his house to guard him from all ill i did not well like this for i would alway have father right well accounted of and not thought to fall into mean country ways but then gan he to talk of mine eyes which he is ever apraising and after a while i forgat my disease still i cannot right away with what father said if only father and mother could know all about this matter and really consent thereto i would be a deal happier but my protection saith that were contrary unto all custom of lovematters and they must well know the same for in all matters where the elders do wit and order the same themselves tis always stupid and humdrum for the young folks and no romance left therein at all it should suit well with mistress nell saith he from what i do hear touching her conditions disposition but never were meet for the noble and generous soul of my fairest amiability that is far above all such mean things so i reckon if the same always be i must be content and not trouble me touching fathers and mothers knowing but i do marvel if father and mother did the like their own selves for i know they married o love howbeit mother had none elders then living nor father neither now i come to think thereon wherefore with them twas other matter sithence i writ that last come alice and blanche lewthwaite and their robin to fourhours and mighty strange it is how folk be for ever asaying things as though they wist what i were athinking here blanche saith to nell that she would account that no jolly wedding where her elders had ordered all for her but would fain choose for herself i would likewise fain have my choice go along therewith saith nell and so doubtless would every maid nor do i think that any father and mother should desire otherwise but thou signifiest not surely blanche that thou shouldst love to order the whole matter thine own self apart from thine elders pleasure altogether ay but i would saith she it should have a deal better zest it should have a deal less honesty saith nell with some heatheat that is for nell honesty quoth blanche soft you now gentlywhat dishonesty should be therein nay blanche measure such dealing thyself by gods ellwand of the fifth commandment and judge if it were honouring thine elders as he bid thee i do vow nell thou art a puritan by the which i know not what thou meanest saith nell as cool as a marble image why tis a new word of late come up quoth blanche they do call all sad precise humdrum folk puritans who be they asks nell why all manner of folksgreat folk in especial saith she come blanche saith edith where hast thou jostled with great folk an i have not quoth she something hotly i reckon i may have talked with some that have no great folkmy lord dilston exceptever come to derwentside saith edith and could i not discourse with my lord dilston if it so pleased him and me quoth blanche yet something angered come my maids fall not out saith alice thou well wist blanche thou hast had no talk with my lord dilston that is known all oer for the bashfullest and silentest man with women ever was i do marvel how he eer gat wed without his elders did order it for him well at this we all laughed and alice turned the talk aside to other matter for i think she saw that blanches temper which is neer that of an angel were giving way i cannot help to be somewhat diseaseful for it seemeth me as though blanche might hint at sir edwin and i do trust he hath not been aflattering of her she is metely welllookinggood of stature and a fair fresh face grey eyen and fair hair as have the greater part of maids about here but her nose turns up too much for beauty she is not for to compare with me nor edith i must ask at sir edwin tomorrow if he wist aught of blanche if i find him doubletonguedgood lack but methinks i would neer see him no more though it should break mine heartas i cast no doubt it should selwick hall november ye xxv tis all well and blanche could not have meant to hint at my protection i asked at him if he knew one blanche lewthwaite and he seemed fair astonied and said he knew no such an one nor that any of that name dwelt in all the vale then i told him wherefore i had asked it and he said that to think i was jealous of any for him did him uttermost honour and pleasance but did his fairest amiability quo he think he could so much as look on any other face at after hers then i asked at him as i had often desired to wit where he were of a sunday for that he never came to church and he told me that he had an old friend a parson dwelling on winanderside and he did alway abide with him oer the sunday moreover he was something feared saith he to be seen at keswick church lest father should get scent of him wherefore he did deny himself the delight it had been quoth he to feast his eyes on the fair face of his most sweet amiability then said i laughing you did not desire for to see father at the first soft you now saith he and laughed too all is fair in love and war i doubt if father should say the same said i well see you quoth he sir aubrey is a right excellent gentleman yet hath he some precise notions which obtain not at court and in such like company a man cannot square all his dealings by the bible and the parsons without he go out of the world and here away in the country where every man hath known you from your cradle it is easier to ride of an hobby than in town where you must do like other folk or else be counted singular and ridiculous no brave and gallant man would run the risk of being thought singular why fathers notion is right the contrary said i i have heard him to say divers times that tis the cowards which dare not be laughed at and that it takes a right brave man to dare to be thought singular exactly saith he that is right the puritan talk as i had the honour to tell you aforetime you should never hear no gentleman of the court to say no such a thing but said i speak they alway the most truth in the court this seemed to divert him rarely he laughed for a minute as though he should neer give oer my fairest amiability saith he had i but thee in the court as is the only place meet for thee then shouldst thou see how admired of every creature were thy wondrous wit and most incomparable beauties why i dare be sworn on all the books in cumberland thou shouldest be of the queens majestys maids in one weeks time and of the delights and jollities of that life dwelling here in a corner of england thou canst not so much as cast an idea methought that should be right rare selwick hall november ye xxvii with aunt joyce this morrow to visit old nanny crewdson that is brothers widow to isaac and dwelleth in a cot up thirlmere way i would fain have avoided the same an i might for i never took no list in visiting poor folk and sithence i have wist my right noble protection do i take lesser than ever in very deed all relish is gone for me out of every thing but him and the jolly court doings whereof he tells me and i am ever so much happier than i was of old with nought but humdrum matter only that now and then for a short while i am a deal more miserabler i cannot conceive what it is that cometh oer me at those times tis like as if i were dancing on flowers and some unseen hand did now and then push aside the flowers and i saw a great and horrible black gulf underneath and that one false step should cast me down therein nor will any thing comfort me at those times but to talk with my protection that can alway dispel the gloom but the things around that i have been bred up in do grow more and more distasteful unto me than ever howbeit i am feared to show folk the same so when aunt joyce called me to come with her to nanny i made none ado but tied on mine hood and went we found old nannythat is too infirm for aught but to sit of a chair in the sunshineso doing by the window beside her a little table and thereon a great bible open with her spectacles of her nose that she pulled off and wiped and set down of the book to keep her place well nanny saith aunt joyce sitting down under his shadow dear heart ay mistress joyce saith she and with great delight i marvel if old folk do really like to read the bible i never did and the older i grow the lesser doth it like me can they mean it trow if they do then i suppose i shall like it when i am as old as nanny but good lack what gloomsome manner of life must that be wherein one shall find ones diversion in reading of the bible i know father and mother would say clean contrary but they see you were bred up never to see a bible in english till they were grown which is as different as can be to the like of us maids that never knew the day when it lay not of the hall table but therein runs my pen too fast for anstace can well remember queen marys time though nell scarce can do soonly some few matters here and there so then aunt joyce and nan fell atalkingand scarce so much as a word could i conceive note they might wellnigh as good have talked greek for me yet one matter will i set down the which i mean to think oersome time when i am come to divert me with the bible and am as old as nanny not now of course where art reading nanny saith aunt joyce in esaias mistress joyce fiftyeighth chapter first and second verses theres fine reading in esaias ay nan there is saith aunt joyce but what toucheth it i am ill set to remember chapter and verse well mistress first it saith show my people their transgression and i th very next verseyet they seek me dailynay theres morethey take delight in approaching to god well nan that reads strangeno doth it ah it doth mistress joyce but i think look ye theres a deal i th word approaching see ye it saith not they take delight to get near nay folk o that make has a care not to get too near theyll lay down a chalk line and theyll stop outside ont if theyd only come near enough th light d burn up all them transgressions but ye see that wouldnt just suit em these is folk that wants to have th lorda tidy way from emand keep th transgressions too eh mistress but when a man can pray right through th hundred and thirtyninth psalm his hearts middlin perfect wi the lord otherwise hell boggle at them last verses we dont want him to search us when we know hell find yon wedge o gold and yon babylonish garment if he do nay we dont so now i know not oer well what old nan meaneth but this do i know that whenever i turn oer the psalter i ever try to get yon psalm betwixt two leaves and turn them oer both together so that i see not a word ont i reckon nan should say my heart was not perfect by a great way well maybe shed be none so far out selwick hall november ye xxix tomorrow shall be the last day of my month and tuesday even must i give up the book to edith i shall not tear out the leaves till the last minute and i will keep them when i do i do never see nought of my protection of a sunday but all other days meet i him now whenas i can in the little copse that lieth thirlmere way not so far from nannys hut last even was he essaying to win me for to wed him as he hath done afore without father and mother knowing i have ever held off till now but i am not so sure i shall do it much longer he saith he wist a popish priest that should do it and it so done father and mother must needs come in and give us leave to be wed rightly in church but i will consider of the same a day or twain longer as to setting down what we do of a sunday tis alway the same oer again so it should be to no good once is enough for all selwick hall november ye last such a fright have i had this morrow i may scantly hold my pen i set forth for the copse where i do meet with my protection and had wellnigh reached itverily i could discern him coming through the trees to meet mewhen from nannys hut right upon us who should come out save father and mother and edith their own selves i cast but a glint to him that he should not note me and walked on to meet them why milly saith mother i wist not thou wert coming this way child under your pleasure mother no more did i of you said i why milly do but look at yon gentleman saith edith as he passed by us taking no note of us at all is it not the same we met on saint huberts isle is it so said i making believe to look after him the rather since it gave me an excuse to turn my back on them he bears a green jerkinotherwise wherein i am very sure i said no falsity as whatso father might say i do think it is the same saith edith came he ever to speak with you father nay my lass i mind him not saith father he is not illlooking saith mother maybe not quoth father thou art a better judge of such matters than i dear heart i only note the way a mans soul looketh out of his eyes not the colour of the eyes whence it looketh now father under your good leave that is not well said edith makes answer for you have your own self the fairest eyes ever a mans soul looked forth of father laughs at this and doffs his cap merrily your very humble servant mistress editha louvaine quoth he when i do desire to send forth to the world a book of all my beauties learning and virtues i will bid you to write therein touching mine eyes they serve me well to see withal i thank god and beyond that issue have i never troubled me regarding them and how liked you the manner of sir edwin tregarvons soul looking forth father saith edith also laughing why that could i not see quoth he for he keeping his eyes bent upon the ground it did not look forth but i cannot say his face altogether pleased me how mighty strange is it that all theyand in especial father that i have alway reckoned so wiseshould have so little discernment well methought as they were there i must needs come home with them and this afternoon if i can steal hence without any seeing me will i go yet again to the copse to see if i may find my protection for i have wellnigh granted the privy wedding he hath pled so hard for and this morrow we thought to order the inwards thereof settle the details as next sunday at even saith he i am to steal forth of the garden door and he shall meet me in the lane with an hackney and two or three servingmen for guard and so go we forth to ambleside where the priest shall join our hands and then come back and entreat father and mothers pardon and blessing i dare be bound there shall be much commotion and some displeasant speeches but i trust all shall blow oer in time and after all as saith my protection when there is no hope that father and mother should give us leave aforehand what else can we do verily it is a sore trouble that elders will stand thus in young folks way that do love each other and my protection is not so much elder than i in the stead of only ten or fifteen years younger than father he is twentyfive well reckoned having but fourandthirty years and i was twenty my last birthday which is two months gone and if he look as he alloweth something elder than his years it is as he hath told me but trouble and sorrow of which he hath known much my poor protection in good sooth i am sorry for his trouble i shall not tear out my leaves afore i am back and meantime i do keep the book right heedfully under lock and key as for any paying of twopences that is oer for me now so there were no good to reckon them up my noble protection saith when he hath but once gat me safe to the court then shall i have a silken gown every day i do live and jewelling so much as ever i shall desire he will set off his amiability quoth he that all shall see and wonder at her though i count father doth love me yet am i sure my protection loveth me a deal the more tis only fitting therefore that i cleave to him rather now must i go forth and see if i may meet with him note the words understand and conceive have changed places since the days of elizabeth to understand then meant to originate an idea to conceive to realise an imparted thought chapter five aunt joyce spoils the game we shun two paths my maiden when strangers way we tell that which ourselves we know not that which we know too well i never knew thou thinkst it well better so today the years lie thick and mossy oer that longsilent way the roses there are withered the thorns are tipped with pain thou wonderest if i tell thee walk not that way again oh eyes that see no further than this worlds glare and din i warn thee from that pathway because i slipped therein so leave the veil uphanging and tell the world outside she cannot understand me she nothing has to hide in ediths handwriting selwick hall december the first i would have fain let be the records of this sad first day that this chronicle is come to mine hand but father and mother do desire me to set down honestly what hath happed the which therefore i must essay to do it was of long time that i had noted a strange difference in milly and had talked with nell thereabout more than once or twice though milisent is by four years elder than i yet she had alway been the one of us most loving frolicsome merriment but now it seemed me as though she had grown up over my head all at once not that she was less mirthful at times nay rather more if aught but at other times she seemed an other maid and not our milly at all it was not our millys wont to sit with her hands of her lap agazing from the window nor to answer sharp and short when one spake to her nor to appear all unrestful as though she were in disease of mind and at last nell thinking less thereof than i i made up my mind to speak with aunt joyce that i knew was wise and witty sensible and if there were aught gone wrong should take it less hard than mother and could break the same to mother more gentler than we to say truth i was fearedand yet i scarce knew whyof that man we met on saint huberts isle i had noted that milly never named him though he were somewhat cause of mirth betwixt helen and me and when an other so did she seemed as though she essayed to speak as careless as ever she could this liked me not nor did it like me that twice i had met milly coming from the garden and she went red as fire when she saw me from all this i feared some secret matter that should not be and as yestermorrow when we were come from nannys i brake my mind to aunt joyce aunt joyce did not cry pish nor fault me for conceiving foolish fantasies as i was something feared she might on the contrary part she heard me very kindly and heedfully laying down her work to give better ear when i had done she saith tell me edith what like is this man i told her so well as i could and how oft hast thou seen him three times aunt the first on saint huberts isle whereof you know the second i met him once in the lane behind the garden as i was acoming home from isaac crewdsons and the last this morrow just as we came out of nannys door we met milisent full face and a minute at after this sir edwin passed us on the road took he any note of you either time when he met me alone he doffed his cap and smiled but spake not this morrow he took no note of any one could she be going to meet him saith aunt joyce in a low and very troubled voice in good sooth aunt said i you have put into words my very fear which i did scarce dare to think right out edith saith she is milly within or no she was tying on her hood a moment since as though she meant to go forth i saw her through a chink of the door which was not close shut as i passed by come thou with me quickly saith aunt joyce and rose up we will follow her tis no treachery to lay snare for a traitor if it be as i fear and tis not she that is the traitor poor childpoor foolish child we walked quickly for our aim was to keep milisent but just in view yet not to let her see us she was walking fast too and she took the road to nannys but turned off just ere she were there into the little shaw that lieth by the way we followed quietly till we could hear voices then aunt joyce stayed her behind a poplartree and made me a sign to be still all things be now ordered my fairest i heard a voice say which methought was sir edwins and peeping heedfully round the poplar i caught a glimpse of his sideface enough to be sure it were he aunt joyce could see him likewise all things be ordered quoth he remember nine o the clock on sunday night but thou wilt not fail me saith milisents voice in answer fail thee he made answer my sweetest of maids impossible i feel afeared she saith again i would they had wist at home i cannot be sure tis right nay sweet heart call not up these old ghosts i have laid so oft already saith he sir aubreys puritan notions should never suffer him to give thee leave afore but when done he shall right soon oerlook all and all shall go merry as a marriage bell seest thou we do him in truth a great kindness sith he should be feared to give consent and yet would fain so do if his conscience should allow would he asks milly in something a troubled tone would he sir edwin makes answer would he have his daughter a right great lady at the court why of course he would every man would that were not a born fool my honeysweet milisent let not such vain scruples terrify thee they are but shadows i do ensure thee i think thus when i am with thee saith she smiling up in his face but when not sweet heart saith he bending his goodly head not is wellnigh over and then thy cruel puritan scruples shall never trouble thee more it is as we feared i whispered into the ear of aunt joyce whose face was turned from me but when she turned her head i was terrified i never in my life saw aunt joyce look as she did then out of her cheeks and lips every drop of blood seemed driven and her eyes were blazing fire when she whispered back it was through her set teeth as far worse worser than thou wist is this the man this is sir edwin without another word aunt joyce stalked forth and had milisent by the arm ere she found time to scream then she shrieked and shrank but aunt joyce held her fast get you gone was all she said to sir edwin nay mistress tell me rather by what right right aunt joyce loosed her hold of milisent and went and stood right before him rightfrom you to me mistress i cry you mercy but we be entire strangers be we she made answer with more bitterness in her voice than ever i heard therein be we such strangers what think you i know you not leonard norris you counted on the change of all these years to hide you from aubrey and lettice and you counted safely enough they would not know you if they stood here but did you fancy years could hide you from joyce morrell traitor a woman will know the man she has loved though his own mother were to pass him by unnoted sir edwin uttered not a word but stood gazing on aunt joyce as though she had bound him by a spell she turned back to us a moment milisent and edith go home she saith milisent thank god that he hath saved thee from the very jaws of hellfrom a man worser than any fiend edith tell thy father what hath happed but say nought of all this to thy mother i shall follow you anon i have yet more ado with him here make thy mind easy childhell not harm me now go milisent needed no persuasions she seemed as though aunt joyces words had stunned her and she followed me like a dog we spake no word to each other all the way when we reached home milly went straight up to her own chamber and i being mindful of aunt joyces bidding went in search of father whom i found at his books in his closet ah me but what sore work it were to tell him i might scarce bear to see the sorrowful changes wrought in his face but when i came to tell how aunt joyce had called this gentleman by the name of leonard norris for one minute his eyes blazed out like hers then they went very dark and troubled and he hid his face in his hands till i had made an end of my sad story and i would fain not have been she that told you father said i but aunt joyce bade me so to do i must have heard it from some lips daughter he saith sorrowfully but have a care thou say no word to thy mother she must hear it from none but me my poor letticeand my poor milisent my poor foolish duped child i left him then for i thought he would desire it and went up to milly she had cast off her hood and tippet and lay on her bed her face turned to the wall dost lack aught milly said i nay was all she said shall i bide with thee nay nor one word more might i get out of her so i left her likewise and came down to the little parlour where i sat me to my sewing it was about an hour after that i heard aunt joyces firm tread on the gravel she came into the parlour and looked around as though to see who were there then she saith none but thee edith where are the rest there was a break in her voice such as folk have when they have been sore troubled i have been alone this hour aunt milly is in our chamber and father i left in his closet whither mother and nell be i know not hast told him ay and he said only himself must tell mother i knew he would god help her you think she shall take it very hard aunt edith saith aunt joyce softly there is more to take hard than thou wist and we know not well yet all the ill he may have wrought to milisent then away went she and i heard her to rap on the door of fathers closet for me i sat and sewed a while longer and yet none coming i went up to our chamber partly that i should wash mine hands and partly to see what was come of milly she still lay on the bed but her face turned somewhat more toward me and by her shut eyes and even breathing i could guess that she slept i sat me down in the window to wait when mine hands were washen for i thought some should come after a while and maybe should not count it right that i left milisent all alone i guess it were a good halfhour i there sat and milly slept on at the last come mother her eyes very red as though she had wept much doth she sleep edith she whispered i said ay mother she hath slept this halfhour or more poor child she saith if only i could have wist sooner how much i might have saved her o poor child the water welled up in her eyes again and she went away something in haste i had thought mother should be angered and i was something astonied to see how soft she were toward milly a while after aunt joyce come in but milly slept on i am fain to see that saith she nodding her head toward the bed a good sign yet i would i knew exactly how she hath taken it i am afeared she may be angered aunt joyce to be thus served of one she trusted i hope so much twill be the best thing she can be the question is what she lovedwhether himself or his flattering of herself shell soon get over the last for it shall be nought worser with her than hurt vanity not the first aunt i do not know edith she saith and crushed in her lips that hangs on what sort of woman she be there shall be a wound in either case but with some it gets cicatrised over and sound again with time and with other some it tarries an open issue for ever it hangs all on the manner of woman what should it be with you aunt joyce said i though i were something feared of mine own venturesomeness what it is edith she made answer crushing in her lips again is the open issue bandaged oer so that none knows it is there save he to whose eyes all things be open child there be some things in life wherein the only safe confidant thou canst have is jesu christ i say so much by reason that thine elders think it bestand i likewisethat ye maids should be told somewhat more than ye have heard aforetime ay i give full assent thereto i only held out for one thingthat i not your mother should be she that were to tell it we were silent a moment and then milisent stirred in her sleep aunt joyce went to her awake my dear heart saith she milly sat up and pushed aside her hair from her face the which was flushed and sullen aunt joyce may the lord forgive you for this days work saith she i was fair astonied that she should dare thus to speak but aunt joyce was in no wise angered amen she saith as softly as might be spoken had i no worser sins to answer for methinks i should stand the judgment no worser milisent blazed forth what you think it a light matter to part two hearts that love well and truly nay truly i think it right solemn matter saith aunt joyce still softly and if aught graver can be milly it is to part two whereof the one loveth well and the othermay god forgive us all what mean you now saith milisent of the same fashion is it my love you doubt or his milisent louvaine saith aunt joyce if thou be alive twenty years hence thou shalt thank god from thy very heartroot that thou wert stayed on that road today oh ay that is what folk always say murmurs she and laid her down again thou wilt thank me twenty years hence quoth they every stinging stroke of the birch and they look for us beaten hounds to crede it forsooth aywhen the twenty years be over i am little like to thank you at twenty years end saith milly sullenly for i count i shall die of heartbreak afore twenty weeks no milly i think not and much you care then i saw aunt joyces face alterterribly milisent she said if i had not cared i should scantly have gone of set purpose through that which wrung every fibre of my heart ay to the hearts core it wrung me more than you milisent makes answer of the same bitter angered tone as aforetime aunt joyce turned away from the bed and i saw pain and choler strive for a moment in her eyes then the choler fell back and the pain abode poor child she cannot conceive it she said nought sterner and she came and sat in the window alongside of me i tell you aunt joyceand milisent sat up again and let herself down and came and stood before usi tell you you have ruined my life my maid aunt joyce makes answer with sore trouble in her voice thine elders will fain have thee and thy sisters told a tale the which we have alway kept from you until now it was better hidden unless you needed the lesson but now they think it shall profit thee and maybe save helen and edith from making any like blunder andwell i have granted it only i stood out for one pointthat i myself should be the one to tell it you wait till thou hast heard that story the which i will tell thee tomorrow and at after thou hast heard it then tell me milly whether i cared for thee this morrow or whether the hand that hath ruined thy life were the hand of joyce morrell oh but you were cruel cruel sobbed milly i loved him so so did i milisent saith aunt joyce very softly long ere you maids were born loved him so fondly trusted him so wholly clung to him so faithfully that mine eyes had to be torn open before i would see the truththat even now after all these years it is like thrusting a dagger into my soul to tell you verily who and what he is ay child i loved that man in mine early maidenhood better than ever thou didst or wouldst have done dost thou think it was easy to stand up to the face that i had loved and to play the avenging angel toward his perfidy if thou dost thou mayest know much of foolishness and fantasy but very little of true and real love milisent seemed something startled and cowed then all suddenly she saithbut aunt joyce he told me he were only of fourandthirty years aunt joyce laughed bitterly wert so poor an innocent as to crede that milly saith she he is a year elder than thy father but i grant he looks by far younger than he is and i reckon he bated ten years or so of what he looked he alway looked young she saith the softened tone coming back into her voice men with fair hair like his mostly do until all at once they break into aged men and he hath kept him well with washes and unguents it was strange to hear how the softness and the bitterness strave together in her voice i count it were by reason they so strave in her heart wait till tomorrow milly saith aunt joyce arising thou shalt hear then of my weary walk through the thorns and judge for thyself if i had done well to leave thee to the like milly sobbed again but methought something more softly we were to have been wed o sunday even saith she by a popish priest right as good as in churchand then to have come home and won father and mother to forgive us and bless us then all had been smooth and sweet and we should have lived happy ever after oh but what pitifulness was there in aunt joyces smile should you saith she in a tone which seemed to me like the biggest nay ever printed in a book poor innocent child a popish priest cannot lawfully wed any and evening is out of the canonical hours wist thou not that such marriage should neer have held good in law it might have been good in gods sight trow saith she something perversely nay saith aunt joyce when men go to of set purpose to break the laws of their countrywithout it be in obedience to his plain commandi see not how the lord shall hold them guiltless so he promised to bring thee home to ask pardon did he poor trusting deluded child thou shouldst never have come home millyunless it had been a year or twain hence a forlorn heartbroken wretched thing well we could have forgiven thee and comforted thee thenas we will now i am right weary awriting and will stay mine hand till i set down aunts story tomorrow selwick hall december ye second i marvel when i can make an end of writing or when matters shall have done happening for early this morrow ere breakfast were well over come a quick rap of the door which caitlin opened and in come alice lewthwaite not a bit like herself looked she with a scarf but just cast oer her head and all out of breath as though she had come forth all suddenly and had run fast and far we had made most of us an end of eating but were yet sat at the table alice dear heart what aileth thee saith mother and rose up lady lettice do pray you tell me panteth she if you have seen or heard aught of our blanche nay alice in no wise saith mother lack the day quoth she then our fears be true what fears dear heart i think father and mother and aunt joyce asked at her all together i would as lief say nought saving to my lady and mistress joyce she saith so they bare her away and what happed at that time i cannot say saving that father himself took alice home and did seem greatly concerned at her trouble well this was scantly oer ere a messenger come with a letter to mother whereon she had no sooner cast her eyes than she brake forth with a cry of pleasure then father desiring to know what it were she told us all that certain right dear and old friends of hers the which she had not seen of many years were but now at the salutation inn at ambleside and would fain come on and tarry a season here if it should suit with mothers conveniency to have them and right fain should i be saith she and so said father likewise then mother told us who were these her old friends to wit sir robert stafford and his lady which was of old time one mistress dulcibel fenton of far kin unto my lady norris that was mothers mistress of old days at minster lovel and moreover one mistress martin a widow that is sister unto sir robert and was mothers fellow when she served my dearworthy lady of surrey so father saith he would ride oer himself to ambleside and give them better welcome than to send but a letter back and mother did desire her most loving commendations unto them all and bade us all be hasteful and help to make ready the guestchambers so right busy were we all the morrow and no time for no tales of no sort but in the afternoon when all was done aunt joyce had us three up into her chamber and bade us sit and listen for it is a sorrowful story i have to tell saith she and added as though she spake to herselfay and it were best got oer ere dulcie cometh so we sat all in the windowseat milly in the midst and aunt joyce afore us in a great cushioned chair when i was of your years milly saith she i dweltwhere i now do at minster lovel with my father and my sister anstace our mother was dead and our baby brother walter and of us there had never been more but we had two cousinsone aubrey louvaine the son of our mothers sisteryou wot who he is she saith and smiled and the other the son of our fathers sister dwelt at oxford with his mother a widow and his name wasleonard norris the name was so long acoming that i marvelled if she meant to tell us i do not desire to make my tale longer than need is dear hearts pursueth she and therefore i will but tell you that in course of time with assent of my father and his mother my cousin leonard and i were trothplight i loved him methinks as well as it was in woman to love man andi thought he loved me i never knew a man who had such a tongue to cajole a womans heart he could talk in such a fashion that thou shouldst feel perfectly assured that he loved thee with all his heart and none but thee and ere the sun had set he should have given the very same certainty to nan at the farm and to mall down in the glen i believe he did rarely make love to so little as one woman at once he likedhe once told your father so mucha choice of strings for his bow but of all this at first lost in my happy love i knew nothing my love to him was so true and perfect that the very notion that his could be lesser than so never entered mine head it was anstace who saw the clouds gathering before any otheranstace to whom in her helpless suffering god gave a strange power of reading hearts there came a strange maiden on the scenea beautiful maiden with fair eyes and gleaming hairand leonards heart was gone from me for ever gonehad it ever come i cannot tell maybe some little corner of his heart was mine once on a timei doubt if i had more he had every corner and every throb of mine howbeit when this maid how was she called aunt joyce saith milly in rather an hard voice aunt joyce did not make answer for a moment and looking up on her i saw drawn brows and flushed cheeks never mind that milly i shall call her mary it was not her name well when this maid first came to visit us and i brought her above to my sister that as ye know might never arise from the couch whereon she layi something marvelled to see how quick from her face to mine went anstace eyes and back again to her i knew long after what had been her thought she had no faith in leonard and she guessed quick enough that this face should draw him away from me she tried to prepare me as she saw it coming but i was blind and deaf i shut mine eyes tight and put my fingers in mine ears i would not face the cruel truth for mary herself i am well assured she meant me no ill nor did she see that any ill was wrought till all were oer she did but divert her with leonards words caring less for him than for them she was vain and loved flatteries and he saw it and gave her them by the bushel she was a child laking with a firebrand and never knew what it were until she burnt her fingers and at last maids mine eyes were forced open leonard himself told me and in so many words what i had refused to hear from othersthat he loved well enough the gold that was like to be mine but he did not love me there were bitter words on both sides but mine were bitterest and so at last we parted i could show you the flag on which he stood when i saw his face for the last timethe last until i saw it yestermorrow others had seen him and knew him not through the changes of years even your father did not know him though they had been bred up wellnigh as brothers but mine eyes were sharper i had not borne that face in mine heart and seen it in my dreams for all these years that i should look on him and not know it i knew the look in his eyes the poise of his head the smile on his lips too welltoo well i reckon that between that day and this a thousand women may have had that smile upon them but i thought of the day when i had itwhen it was the one light of life to mefor i had not then beheld the light of the world milly didst thou think me cruel yestermorrowcold and hard and stern ah men do think a woman soand women at times likewisethink her words hard when she has to crush her heart down ere she can speak any word at allthink her eyes icy cold when behind them are a storm of passionate tears that must not be shed then and she has to keep the key hard turned lest they burst the door open ah young maids you look upon me as who should say that i am an old woman from whom such words are strange to you they be fit only for a young lasss lips forsooth childre you wis not yet that the hot love of youth is nought to be compared to the yearning love of agethat the maid that loveth a man whom she first met a month since cannot bear the rushlight unto her that has shrined him in her heart for thirty years aunt joyce tarried a moment and drew a long breath then she saith in a voice that was calmer and lower anstace told me i loved not the leonard that was but only he that should have been but i have prayed god day and night and i will go on yet praying that the man of my love may be the leonard that yet shall bethat some day he may turn back to god and me and remember the true heart that poured all that love upon him if it be so let the lord order how and where and when for if i may know that it is when i come into his presence above i can finish my journey here without the knowledge but it were better to know it aunt joyce saith helen tenderly methinks the tale had stirred her heart very much it were happier nelly quoth aunt joyce softly god knoweth whether it were best if it be so he will give it meand now is the hardest part of my tale to tell for after a while milly thismarycame to see what leonard meant and methinks she came about the same time to the certainty that she loved one who was not leonard when he had parted from me he sought her and there was much bitterness betwixt them at the last she utterly denied him and shut the door betwixt him and her for the which he never forgave her but at a later time when in the persecutions under king henry she came into his power he used her as cruelly as he might then dare to go i reckon had it been under queen mary he should have been content with nought less than her blood but it pleased the good lord to deliver her he getting him entangled in some briars of politics that you should little care to hear and so when she was freed forth of prison he was shut up therein then aunt joyce is he a papist saith helen of a startled fashion ay nell he is a black papist when we all came forth of babylon he tarried therein and what came of her you called mary if it please you aunt quoth i she was wed to one that dwelt at a distance from those parts edith saith aunt joyce in the constrained tone wherein she had begun her story and sithence then have i heard at times of leonard though never meeting himbut alway as of one that was journeying from bad to worsewinning hearts and then breaking them since queen elizabeth came in howbeit heard i never word of him at all and i knew not if he were in life or no till i set eyes on his face yesterday we were all silent till aunt joyce saith gently well millyshould we have been more kinder if we had let thee alone to break thine heart thinkest it runneth not to a certainty that mine should be broke because others were mutters milly stubbornly thou countest then that he which had been false to a thousand maids should be true to the one over saith aunt joyce with a pitying smile well such a thing may be possibleonce in a thousand times hardly oftener methinks my child but none is so blind as she that will not see i must leave the lord to open thine eyesfor i wis he had to do it for me and aunt joyce rose up and went away i marvel who it were she called mary said i essay not to guess dear heart saith helen quickly tis plain aunt joyce would not have us know why she told us or as good quoth milisent in that bitter fashion she hath had today and yesterday said she not at the first that it were well to get the tale oer ere dulcie should come tis my lady stafford of course i am not so sure of that saith helen in a low voice and methought she had guessed at some other but would not say out note i think we were better to go down now so down went we all to the great chamber and there found with mother mistress lewthwaite that was as was plain to see in a mighty taking much agitated dear heart lady lettice but i never looked for this she crieth wiping of her eyes with her kerchief i wis we have been less stricter than you in breeding up our maids but to think that one of them should bring this like of a misfortune on us for blanche is gone to be undone of that am i sure truth to tell yonder sir francis everett so took me with his fine ways and goodly looks and comely apparel and wellchosen wordsay and my master toothat we never thought to caution the maids against him now it turns out that alice had some glint of what were passing but she never betrayed blanche thinking it should not be to her honour and mewhy i neer so much as dreamed of any ill in store what name said you quoth mother that was trying to comfort her everett saith she sir francis everett he said his name were of woodbridge in the county of suffolk where he hath a great estate and spendeth a thousand pound by the year and a welllooked man he was not oer young belike but rare goodly his hair fair and his eyen shining greysomewhat like to yours my lady helen and i looked on each other and i saw the same thought was in both our minds and looking then upon mother i reckoned it had come to her likewise at milisent i dared not look though i saw helen glance at her and now continueth mistress lewthwaite here do i hear that at grasmere farm he gave out himself to be one master tregarvon of devon and up in borrowdale he hath been playing the gallant to two or three maids by the name of sir thomas brooke of warwickshire and the saints know which is his right one hes a bad one lady lettice and after all here is your mistress bess she saith she is as sure as that her name is wolvercot that no one of all these names is his own she reckons him to be some young gentleman that she once wist down in the shiresmarry what said she was his name now i cannot just call to mind she should neer have guessed at him quoth she but she saw him do somewhat this young man were wont to do and were something singular thereini mind not what it were dear heart but this fray touching our blanche hath drove aught else out of mine head but mistress bess said he were a bad one and no mistake is blanche gone off with him mistress lewthwaite saith helen that is right what she is nell and ill luck go with her quoth mistress lewthwaite for it will that know i god shall never bless no undutiful childreof that am i well assured nay friend curse not your own child saith mother with a little shudder eh poor lass i never meant to curse her quoth she shell get curse enough from him shes gone withal she has made her bed and she must lie on it and a jolly hard one it shall be by my troth here come cousin bess and aunt joyce into the chamber and a deal more talk was had of them all but at the last mistress lewthwaite rose up and went away but just ere she went saith she to milisent and me that were sat together of one side of the chamber eh my maids but you twain should thank god and your good father and mother for if you had been bred up with less care this companion whatso his name be should have essayed to beguile you as i am a cumberland woman a pair of comely young lasses like you should have been a great catch for him i reckon ah mistress mine saith cousin bess when lasses take as much care of their own selves as their elders of them we shall catch larks by the sky falling i reckon you are right mistress bess saith she and so away hied she no sooner was mistress lewthwaite gone than mother saithbess who didst thou account this man to be mistress lewthwaite saith thou didst guess it to be one thou hadst known down in the shires but she had forgat the name i saw cousin bess look toward aunt joyce with a question in her eyes and if ever i read english in eyes what aunts said washave a care then cousin bess saith very quiet it was a gentleman in oxford town cousin lettice that i was wont to hear of from our nell when she dwelt yonder oh so saith mother and thus the matter ended but at after in the even when father and aunt joyce and i were by ourselves a little season in the hall i heard aunt joyce say very soft aubrey didst thou give her the name methought father shook his head i dared not joyce saith he she was so sore troubled touching the other matter i thought so quoth aunt then i will beware that i utter it not but edith knows answereth father in a low voice the maids all know saith she i did not reckon thou wouldest keep it from her i should not butand father paused thou wist joyce how she setteth her heart on all things i am afeared aubrey she shall have to know sooner or later mistress lewthwaite did all but utter it to her this morning only i thank god her memory failed her just at the right minute we were better to tell her than that saith father and leaned his head upon his hand as though he took thought then mother and helen came in and no more was said selwick hall december the fourth i had no time to write yestereven for we were late abed it being nigh nine o the clock ere we came up and all the day too busy my lady stafford and sir robert and mistress martin did return with fatherthe which i set not down in his right place at my last writingand yesterday we gat acquaint and showed them the vicinage and such like as tomorrow mother shall carry them to wait on my lord dilston sir robert stafford is a personable gentleman much of fathers years his nose something high yet not greatly so and his hair and beard now turning grey but have been dark mistress martin his sister that when mother wist her was mistress grissel stafford is much like to him in her face but some years the younger of the twain though her hair be the greyer my lady stafford howbeit hath not a grey hair of her head and hath more ruddiness of her face than mistress martin being to my thought the comelier dame of the twain mother nathless saith that mistress grissel was wont to be the fairer when all were maids and that she hath wist much trouble the which hath thus consumed her early lovesomeness for her husband captain martin that was an officer of calais coming home after that town was lost in queen marys time was attaint of heresy and taken of bishop bonner he lying long in prison and should have been brent at the stake had not queen marys dying under gods gracious ordering saved him therefrom and all these months was mistress martin in dread disease never knowing from one week to another what should be the end thereof and indeed he lived not long after but two or three years sir robert stafford on the other part was a wiser man for no sooner was it right apparent on queen marys incoming how matters should turn than he and his dame and their two daughters gat them over seas and dwelt in foreign parts all the days that queen mary reigned and in dutchland germany were both their daughters wedded the one unto a noble of that country by name the count of rothenthal and the other unto a priest an englishman that took refuge also in those parts by name master francis digby that now hath a living in somerset medoubteth if mother be told who sir edwin tregarvon were milly bideth yet in the sulks and when she shall come thereout will i not venture to guess alice lewthwaite come over this afternoon but for a moment on her way to her aunts mistress rigg and saith no word is yet heard of their blanche whom her father saith he will leather while he can lay on if she do return while her mother is all for killing the fatted calf and receiving her back with welcome selwick hall december the v this morrow we set forth for lords island a goodly companyto wit father and mother and sir robert and my lady stafford and mistress martin and milisent and me too many were we for adam to row and thought to take old matthias had not robin lewthwaite chanced on us the last minute and craved leave to take an oar saying it should be a jolly pleasance for him to spend the day on lords island so father took the second oar and adam steered and all we got well across thanks to god we landed father gave his hand to my lady stafford and sir robert to mother and robin pulling a face at milly and me for i wis well he had liever have been with us his to mistress martin well edith saith milly the pleasantest she hath spoken of late i reckon i must be thy cavaliero will you have my cap milisent saith robin oer his shoulder thanks i reckon i shall manage without quoth she well have a care you demean yourself as a cavaliero should saith he tell her she is the fairest maid in all the realm and you shall die o despair an you get not a glance from her sweet eyes nay ill leave that for you saith milly good i will do mine utmost to mind it the next opportunity quoth robin so with mirth come we up to dilston hall my lord was within said the old servingman and so likewise were mistress jane and mistress cicely so he led us across the hall that is set with divers coloured stones of a fashion they have in italy and into a pleasant chamber where mistress cicely was sat at her frame awork and rose up right lovingly to welcome us mistress jane said she was in the garden but my lord come in the next minute and was right pleasant unto us after his sad and bashful fashion for never saw i a man like him as bashful as any maid then mistress jane come anon and bare usto wit milisent and meaway to her own chamber where she gave us sweet cakes and muscadel and mistress cicely came too and a jolly time should we have had had it not come into mistress cicelys head to ask at us if it were true that blanche lewthwaite was gone away with some gallant i had need to say ay for milisent kept her mouth close shut and who were he quoth mistress jane i answered that so far as we heard he had passed by divers names all about this vicinage but the name whereby he had called himself at mere lea which is master lewthwaites was everett i warrant you jane saith mistress cicely tis the same everett farmer benson was so wroth with for making up to his margaret he said if ever he came nigh his house again he should go thence with a bullet more than he brought a man past his youth was he edith with fair shining hairno grey in itand mighty sweet spoken ay that is he said i or i mistake madam dear heart but what an ill one must he be quoth mistress jane why he made old nannys granddaughter doll reckon he meant to wed her and promised to give her a silver chain for her neck this next sunday all this while sat milisent still and spake never a word i gat discourse turned so soon as ever i might then after a little while went we down to hall and good mirth was had of the young gentlewomen with robin and me but all the while milisent very still so that at last mistress cicely noted it and asked her if her head ached she said ay and she looked like it so soon after came we thence and crossed the lake again and so home milly yet very silent all the even not as though she sulked as of late but rather as though she meditated right sadly selwick hall december ye vii this morrow i being in aunt joyces chamber helping her to lay by the newwashed linen come milisent in very softly aunt joyce she saith i would fain have speech of you shall i give thee leave go away and leave you milly said i arising for i was knelt of the floor before the bottom drawer nay edith she makes answer thou knowest my faults and it is but meet thou shouldst hear my confession her voice choked somewhat and aunt joyce saith lovingly dost think then thou hast been foolish dear child i can hardly tell about foolish aunt saith she casting down her eyes but methinks i have been sinful will you forgive me mine hard words and evil deeds ay dear heart right willingly and i shall not gainsay thee milly saith aunt joyce sadly for the thought of foolishness is sin and god calls many a thing sin whereof we men think but too lightly yet bethink thee that if any man sin we have an advocate with the father now dear heart if thou wilt be ruled by me thou wilt arise and go to thy father and thy mother and say to them right as did the prodigal that thou hast sinned against heaven and in their sight i think neither of them is so much angered as sorrowful and pitying yet if there be any anger in them trust me that were the way to disarm it come back millyfirst to god and then to them thou shalt find fatherly welcome from either milly still hid her face aunt joyce she saith i dare not say i have come back to god for i have been doubting this morrow if i were ever near him but i think i have come so now i may go to father and mother aunt joyce kissed her lovingly and carried her off of course i know not what happed betwixt father and mother and milly but i know that milly looks a deal happier and yet sadder graver than she hath done of many days and that both father and mother be very tender unto her as to one that had been lost and is found note helen guessed rightly as the readers of lettice eden will know the mary of the tale was her mother chapter six christmas cheer then opened wide the barons hall to vassal tenant serf and all all hailed with uncontrolled delight and general voice the happy night that to the cottage as the crown brought tidings of salvation down scott in ediths handwriting selwick hall december ye x here have i been athinking i should scantly write a word when my month was come and already with but ten days thereof have i filled half as much paper as either helen or milisent but in good sooth i do trust the next ten days shall not be so full of things happening as these last nathless i do love to have things happen after a fashion but i would have them to be alway pleasant things and when things happen they be so oft unpleasant now if one might order ones own life methinks it should be a right pleasant thing for i reckon i should not go afooling like as some lasses do mine head is not all stuffed with gallants nor yet with velvet and gold but i would love to be great not great like a duchess just a name and no more but to make a name for myself and to have folks talk of me how good and how clever i were that is what i would fain be thoughtgood and clever i take no care to be thought fair nor in high place howbeit i desire not to be ugly nor no lower down than i am but i am quite content with mine own place only i feel within me that i could do great things and how can a woman do great things without she be rare high in place such like as the queens majesty or my lady duchess of suffolk or how could i ever look to do great things here in derwent dale oh i do envy our wat and ned by reason they can go about the world and oer the seas and make themselves famous and somehow in a womans life everything seems so little tis just cooking and eating washing linen and soiling of it going to bed and rising again always doing things and then undoing them and alway the same things over and over again it seems as if nought would ever stay done if one makes a new gown tis but that it may be worn out and then shall another be wanted i would the world could give oer going on and every thing getting worn out and done with other folks do not seem to feel thus i reckon helen never does not one bit some be so much easier satisfied than other i count them the happiest i cannot tell how it is but i do never feel satisfied tis as though there were wings within me that must ever of their nature be stretching upward and onward where should they end an they might go forward would there be any end can one be satisfied ever i believe anstace and helen are satisfied but then tis their nature to be content with things as they be i do not know about mother and aunt joyce i misdoubt if it be altogether their nature but then neither do they seem always satisfied father doth so and his nature is high enough i think i shall ask father as for cousin bess an i were to ask at her she should conceive me never a whit tis her nature to cook and darn and scour and to look complacently on her cake and her mended hole and her cleaned chamber and never trouble herself to think that they shall lack doing oer again tomorrow chambers are like to need cleansing and what were women made for save to keep them clean that is cousin bess right out for master stuyvesant methinks he is right the other way and rather counts the world a dirty place and full of holes that there shall be no good in neither cleansing nor mending and i look not on matters in that light methinks it were better to cleanse the chamber if only one could keep it from being dirtied at after i shall see what father saith selwick hall december the xii yester even as we were sat in the great chamberthere was mother and helen at their wheels and aunt joyce and my lady stafford asewing and mistress martin and milisent and me at the broidery and father had but just beat sir robert in a game of the chess and mynheer one foot upon his other knee was deep in a great book which thereon restedand fresh logs were thrown of the fire by kate which sent forth upward a shower of pleasant sparkles and methought as i glanced around the chamber that all looked rare pleasant and comfortable and we ought to thank god therefore when all had been silent a short while out came i with my question wellnigh ere i myself wist it were out father are you satisfied a mighty question my maid saith hewhile helen looked up in surprise and aunt joyce and mistress martin and milisent fell alaughing with what the past the present or the future quoth father with things father said i with life and every thing ah edith hast thou come to that saith my lady stafford and she exchanged smiles with mother daughter father makes answer methinks no man is ever satisfied with life until he be first satisfied with god the furthest he can go in that direction is not to think if he be satisfied or no a man may be well pleased with lesser things but to be satisfied that can he not whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again quoth mother softly ay saith sir robert and wit you mistress edith what cometh at times to men adrift of the ocean when all their fresh water is spent why surely they should find water in plenty in the sea sir said i right so do they saith he and tis a quality of the seawater that if a man athirst doth once taste the same his thirst becometh so great that he drinketh thereof again and again the thirst worsening with every draught until at last it drives him mad an apt image of the pleasures of this world answers father ah how is all nature as gods picturebook given to help his dull childer over their tasks but fathersaid i and stayed well my maid he answers of his kindly fashion i cry you mercy father if i speak foolishly but it seems me that pious folk be not alway satisfied they make as much fume as other folk when things go as they would not have them the angels do not so i reckon saith mynheer alooking up we are not angels yet quoth father a little drily truth my maid and we ought to repent thereof seeing such practices but too oft cause the enemy to blaspheme and put stumblingblocks in the way of weak brethren ay and from what we read in gods word it should seem as though all murmuring and repiningnot sorrowing mark thou but murmuringwent for far heavier sin in his eyes than it doth commonly in ours we count it a light matter if we grumble when things go awry and matters do seem as if they were bent on turning forth right as we would not have them let us remember for ourselves that such displeaseth the lord he reckons it unbelief and mistrust how long saith he unto moses will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me howbeit as for our neighbours we need not judge them and indeed such matters depend much on mens complexions note and some find it a deal easier to control them than other and after all edith there is a sense wherein no man can ever be fully satisfied in this life we were meant to aspire and if we were entirely content with present things then should we grovel to submit cheerfully is one thing to be fully gratified so that no desire is left is an other we shall not be that methinks till we reach heaven shall we so even there saith sir robert it hath alway seemed to me that when diogenes did define his gods as they that had no wants he pointed to a very miserable set of creatures is it not human nature that the thing present shall fall short of the thing prospective the in posse is better than the in esse saith father well it should seem so in this dispensation but how in the next world our powers may be extended and our souls in some degree suffer change that we can be fully satisfied and yet be alway aspiringi reckon we cannot now understand i only gather from scripture that it shall be thus you and i know very little robin of what shall be in heaven ah truetrue saith sir robert it hath struck me at times saith father that while it may seem strange to the young and eager soul yet it is better understood as one grows olderhow the account of heaven given us in scripture is nearly all in negations god and ourselves are the two matters positive the rest are nays there shall be no pain no crying no sorrow no night no death no curse and though youth would oft have it all yea yet nay suits age the better an old man and weary feels the thought of active bliss at times too much for him it wearies him to think of perpetual singing and constant flying it is rest he needsit is peace well father saith milisent looking up i hope it is not wicked of me but i never did enjoy the prospect of sitting of a cloud and singing hallelujah for ever and ever right what i was wont to think at thy years milly saith mother alaughing dear hearts saith father there is in gods word a word for the smallest need of every one of us if we will only take the pain to search and find it there they had no rest day neither night cranmers version of revelations chapter four verse that is for the eager active soul that longs to be up and doing and they rest from their laboursthat is for the weary heart that is too tired for rapture yet doth not that latter class of texts think you saith sir robert refer mainly to the rest of the body in the grave well it may be so answers father yet look you the rest of the grave must be something that will rest us what is thy notion aubrey saith aunt joyce of the state of the soul betwixt death and resurrection my notion joyce saith father is that scripture giveth us no very plain note thereon i conclude therefore that it shall be time to know when we come to it this only do i seethat all the passages which speak thereof as sleep forgetfulness and the like be in the old testament and all thosenay let me correct myselfmost of those which speak thereof as of a condition of conscious bliss being with christ and so are in the new there i find the matter and there under your good pleasure will i leave it well that should seem quoth aunt joyce as if the condition of souls had been altered by the coming of our lord by his death rather as methinks if so be it may be so i dare not be positive either way has it never seemed strange to you louvaine saith sir robert how little we be told in gods word touching all those mysteries whereon mens minds will ever be busying themselvesto all appearance so long as the world lasts this matter of our talkthe origin of evilfreewill and sovereign graceand the like why are we told no more why saith father with that twinkle in his eyes which means fun i am one of the meaner intelligences of the universe and i wis not if you can find any whither the angel gabriel you may ask at him if he can untie your knots now aubrey that is right what mads me breaks in aunt joyce sir robert asks why we be told no more and thine answer is but to repeat that we be told no more do man give a plain answer to a plain question nay now thou aft like old lawyer pearson quoth father i wis not master saith the witness ay but will you swear saith he why quoth the witness how can i swear when i wis not nay but you must swear one way or an other saith he under thy leave joyce i do decline to swear either way seeing i wis not aunt joyce gives a little stamp of her foot what on earth is the good of men when they wit no more than women quoth she whereat all laughed ah some women have great wits saith father give oer thy mocking aubrey answers she tell us plain what notion thou hast and be not so strict tied to chapter and verse of what worth shall then be my notions well saith father i have given them on the one matter as for the origin of evil i find the origin of mine evil in mine own heart and no further can i get except to satan ay but i would fain reach over satan saith she that shall we not do without satan overreaching us quoth father well thenas to freewill and grace i find both whosoever will take of the water of lifeand yet will ye not come unto me that ye might have life but also i find no man can come to me except the father draw him and that faith cometh not of yourselves it is the gift of god come tarry not there saith aunt joyce how dost thou reconcile them why i dont reconcile them quoth he ay but do she makes answer well saith he if thou wilt come and visit me joyce an hundred years hence at the sign of the burntsacrifice in amethyst lane in the new jerusalem i will see if i can do it for thee then aubrey louvaine saith aunt joyce thou art not yet there he answers i am fully aware of it the wearifullest tease ever i saw when it liketh thee saith she dost thou know joyce quoth mother laughing merrily i found out that afore i was wed he did play right cruelly on mine eagerness once or twice good lack then why didst thou wed him saith aunt joyce mother laughed at this and father made a merry answer which turned the discourse to other matter and were not worth to set down so we gat not back to our sad talk but all ended with mirth this morrow come oer robin lewthwaite with a couple of rare fowl and his mothers loving commendations for mother he saith nothing is yet at all heard of their blanche and he shook his head right sorrowfully when i asked at him if he thought aught should be it seemed so strange a thing to see robin sorrowful selwick hall december ye xvi this morrow my lady stafford aunt joyce and i were sat at our work alone in the great chamber milly was gone with mother avisiting poor folk and sir robert and mistress martin with helen for guide were away towards thirlmeremy lady stafford denying to go withal by reason she had an ill rheum catched yesterday amongst the snowy lanes all at once up looks my lady and she saith joyce what is this i heard yestereven of old mall crewdson touching one everett or tregarvonshe wist not rightly which his name werethat hath done a deal of mischief in these parts of late what manner of mischieffor old mary was very mysterious maybe i do not well to ask afore edith ay dulcie well enough saith aunt joyce sadly for edith knows the worst she can already and if you knew the worst you could why what is it quoth she leonard saith aunt joyce curtly leonard every drop of blood seemed gone out of my ladys face i thought he was dead years gone so did not i aunt joyce made low answer no i wis thou never didst saith my lady tenderly so thy love is still alive joyce poor heart my heart is she saith as for love it is poor stuff if it can die there is a deal of poor stuff abroad then quoth her ladyship in very deed so it is so he is yet at his old work aunt joyce only bent her head well it were not possible to wish he had kept to the new pursueth she i do fear there were some brent in smithfield that had been alive at this day but for him but ever since queen mary died hath he kept him so quiet that in very deed i never now reckoned him amongst the living where is he now god wot saith aunt joyce huskily my lady was silent awhile and then she saith well maybe better so but joyce doth lettice know that tregarvon were he not without aubrey hath told her these last ten days and her face saith not so no it doth not my lady makes answer but sir aubrey wist then his face is not wont to talk unless he will in no wise saith aunt joyce ay dulcibel i had to tell him thou saith my lady pityingly none knew him but me made she answer and her voice grew very troubled not even aubrey nor lettice bess guessed at him after awhile but not till she had seen him divers times but for me one glimpse was enough aunt joyces work was still now hadst thou surmised aforetime that it were he aunt joyce shook her head no need for surmising dulcie she said if i were laid in my grave for a year and a day i should know his step upon the mould above me my poor joyce softly quoth my lady stafford even god hath no stronger word than passing the love of women yet a womans love lasts not out to that in most cases her heart lasts not out thou meanest saith aunt joyce hearts are weak dulcie but love is immortal and hast thou still hopefor him joyce answereth my lady i lost the last atom of mine years gone hope of his ultimate salvation ayas long as life lasts i shall give over hoping for it when i see it but saith my lady slowly as though she scarce liked to say the same how if thou never wert to see it between the stirrup and the ground mercy i sought mercy i found thou wist that epitaph dulcie on him that lost life by a fall from the saddle my seeing it were comfort but no necessity i could go on hoping that god had seen it aunt joyce arose and left the chamber then saith my lady stafford to me there goes a strong soul there be women such as she but they are not to be picked like blackberries off every bramble edith young folks are apt to think love a mere matter of youth and of matrimony they cannot make a deeper blunder the longer love lasts the stronger it groweth always my lady said i ay saith she that is if it be love we wrought a while without more talk when suddenly saith my lady stafford edith didst thou see this tregarvon or how he called himself ay madam said i he made up to me one morrow when my sister milisent and i were on saint huberts isle in the mere yonder and i was sat adrawing of a stone ay so quoth she with some earnestness in her voice and what then i think he took not much of me madam said i my lady stafford smiled yet methought somewhat pensively may i wit what he said to thee edith oh a parcel of stuff touching mine hair and mine eyes and the like said i i knew well enough what colours mine hair and eyes were of without his telling me could i dress mine hair every morrow afore the mirror and not see well edith saith she methinks he did not take much of thee i would i could have seen himand her voice grew sadder not that my voice should have had any potency with him that had it never yet but i would fain have noted how far the years had changed him and ifif there seemed any more hope of his amendment than of old time there was a time when in all oxfordshire he was allowed the goodliest man and i fear he was not far from being likewise the worst here come in mother and my lady stafford changed the discourse right quickly i saw i must say no more but i am well assured aunt joyces mary was never my lady stafford who methinks it were it should serve no good end to set down selwick hall december ye xix as we sat this even of the great chamber saith father stafford do you remember our talk some days gone touching what manner of life there should be in heaven that do i well sir robert made answer well quoth father i have fallen to think more thereupon and the thought comes to mewherefore account we always that we shall do but one thing there and that all shall do the same here is milisent ay and lettice toothat think they should be weary to sit of a cloud and sing for ever and ever truly so should i methinks saith sir robert so should we all i cast no doubt answers father if our capacity for fatigue did extend into that life but why expect the same thing over and over it is not so on earth i am not reading nor is lettice sewing nor milisent broidering with no intermission from the morning to the night neither do we all the same fashion of work ay saith aunt joyce somewhat eagerly but the work done here below is needful aubrey there shall be no necessity for nought there art avised o that joyce saith father why saith she dost look for brooms and dusters in heaven shall bess and i sweep out the gold streets thinkest or fetch a pan to seethe the fruits of the tree of life one would think saith sir robert if all be allegorical as some wise doctors do say that they should be shadowy brooms that swept parabolical streets allegorical fiddlesticks quoth aunt joyce i did never walk yet oer a parabolical paving nor sat me down to rest me of an allegorical chair am i to be allegorical forsooth you be a poor comforter sir robert soft you now saith father i enter a caveat as lawyers have it methinks i have walked for some years oer a parabolical paving and rested me in many an allegorical chair thou minglest somewhat too much the spiritual and the material joyce i count i take thee audrey saith she thou wouldst say that the allegorical city is for the dwelling of the spirit and the real for the body but pray you if my spirit have a dwelling in thine allegorical city nay i said not the city were allegorical quoth he burden not me withal for in truth i do believe it very real no that was sir robert saith she so i will ask at him as shall be but fair where i pray you is my body to be sir whilst my soul dwelleth in your parabolical city there shall be a spiritual body my mistress makes he answer smiling truth quoth she but i reckon it must be somewhere it seems me to my small wit that if my soul and my spiritual body be to dwell in an allegorical city then i must needs be allegorical also and i warrant you that should not like me a whit let us not mingle differences saith father be the spiritual and the allegorical but one thing nay i believe there be two saith aunt joyce tis sir robert here would have them alike but how would you define them saith sir robert to father thus he made answer the spiritual is that which is real as fully as the material but it is invisible the allegorical is that which is shadowy and doth but exist in the fantasy if i say of these my daughters they be my jewels i speak allegorically for they be not gems but maidens but i do not love them in an allegory but in reality love is a moral and spiritual matter but no allegory so heaven is a spiritual place but methinks not an allegorical one but the new jerusalemthe golden city which lieth foursquarethat is allegorical surely we shall see when we are there saith father i think not sir robert pursed up his lips as though he could no wise allow the same mind you robin saith father i say not that there may not be allegory touching some of the details i reckon the pearls of the twelve gates were never found in earthly oysters nor do i account that the gold of the streets was molten in an earthly furnace no more when edith saith she will run and fetch a thing should i think to accuse her of falsehood if i saw that she walked and ran not tis never well to fetch a parable down on all fours you and i use allegory always in our common talk ay quoth sir robert but you reckon they be pearls and gold i will tell you when i have seen them saith father and smiled either they be gold and pearls or they be that to which in our earthly minds gold and pearls come the nearest why my friend we be all but lisping children to god think you one moment and tell me if every word we use touching him hath not in it more or less of parable we call him father and king and master and guide and lord is not every one of these taken from earthly relationships and doth it not presuppose a something which is to be found on earth we have no better wits than to do so here if god would teach us that we know not it must be by talking to us touching things we do know did not you the same with your children when they were babes how far we may be able to penetrate when we be truly men grown up unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ verily i cannot tell only i do see that not only all scripture but all analogy pointeth to a time when we shall emerge from this caterpillar state and spread our wings as butterflies in the sunshine nay there is yet a better image in nature the grub of the dragonfly dwelleth in the waters and cannot live in the air till it come forth into the final state tell me then i pray you how shall this watergrub conceive the notion of flying through the air supposing you able to talk with him could you represent the same unto him other than by the conceit of gliding through water with most delightsome swiftness and directness to talk of an element wherein he had no experience should be simply so much nonsense to him now it may betake me not i pray you as meaning it must bethat all that shall be found in heaven differs as greatly from what is found on earth as the water differs from the air concerning these matters i take it god teaches us by likening them to such things as we know that shall give the best conceit of them to our minds here on earth the fairest and most costly matter is gold and gems well he would have us know that the heavenly city is builded of the fairest and most precious matter but that the matter is real and that the city is builded of somewhat that will i yield to none to do other were to make it a fairy tale heaven in cloudland and god himself but the shadow of a dream the only difference i can see is that we should never awake from the dream but should go on dreaming it for ever o louvaine saith sir robert i can never allow of matter in heaven all there is spiritual now what mean you by matter saith father matter is a term of this world i argue not for matter in heaven as opposed to spirit but for reality as opposed to allegory youll be out of my depth next plunge saith sir robert merrily we shall both be out of our depth robin ere long and under your leave there will we leave it but i see you are a bit of a manichee that is out of my depth at any rate quoth he i am but ill read in ancient controversies though i know you dabble in them why i have dipped my fingers into a good parcel of matters in my time saith father but the manichees old friend were men that did maintain the inherent evil of matter all things with them were wicked that had to do therewith wherein though they knew it not they were much akin to the indian mystics of buddha that do set their whole happiness in the attaining of nirvana what is that saith aunt joyce is it an india goddess or something good to eat it is quoth father the condition of having no ideas good lack saith she then daft madge is nearest perfection of us all perhaps she is in sober truth father makes answer meseemeth whispers milisent to me that jack benn is a manichee tis strange saith father as in meditation how those old heresies shall be continually reborn under new names nor only that but how in the heart of every man and woman there is by nature a leaning unto some form of heresy here is robin stafford a manichee and bess a mennonite and my lady stafford if i mistake not a stoic and mynheer somewhat given to be a cynic and lettice and milisent methinks are by their nature epicureans mistress martin it seemeth me should be an essene and what shall we call thee edith aught but a pharisee father said i laughing nay thou art no pharisee saith he but that they were a nation and not a sect i should write thee down a sybarite nell is as near a pharisee as we have one in the chamber yet methinketh it were to insult her to give her such a name go on saith aunt joyce im waiting what for thine own class mine and thine saith she fathers eyes did shine with fun well joyce to tell truth i am somewhat puzzled to class thee but i am disposed to put thee amongst the brownists what on earth for saith she why quoth he because thou hast a mighty notion of having things thine own way sir robert quoth aunt joyce pray you box my cousins ears for me as you sit convenientand what art thou thine own self thou caitiff a bonus homo answers father right sadly whereat all that did know latin fell alaughing and i asking at my lady stafford she told me that bonus homo is to say good man and was in past time the name of a certain order of friars that had carried down the truth of the gospel from the first ages in a certain part lying betwixt italy and france nell saith father i did thee wrong to call thee a pharisee thou art rather a herodian but i pray you sir aubrey what did you mean by the name you gave me saith mistress martin for i would fain wit my faults that i may go about to amend them and as at this present i am none the wiser the essenes saith he mistress martin were a sect of the jews so extreme orthodox that they did deny to perform sacrifice or worship in the temple seeing there they should have to mingle themselves with other sects and with wicked men that brought not their sacrifices rightly moreover they would neither eat fleshmeat nor drink wine and they believed not that there were so much as one good woman in the whole world then i cry you mercy sir aubrey quoth she but if so be assuredly i am not of them i do most heartily believe in good women whereof methinks i can see four afore me at the very least this instant moment nor have i yet abjured neither wine nor fleshmeat oh no the details be different saith he yet i dare be bold to say you have a conceit of a perfect church whereinto no untrue man should ever be suffered to enter ay that have i said she methinks the church of england is too comprehensive and should be drawn on stricter lines and therein are you an essene answereth father oh grissel would fain have every man close examined saith sir robert and only admitted unto the lords supper by the clergy after right strict dealing were you alway of this manner of thought mistress martin asks father i trow not said she as one gets on in life you see one doth perceive many difficulties and differences that one noted not aforetime one is more apt to fall into ruts that i know saith aunt joyce i had ado enough and yet have to keep me out of them a man is apt to do one of two things saith father either to fall into a rut or to leave the road altogether either his charity contracteth and he can see none right that walk not in his rut or else his charity breaketh all bounds and he would have all to be right which way soever they walk why those be the two ends of the pole quoth sir robert and i warrant you you shall find grissel right at the end which so it be she hath a conceit that a man cannot be too right nor that if a thing be good you cannot have too much thereof ah that hangeth on the thing saith father you cannot have too much faith nor charity but you may get too much syllabub methinks that is scantly the true rendering thereof have not the proportions much to do withal if a mans faith outrun his charity behold him at the one end of your pole but if his charity outrun his faith here is he at the other now faith and charity should keep pace let either get afore the other and the man is no longer a perfect man but a man with one limb grown out and another shrivelled up but sir aubrey quoth mistress martin can a man be too holy or too happy surely not mistress martin saith he but look you god is the fountain and pattern of both and in him all attributes are at once in utmost perfection and in strictest proportion we sons of adam since his fall be gone out of proportion and note you for it is worthy notethat nothing short of revelation did ever yet conceive of a perfect god the gods of the heathen were altogether such as themselves even very christians with revelation to guide them are ever starting aside like a broken bow in their conceits of god either they would have him all justice and no mercy or else all mercy and no justice and the looser they hold by the revelation god has made of himself the dimmer and the more out of proportion be their thoughts of god the most men frame a god unto themselves and be assured that he shall be like themselvesthat the sins which he holds in abhorrence shall be the sins whereto they are not prone are we not in fine saith sir robert so far gone from original righteousness that our imperfect nature hath lost power to imagine perfection not a doubt thereof saith father look you but abroad in the world you shall find pride lauded and called high spirit and nobleness covetousness is prudence and good thrift flattery and conformity to the world are good nature and kindliness every blast from hell hath been renamed after one of the breezes of heaven there was silence so long after this that i reckoned the discourse were oer when all suddenly saith sir robert louvaine have you much hope for the futurewhether of the church or of the world all hope in god none out of him nay come closer saith sir robert what shall hap in the next few reigns i will overturn overturn overturn until he come whose right it is and i will give it him there is our polestar robin and i see no other stars this same jesus shall so come even so come lord jesus yet may he not be said to come by the spirit shed abroad in the hearts of men and so the world be regenerated find that in gods word robin afore he comes and i will welcome it with all my heart answers father i could never see it there i see there a mighty spread of knowledge and civility civilisation and communications of menas hath been since the invention of printing and may be destined to spread yet much further abroad but knowledge is not faith nor is civility christianity and in fine he is to come as he went he did not go invisibly in the hearts of men but the kingdom of god is within you ay in the sense wherein the word is there used the power of christ at that time was to be a power over mens hearts not an outward show of regality but he shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go is a very different matter oh of course we look for our lords advent in his own person quoth sir robert but i cannot think he will come to a sinstained earth it were not suitable to his dignity the way of the lord must be prepared we shall see when he comes gently answereth father but if he had not deigned to come to a sinstained earth what should have come either of robin stafford or of aubrey louvaine selwick hall december ye xxiii four nights hath it taken me to write that last piece for all the days have we been right busy making ready for christmas there be in the buttery now thirty great spicecakes and an hundred mince pies and a mighty bowl of plumporridge plumpudding without the cloth ready for the boiling and four barons of beef and a great sight of carrots and winter greens and two great cheeses and a parcel of sugarcandy for the childre and store of sherrissack and claret and rhenish wine and muscadel as to the barrels of ale and the raisins of corance currants and the apples and the conserves and codiniac quince marmalade and such like i will not tarry to count them and today and yet again it shall be tomorrow have mother and aunt joyce and we three maids trudged all the vicinage bidding our neighbours to the hall on christmas eve and for the even of christmas day and as tonight am i well aweary for thirlmere side fell to my share and i was this morrow as far as old madges bidding her and young madge and that is six miles well reckoned father saith alway that though it be our duty at all times yet is it more specially at christmas to bid the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind so we have them alway of christmas night and of christmas eve have we a somewhat selecter gathering of our own kin and close friends and such like only master banaster and anstace come both times then on new years day have we alway a great sort of childre and merry games and music and such like but the last night of the old year will father have no gatherings nor merrymaking he saith tis a right solemn time and as each one of us came to the age of fourteen years have we parted at nine o the clock as usual but not on that night for bed every one sitteth by him or herself in a separate chamber with a bible or some portion thereof open afore there do we read and pray and meditate until halfpast eleven at which time all we gather in the great chamber then father reads first the th psalm and then that piece in the revelation touching all the dead standing afore god and he prayeth a while until about five minutes afore the year end then all gather in the great window toward keswick and tarry as still as death until master cridge ring the great bell on lord island so soon as he hear the chimes of keswick church then no sooner hath the bell died away which telleth to all around that the new year is born then father striketh up and all we join in the th psalm to wit all people that on earth do dwell and when the last note of the amen dieth then we kiss one another and each wisheth the other a happy new year and gods blessing therein and so away to bed i reckon i shall not have no time to write again until christmas day is well over father said i last night to himwe were us two alone that minutefather do you love christmas he looked on me and smiled i love to see my childre glad dear maid saith he and i love to feast my poor neighbours that at other times get little feasting enough but christmas is the childres festival edith for it is the festival of untroubled hearts and eyes that have no tears behind them for the weary hearts and the tearful eyes the true feast is easter the one is a hope the other is a victory there are no clouds oer the blue sky in the first the storm is over and the sun is out again in the last we believe in the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come but we are apt to believe in the resurrection the most truly when the grave hath been lately open and the life of the world to come is the gladdest thought to them for whom the life of the world that is seems not much to live for selwick hall december the xxviii well edith quoth aunt joyce to me last night thou hast had a rare time of it i have aunt said i yet i warrant you i was not sorry to have sunday come at after eh but i was weary when i gat me abed on christmas night and it were ten oclock well told ere i so did helen and milisent were later yet but mother packed me off saying that growing maids should not tarry up late and when i found me withinside the blankets i warrant you but i was thankful i reckon being now something rested i must set down all that we did and first for christmas eve hal and anstace came early their childre were bidden to keswick unto a childres gathering then about three o the clock master and mistress lewthwaite with alice nym jack and robin and by the same token nym played the despairing gallant that i could not choose but laugh his hat awry and his ruff all o one side and a bombasted padded doublet that made him look twice his own size and methought it a sore pity to miss blanche that was wont to be merriest of us all when as she were in a good humour and so alice said unto me while the water stood in her eyes a little while after come doctor and mistress meade and their isabel then old mistress rigg and her three tall daughters mrs martha mrs katherine and mrs anne then farmer benson and his dame and their margaret and agnes and master coward with their tom and susan and master and mistress armstrong with their ben nicholas and gillian last of all come master park and master murthwaite both together and their mistresses with the young folkhugh and austin park and dudley faith and temperance murthwaite so our fourandthirty guests with ourselves thirteen made in all a goodly company of fortyseven first when all were come in and had doffed their outdoor raiment and greeting over we sat us down to supper where one of the barons of beef and plumporridge and applepies and chickenpies and syllabub and all manner of good things but in very deed i might scarce eat my supper for laughing at nym lewthwaite that was sat right over against me and did scarce taste aught but spent the time in gazing lackadaisically on our helen and fetching great sighs with his hand laid of his heart supper oer we first had snapdragon then hot cockles then blindmans buff then hunt the weasel we pausing to take breath at after father called us to sing so we gathered all in the great chamber and first mynheer sang a dutch song and then sir robert and mistress martin a rare partsong touching the beauties of springtime then sang farmer benson master armstrong and ben and agnes the hunt is up which was delightsome to hear then aunt joyce would sing pastime with good company and would needs have milisent and me and robin lewthwaite to help her after this jack lewthwaite and nick armstrong made us to laugh well by singing the cramp is in my purse full sore the music ended with a sweet glee of faith and temperance murthwaite something sober but i know it liked father none the worse and the old english song of summer is ycumen in sung of father and sir robert our helen and isabel meade then we sat around the fire till rearsupper and had questions and commands and cried forfeits and wound up with i love my love and some were rare witty and mirthful in that last particularly sir robert who did treat his love to oranges and orfevery in the orcades hebrides and father said he marvelled how he gat them there and aunt joyce who said her love was benjamin breakrope and he came from the tower of babel then after that fell we atelling stories and a right brave one of father out of one of his old chronicles how queen philippa gat a pardon from her lord for the six gentlemen of calais and a merry of dr meade touching king john and the abbot of canterbury and the three questions that the king did ask at the abbots gardener he playing his master and the witty answers he made unto him then would master armstrong tell a tale and an awesome ghoststory it were that made my flesh creep and milisent whispered in mine ear that she should sleep never a wink at after it eh saith farmer benson and fetched an heavy sigh ghosts be ill matter of an house saw you eer a ghost farmer benson saith dudley murthwaite nay lad quoth he ive had too much good daylight work in my time to lie awake aseeing ghosts when night cometh ah but ive seen a ghost saith austin park oh where cried a dozen together why it was but night afore last saith he up by the old whitethorn that was strake of the lightning come two years last midsummer just at yon reach o the lake that comes up higher than the rest ay ay saith farmer benson and what like were it master austin a woman all in white with her head cut off quoth he said she aught to thee nay i gave her no chance i took to my heels quoth he now austin that should i neer have done saith aunt joyce who believes in ghosts never a whit i would have stood my ground for i did never yet behold a ghost and would dearly love to do it and do but think how curious it should be to find out what she spake withal that had her head cut off mistress joyce had you found you as i did close to a blasted tree and been met of a white woman with no head ill lay you aught you will youd never have run no faster saith austin in an injured tone that should i not quoth aunt joyce boldly i shall win my fortune at that game austin if thou deny not thy debts of honour why man o life what harm should a blasted tree do me had the lightning struck it that minute while i stood there then might there have been some danger but because the lightning struck it two years gone how should it hurt me now and as to a woman with no head that would i tarry to believe till i had stripped off her white sheet and seen for myself eh mistress joyce cries old mistress rigg but sure you should never dare to touch a ghost there be not many things save sin mistress rigg that i should not dare to do an it liked me i have run after a thief with a poker ay and i have handled a popish catchpoll in queen marys days that he never came near my house no more and wherefore i pray you tell me should i be more feared of a spirit without a body than of a spirit within the bodyaustin if thou meet the ghost again prithee bid her come up to selwick hall and ask for joyce morrell for i would give forty shillings to have a good talk with her only think how much a ghost could tell a body lackaday mistress joyce ill neither make nor meddle with her cries austin poor weak soul saith aunt joyce whereat many laughed so after a while sat we down to rearsupper and at after that gathered in small groups twos and threes and the like and talked and i with isabel meade and temperance murthwaite and austin park had some rare merriment touching divers matters when all at once i heard aunt joyce say well but what ill were there in asking questions of spirits if they might visit the earth the ill for which adam was turned forth of eden saith father disobedience to a plain command of god look in the xviii chapter of deuteronomy and you shall see necromancy forbidden by name that is communication with such as be dead but that were for religion sir aubrey saith master coward this look you were but matter of curiousness that is to say it was evas sin rather than adams father makes answer surely that which is forbid as solemn matter of religion should be rather forbid as mere matter of curiousness but was that aught more than a ceremonial law of the jews no longer binding upon christians saith sir robert nay then turn you to pauls epistle to timothy quoth father where among the doctrines taught by them that shall depart from the faith he doth enumerate doctrines of devilsor as the greek hath it of demons now these demons were but dead men whom the pagans held to be gobetweens for living men with their gods so this see you is a twoedged sword forbidding all communication with the dead whether as saints to be invoked or as visitants to be questioned nobodys like to question em save mistress joyce saith farmer benson of his husky voice which alway soundeth as though he should have an ill rheum of his throat aunt joyce laughed nay i were but joking quoth she but i warrant you if i meet austins white woman without a head ill see if she be ghost or no but what think you sir aubreywherefore was such communication forbid saith master murthwaite god wot saith father i am not of his councilchamber my masters plain word is enough for me one might think that a warning from beyond the grave should have so solemn an effect on a sinner nay we be told right contrary if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they believe though one rise from death again how much rather when one hath risen from the dead and they have refused to hear him then arose dr meade that was discoursing with mynheer of a corner and prayers were had after which a gracecup and then all took their leave master park being last to go as to come and just ere he was through the door saith austin to aunt joyce alaughing youll mind to let me know mistress joyce what the ghost saith to you i can stand it secondhand maybe thats a jolly hearing from one of the stronger sex to one of the weaker quoth she well said thou mocking companion i will give thee to wita piece of my mind if no more christmasday of course all to church and in the even sat down to supper seventysix all but ourselves poor men and women and childre and two of the barons of beef and six bowls of plumporridge and one hundred pies of divers kindsto say nought of lesser dishes that milly counted up to eighty then after snapdragon whereat was much mirth and singing of christmas carols and games with the childre and all away looking mighty pleased daft madge would know of me if the angels lived o plumporridge i told her i thought not so it is like to be somewhat rare good quoth she the lords so rich look youmain richer nor sir aubrey if t servant gives poor folk plumporridge whatll t master give father answered her for he was close by fat things full of marrow wines on the lees well refined eh that sounds good saith she alicking of her lips and thats for t hungry folk master it is only for hungry folk saith he tis not thrown away on the full ones whosoever will take saith the lord who gives the feast eh then i shall get some saith she alaughing all oer her face as she doth when she is pleased at aught youll be sure and let me know when tis master ill come if tis snow up to t knees all t way the lord will be sure and let thee know madge when tis ready saith father for he hath oft said that little as poor madge can conceive he is assured she is one of gods childre oh if tis him to let me know tll be all right saith madge smiling and drawing of her cloak around her hell not forget madgenot he he come down o purpose to die for me you know father saith as madge trudged away in her clogs after old madge her grandmother ah rich madgenot poor maybe thine shall be the most abundant entrance of any in this chamber i am at the end of my month and as tomorrow i hand the book to helen but i dare not count up my twopences for i am feared they be so many note complexion at this date signified temperament not colour the middle age physicians divided the complexions of mankind into four the lymphatic the sanguine the nervous and the bilious and their treatment was always grounded on these considerations colour of skin hair and eyes being considered symptomatic of complexion the word was readily transferred from one to the other chapter seven aunt joyce tackles a ghost twas but one little drop of sin we saw this morning enter in and lo at eventide the world is drowned keble in helens handwriting selwick hall january ye iv dear heart but i neer thought our edith should have filled so much paper yet it doth seem me she is more livelier at writing than at household duties i have watched her pen aflying of a night for she can write twice as fast as i she writing of the new italian hand and i but the old english note till i marvelled whateer she found to say and methinks she hath likewise a better memory than i for i reckon i should have made some mighty blunder in all these long talks which she hath set down so pat i had no time to write afore today nor much now for o new years day had we all the childre of all the vicinage and i were fair run off my feet first amaking ready and then aplaying games then was there a stowing away of such matter as should not be wanted again o twelfth night trust me but after twelfth night we shall have some jolly work dear heart but how much hath happed since the last line i writ in this book and tis but two months gone i do see as saith the wise man that we verily wit not what a day may bring forth our milly is coming back something to her old self though methinks she hath learned an hard lesson and shall neer be so light and foolish as aforetime i trust this is not unkindly to say for in very deed i mean it not so but more and more hear we of all sides touching this master norris as aunt joyce saith is his true name which doth plainly show him a right evil man and that if our poor milly had trusted to his fair words she should soon have had cause to repent her bitterly thereof why there is scarce a wellfavoured maid in all derwentdale nor borrowdale that hath not token to show of him and an heap of besugared flatteries for to tell eh but what an ill world is this we live inand how thankful should young maids be that have a good home to shelter them in and a loving father and mother to defend them from harm trust me but i never knew how ill place was the world nor did i ever truly conceive aforetime of aunt joyce methought that for her being rich and well to do the wheels of life had run rare smooth and that twas but a short way to the bottom of her mind and heart and all suddenly an hand uplifts the corner of a curtain that i had taken no note of and lo a mighty deep that i never guessed to be there is it thus with all folks i do marveland if we could look into the inwards of them that seem as though nought were in them should we find great dreary caverns or vast mines of wealth yet for all this is aunt joyce ever bright and cheery and ready to do all kindly service for whoso it be that needeth it and tis harder to carry an heavy burden that it shall not show under your cloak than to heave it up on your shoulder i did alway love aunt joyce but never better methinks than sithence i have known somewhat more of her inner mind poor hasty spirits that we be how do we misjudge other folk but now i must tarry in my chronicling for i hear anstace voice below and i reckon she is come to help in making ready for twelfth night selwick hall january ye viii well twelfth night is oer and the most of things stowed away and all come back to our common ways sixtyeight guests had we grown folk and childre and i shall not essay as i see edith hath done rarely to set down all their names only there were most of those that come on christmas eve but not dr meade and his folks he being bidden of my lord dilston much merriment was there adrawing of king and queen and it oer behold dudley murthwaite was king and mother was queen so father which had drawn the chamberlain right courtlily hands mother up to the throne that was set at the further end of the great chamber all laughing rarely to see how well twas done and martha rigg agnes benson gillian armstrong and our milly that had drawn the maids of honour did dispose themselves behind her aunt joyce was mother of the maids and she said she would have a care to rule them with a rod of iron so she armed her with the poker and shaked it at each one that tittered till the most were aholding of their sides with laughter jack lewthwaite drew the chancellor and right well he carried him ere their majesties abdicated and the court dispersed had we rare mirth for aunt joyce laid afore the throne a plaint of one of her maids for treason which was gillian that could no way keep her countenance and twas solemnly decreed of their majesties and ratified of the chancellor that the said prisoner be put in fetters and made to drink poison the which fetters were a long piece of silver lace that had come off a gown of mothers and the poison a glass of syllabub which mr chancellor brought to the prisoner that screamed and begged for mercy but had it notand hard work had gillian to beg for mercy for she was laughing till she could scarce utter no words howbeit this oer all we gathered around the fire and played at divers sitting games and as we were in the midst of i love my love and had but just finished r afore margaret benson that was next could begin with sbehold a strange voice behind yet no strange one crieth out loud and cheery i love my love with an s because she is sweet i hate her with s because she is sulky i took her to the sign of the ship and treated her to sprats and seaweed her name is sophonisba suckabob and she comes from san sebastian well we turned round all and looked on him that had spoke but in good sooth not one of us knew the bright fresh face until mother cries outned ned my boy and then i warrant you there was some kissing and handshaking ay more than a little fleet ahoy saith ned havent seen so many crafts in the old harbour for never so long why ned hast thou forgot tis twelfth night says milly so tis quoth ned shall i dance you a hornpipe so after all the greeting was done ned sat down next to mother but we gat no further aloving of our loves that night for all wanted to hear ned that is but now come back from the spanish seas and divers tales he told that were rare taking and one or twain that did make my flesh creep but truly his seatalk is rare hard to conceive when all at once saith ned have you a ghost cruising these parts eh ned hast thou seen her cries austin park whos her saith ned ive seen a craft with a white hull and all sails up in the copse nigh old nannys couldst thou make it thy conveniency to speak english ned saith father that is the language we talk in derwentdale ned laughed and saith ill endeavour myself but tis none so easy to drop it well who or what is it tis a ghost saith austin and folks laughed at me when i said i had seen it maybe theyll give oer now why didst not send a buckshot through her quoth ned good lack i had no arms saith austin and what good should come o shooting a ghost make you first sure she is a ghost saith father for it should be right little good that should come of shooting a woman this was all said that night and we brake up at nine o the clock and away hied our guests but yestereven as i was acrossing of the hall just after the dusk fell what should i see but aunt joyce clad in hood cloak and pattens drawing back of the bolt from the garden door and i ran to help her why aunt joyce whither go you so late said i but maybe i do ill to ask nay thou dost not so child saith she and i will take thee into my secret for i can trust thee nell i am going to see the ghost aunt joyce was all i could utter ay saith she i will for my mind misgives me that this is no ghost but a living woman and a woman that it should be well had an other woman to speak unto her be not afeared dear heart i am not running afore i am sent it was said to me last night go in this thy might and when the lord sends men on his errands he pays the charges but if you should be hurt aunt cried i well what so saith she he were a poor soldier that were afeared to be hurt in his kings battles but if it be as i think nell there is no fear thereof and if there were mine ease is of less moment than a sinners soul nay dear maid take thine heart to thee cheer up there is more with me than all the constables in cumberland whatsoever the lord pleased that did hein heaven and in the earth and in the seas and in all deep places i am not afeared nell and away trudged she without an other word but i sat on thorns till about seven o the clock she came into the great chamber her hood and cloak doffed why joyce i had lost thee saith mother looking up brightly from her sewing i would rather thou hadst lost me than the lord lettice and if thou hadst not methinks he had found me wanting saith aunt joyce now dear hearts list me i have much trust in you aubrey and lettice or i had not dared to do as i have done this night i have brought into your house a woman that is a sinner will you turn her forth of the doors to die in the snow without or will you let her bide till she hath had time to behold him that sitteth as guest at your banquet and i would hope to wash his feet with tears and wipe them with the hairs of her head o joyce let her bide crieth mother and the tears ran down her cheeks amen saith father gently but who is she saith mother as if something fearfully she isaunt joyces voice was very huskyshe is what our milisent would have been if the lord had not stayed her right at the last minute so then i knew that blanche lewthwaite was found at last there were none in the chamber as it happed but father mother and me when aunt came in and what hath she to say asks mother she will not talk of the past saith aunt joyce and god wot i shall not ask her is she very shamed and sorrowful never a whit she is more angered than aught else angeredwith whom with providence i take it quoth aunt joyce something drily she counts a miracle should have been wrought for her to hinder her from sinning and that since it were not there can be no blame laid at her door so hard as that saith mother maybe not all through aunt joyce makes answer the crust seems thick at present but there may be a soft spot deep down below i shall work till i find it is she not softened toward thee asks father me saith aunt joyce with a bitter little laugh why so far as i can make out i am but one step fairer than providence in her eyes i gat not much flattery this even i can tell youno more than i had of milly a month gone nay aubrey he that would save a sinner against his will must not expect thanks from him shall i go to her joyce saith mother and rose up as thou wilt lettice saith aunt joyce only an thou so dost look not for any fair words save out of thine own mouth she is in the green chamber i locked her in hath she had to eat saith mother ay i saw to that ere i came below mother went forth of the chamber may i see her aunt joyce said i or must i not better not at this present nell she made answer buti am not sure that it were not well for milly when mother came down again she saith in a despairing voice and spreading forth her hands o joyce she is as hard as a stone ay saith aunt joyce quietly so i reckon was peter until the lord turned and looked upon him that melted him lettice leave us take blanche to the lord sin is the most hardening thing in the world dear heart saith father sadly so here is poor blanche locked of the green chamber with aunt joyce for her waitingmaid for none other will she have to enternot even mother for her one talk with blanche hath sore distressed her wait a while lettice saith aunt joyce i will bid thee when i reckon any good should come of it milisent hath been told and seemeth much touched therewith but none of us have yet seen blanche poor heart may the good lord have mercy upon her selwick hall january ye xii mother and i with her went up this morrow to mere lea to do mistress lewthwaite to wit touching blanche we found her right busy amaking of pies and alice by her paring of apples she gave us good welcome and we sat us down and talked a short while of other matter then saith mother suffer me to ask at you mistress lewthwaite if you have heard ever any news of blanche mistress lewthwaite shaked her head sorrowfully nay not we saith she it should be a good day we did albeit her father is sore angered yet methinks if he did verily stand face to face with the child he should not be so hard on her as he talks now then i hope the good day is coming saith mother for methinks neighbour we have heard somewhat mistress lewthwaite left her pastry of the board and come up to mother eh lady lettice what have you heard tell me quick now my poor heart i saw her last night where is the child with us at selwick hall joyce found her wandering about and hiding in copses and she brought her in and what hath happed lady lettice we have not asked her not asked her saith mistress lewthwaite in manifest amazement and alice looked up with the like we know saith mother but such matter as it hath liked her to tell us the which is that she was wed to this gentleman of a popish priest which as you know is not good in law and that after she had bidden with him but a fortnight they quarrelled and he left her ah she neer had a good temper hadnt blanche saith her mother well poor heart ill not quarrel with her were all sinners i reckon the lass may come home when she will for all me and ill do mine utmost to peace her father we havent so much time o this world nor so much happiness that we need wrangle and make matters worser for mistress lewthwaite is herself a right easygoing woman tis her father of whom blanche hath her temper but alice saith to me that sat right at the end of the board where she was awork all very well methinks for my fine mistress to come hither aprinking and apranking of her and looking to be took back as if nought had happened if i had the word to say shed not come home in no hurry i warrant you she should lie on her bed as shed made it o alice said i but sure thou wilt be right glad to have blanche back shall i so saith she and tossed her head thank you for nothing nell louvaine im a decent maid that have alway carried me belike and i go not about to say sister to one that brought disgrace on her name alice art thou about to play the pharisee said i for i was sore troubled i had ever thought alice right sorry after blanche and it did astonish me to hear such words of her let my fine lady everett play the publican first then quoth she i scarce wist what to say yet i would have said more but that mother rose up to depart at this time but i am so astonied at alice while so blanche were lost she did seem quite soft toward her and now she is found here is alice grown hard as a board and all of a minute as it were had it been our milly which i do thank god from mine heartroot it is not i think i would not have been thus towards her i know i am but sinful and not to be trusted for the right as much or more than other but i do think i should not so do yet is there one matter that i comprehend not nor never shall neither of milly nor of any other to think of a maid leaving of father and mother and her home and her brethren and sisters to go away with a finespoken man that she had not known a month all by reason he spake some flattering wordsin good sooth but tis a marvel unto me truly i might conceive the same in case a maid were rare illusen at home were her father ever harsh unto her and her mother all day anagging at herthen if the man should show him no mere flatterer but a true friend would i not stick to the days she had known him and yet as methinks it should be a strange case wherein a true man should not go boldly and honestly to the maids father and ask her of him with no holeandcorner work but to think of so leaving our father and mother that never in all their lives did deny us any good thing that was meet for us and that have loved us and cared for us all from the day we were born unto this dayto go away from them with a strange flatterernay this passeth me by many a mile selwick hall january ye xvi this morrow as i was sat awork alone in the great chamber come my lady stafford with her broidery in her hand and sat her down beside me and ere many minutes were passed saith she helen i have been to see blanche and is she still so hard my lady said i i should not call her mood hard saith she i think she is very very sorry and would fain not have us see it but she paused a moment and then went on it is the worldly sorrow which causeth death your ladyship would say she is right sorry for my lady everett for the great lady she thought to have been and the grand life she looked to lead but for blanche lewthwaite as a sinner before god methinks she is not sorry at all tis a sad case said i my lady stafford gave me no answer and when i looked up at her i saw her dark eyes fastened on the white clouds which were floating softly across the blue and her eyes so full that they allto nearly ran oer helen she saith hast thou any idea what is sin truly madam i think so i made answer i marvel she pursueth if there ever were man or woman yet that could see it as god seeth it it may be that unto him all the evil that blanche hath doneand tis an evil with many sides to itis a lesser thing than the pride and unbelief which will not give her leave to own that she hath done it and for what others have done all suddenly her ladyship brake off and hiding her face in her kerchief she brake into such a passion of weeping tears as methought i had scarce seen in any woman aforetime o my god my god she sobbeth through her tears how true is it that man knows the beginnings of sin but who boundeth the issues thereof note i felt that my ladys trouble the cause whereof was unknown to me lay far beyond any words specially of me and i could but keep respectful silence till she grew calm when so were quoth she dost marvel at my tears helen in no wise madam said i for i reckoned there were some cause for them beyond my weak sight cause saith sheay helen cause more than thou wist dost know that this leonard norristhe man that hath wrought all this mischiefand more beside than thou or i can tellis my brother of the fathers side madam cried i in amaze ay saith she sorrowfully and that is not all helen by very much for our father was just such an other and not only are the sins but the leanings and temptations of the fathers visited upon the children and i thought helen beyond thatof a quiet grave in unconsecrate ground wherein now nigh fifty years agone they laid one that had not sinned against the light like to blanche lewthwaite yet to whom the world was harder than it is like to be to her she was lawfully wed helen but she stood pledged to convent vows and the church cursed her and flung her forth as a loathsome thing her life for twelve years thereafter was a daily dying whereto death came at last as a hope and a mercy i reckon the angels drew not their white robes aside lest her soiled feet should brush them as she passed up to the judgment bar and methinks her sentence from the judge should be no worser than one he gave in the days of his fleshthy sins be forgiven thee go in peace the church cast her out but not the cross there was no room for her in the churchyard but methinks there was enough in the sepulchre on golgotha oh but how sorry i felt for this poor soul and i saw she was one whom her ladyship had loved well there was a time helen she went on when it seemed to me uttermost misery that no prayers should be permitted for her soul think thou with what comfort i found in gods word that none were needed for her ah these papists will tell you of the happiness of their priests fatherly care and the sweetness of absolution but they tell you not of the agony of despair to them to whom absolution is denied and for whom the church and the priest have no words save curses i have seen it helen well for them whom it drives straight to him that is high above all churches and who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy praise be to his holy name that the furthest bounds of mens forbearance touch not the uttermost of god when my lady thus spake it came upon my mind all of a sudden to ask at her somewhat the which had troubled me of long time i marvel wherefore it should be that it doth alway seem easier to carry ones knots and griefs unto them that be not the nearest and dearest than unto them that be is it by reason that courtesy ordereth that they shall list the better and not be so like to snub a bodyyet that can scarce be so with me that am alway gently entreated both of father and mother or is it that one would not show ignorance or mistakings afore them one loves nor have them hereafter cast in ones teeth as might be if one were oerheard of ones sistgood lack but methought i were bettered of saying unkindly things i will stay me not by reason that it should cost me two pence but because i do desire to please god and do the right well so i said unto my lady madam i pray you pardon me if i speak not well but there is one place of holy writ that doth sore pose and trouble me it is that of saint paul which saith that if they that were once enlightened shall fall away there shall be no hope to renew them again that doth alway seem to me so awful a wordto think of one that had sinned longing for forgiveness and yet must not have iti cannot understand how it should be when christ liveth to save to the uttermost nor any other saith she dear helen thou readest it wrong as i believe many do the apostle saith not there is no renewing to pardon he saith there is no renewing to repentance with them that have sinned against light the language of whose hearts is i have loved idols and after them i will gothese have no desire of remission they do not wish to be forgiven but these dear maid are not they that long for pardon and are willing to turn from sin that is repentance so long as a sinner can repent so long can he receive pardon the sinner that doth long for forgiveness which god can not or will not give him is a monster was never found yet in this world or that which is to come right comfortable did i think these words i never should have dared as milly saith touching the th psalm to have turned oer the two leaves together that i might not see this sixth chapter of hebrews yet did i never see it without a diseaseful creeping feeling belike coming oer me and i am sore afeared lest i may have come nigh at times to wishing that saint paul had not writ the same yet mark thou helen again saith my lady there is a difference betwixt remission of sin and remission of penalty every sinner should be glad enough to part with his punishment but no sinner was ever yet willing to part with his sin but under the promptings of gods spirit and that is but a sorry repentance which would fain keep the sin if only it might without incurring penalty madam you do cause sin to look very awful said i that is how god would have thee see it helen saith she remember he hates sin not for his own sake only but for thy sake ah dear maid when some sin or some matter that perhaps scarce seems sin to thee yet makes a cloud to rise up betwixt god and theewhen this shall creep into thy very bosom and nestle himself there warm and close and be unto thee as a precious jewelremember if so be that it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than thou shouldst having two hands or two feet be cast into everlasting fire he that said that helen knew what hell was selwick hall january ye xxi blanche is gone home at last aunt joyce and i went thither this last night with her her mother having wrung consent from her father that she should come for all that was the scene distressful for master lewthwaite kept not in divers sharp speeches and blanche that is sore wanting in reverence to her elders would answer back as she should not but at the last mistress lewthwaite gat them peaced and alice and blanche went off together alice behaved better than my fears but dear heart to my thinking how hard and proud is blanche why she would brazen it out that she hath done none ill of no kind the good lord open her eyes when we came out from mere lea and were come down the garden path aunt joyce stood a moment on the hillside her eyes lift up to the still stars good lord then saith she how hard be we poor sinful men and women each to other and how much more forbearing art thou against whom we have sinned make thou thy servants more like thyself and then away with a quick foot and never an other word spake she till we gat us home selwick hall january ye xxvii when i come to read oer that i have writ i find i have said rare little touching ned and in very deed it is not that i meant to keep him out for ned is my very hero and my true thought is that never yet were young man so brave and good nor so wellfavoured i must say i would i could conceive his talk better for tis all so stuffed with seawords that i would fain have an interpreter ned laughs when i say this well saith he tis the strangest thing in the world you should not conceive me tis all along of you being maids i reckon nay say i tis by reason we were neer at sea well how any human creature can be a landlubber saith ned when he might have a good boat and a stiff capful o wind passeth me rarely why quoth father that had listed us in silence till now if we were all sailors and mermen ned how wouldst come by a seabiscuit or a lump of salt meat there should be none to sow nor reap if the land were deserted oh ay tis best some should love it saith ned but how they so should that is it passeth me tis a strange matter saith father that we men should be all of us unable to guess how other men can affect that we love not i dare be bound that wat should say what passed him was that any man which might dwell on the land should take to the sea wat saith ned curling of his lip i saw him sir and spent two days in his company when we touched at london some eight months gone why he isnay i wis not what he is like all the popinjays in the south seas be fools

be in treaty of loveor without the same being but friendsthey do agree to call each other by certain dainty and fantastical names as the one shall be perfection and the other hardihood or the one sweetness and the other fortitude and the like i prayed wat to show me how it were or else had i wist no more than a baker how to reef a sail the names whereby he and his lady do call each other be

excellency when she hath done nought all her life but to pluck roses and finger her gold chain wheres her excellency belike things were ill enough in the court of old saith father but it doth seem me we were scantly so brainless of old time as this i shall send a letter to my cousin of oxenford touching walter he must not be suffered to drift into father did not end his sentence but methought i could guess reasonable well how it should have been finished verily i am troubled touching wat and will pray for him that he may be preserved safe from the snares of the world the flesh and the devil oh what a blessed place must heaven be seeing there shall be none of them one thing howbeit doth much comfort meand that is that ned is true and staunch as ever to the early training he had of father and mother out of gods word some folk might think him careless and too fond of laughter and fun and the like but i know nedof early days i was ever his secret fellowand i am well assured his heart is right and true he shall bide with us until sir humphrey gilbert his next voyage out to the spanish seas but we know not yet when that shall be he had intended to make the coast of virginia this last time but was beat back by the tempest tis said that when he goeth his brother of the mothers side sir walter raleigh shall go with him this sir walter saith ned is a young gentleman that hath but eight and twenty years yet is already of much note in the court he hath a rare intelligence and a merry wit aunt joyce was mightily taken by one tale that ned told us of himhow that being at the house of some gentleman in the country where the mistress of the house was mightily set up and precise one morrow this sir walter that was adonning dressing himself did hear the said his precise and delicate hostess without his door to ask at her servants be the pigs served no sooner had they met below than saith sir walter madam be the pigs served but my lady that moved not a muscle of her face replied as calm as you will you know best sir whether you have had your breakfast aunt joyce did laugh oer this and said sir walter demerited to have as good given him as he brought i do like quoth she a woman that can stand up to a man i can credit it joyce saith father note the english hand was the running hand of the old black letter and was a very crabbed and tedious piece of work the italian hand which came in about this time has lasted until the present day though its latest variety has lost much of the old clearness and beauty it was at its best in the reign of james the first of which period some specimens of writing have been preserved exquisitely beautiful and as legible as copperplate most lovely is the youthful hand of his eldest daughter the cacography of her later years is alas something horrible queen elizabeth could write the italian hand and did it to perfection but she has left on record that she did not like doing it note these were the last words of francesco spira an italian lawyer and a pervert whose terrible death in the agonies of remorse and despair made a deep and lasting impression on the protestants of england chapter eight how two went in at the gate all the foolish work of fancy and the bitter close of all tennyson on all the sweet smile falleth of him who loveth so but to one the sweet voice calleth arise and let us go they wait to welcome thee this night at home with me bm in milisents handwriting selwick hall february ye ii this day was called of old time candlemas by reason of the great number of candles saith father which were brent afore the altar at the purification of saint mary being an holy day all we to church this morrow after the which i was avised to begin my chronicling and afore i set down anything else tis meet i should say that i do now see plain how i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly i would not think now to tear forth those pages i writ this last november though they be such a record of folly and sin as few maids should need to set down i would rather keep them that i may see in future days all the ill that was once in milisent louvaine and all the great mercy and goodness which the lord my god did show me oh the bitter anger that was in mine heart that night toward dear aunt joycewho next unto father and mother hath been to me as an angel of god for had she not stopped me in my madness where and what had i been tonight i can scarce bear to think on it perchance i feel it the more sith i am ever put in mind thereof by the woefully changed face of poor blancheblanche but three months gone the merriest of us all and now looking as though she should never know a days merriment again her whole life seems ruined and dr bell the chirurgeon at keswick told mother but yesterday that blanche should not live long she hath said he a leaning of her nature toward the consumption of the lungs the which was greatly worsened by those days that she hid in the copse fearing to come home until aunt joyce went to her and to think that i might have been thus nowwith nought but a wasted life to look back on and nought to look forward to but a rapid and early death and to know well as i do know that i have but mine own headstrong foolery to thank for the danger and am far from having any wisdom of mine to thank for the rescue verily i should be the humblest of women all the days of my life oh when will young maids learn without needing to have it brent into them of hot irons that they which have dwelt forty or sixty years in this world be like to know more about its ways than they that have lived but twenty or that their own fathers and mothers which have loved and cared for them since they lay in the cradle be not like to wreck their happiness even for a while without they have good cause of force i know tis not every maid hath such a father and mother as wethank god for the samebut i do think nevertheless there be few mothers that be good women at all which should not be willing to have their daughters bring their sorrows and joys to them rather than pour them into the ear of the first man that will flatter them i have learned from aunt joyce that there is oft a deal more in folk than other folk reckon and that if we come not on the soft spot in a womans heart tis very commonly by reason that we dig not deep enough howbeit aunt joyce saith there be women that have no hearts the good lord keep them out of my path if his will be selwick hall february ye v this morrow we maids were sat awork in the great chamber where was aunt joyce awork likewise and mother coming in and out on her occasions father was there but he was wrapped in a great book that lay afore him i cannot well mind how we gat on the matter but aunt joyce gan speak of the blunders that men do commonly make when they speak of women why saith she we might be an other sort of animal altogether instead of the one half of themselves do but look you what i have heard men to say in my life a womans first desire is to be wed thats not true but of some women and they be the least worthy of the sex a woman can never keep a secret thats not true but of some a woman can never take a joke thats as big a falsehood as westminster abbey a woman cannot understand reason and logic thats as big an one as all england any woman can keep a house or manage a babe heyday can she so i know better poor loons what should they say if we made as great blunders touching them and an other thing i will tell you which hath ofttimes diverted me tis the queer ways whereby a man will look to win favour of a woman nine men of every ten will suppose they shall be liked of a woman for telling her in substance that she is as good as if she had not been one now that should set the man that did it out of my grace for ever and ever how mean you aunt an it like you saith nell why look you here saith aunt joyce but this last week said i to master coward touching somewhat he had said but said i that were not just quoth he how my mistressyou a woman and love justice again there was once a companion would fain have won me to wed him when i said nay and meant it quoth he oh a maid doth never say yea at the first and i do believe that both these thought to flatter me if they had but known how i longed to shake them for look you what the words meant a woman is never just a woman is never sincere and the dolts reckon it shall please us to know that they take us for such fools verily i would give a pretty penny but to make them conceive that the scrap of flattery which they do offer to my particular is utterly swamped in the vast affront which they give to my sex in the general but you shall rarely see a man to guess that moreover there be two other points mark you how a man shall serve a woman if he come to know that she hath the tongues knows the classical languages doth he take it as he should with an other man never a whit he treats the matter as though an horse should read english or a cat play the spinnet what right hath he to account my brains so much worser than his i being the same creature as he that i cannot learn aught he can so meanbrained a thing as a woman to know as much as any man i grant you he shall not say such words but he shall say words that mean it and then forsooth he shall reckon he hath paid me a compliment i trow no woman should have brains as dull as that and do tell me belike why a man that can talk right good sense to his fellows shall no sooner turn him around to a woman than he shall begin to chatter the veriest nonsense it doth seem me that a man never thinks of any woman but the lowest quality he counts her loving if you will but alway foolish frothy witless hell take every one of you for that make of woman till he find the contrary oh these men these men ah saith father i feel myself one of the inferior sex aubrey what business hast thou hearkening quoth she i thought thou wert lost in yonder big book i found myself again some minutes gone saith father but thou wist tis an old saw that listeners do never hear any good of themselves i didnt mean thee man saith aunt joyce present company always excepted methought i was reckoned absent company saith father with a twinkle in his eyes and lifting his big book from the table howbeit i am not too proud to learn even from a woman quoth aunt joyce thou art the pearl of men if so be father laughed and carried off his book pausing at the door to observethere is some truth in much thou hast said joyce lackaday what an acknowledgment from a man cries aunt joyce yet tis fenced round look you there is some truth in much i have said ah go thy ways my good aubrey thou art the best man ever i knew but alack thou art a man after all why aunt joyce saith edith who was laughing rarely what should we do think you if there were no men i would do some way thou shouldst see saith aunt joyce sturdily and so she let the matter drop or should so have done but nell saith i reckon we all both men and women have in us a touch of our father old adam and our mother old eva said i you say well childre quoth aunt joyce and she that hath the biggest touch of any i know is a certain old woman of oxfordshire by name joyce morrell up springeth edith and giveth aunt joyce a great hug she is the best sweetest dearest old woman if so be ever i knew saith she i except not even mother for i count not her an old woman aunt joyce laughed and paid edith back her hug with usury then when edith was set down again to her work aunt joyce saith anstace was wont to saymy anstace not yours my maidsthat she which did commonly put herself in the lowest place should the seldomest find her out of her reckoning selwick hall february the ix come dr bell this morrow to let us blood as is alway done of the springtime i do never love these bloodletting days sith for a sennight after i do feel weak as water but i reckon it must needs be to keep away fever and plague and such like the which should be worser than bloodletting a deal all we were blooded down to adam and dr bell rode away by sixteen shillings the richer man which is a deal for a chirurgeon to earn but of one morrow aunt joyce saith she marvelleth if in time to come physicians cannot discover some herb or the like that shall purify folks blood without having it run out of them like water from a tap i would if so be that they might make haste and find the same father hath writ to his cousin my lord of oxenford praying him to give leave for wat to visit us at home tis four years sithence he were here and father hath been wont to say that shall be a rare wellwrit letter which shall in common cases do half the good of a talk face to face i can see he is somewhat diseaseful touching wat lest he should slide into ill ways we do hear of old nanny that cometh by nows and thens for waste victuals that daft madge is something sick her grandmother reckons she caught an ill rheum that even of christmas day when she were here but madge herself will strongly deny the same saying poor maid that she never could take nought ill at selwick hall for never nought but good saith she came to her there mother would go to visit her but she hath an evil rheum herself and father saith she must tarry at home this sharp frost so aunt joyce and i be to go this afternoon and carry her a basket of comfortable things selwick hall february ye x a rare basket that was mother packed yestermorrow for daft madge first went in a piece of beef and then a goodly string of salt ling for lent is nigh at hand note a little bottle of cinnamon water divers pots of conserves and honey a roll of butter a halfdozen of eggs which at this present are ill to come by for the hens will scarce lay this frost weather and two of the new foreign fruit called oranges first introduced in which have been of late brought from abroad and ned did bring unto mother a little basket of them we had an ill walk for there hath been frost after snow and the roads be slippy as they were greased with butter howbeit we come at last safe to madges door and there found daft madge in a great chair afore the fire propped up of pillows and old madge her grandmother sat asewing with her hornglasses across her nose and by her old isaac crewdson that is daft madge her grandfather of the other side she smiled all oer her face when she saw us and did feebly clap her hands as she is wont to do when rare pleased good morrow madge saith aunt joyce see thou my lady lettice hath sent thee a basket of good things to strengthen thee up a bit madge took aunt joyces hand and kissed it theyll be good but your faces be better saith she old madge gat her up and bustled about unpacking of the basket and crying out o pleasure as she came to each thing and told what it were but daft madge seemed not much to care what were therein though she was ever wont dearly to love sweets there being i reckon so few pleasures she had wit for only she sat still gazing from aunt joyce to me and smiling on us what art thinking madge saith aunt joyce for natural idiot though she be madge is alway thinking tis very nigh as though there were a soul within her which tried hard to see through the smoked glass of her poor brains nay i take it so there is i were thinking saith she alooking on your faces what like itll be to see his face madge hath rarely any name for god it is mostly he wouldst love to see it madge saith aunt joyce shall quoth she right soon he sent me word mistress joyce yestereven ay saith old isaac she reckons shes going

saying he careth for you dost thou think she is going isaac saith aunt joyce for old isaac is an herbgatherer or were while he could and he wist a deal of physic now gaffer thoult never say nay cries madge faintly as though it should trouble her sore if he thought she would live through it ill say nought o th sort madge said isaac ay mistress joyce shes been coming to the lord this ever so long and now i take it shes going to him thats right saith madge with a comforted look and laying of her head back on her pillows it would be sore to get right up to th gate and then an angel as one didnt

aunt joyce eh i hope not quoth madge as regretfully i do want to see him so id like to see if he looks rested like after all he bare for a poor daft maid and i want to know if them bad places is all

th door betwixt madge hath alway had a strange fantasy to shut the halfdoor betwixt her and them she loveth not there be very few she will let come withinside i reckon them that may might be counted

always so now but i reckon theyve things tidy up yon theyll fit like ye ken but mistress joyce do ye tell me will us be any wiser up yon i saw the water in aunt joyces eyes as she arose and she bent down and kissed madge on the brow dear heart quoth she thou shalt know him then as well as he knows thee is that plenty madge i reckon tis a bit o tother side saith madge with her eyes gleaming but when i came to kiss her the next minute quoth shemistress milisent saw ye eer mistress joyce when she had doffed her ay madge said i marvelling what notion was now in her poor brain and saith she be there any wings agrowing out of her shoulders do tell me id like to know how big they were by now nay madge i never saw any no did ye quoth she in a disappointed tone i thought theyd have been middling grown by now but maybe he keeps th wings till weve got yon ay i reckon thats it shell have em all right some day and madge seemed satisfied selwick hall february ye xvi yestermorn dr bell being at church mother was avised to ask him if it might stand with his conveniency to look in on madge the next time he rideth that way and see if aught might be done for her he saith in answer that he should be ariding to thirlmere early this morrow and would so do and this even on his way home he came in hither to tell mother his thought thereon tis even as we feared for he saith there is no doubt that madge is dying nor shall she overlive many days but right sorry were we to hear him say that he did marvel if she or blanche lewthwaite should go the first why doctor saith mother i never reckoned blanche so far gone as that maybe not when you saw her lady lettice saith he butwomen be so perverse why the poor wretch might have lived till this summer next following or even though i scarce think it have tided oer another winter but she must needs take it into her foolish head to rush forth into the garden to say a last word to somebody a frosty bitter even some ten days back with never so much as a kerchief tied oer her head and now is she laid of her bed as was the only thing like and may scarce breathe with the inflammation of her lungs she may win through but verily i look not for it poor heart i will go and see her saith mother ay do so saith he poor foolish soulas foolish in regard of her health as of her happiness this even i being the first in our chamber was but making ready my gown with a clean partlet ruff for tomorrow when mother come in milly she saith i shall go if the lord will to see blanche tomorrow and i would have thee go withal i guess mother saw that i did somewhat shrink from the thought in truth though i have seen blanche in church and know how she looketh yet i have never yet spoke with her sithence she came home and i feel fearful as though i were going into a chamber where was somewhat might hurt me my milisent saith motherand that is what she calls me at her tenderesti would not hurt thee but for thine own good and i know dear heart that few matters do more good than for a sinner to be shown that whereto he might have come if the lord had not hedged up his way with thorns tis not alwayi might say tis not oftenthat we be permitted to see whither the way should have led that the father would not have us to take and my dear heart thou art of thy nature so like thy foolish mother that i can judge well what should be good for thee nay mother dear heart i pray you call not yourself names said i kissing her hand i shall be of my nature foolish milly whether i do so call myself or no saith mother laughing and truly the older i grow the more foolish i think myself in my young days shall i so do mother when i am come to your years said i also laughing i hope so milly saith she i am afeared if no thy wisdom shall then be small selwick hall february ye xvii i have seen blanche lewthwaite and i do feel tonight as though i should never laugh again verily o my god the way of the transgressors is hard she lies of her bed scarce able to speak and that but of an hoarse whisper dr bell hath given order that she shall not be suffered to talk but to make known her wants or to relieve her mind though folk may talk to her so long as they weary her not we came in brought of alice and mother sat down by the bed while i sat in the window with alice blanche looked up at mother when she spake some kindly words unto her i am going lady lettice was the first thing she said i do trust dear heart if the lord will dr bells skill may yet avail for thee saith mother but if not blanche blanche interrupted her impatiently with a question whereof the tone yet more than the words made my blood run cold whither am i going dear blanche said mother the lord jesus christ is as good and as able today as ever he were there was a little impatient movement of her head too late never too late for him saith mother too late for me blanche made answer you mind the textlast sunday i loved idolsafter them i would go she spoke with terrible pauses caused by that hard labouring breath mother answered as i knew from the word of god yet return again to me saith the lord i cannot return i never came then come unto me all ye that are weary and laden the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost blanche made no answer she only lay still her eyes fixed on mother which did essay for to show her by gods word that she might yet be saved if she so would methought when mother stayed and rose to kiss her as she came thence that surely blanche could want no more her only word to mother was thanks then she beckoned to me and i came and kissed her mother was gone to speak with mistress lewthwaite and alice withal blanche and i were alone close she said and i bent mine ear to her lips very kindlady lettice buttoo late o blanche i was beginning but her thin weak hand on mine arm stayed further speech hush milisentthank godthou art not as i thank godand keep clean too late for me goodbye o blanche blanche i sobbed through my tears the look in her eyes was dreadful to me the lord would fain have thee saved and wherefore dost thou say too late i want it not she whispered blanche i cried in horror what canst thou mean not want to be saved from hell not want to go to heaven from hellay but notto go to heaven but there is none other place cried i i know would there were i believe i stood and gazed on her in amaze i could not think what were her meaning and i marvelled if she were not featherbrained wandering lightheaded somewhat god is in heaven she said i do not want god nor he me i could not tell what to say i was too horrified there was a time saith blanche in that dreadful whisper which seemed me hoarser than ever he wouldhave saved methen but i would not nowtoo late thanks gogoodbye and then mother called me i think that hoarse whisper will ring in mine ears and those awful eyes will haunt me till the day i die and this might have been my portion no word of all this said i to mother as aunt joyce saith she picks up everything with her heart and father hath alway bidden us maids to spare her such trouble as we maywhich same he ever doth himself but i found my lady stafford in the little chamber and i threw me down on the floor at her feet and gave my tears leave to have their way my lady always seemeth to conceive any in trouble and she worketh not at you to comfort you afore you be ready to be comforted she only stroked mine head once or twice as though to show me that she felt for me until i pushed back my tears and could look up and tell her what it were that troubled me what ought i to have said my lady quoth i no words of thine milisent she made answer that valley of the shadow is below the sound of any comfort of men the words that will reach down there are the words of god and not always they buto my lady think you the poor soul can be rightthat it is too late for her there is only one that can answer thee that question she saith let us cry mightily unto him so long as there is life there may be hope there be on whom even in this world the lord seems to have shut his door but i think they be commonly hardened sinners that have resisted his good spirit through years of sinning there is no unforgivable sin save that hard unbelief which will not be forgiven dear milisent let us remember his word that if two of us shall agree on earth as touching anything they shall ask it shall be done and he willeth not the death of a sinner we made that compact and ever sithence mine heart hath been as it were crying out to god for poor blanche i cannot tell if it be foolish to feel thus or no but it doth seem as though i were verily guilty touching her as though the saving of me had been the loss of her o lord god have mercy upon her selwick hall february ye xxii this cold even were we maids and ned bidden to a gathering at master murthwaites it being temperance her birthday and she is now two and twenty years of age we had meant for to call on our way at mere lea to ask how was blanche but we were so late of starting i need not blame any that there was no time left and we had to foot it at a good pace master murthwaite dwells about half a mile on this side of keswick so we had a middling good walk there come we found gillian armstrong and her brethren but none from mere lea gillian said her mother had been thither yestermorn when she reckoned blanche to be something better and they were begun to hope though dr bell would not yet say so much that she might tide oer her malady a pleasant even was it but quiet for master murthwaite is a strong puritan as folk do now begin to call them that be strict in religion and loveth not no manner of noisy mirth nor do i think any of us were oer inclined to vex him in that matter i was not leastwise we brake up about eight of the clock or a little past and set forth of our way home not many yards howbeit were we gone when a sound struck on our ears that made my blood run chill from the old church at keswick came the low deep toll of the passing bell onetwothen a pause a woman there were only two women so far as i knew that it was like to be i counted every stroke with my breath held would it pause at the nineteen which should point to daft madge or go on to the twentyone which should mean blanche lewthwaite eighteennineteentwentytwentyone then the bell stopped o ned it is blanche cries edith ay i reckon so saith ned sadly we hurried on then to the end of the lane which leads up to mere lea looking up at the house whereof the upper windows can be seen we saw all dark and closed up and in blanches window where of late the light had burned day and night there was now only pitch darkness she needed no lights now for she was either in the blessed city where they need no light of the sun or else cast forth into the blackness of darkness for ever oh which should it be milisent said a low sorrowful voice beside me and mine hand clasped robin lewthwaites when was it robin two hours gone he saith mournfully robin i could not help whispering said she aught comfortable at the last she never spake at all for the last six hours he made answer but the last word she did say wasthe publicans prayer milly then there is hope i thought but i said it not to robin so we came home and told the sorrowful tidings selwick hall february ye xxv i was out in the garden this morrow picking of snowdrops to lay round blanches coffin my back was to the gate when all suddenly i heard dr bells voice saymilisent is that thou i rose up and ran to the gate where he sat on his horse well milly saith he the shutters are up at mere lea ay we know it doctor said i sadly poor maid saith he a life flung away and it might have been so different i said nought for the tears burned under mine eyelids and there was a lump in my throat that let me from speech i would thou wouldst say milly goeth on dr bell to my lady and mistress joyce that daft madge as methinks shall not pass the day and she hath a rare fantasy to see mistress joyce once more see if it may be compassed good morrow i went in forthwith and sought aunt joyce which spake no word but went that instant moment and tied on her hood and cloak and so did i mine twas nigh ten o the clock when we reached old madges hut we found daft madge in her bed and seemingly asleep but old madge said twas rather a kind of heaviness whence she would rouse if any spake to her aunt joyce leaned over her and kissed her brow eh tis mistress joyce saith madge feebly as she oped her eyes thats good hes let me have all i wanted art comfortable madge close to th gate im lookin to see t open and mother come out willnt she be pleased aunt joyce wiped her eyes but said nought say yon again mistress joyce saith madge what my dear heart why you saith madge over seeing th king dinna ye ken eh mistress joyce but ye ha set her up some wi that saith old madge shes talked o nought else sin scarce aunt joyce said it once more thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off tis none so fur off now quoth madge ive getten a many miles nearer sin you were hither i think thou hast madge saith aunt joyce ay an tis a good place saith she tis a good place here where ye can just lie and watch th gate theyll come out they bonnie folk and fetch me in anon and mothers safe sure to be one ah madge thou wist whither thou goest saith aunt joyce why for sure saith she hes none like to send me nowhere else but where he is dun ye think id die for somebody i didnt want she saith not much else but seemed as though she sank back into that heavy way she had afore but at last when we were about to depart she roused up again a moment god be wi ye both said she im going th longer journey but theres t better home at t end maybe i shall come to th gate to meet you mind you dunnot miss mistress milly mistress joyce shes safe i will try not to miss madge i answered through my tears god helping me hell help ye if ye want helpin saith madge only hell none carry you if ye willnt come dunna throw away good gold for dead leaves mistress milly god be wi ye we left her therewatching the gate selwick hall february ye xxvi this morrow as i came down the stairs what should i see but aunt joyce ashaking the snow from her cloak and pulling off her pattens why aunt cried i have you been forth thus early aunt joyce turned on me a very solemn face milly saith she madge is in at the gate o aunt have you seen her die i have seen her rise to life she made answer child the lord grant to thee and me such a death as hers it seemed as though right at the last moment the mist that had veiled it all her earthtime cleared from the poor brain and the light poured in on her like a flood the king in his beauty the king in his beauty were the last words she spake but in such a voice of triumph and gladness as i never heard from her afore o milly my darling child how vast the difference between the being saved so as by fire and the abundant entrance of the good and faithful servant let us not rest short of it and methought as i followed aunt joyce into the breakfastchamber that god helping me i would not note for many years after the reformation the use of fish was made compulsory in lent from the wish to benefit the fish trade a licence to eat flesh in lent obtained from the queen not the pope cost shillings in chapter nine walter learns to say no betray mean terror of ridiculethou shalt find fools enough to mock thee but answer thou their laughter with contempt and the scoffers shall lick thy feet martin farquhar tupper in ediths handwriting selwick hall march the ii never methinks saw i any so changed as our milly by the illness and death of poor blanche from being the merriest of all us methinks she is become wellnigh the saddest i count it shall pass in time but she is not like milisent at this present all we indeed have much felt the same but none like her i never did reckon her so much to love blanche i have marvelled divers times of late what did bring robin lewthwaite here so oft and i did somewhat in mine own mind rhyme his name with milisents for all as i find on looking my damsel hath set down never a time he came the which as methinks is somewhat significant so i was little astonied this afternoon to be asked of robin as we two were in the garden if i reckoned milisent had any care touching him thou wist edith saith he i did alway love her but when yon rogue came in the way betwixt that did end all by the beguilement of our poor blanche i wellnigh gave up all hope for methought she were fair enchanted by him i think she so were for a time robin said i until she saw verily what manner of man he were and that it were not truly he that she had loved but the man she had accounted him well saith robin i would like to be the man she accounted him thinkest there is any chance thou wist i can but guess i made answer for milisent is very close of that matter though she be right open on other but i see no reason robin wherefore thou shouldst not win her favour and i do ensure thee i wish thee well therein edith thou art an angel crieth he out and squeezed mine hand till i wished him the other side the border nay said i alaughing what then is milly oh aught thou wilt saith he also laughing that is sweet and fair and delightsome dost know edith our nym goeth about to be a soldier he shall leave us this next month a soldier cried i for in very deed nym and a soldier were two matters that ran not together to my thoughts howbeit i was not sorry to hear that nym should leave this vicinage and thereby cease tormenting of our helen the way he gazeth on her all the sermontime in church should make me fit to poison him were i she and desired not as i know she doth not that he should be arunning after me but nym a soldier i could as soon have looked to see moses play the virginals why he is feared of his own shadow very nigh and is worser for ghosts than even austin park i do trust if we need any defence here in derwentdale either the queens majesty shall not send nym to guard us or else that his men shall have stouter hearts than he an hare were as good as nym lewthwaite sithence i writ what goeth afore have we all been rare gladded by walters coming which was just when the dusk had fallen he looketh right well of his face and is grown higher and right wellfavoured but eh me so fine i felt wellnigh inclined to lout courtesy me low unto this magnifical gentleman rather than take him by the hand and kiss him ned saith the queens highness barge ahoyall lined and padded o velvetand in the midst the estate the royal canopy of cloth of gold off with your caps my hearties walter laughed and took it very well saith aunt joyce when he come to her wat how much art thou worth by the yard ten thousand pound aunt saith he boldly and laughing ha saith she somewhat dry i trust tis safe withinside for i see it not

our sewing wilt tell me wat saith father what years thou hast why sir quoth he i reckon you know that something better than i but i have alway been given to wit that the year of my birth was mdlvii the which sith thou wert born in july makes thee now of two and twenty years father makes answer i believe so much sir saith walter that looked somewhat diverted at this beginning and thy wage at this time from my lord of oxenford is sixteen pound by the year note it is so sir quoth wat and what reckonest thy costs to be in good sooth sir i have not reckoned saith he go tomake a guess wat did seem diseased thereat and fiddled with his chain at the last father keeping silence he saith looking up with a flush of his brow to speak truth sir i dare not right my lad saith father speak the truth and let come of it what will but in very deed we must come to it wat this matter is like those wounds that tis no good to heal ere they be probed nor knew i ever a chirurgeon to use the probe without hurting of his patient howbeit wat i will not hurt thee more than is need tell me dost thou think that all thy costs of whatsoever kind should go into two hundred pound by the year the red flush on wats brow grew deeper i am afeared not sir he made answer of a low voice should they go into three wat hesitated but seemed more diseased uncomfortable than ever should four overlap them wat brake forth father i would you would scold mei cannot stand it i should feel an hard whipping by far less than your terrible gentleness i know i have been a downright fool and i have known it all the time but what is a man to do the fellows laugh at you if you do not as all the rest then they come to one every day with here louvaine lend me a sovereignand look you louvaine pay this bill for meand they should reckon you the shabbiest companion ever lived if you did it not or if having done it you should ask them for it again wat saith aunt joyce from the window what so aunt quoth he stand up a minute and let me look at thee saith she walter did so but with a look as though he marvelled what aunt joyce would be at i would judge from thy face quoth she if thou art the right lad come or they have changed thee in london town our walter used to have his fathers eyes and his mothers mouth well i suppose thou art but i should scantly have guessed it from thy talk walter softly saith mother thy father should never have so dealt when he were of thy years lackadaisy i would have thought the world was turning round quoth aunt joyce had i ever heard such a speech of aubrey at any years whatsoever father listed this with some diversion as methought from the set of his lips well i am not as good as father saith wat amen quoth aunt joyce but aunt you are hard on a man see you not all the fellows think you a coward if you dare not spend freely and act boldly ay and a miser belike is it worser to be thought a coward than to be one saith father who be all the fellows saith aunt joyce my lord of burleigh and my lord hunsdon and sir francis walsingham ill warrant you now aunt saith walter not grave old men like they my lord of oxenford that is bestdressed man of all the court and spendeth an hundred pound by the year in gloves and perfumes only eh wat cries helen and motherwalter my dear boy tis truth i do ensure you saith he and sir walter raleigh one of the first wits in all europe and young blount that is high in the queens majestys favour and my young lord of essex unto whom she showeth good countenance tis not possible to lower ones self in the eyes of such men as theseand assuredly i should were i less freehanded my word wat but thou hast fallen amongst an ill pack of hounds saith aunt joyce then it is possible or at least more possible to lower thyself in our eyes wat saith father father you make me to feel shamed of myself crieth wat yet think you so should they when i were among them if i should hold back from these very deeds then is there no difference my son asks father still as gentle as ever betwixt being shamed for doing the right and for doing the wrong butpardon me siryou are not in it saith walter do but think what it should feel to be counted singular and as a speckled bird unlike all around well saith aunt joyce fervently i am five and fifty years of age this morrow and have in my time done many a foolish deed but i do thank heaven that i was never so left to mine own folly as to feel any ambition to make one of a row of buttons i laughedi could not choose you are a woman aunt saith wat tis different with you i pay you good thanks master walter louvaine quoth she for the finest compliment was ever paid me yet i am a woman wherefore i thank god and therefore this young gentleman being testimony have more bravery of soul than a man for that is what thy words come to master wat though i reckon thou didst not weigh them afore utterancenow aubrey what art thou about to do with this lad i fear there is but one thing to do saith father and he fetched an heavy sigh but let us reach the inwards of the matter first i reckon walter thou hast many debts outstanding i am afeared so sir saith watwhich to do him credit did look heartily ashamed of himself to what sum shall they reach thinkest wat fiddled with his chain and fidgetted on his seat and father had need of some patience which he showed rarely ere he gat at the full figures it did then appear that our young gallant should have debts outstanding to the amount of nigh two thousand pounds but wat saith helen looking sore puzzled how couldst thou spend two thousand pounds when thou hadst but sixtytwo in these four years maidens understand not the pledging of credit saith ned see thou nell i am a shopkeeper and sell silk gowns and thou wouldst have one that should cost an angel eh ned crieth she and all we laughed thou shalt not buy a silk gown under six angels at the very least leastwise not clear silk it should be all full of gum go to saith ned six angels thensixty if thou wilt dear heart what costly matter women be ill don my wife in camlet well in thy purse is but two angels how then shalt thou get thy gown why how can i i must do without it saith she most sweet helen sure thou earnest straight out of the garden of eden dear heart folks steer not in that quarter now o days thou comest to me for the gown and i set down thy name in my books that thou owest me six angels and away goest thou with the silk and turnest forth o sunday as fine as a fiddler welland then saith she then with christmas in cometh my bill and thou must pay the same but if i have no money then i lose six angels father is that honest saith helen if thou hadst no reason to think thou shouldst have the money by christmas certainly not my maid he made answer not honest sir saith wat is it so quoth father oh look you words mean different in the court crieth aunt joyce from what they do in derwentdale and at minster lovel if we pay not our debts here we go to prison and folks do but say served him right but if they pay them not there why the poor tailor and jeweller must feed their starving childre on the sight of my lord of essex gold lace and the smell of my lord of oxenford his perfumes do but think what a rare supper they shall have now hearken walter saith father i must have thee draw up a list of all thy debts what sum for what purpose and to whom owing likewise a list of all debts due to thee but you would not ask for loans back sir cries wat that depends on whom they were lent to answers father if to a poor man that can scarce pay his way no but if to my cousin of oxenford and such like gallants that have plenty wherewith to pay then ay they would think it so mean sir saith walter diseasefully let them so do saith father i shall sleep quite as well but really sir i could not remember all then set down what thou canst remember walter looked as if he would liefer do aught else and my son saith father so gently that it was right tender i must take thee away from the court sir crieth walter in a voice of very despair i can see thou art not he that can stand temptation i had hoped otherwise but tis plain that this temptation at the least hath been too much for thee wats face was as though his whole life should be ruined if so were come wat take heart o grace cries ned i wouldnt cruise in those muddy waters if thou shouldst pay me two thousand pound to do the same think but of men scenting themselveswith aught but a stiff seabreeze pish and as to dancing cap in hand afore a woman and calling her thine excellency or thy floweriness or thy somesortoffoolery why id as lief strike to a spanish galleon very nigh when i want a maid to wed me an i ever doat this present i donti shall walk straight up to her like a man and say mistress cicely or whatso she be named i love you will you wed me and if she cannot see an honest mans love or will not take it without all that flummery why she isnt worth a pail o seawater and i can get along without her and i will hurrah for ned saith aunt joyce tis a comfort to find we have one man in the family i trust we may have two in time quoth father wat my lad i know this comes hard and as i count thee not wicked but weak i would fain help thee all i may but thou canst not be suffered to forget that my fortune is but three hundred pound by the year and i have yet three daughters to portion i could not pay thy debts without calling in that for which thou hast pledged my creditfor it is mine wat rather than thine seeing thine own were thus slender but sir crieth wat that were punishing you for mine extravagance i never dreamed of that come he is opening his eyes a bit at last saith aunt joyce to me that was next her maybe wat saith father with a kindly smile it had been better if thou hadst dreamed thereof a little sooner i think my boy it will be punishment enough for one of thy nature but to bide at home and to see the straits whereto thou hast put them that love thee best punishment saith wat in a low shamed voice yes father the worst you could devise well then we will say no more saith father only draw up those lists walter and let me have them quickly father then left the chamber and wat threw him down at mothers knee o mother mother if i had but thought sooner crieth he if i could but have stood out when they laughed at mefor that in very deed were the point i did begin with keeping within my wage and then all they mocked and flouted me and told me no youth of any spirit should do so andand i gave way oh if i had but held on mother softly stroked wats gleaming fair hair that is so like hers my boy she saith didst thou ask for gods strength or try to hold on in thine own walter made no answer in words but methought i saw the water stand in his eyes when mother and wat were both gone forth aunt joyce saithi cannot verily tell how it is that folk should have a fantasy that tis a shame to be feared of doing ill and no shame at all to be feared of being laughed at why one day when i were at home there was little jack bracher astealing apples in mine orchard and hewitt that is aunt joyces chief gardener caught him and brought him to me jack he sobbed and thrust his knuckles into his eyes and said it were all the other lads but what did the other lads to thee quoth i oh they dared me crieth he they said i durst not take em and so i had to do it now heard you ever such stuff in your born days why they might have dared me till this time next year afore ever i had turned thief for their daring but then aunt you see saith ned a twinkle in his eyes you are but a woman that alters the case just so ned quoth aunt joyce the fun in her eyes as in his i am one of the weaker sex i know now ill tell you saith ned how they essayed it with me when i first joined my ship they dared memy mates wot youto go up to the masthead afore i had been aboard a day now look you here mates says i when the admiral bids me ill scale every mast in the ship and if i break my neck i shall but have done my duty but ill do nought because im dared and so that you know well believe me who will but they cheered me as if i had taken a galleon laden with ducats and ive been their white son favourite ever since of course saith aunt joyce they alway do tis men which have no true courage that dare others and when they come on one that hath they hold him the greater hero because tis not in themselves to do the like ned lad thou art thy fathers son i know not how wat gat changed well aunt i hope i am saith ned i would liefer copy father than any man ever i knew hold thou there and thou shalt make a fair copy saith aunt joyce we wrought a while in silence when aunt joyce saith sure if mens eyes were not blinded by the sin of their nature they should perceive the sheer folly of fearing the lesser thing and yet daring the greater feared of the laughter of fools that is but as the crackling of thorns under the pot and not feared of the wrath of him that liveth for ever and everwhich is able when he hath killed to destroy body and soul in hell oh the folly and blindness of human nature selwick hall march ye vii was ever any creature so good as this dear aunt joyce of ours this morrow when all were gone on their occasions saving her and father and nell and me up cometh she to father that was sat with a book of his hand and saith aubrey father laid down his book and looked up on her thou wert so good as to tell us three mornings gone saith she that thine income was three hundred pound by the year right interesting it were for i never knew the figure aforetime well saith father laughing but i hope continueth she thou didst not forget what thou didst know aforetime that mine is two thousand my dear joyce saith father and held forth his hand my true sister i will not pretend to lack knowledge of thy meaning thou wouldst have me draw on thee for help to pay walters debts nay not so saith she for i would pay them all out look thou to do the same at once should inconvenience me but a trifle and to do it at twice nothing at all but dear joyce i cannot quoth he nay not for thy sakei know thou wouldst little allow such a pleabut for walters own to do thus should be something to ease myself at the cost of a precious lesson that might last him his whole life i take thy meaning saith she yet i cannot sleep at ease if i do not somewhat give me leave to help a little if no more might not that be done yet leave wat his lesson well dear heart this i promise thee saith father that in case we go abegging we will come first to the manor house at minster lovel after which you shall get no farther saith aunt joyce but i want more than that aubrey i would not of my good will tarry to help till thou and lettice be gone abegging i can give the maids a gownpiece by now and then of course and so ease my mind enough to get an halfhours nap but what am i to do for a nights rest father laughed come a word in thine ear saith he aunt joyce bent her head down but then pursed up her lips as though she were but half satisfied at last will that not serve saith father smiling on her ay so far as it goeth she made answer yet it is but an if aubrey life is a chain of ifs dear joyce saith he truth saith she and stood a moment as if meditating well saith she at last half a loaf is better than no bread at all so i reckon i must be content with what i have but if i send thee an whole flock of sheep one day and to lettice the next an hundred ells of velvet prithee be not astonied father laughed and said nought of that sort should ever astonish him for he knew aunt joyce by far too well selwick hall march ye ix we were sat this morrow all in the little chamber at work and i somewhat marvelled what was ado with mother for smiles kept ever and anon flitting across her face as though she were mighty diverted with the flax she was spinning and i guessed her thoughts should be occupying somewhat that was of mirthful sort at last saith aunt joyce lettice what is thy mind alaughing at i have kept count and thou hast smiled eleven times this halfhour come give us a share good fellow mother laughed right out then and saith why joyce i knew not i was thus observed of a spy howbeit what made me smile that shall you know who is here to list me all the women of the house were there but milisent of the men none save ned aubrey hath had demand made of him for our milly saith mother heave he cries ned who wants her good lack lad hast no eyes in thine head quoth aunt joyce robin lewthwaite of course i can alway tell when young folks be after that game eh deary me cries cousin bess why i neer counted one of our lasses old enough to be wed how doth time slip by for sure i scarce looked for milly to go the first saith mistress martin i reckon she thought nell should have come afore for she is six years elder than milly and so she might would she have taken nym lewthwaite for father and mother were so rare good as leave her choose but i would not have taken nym so i cannot marvel at helen you see aunt saith ned answering aunt joyce i am not yet up to the game and what wilt choose by when thou art saith aunt joyce with a little laugh i know a young man that chose his wife for her comely eyebrows and an other save the mark by her french hood had i had no better cause than that last i would have bought me a french hood as fair if i had need to send to paternoster row note for it and feasted mine eyen thereon it should not have talked when i desired quietness nor have threaped scolded at me when i did aught pleased it not that speech is rare like a man joyce saith my lady stafford dear heart dulcie dost think i count all women angels by reason i am one myself quoth aunt joyce i know better forsooth methinks aunt i shall follow your example saith ned winking on me that was beside him women be such ill matter ill sheer off from em well lad thou mayest do a deal worser saith aunt joyce yet am i more afeared of wat than thee is wat the more like to wed a french hood saith ned i reckon so much saith she or a box of perfume or some such rubbish eh dear this world ned tis a queer place and the longer thou livest the queerer shalt thou find it tis a very pleasant place aunt by your leave said i thou art not yet seventeen edith saith she and thou hast not seen into all the dusty corners nor been tangled in the spiders webswell lettice i reckon aubrey gave consent oh ay saith mother in case milisent were agreeable and were milisent agreeable asks my lady stafford i think so much made answer mother and smiled none save a blind bat should have asked that saith aunt joyce but thou hast worn blinkers dulcie ever sith i knew thee eh lackadaisy but that is fifty year gone or not far thence three lacking quoth my lady stafford ill tell you what we be growing old women saith aunt joyce ned and edith ye ungracious loons what do ye alaughing i cry you mercy aunt i could not help it said i when i might speak you said it as though you had discovered the same but that instant minute well i had saith she and so shall you afore you come to sixty years or if not woe betide you dear heart aunt there is a long road betwixt sixteen and sixty cried i yet laughing there is edith right grave aunt joyce makes answer a long stretch of road and maybe steep hills child and heavy moss and swollen rivers to ford and snowstorms to breast on the wild moors ah how little ye young things know i reckon most folk should count my life an easy one beside other but i would not live it again an i might choose wouldst thou dulcie oh dear no cries my lady stafford and thou grissel mistress martin shook her head and thou lettice mother hesitated a little some part i might she saith ay some part we could all pick out that returns aunt joyce what sayest thou bess what to turn back and begin all oer again quoth cousin bess nay mistress joyce im none such a dizard as that i reckon ned shall tell you when a sailor is coming round the corner in sight of home tis not often he shall desire to sail forth back again why we reckon that as ill as may be saith ned not to be able to make your port and forced to put to sea again and when the sea hath been stormy saith aunt joyce and the port is your own home and you can see the light gleaming through the windows why it were wellnigh enough to make an old salt cry saith ned ay saith aunt joyce nayi would not live it again yet my life hath not been an hard oneonly a little lonely and trying dulcie here hath known far sorer sorrows than i yet i shall be glad to get home and lay by my travellinggear but thou hast had sorrow dear joyce saith my lady stafford gently did any woman ever reach fifty without it aunt joyce makes answer ay i have had my sorrows like other womenand one sorer than ever any knew maybe dulcie if the roads were smoother and the rivers shallower to ford we should not be so glad when we gat safe home and so he leadeth them unto the haven where they would be softly saith mistress martin ay it makes all the difference who leads us when we pass through the waters answereth aunt joyce i mind anstace once saying that most folks said she were content to go down trusting to very shallow sticksto the world that brake under them like a reed or to the strength of their own hearts that had scantly the pith of a rush but let us get hold with a good grip of christs hand and then the water may carry us off our feet if it will it can never sweep us down the stream it must spend all his force on the rock of our shelter before it can reach us in the great waterfloods they shall not come nigh him may the good lord keep us all saith mother looking tenderly on us amen saith aunt joyce children the biting cold and the rough walking shall be little matter to them that have reached home selwick hall march ye xiii walter saith father this even i have had a letter from my lord of oxenford you have so sir quoth he but not an answer to yours ay an answer to mine having come down express with the queens majestys despatches unto my lord dacre of the north but aubrey that is quick work saith aunt joyce why i reckon it cannot be over nine days sith thine were writ nor is it joyce saith father but look thou i had rare opportunities since mine went with certain letters of my lord dilston unto sir francis walsingham well i never heard no such a thing crieth she to send a letter to london from cumberland and have back an answer in nine days tis uncommon rapid surely saith father well walter my boyfor thine eyes ask the question though thy tongue be stillmy lord of oxenford hath loosed thee from thine obligations yet he speaks very kindlily of thee as of a servant note whom he is right sorry to lose you told him fatherand wat brake off short i told him my lad saith father laying of his hand upon walters shoulder that i did desire to have thee to dwell at home a season and moreover that i heard divers matters touching the court ways which little liked me was that all aubrey asks aunt joyce touching the cause thereof ay then walter breaks forth with that sudden eager way he hath which aunt joyce saith is from mother father i have not deserved such kindness from you but i do desire to say one thingthat i can see now it is better i were thence though it was sore trouble to me at the first and god helping me i will endeavour myself to deserve better in the future than i have done in the past father held forth his hand and wat put his in it god helping thee my son saith he gravely i do in very deed trust the same yet not without it walter somewhat like an hour thereafter when aunt joyce and i were alone she saith all suddenly without a word of her thoughts aforetime ay the lad is his fathers son after all if he only could learn to spell nay note the reader is requested to remember that these sums must be multiplied by fifteen to arrive at the equivalents in the present day note paternoster row was the regent street of elizabeths reign note the word servant was much more loosely used in the sixteenth century than at present any lady or gentleman however well born and educated in receipt of a salary from an employer was termed a servant the queens maids of honour were in service and their stipends were termed wages chapter ten in deep places so i go on not knowing i would not if i might i would rather walk in the dark with god than go alone in the light i would rather walk with him by faith than go alone by sight philip bliss in ediths handwriting selwick hall march the xvii helens birthday she is this morrow of the age of sevenandtwenty years being eldest of all us save anstace alice lewthwaite counts it mighty late to tarry unwed but i do misdoubt of mine own mind if helen ever shall wed with any from father she had gift of a new prayerbook with a chain to hang at her girdle and from mother a comely fan of ostrich feathers with a mirror therein set likewise with a silver chain to hang from the girdle aunt joyce shut into her hand in greeting of her five gold spanish ducatsa handsome gift by my troth but tis ever aunt joyces way to make goodly gifts my lady stafford did give a pair of blue sleeves note broidered in silver whereon i have seen her working these weeks past mistress martin a pair of lovesome white silk stockings note sir robert a silver pouncetbox a kind of vinaigrette filled with scent anstace a broidered girdle of black silk and hal a comfitbox with a little gilt spoon milisent two dozen of silver buttons and i a book of the psalms the which i wist helen desired to have cost me sixteen pence ned diverted us all by making her present of a popinjay parrot the which he brought with him and did set in care of faith murthwaite till nells birthday came and either faith or ned had well trained the same for no sooner came the green cover off his cage than up goeth his foot to his head with good morrow mistress nell and much happiness to you all we were mighty taken amused with this creature and i count ned had no cause to doubt if helen were pleased or no last came walter which bare in his hand a right pretty box of walnutwood lined of red taffeta and all manner of cunning divisions therein saith he helen dear heart i would fain have had a better gift to offer thee but being in the conditions i am i thought it not right for me to spend one penny even on a gift howbeit i have not spared labour nor thought and i trust thou wilt accept mine offering valueless though it be for in very deed it cometh with no lesser love than the rest why wat dear heart crieth nell her cheeks all flushing dost think that which cost money should be to me so much as half the value of thine handiwork that had cost thee thought and toil nay verily thou couldst have given me nought hadst thou spent forty pound that should have been more pleasant unto me trust me thy box shall be one of my best treasures so long as i do live and i give thee hearty thanks therefor walter looked right pleased and saith he well in very deed i feared thou shouldst count it worth nought for even the piece of taffeta to line the same i asked of mother nay verily not so saith she and kissed him to say wat were last howbeit i writ not well for i forgat mynheer and cousin bess the which i should not cousin bess marcheth up to nell withwell my maid thou hast this morrow many goodlier gifts than mine yet not one more useful tis plain and solid like me and forth she holdeth a parcel which being oped did disclose a right warm thick hood of black serge lined with flannel and dowlas mighty comfortablelooking mynheer cometh up with a courtesy and a scrape that should have beseemed a noble of the realm and saith he mistress helena van louvainefor that is your true name as i am assured of certaintyi a dutchman have the great honour and pleasure to offer unto you a dutch vrouw a most precious relic of your country being a stool for your feet made of willowwood that groweth by the great dyke which keepeth off from holland the waters of the sea tis true you be of the netherland and this cometh of the hollowlandfor such do the names mean howbeit do me the favour domina mea to accept this token at the hands of your obeissant paedagogus that should have had much pleasure in learning you the latin tongue had it been the pleasure of your excellent elders alack that it were not so for i am assured your scholarship should have been rare and your attention thereto of the closest nell kept her countenance which was more than ned or milly could do and thanked mynheer right well ensuring him that she should essay to make herself worthy of the great honour of coming of dutch parentage saith father drily there is time yet mynheer for what saith he to learn mistress helena the latin excellent sir you rejoice me when shall we begin mistress helenathis morrow helen laughed now and quoth shei thank you much mynheer though i am feared you reckon mine understanding higher than it demerit yet i fear there shall scantly be opportunity this morrow i have divers dishes to cook that shall be cold for this even and a deal of flannelwork to do ah the dishes and the flannel they are mine abhorrence saith mynheer they stand alway in the road of the learning nay mine old paedagogus crieth ned i reckon the dishes are little your abhorrence at suppertime nor the flannel of a cold night when it taketh the form of blankets tis right well to uphold the learning yet without nells cates and flannel your latin should come ill off the body is ever in the way of the soul saith mynheer were we souls without bodies what need had we of the puddings and the flannels or the latin sticketh in ned mischievously mynheer wagged his head at ned edward van louvaine thou wist better few folks but know better than they do mynheer saith ned yet think you there shall be lexicons needed to talk with king david or the apostle paul hereafter i trow not saith father dear heart master stuyvesant cries cousin bess but sure the curse of babel was an ill thing all oer you would seem to count it had a silver side to it it had a golden side my mistress made he answer had all men ever spoken but one tongue the paedagogus should scarce be needed and half the delights of learning had disappeared from the earth eh lackadaybut how different can folks look at matters saith cousin bess why i have alway thought it should be a rare jolly thing when all strange tongues were done away as i reckon they shall hereafter and all folks spake but plain english art so sure it should be english bess saith father smiling what an it were italian or greek good lack that could never be crieth she why do but think the trouble all men should have somebody must have it quoth he i take it what so were the tongue all nations but one should have to learn it ill not credit it sir aubrey crieth bess as she trotteth off to the kitchen it is like to be english that shall become the common tongue of the earth it cant be no elsewise mynheer seemed wonderful taken with this fantasy of cousin bess how strange a thought that saith aunt joyce bess is in good company answereth father tis right the reasoning of saint cyril when he maketh argument that the temple of god wherein the man of sin shall sit as paul saith cannot signify the christian church but wherefore good sir say you oh saith he because god forbid it should be this temple wherein we now are well it is a marvel to me quoth aunt joyce that some folks seem to have no brains is it so great a marvel saith father but they have no wit saith she why here yestereven was caitlin telling me the sun had put the fire outshed let it go out the lazy tyke as she isthen said i but how so caitlin when there hath been no sun you wist how hard it rained all day ha saith she and gazed into the black grate as though it should have helped her to an other excuse which to all appearance it did for in a minute quoth my wiseacrethen an it like you mistress it was the light a lack of power to perceive the relation betwixt cause and effect saith father drily a lack of common sense saith aunt joyce the uncommonest thing that is quoth father but wherefore should the sun put the fire out saith sir robert nay ill let alone the whys and the wherefores quoth she it doth and that is enough for me father seemed something diverted in himself but he said nought more all the morrow were we busy in the kitchen and the afternoon awork but in the even come all the young folks to keep nells birthdayto wit the lewthwaites the armstrongs the murthwaites the parks and so forth of course robin had no eyes nor ears for aught but milisent and for all master ned may say of his being so rare heartfree i did think he might have talked lesser with faith murthwaite had it liked him so to do i said so unto him at after but all i gat of my noble admiral was avast there the which i took to mean that he did desire me to hold my peace wat was rare courtly amongst all us and had much praise of all the maidens mewondered if gillian armstrong meant not to set her cap at him but i do misdoubt mine own self if any such rustical maids as be here shall be like to serve walters turn i would fain hear more of this daughter of my lord of sheffield that was his excellency but i am not well assured if i did well to ask at him or no selwick hall march ye xx tis agreed that aunt joyce in the stead of making an end of her visit when the six months shall close shall tarry with us until sir robert and his gentlewomen shall travel southward the which shall be in an other three weeks time thereafter they look therefore to set forth in company as about the twentieth of april i am rare glad and so methinks be we all to keep aunt joyce a trifle longer she is like a fresh breeze blowing through the house and when she is away as ned saith we are becalmed indeed i would by my good will have her here alway now aunt said i you shall have time to write your thoughts in the chronicle the which shall end with this month as twas agreed time quoth she and how many pages my sweet scrivener trust me but ill leave you plenty said i your part shall be a deal better worth the reading go to mistress edith saith she all the proof of a pudding is in the eating i am sure of that pudding saith milisent these rash young women maketh answer aunt joyce when thou hast lived fifty or sixty years in this world my good maid thou wilt be a trifle less sure of most things none be so sure that a box is white of all sides as they that have seen but one when thou comest to the second and findest it painted grey thou wilt not be so ready to swear that the third may not be red but we can be sure of some things at any years aunt saith milly canst thou so saith aunt joyce ah child thou hast not yet been down into many deep places so long as a goat pulls not at his tether he may think the whole world lieth afore him when he hath but halfadozen yards let him come to pull and he will find how short it is there be places milly where a man may get to that he can be sure of nothing in all the universe save god and thou shalt not travel far neither to come to the end of that cord o aunt joyce i do never love to hear such talk as that saith milly it causeth one feel so poor and mean then it causeth thee feel what thou art saith she tis good for a man to find at times how little he can do it may be good but tis mighty displeasant quoth milisent tis very well when it be no worse than displeasant aunt joyce makes answer i thought of places milly which were not displeasant but awfulwhere the human soul feels nigh to being shut up in the blackness of darkness for ever thou wist little of such things yet but most souls which be permitted to soar high aloft be made likewise to descend deep down david went deep enoughmaybe deeper than any other save christ look you he was appointed to write the psalter throughout all the ages coming of his words was the church to serve her when she should come into deep places there must be somewhat therein for every christian soul and every jewish belike ere christ came and to do that i reckon david had need to go very deep down he that shall help a man to climb forth of a well must know whereto the water reacheth and on which side the steps be list himout of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord i am come into deep places where the floods overflow me but aunt said i yet was i something feared to say it was not that hard on david it scarce seems just that he should have to go through all those cruel troubles for our good ah edith saith she the lord payeth his bills in gold of ophir i warrant you david felt his deep places sore trying but ask thou at him when ye meet if he would have missed them he shall see clearer then when he shall wake up after his likeness and shall be satisfied with it what sort of deep places mean you aunt saith helen looking on her somewhat earnestly thou dost well to ask nell quoth she for there be divers sorts of depths there be mind depths the which are at times as milly saith displeasant at other times not displeasant but there be soul depths for the which displeasant is no word when the lord seems to shut every door in thy face and to leave thee shut up in a well where thou canst not breathe and when thou seest no escape and when thou criest and shoutest he shutteth out thy prayer when thine heaven above thee is as brass and thine earth below thee iron when it seems as if no god were either to hear thee or to do for theethat is a deep pit to get in helen and not a pleasant one aunt joyce can such a feeling beat the least to one that feareth god ay it can nelly saith aunt joyce solemnly yet with much tenderness and when thou comest into such a slough as that may god have mercy upon thee and methought looking in aunt joyces eyes that at some past time of her life she had been in right such an one it sounds awful saith milisent under her breath it may be saith aunt joyce looking from the window and after a fashion as though she spake to herself rather than to us that there be some souls whom the lord suffers not to pass through such quagmires maybe he only leads the strongest souls into the deepest places i say not that there be not deeps beyond any i know yet i know of sloughs wherein i had been lost and smothered had he not held mine hand tight and watched that the dark waters washed not over mine head too far for life that word the fellowship of his passions hath a long tether for he went down to hell but aunt would you say that meant the place of lost souls saith helen i am wholesomely feared of laying down the law nell saith aunt joyce touching such matters as i can but see through a glass darkly what he means he knoweth but the place of departed spirits can it scarce fail to be aunt joyce saith helen laying down her work i trust it is not ill in me to say thus but in very deed i do alway feel feared of what shall be after death if we might but know where we shall be and with whom and what we shall have to doit all looks so dark had it been good for us we should have known saith aunt joyce and two points we do know with christ and far better is that not enough for those that are his friends if it were not so i would have told you saith my lady stafford but not how madam an it please you asks helen if there were not room if there were not happiness i take it saith aunt joyce if there were not all that for which my nature doth crave but mark you my renewed nature then surely we must know our friends again saith helen he was a queer fellow that first questioned that saith aunt joyce if i be not to know anstace morrell i am well assured i shall not know her sister joyce but thereby hangeth a dreadful question joyce answereth my lady stafford if we must needs know the souls that be found how about them that be missed aunt joyce was silent for a moment then saith she the goat doth but hurt himself dulcie to pull too hard at the tether neither thou nor i can turn over the pages of the book of life it may be that we shall both find souls whom we thought to miss maybe in the very last moment of life the lord may save souls that have been greatly prayed for though they that be left behind never wit it till they join the company above we poor blindlings must leave that in his hands unto whom all hearts be open and who willeth not the death of any sinner as his majesty is so is his mercy of this one thing am i sure that no soul shall be found in hell which should have rather chosen heaven they shall go to their own place the place they are fit for and the place they choose but how can we forget them she replieth if we are to forget them saith aunt joyce the lord will know how to compass it i have reached the end of my tether dulcie and to pull thereat doth alway hurt me i will step back by thy leave as i listed the two voices both something touched methought it should be one soul in especial of whom both were thinking and i guessed that were mr leonard norris and yet saith my lady stafford that thought hath its perilous side joyce tis so easy for a man to think he shall be saved at the last minute howsoeer he live be there any thoughts that have not a perilous side saith aunt joyce as for that dulcie my rule is to be as easy as ever i can in my charitable hopes for other folk and as hard as ever i can on this old woman joyce that i do find such rare hard work to pull of the right road i cannot help other folks lives but i can see to it that i make mine own calling sure that is the safe side i reckon the safe side ay but men mostly love to walk on the smooth side why so do i quoth aunt joyce but i would be on the side that shall come forth smooth at the end ah if all would but think of that saith my lady and she fetched a sigh we should all soon be in heaven aunt joyce made answer but thou art right dulcie he that shall leave to look to his chart till the last hour of his journey is like to reach home very weary and worn if he come at all he that will go straight on and reckoneth to get home after some fashion is not like to knock at the gate ere it be shut up the easiest matter in all the world is to miss heaven selwick hall march ye xxv this morrow milisent was avised to ask at walter in a tone somewhat satirical if he wist how his excellency did nay milly mind me not of my follies prithee quoth he flushing never cast a mans past illdeeds in his face milly softly saith mother his conscience if it be awake shall mind him of them oft enough i reckon she shall have forgotten by now how to spell his name saith father there be many such at court yet they have hearts in the court trow saith aunt joyce a few quoth father but they mostly come forth thereof for one like my lady of surreylettice will conceive methere is many a lady of richmond oh surely not aubrey crieth mother earnestly true dear heart answereth he let but a woman enter the courtany courtand verily it should seem to change her heart to stone now son of adam saith aunt joyce well daughter of eva father makes answer casting the blame on the women saith she right so did adam and all his sons have trod of his steps i thought she deserved it saith father she deserved it a deal less than he quoth aunt joyce in an heat he sinned with his eyes open and she was deceived of the serpent look you she blamed the serpent belike saith sir robert laughing i take it she was an epitome in little of all future women as adam of all men to come saith father but joyce methinks paul scarce beareth thee out i have heard folks to say paul was not a womans friend saith sir robert thats not true quoth aunt joyce why how so my mistress sir robert makes merry answer he bade them keep silence in the churches and be subject to the men and not to teach was that over courteous think you call me a frenchman if i stand that crieth aunt joyce sir robert stafford be so good as listen to me so i do with both mine ears i do ensure you saith he laughing now shall we meet with our demerits saith father i pity thee not oer much robin for thou hast pulled it on thine own head my head will stand it quoth sir robert now then mistress joyce prithee go to then quoth she standing afore himi know well you can find me places diverse where paul did bid wives that they should obey their husbands and therein hold i with paul but i do defy you in this company to find me so much as one place wherein he biddeth women to obey men and as for teaching in his epistle unto titus he plainly commandeth that the aged women shall teach the young ones moreover i pray you had not philip the evangelist four virgin daughters which did prophesy to wit preach and did not priscilla no whit less than aquila instruct apollos mistress joyce the queens bench lost an eloquent advocate in you thats a man all over quoth aunt joyce with a little stamp of her foot when he cannot answer a womans reasoning trust him to pay her a compliment and reckon that shall serve her turn poor fool a deal better than the other sir robert laughed as though he were rarely diverted dulcie may do your bidding an she list saith aunt joyce but trust me so shall not i mistress joyce therein will i trust you as fully as may be saith he yet laughing yet i pray you satisfy my curious fantasy and tell me wherein you count paul a friend to the women by reason that he told them plainly they were happier unwed saith aunt joyce and find me an other man that so reckoneth mark you he saith not better nor holier nor wiser but happier that is it which most men will deny doth it not in any wise depend on the woman saith sir robert with a comical set of his lips it depends on the man a sight more saith she but my mistress bethink you of the sawa man is what a woman makes him oh is he so crieth aunt joyce in scorn shes a deal more what he makes her a good jack a good gill saws cut two ways sir robert six of one and halfadozen of the other saith father lettice come thou and aid me saith aunt joyce here be two men set on one poor woman nay i am under obedience joyce saith mother laughing forsooth so thou art quoth she bess give me thine help i am beholden to you mistress joyce saith cousin bess but i love not to meddle in no frays of other folk i were alway learned that women were the meaner sort o th twain go thy ways thou renegade saith aunt joyce come joyce shall i aid thee quoth father nay thou hypocrite ill not have thee saith she thou shouldst serve me as the wooden horse did the trojans and she added some latin words the which i wist not note femme qui parle latin ne vient jamais a bonne fin saith sir robert under his voice that is because you like to have it all to yourselves saith aunt joyce turning upon him there be few men would not fainer have a woman foolish than learned tell me wherefore i dispute the major quoth he and shaked his head then ill tell you pursueth she becauseto give you french for your frenchparmi les aveugles les borgnes sont rois you love to keep atop of us and it standeth to reason that the lower down we are the less toil shall you have in climbing endless genealogies which breed doubts more than godly edifying saith father are we not landed in somewhat like them well sir robert ill forgive you saith aunt joyce and held forth her hand but mark you i am right and you are wrong for all that sir robert lifted aunt joyces hand to his lips with ever so much fun in his eyes though his mouth were as grave as a whole bench of judges my mistress said he i have been wed long enough to have learned never to gainsay a gentlewoman nay dulcie never learned you that saith aunt joyce i know her better your daughters may have done belike sir robert did but laugh and so ended the matter selwick hall march the xxx so here i am come to the last day of our chronicletomorrow being sunday when methinks it unseemly to write therein without it were some godly meditations that should come more meeter from an elder pen than mine tomorrow even i shall give the book into the hands of aunt joyce that she may read the same and write her own thoughts thereon and thereafter shall father and mother and anstace read it there be yet fifteen leaves left of the book and metrusteth aunt joyce shall fill them every one for it standeth with reason that her thoughts should be better worth than of young maids like us i wis not well if i have been wise on the last page or no as father did seem diverted to hear me to say i would fain be i am something afeared that i come nearer milisent her reckoning and have been wise on none but i dare say that helen hath fulfilled her hope and been wise on all leastwise aunt joyce her wisdom as i cast no doubt shall make up for our shortcomings i cannot but feel a little sorry to lay down my pen and as though i would fain keep adding another line not to have done wherefore is it i marvel that all last things without they be somewhat displeasant be so sorrowful though it be a thing that you scarce care aught for yet to think that you be doing it for the very last time of all shall cause you feel right melancholical well last times must come i count so farewell my good red book and when the queens majesty come to read thee as milly would have it may her majesty be greatly diverted therewith and when father and mother may they pardon as i reckon they shall all faults and failings thereof and in particular should they find such any displeasance done to themselves more especially of that their loving and duteous daughter that writes her name editha louvaine note at this time separate articles from the dress and fastened in when worn according to taste note silk stockings new and costly things being about two guineas the pair note timeo danaos ac dona ferentes chapter eleven the joy of harvest now that thy mercies on my head the oil of joy for mourning pour not as i will my steps be led but as thou wilt for evermore anna l waring in joyce morrells handwriting selwick hall april ye second some ten years gone when i was tarrying hither i had set round my waist a leather thong at the other end whereof was a very small damsel by name edith gee up horse quoth she gee up i say and accordingly in all obeisance i did gee up and danced and pranced like an old dolt as i am at the pleasance of that my driver it seems me that mistress edith hath said gee up yet once again and given the old brown mare a cut of her whip i therefore have no choice but to prance and if any into whose hands this book may fall hereafter shall reckon me a silly old woman i hereby do them to wit that their account tallieth to one farthing with the adding of joyce morrell i have read over the writings of these my cousins and as i am commanded to write my thoughts on that matter i must say that methinks but one of them hath done as she laid out to do that nell hath been wise on every page will i not deny at the least if not they be right few but i reckon edith hath been wise on more than the last though not on all and hath thus done better than she looked for while as to milly she hath been wise on none of her first writing and on all of her second verily when i came to read that record of february i might scarce credit that milisent was she that writ ah these young maids how do they cause an elder woman to live oer her life again to look thereat in one light it seemeth me as a century had passed sithence i were as they and yet turn to an other and it is but yestereven since i was smoothing anstace pillow and making tansy puddings for my father and walking along the garden in a dream of bliss that was never to be with one i will not name but who shall never pass along those garden walks with me never any more and dost thou think it sorrow young edith rosebud but just breaking into bloom to clasp the hand of aught and say unto it farewell last time i shall not gainsay thee all young things have such moods half melancholical half delightsome and i know when i was as much given to them as ever thou art but there be sorrows to which there is no last time that you may knowno clasping of loving hands no tender farewell only the awful waking to find that you have dreamed a dream and the utter blank of life that cometh after our worst sufferings are not the crushing pain for which all around comfort you and smoothe your pillow and try one physic after an other that shall maybe give you ease they are those for which none essayeth to comfort you and you could not bear it if they did no voice save his that knoweth our frame can speak comfort then and ofttimes not his even can speak hope ay and they that account other folk cheery and hopefulas i see from these writings that these maids do of mewhat wit they of the inner conflict and the dreary plains of despair we have by times to cross it may be that she which crieth sore and telleth out all her griefs hath far less a burden to carry than she which bolts the door of her heart oer it so that the world reckoneth her to have no griefs at all in good sooth i have found anstace right when she said the only safe confidant for most was jesu christ well it is ever best to let bygones be bygones only there be seasons when they will not be gone but insist on coming back and abiding with you for a while and one of those seasons is come to me this eve after reading of this chronicle ay joyce morrell thou art but a poor weak soul and that none knoweth better than thyself let the world reckon thee such and welcome and in very deed i would fain have christ so to reckon me for then should he take me in his arms with the little lambs in the stead of leaving me to trot on alongside with the strong unweary sheep yes they call a womans heart weak that will go on loving through evil report and good reportthrough the deep snows of long absence and the howling storms of no love to meet it and the black gulfs of utter unworthiness be it so i confess them all but i go on hoping against all hope and when even hope seems as though it died within me i go on loving still was it for any love or lovesomeness of mine that god loved me o my hope once so bright my treasure that was mine once my love that might have been every morrow and every night i pray god to bring thee back from that far country whither thou art gonehome to the fathers house if i may find thee on the road home well so much the sweeter for me but if not let us only meet in the house of the father and i ask no more i know thou hast loved many with that alloyed metal thou dignifiest by the name but with the pure gold of a true heart that god calls love none hath ever loved thee as i havemaybe none hath ever loved thee but me god knoweththee and me god careth god will provide enough o fainting heart get thee back into the clefts of the rock that is higher than thou rest and be still selwick hall april ye iii i could write no more last night it was better to cast ones self on the sand as ned saith men do in the great desert of araby and leave the tempest sweep oer ones head i come back now to the life of every daythat quiet humdrum life as milly hath it which is so displeasant to young eager natures and matcheth so well with them that be growing old and come to feel the need of rest and after all said mistress milisent a man should live a sorry life and a troublous if it had in it no humdrum days human nature could not bear perpetual sorrow and as little in this dispensation at the least should it stand unceasing joy i fell athinking this morrow how little folks do wit of that which lieth ahead now if i were to prophesy that am no prophet neither a prophets daughter what should befall these young things my cousins twenty years hereafter then would i say that it should find ned captain of some goodly vessel and husband of faith murthwaite and may he have no worser fate befall himand wat a country gentleman but i trust not wed to gillian armstrong and nell a comely maiden ministering lovingly unto her father and mother and milisent dwelling at mere lea with robin lewthwaite and edithnay i will leave the fashioning of her way to the lord for i see not whither it lieth and very like an it be his will i live thus long when the time cometh i shall see maybe not so much as one that hath fulfilled the purpose i did chalk out for them ay but the lords chalking shall be a deal better than joyce morrells i reckon my lines should be all awry for how little hath happed that ever i looked for aforetime dulcie fenton that wont to look as though it should be a sin in her to laugh had she beheld aught to laugh at hath blossomed out into an happy comfortable matron with two fair daughters and an husband that for a man is rare good unto her and lettice edencome anstace is to read this so will i leave lettice to conceive for herself what should have followed both she and aubrey shall read well enough betwixt the lines and joyce morrell that thought once to bewhat she is not is an humdrum old maid i trust a bit useful as to cooking and stitchery and the like and on whom god hath put a mighty charge of his gold and goods to minister for himbut nought nearer than cousins to give her love though that do they most rarely and god bless their hearts therefor my best treasures be in the good landall save one that the good shepherd is yet looking for over the wild hills nor hath my life been an unhappy one but for that one blank which is there day and night and shall be till the good shepherd call me by my name to come and rejoice with him over the finding of his sheep that is lost o lord make no long tarrying yea make no tarrying o my god selwick hall april ye v ned hath spoke out at last like the honest man he is and done aubrey to wit of his desire to wed with faith murthwaite she is a good maid and i cast no doubt shall make a good wife scarce so comely as her sister temperance maybe yet she liketh me the better and not by no means so fair as gillian armstrong which liketh me not at all i would with all mine heart that i could put a spoke in that lasss wheel the which she rolleth toward our walter yet this know i that if you shall give an hint to a young man that he were best not to wed with a certain maid mine head to a porridgepot but he shall go and fall o love with her out of pure contrariety men be such dolts and worser yet they will not be ruled by the women that have all the wit going master murthwaite though he say little as his wont is is nevertheless as i can see pleased enough and mistress murthwaite a deal more and openly that his lass should have caught our ned and truly our ned is no ill catch for he feareth god and hath a deal of his father in him than which i can write no better commendation wat is more like lettice ay me but is it no strange matter that the last thing ever a man or woman doth seem able to understand is that whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap that not an other thing yet for one that honestly essayeth to sow that which he would reap an hundred shall sow darnel and look confidently to reap fine wheat they sow that they have no desire to reap and ope their dull eyes in amazement when that cometh up which they have sown how do men pass their lives in endeavours to deceive god because they be ready to take his gold for tinsel they reckon he shall leave their tinsel pass for gold yea and too oft we know not indeed what we sowhere be seeds what i wis not drop them into the earththey shall come up somewhatthen when they come up briars and thistles we stand and gape on themdear heart who had thought they should be so i looked for primroses and violetsdid you so friend but had you not been wiser to ask at the husbandman who wot that you did notgood lack but i thought me wise enoughay so that do we all and alway good lord who art the only wise shake our conceits of our own wisdom lackadaisy but how easy is it to fall of a rut in thy journeying here was i but to write my thoughts touching these maids writings and after reading the same i am fallen of their rut and am going on to keep the chronicle as though i were one of them of a truth there is somewhat captivating therein and edith saith she shall continue for her own diversion to keep a privy chronicle so be it methinks as matter of understanding and natural turn thereto she is fittest of the three nell saith she found it no easy matter and should never think so to do while milisent as i guess shall for a while to come be something too much busied living her chronicle to write it for me i did once essay to do the same but it went not as i mind beyond a week or so either there were so much to do there was no time to write it or so little that there was nought to write i wellnigh would now that i had kept it up for sure such changes in public matters as have fallen in my life shall the world not see many times oer again when i was born in mdxxv was king harry the eight young and wellliked of all men and no living soul so much as dreamed of all the troubles thereafter to ensue then came the tumult that fell of the matter of the kings divorce all long of a mans obstinateness for was not my sometime lord cardinal wolsey wont to say that rather than miss the one half of his will he would endanger the one half of his kingdom right the man is that a woman should know how to bend herself to circumstances then came the troubles oer queen anne that had her head cut off and by my troth i misdoubted alway if she did deserve the same and then of the divorce of the lady anne of cleve that no gospeller did ever think to deserve the same and then of queen katherine whose head was cut off belikeeh me what troublous times were then verily looking back they seem worser than at the time they did for when things be there be mixed with all the troubles little matters that be easy and even delightsome but to look back one doth forget all them and think only of the great affairs and all the time along with this kept pace that great ado of religion which fell out in the purifying of the church men call the reformation though of a truth the papists have of late took up a cry that afore the reformation the church of england was not and did only then spring into being as good say i was not joyce morrell this morrow until i washed my face then when king harry diedand it was none too soon for this poor realmcame the goodly days of our young josiah king edward which were the true reforming of the church that which went afore were rather playing at reform mens passions were too much mixed up with it but after the blue sky returned the tempest ay me those five years of queen mary what they be to look back on howbeit matters were worser in the shires and down south than up hither old bishop tunstall was best of all the papist bishops for though he flustered much and as some thought to save himself from suspicion of them in power yet he did little more i wellnigh gat mine head into a noose for it neer was my way to carry my flag furled and father slatter that was then priest at minster lovel as i know had my name set of his list of persons suspect once come the catchpoll to mine housei wis not on what business for poor man he tarried not to tell me when i come at him with the redhot poker i never wist a man yet would stand a redhot poker with a woman behind it that meant it for him master catchpoll were wise enough to see that the penny is well spent that saveth a groat and he gave me leave to see little more of him than his flying skirts and the nails of his boots and his hat that he left behind of his hurry the which i sent down to my mistress his wife with mine hearty commendations and hope he had catched no cold i reckon he preferred the risk of that to the surety of catching a redhot poker but that giving me warning of what might followas a taste of a dish whereof more should be anon laid on my trencherupstairs went i and made up my little bundle and the next night that ever was away came i of an horse behind old dickon that had been sewer ever since father and mother were wed then fiveandthirty years gone and father slatter might whistle for me as i reckon he did when he heard it it were an hard journey and a cold for it were winter but the snow was our true friend in covering all tracks and at long last came i safe hither in the middle of the night and astonied aubrey and lettice more than a little by casting of snowballs at their chamber window at the last come the casement undone and aubreys voice saith is there any in trouble here is a poor maid by name joyce morrell said i that will be in trouble ere long if thou leave her out in this snowstorm good lack but was there no ado when my voice were known the hall fire embers were stirren up and fresh logs cast thereon and in ten minutes was i sat afore it of a great chair with all the blankets in cumberland around and over me and a steaming hot possetbowl of mine hand it was a mile or so too far i reckon for father slatter to trudge after me and if he had come id have serven him of the poker or twain if need be i guess he should have loved rather to flounder back through the snow so by the good hand of my god upon me came i safe through the reign of queen mary and when queen elizabeth came in whom god long preserve unto the comfort of his church and the welfare of england had i not much ado to win back my lands and goods truth to tell i gat not all back but what i lost was a cheap bargain where life lay in the other scale and enough is as good as a feast any day so here lie i now at anchor becalmed on the high seas if that emblem hang not together ned must amend it when he cometh unto it the day is neither bright nor dark but it is a day known to the lord and i have faith to believe that at eventide it shall be light i can trust and wait in ediths handwriting minster lovel manor house august the xxviii mdxci when i come this morrow to search for my diurnal book the which for aught i knew i had brought with me from home what should i find but our old chronicle which i must have catched up in mistake for the same and looking therein i was enticed to read divers pages and then i fell athinking that as it had so happed it might be well seeing a space was yet left that i should set down for the childre whose it shall some day be what had come to pass since they were the pages aunt joyce writ that i read and seeing that of them therein named two have reached home already and the rest of us be eleven years further on the journey it shall doubtless make the story more completer to add these lines father and mother and aunt joyce be all yet alive the lord be heartily thanked therefor but fathers hair is now of the hue of the snow though mother hath scantly any silver amongst the gold and aunt joyce wellnigh matcheth father hal and anstace be as they were with more childre round them robin and milisent dwell at mere lea with a goodly parcel belike and helen that aunt joyce counted should be an old maid is wife unto dudley murthwaite and dwelleth by skiddaw force wat is at kendal grown a good man and wise more like to father than ever we dared hope but his wife is not gillian armstrong nor any of the maids of this part but frances radcliffe niece to my lord dilston that was and cousin unto mistress jane and mistress cicely they have four boys and three maids but nell hath only one daughter that is named lettice for mother and ned is not we prayed the lord to bring him safe from that last voyage to virginia that ever sir humphrey gilbert took and he set him safe enough but in better keeping than ours for from that voyage came safe to falmouth all the ships save one and that was the admirals own they had crossed the atlantic through an awful storm and the last seen of the admiral was on the ix of september mdlxxxiii by them in the hind and when they saw him he was sat of the stern of his vessel with his bible open of his knees and he was plainly heard to saycourage my men heaven is as near by water as by land then the mist closed again oer the fleet and they saw him no more on the xxii of september the fleet reached falmouth but when and where and how sir humphrey gilbert and our ned went down he knoweth unto whom the night is as clear as the day and we shall know when the sea giveth up her dead his young widow our dear sister faith dwelleth with us at selwick hall and so doth their one child little aubrey the darling of us all i cannot choose but think never were two such sweetings as aubrey and his cousin lettice murthwaite i am edith louvaine yet i know now that i was counted fairest of the sisters and they looked for me to wed with confidence i am not so fair now and i shall never wed had things turned out other than they have i will not say i might not have done it there is no blame to anynot even to myself it was of gods ordering and least of all could i think to blame that it is onlyand i see no shame to tell itthat the man who was my one love never loved me and is happy in the love of a better than i be it so i am content i had no lovestoryonly a memory that is known to none but me though it will never give mine heart leave to open his gates to any love again enough of that it is all the better for our dear father and mother that they have one daughter left to them at the time we writ this chronicle when i were scarce seventeen years of age i mind i had a fantasy running through my brain that i was born for greatness methinks it came in part of a certain eager restless spirit that did long to be adoing and such little matters as do commonly fall to womens lot seemed mean and worthless in mine eyes but in part if i must needs confess my folly i do believe it sprang of a tale i had heard of mother touching queen katherine the last wife to king harry that was of whom some egyptian gypsy had prophesied in her cradle that she was born for a crown and ever after she heard the same the child as she then were was used to scorn common works and when bidden to her task was wont to saymy hands were made to touch crowns and sceptres not spindles and neelds needles well this tale that mother told us for our diversion when we were little maidsfor she being kendal born did hear much touching the lady maud parr and her childre that dwelt in kendal castle this tale i say catched great hold of my fantasy mistress kate parr came to be a queen according to her previsions of greatness and wherefore should not editha louvaine truly there was but little reason in the fantasy seeing no egyptian had ever prophesied of me should that be of any account which father will neer allow nor could the queens majesty make me a queen by wedding of me but methinks pride and fantasy stick not much at logic so i clung in my silly heart to the thought that i was born to be great and was capable to do great things would they but come in my way and now i have reached the age of seven and twenty and they have not come in my way nor seem like to do the only conquest i am like to achieve is that over mine own spirit which scripture reckoneth better than taking of a city and the sole entrance into majesty and glory that ever i can look for is to be presented faultless before the presence of god with exceeding joy ah editha louvaine hast thou any cause for being downcast at the exchange in good sooth this notion of mine that i can smile at now showeth one thing to wit the deal of note that childre be apt to take of little matters that should seem nought to their elders i can neer conceive the light and careless fashion wherein some women go about to breed up a child to me the training of a human soul for the life immortal seems the most terrible piece of responsibility in the whole world and now there is one story left that i must finish and it is of the other that hath got home it was five years gone and a short season after helens marriage mother was something diseased as i think touching me for she said i was pale and had lost mine appetite and my sleep belike though she wist it not twas thought that the winters at home were somewhat too severe for mine health and twas settled that for the winter then coming i should tarry with aunt joyce it was easy to compass the matter for at that time was wat of a journey to london on his occasions and he brought me early in october as far as minster lovel as for getting back that was left to see to when time should be convenient father gave me his blessing and three nobles spending money and bade me bring back home a pair of rosier cheeks saying he should not grudge to pay the bill and mother shed some tears oer me and packed up for me much good gear of her own spinning and knitting and all bade me farewell right lovingly i oerheard cousin bess say to mother that the sun should scant seem to shine till i came back the which dear mother did heartily echo saying she wist not at all what had come oer me but it was her good hope that a southward winter should make me as an other maid well i could have told her what she wist not for i was then but new come out of the discovering that what women commonly reckon the flower of a womans life was not for me and that i must be content to crown mine head with the common herb of the field but i held my peace and none wist it but aunt joyce for in her presence had i not been a day when i found that her eyes had read me through as we sat by the fire at even our two selves quoth she all suddenly without an other word afore it there be alway some dark valleys in a womans life edith i reckon so aunt said i essaying to speak lightly ay and each one is apt to think she hath no company but there be always footsteps on the road afore us child nearest of all be his footsteps that knelt that dark night in gethsemane with no human comforting in his agony there hath never been any sorrow like to his sorrow though each one of us is given to suppose there is none like her own poor little edith didst reckon thy face should be any riddle to meme that have been on the road afore thee these forty years i could not help it that gentle touch unlocked the sealed fountain and i knelt down by aunt joyce and threw mine arms around her and poured out mine heart like water with mine head upon her knees she held me to her with one arm but not a word said she till my tears were stayed and i could lift mine head again that will do thee good child saith she tis what thy body and mind alike were needing and truly mine heart as methought hath never felt quite so sore and bound from that day i know all about it edith i saw it these two years gone when i was with you at selwick and i began to fear even then that there was a dark valley on the road afore thee though not so dark as mine ah dear heart it is sore matter to find thy shrine deserted of the idol yet not half so sore as to see the idol lie broken at thy feet and to know thenceforward that it was nought but a lump of common clay no god only a lump of clay that thy foolish heart had thought to be one well all that lieth behind and the sooner thou canst turn away and go on thy journey the better but for what lieth afore edith look onward and look upward heaven will be the brighter because earth was darker than thou hadst looked for christ will be the dearer friend because the dearest human friend hath failed thine hope it is not the traveller that hath been borne through flowers and sunshine on the soft cushions of a litter that is the gladdest to see the lights of home it is nobodys fault i could not help whispering i know dear heart she saith thine idol is not broken thank god for it thou mayest think of him yet as a true man able to hold up his head in the sunlight with no cause to be shamed of the love which stole into thine heart ere thou hadst wist it alas for them to whom the fairest thought which even hope can compass is the thought of the prodigal in the far country weary at long last of the husks which the swine do eat and turning with yearning in his eyes toward the hills which lie betwixt him and the father o edith thank god that he hath spared thee such a sorrow as that it was about six weeks after that even when one wet morrow as i was aiding aunt joyce to turn the apples in her storechamber and gather into a basket such as lacked use that barbara the cookmaid come in with her hands oer flour to say mistress here at the base door is a poor blind man begging for broken victuals would you have me give him that beefbone you set aside for broth a blind man saith aunt joyce then shall he not go empty i am coming down bab and will look to him myself bring him out of the rain to the kitchen fire and if he have a dog that leadeth him find the poor animal some scrapsnow edith bring thy basket and i will take mine he hath no dog mistress saith bab twas a lad that brought him then the lad may have an apple saith aunt joyce which the dog should scantly shake his tail for go and bring them in bab i shall be after thee presently so down came we into the kitchen where was sat the blind man and the lad we set down our baskets and i gave the lad an apple at a sign from aunt joyce which went toward the blind man and gan ask him if he were of those parts he was a comely man of i would judge betwixt sixty and seventy years and had a long white beard he essayed to rise when aunt joyce spake nay sit still friend saith she i dare reckon thou art aweary ay saith he in a sad tone weary of life and all things that be in it ay so quoth she and how then of thine hope for the life beyond where they never rest yet are never weary mistress saith he the sinner that hath been pardoned a debt of ten thousand talents may have peace but can scarce dare rise to hope i am alway fain when a man reckoneth his debt heavy saith aunt joyce we be mostly so earnest to persuade ourselves that we owe no farthing beyond an hundred pence i could never persuade myself of that saith he shaking his white head i have plunged too deep in the mire to have any chance to doubt the conditions of my clothing it struck me that his manner of speech was something beyond a common beggar and i could not but marvel if he had seen better days and what askest friend saith aunt joyce winch turned away from him and busied herself with casting small twigs on the fire a few waste victuals if it like you mistress they will be better than i deserve and if it like me not saith aunt joyce suddenly turning back to him and methought there was a little trembling in her voice then saith he i will trouble you no further then saith she to mine amaze i tell thee plainly i will not give them to such a sinner as thou hast been by thine own confession be it so he saith quietly bowing his white head i cry you mercy for having troubled you and i wish you a good morrow that shalt thou never came from aunt joyce in a voice which was not hers didst thou count i was blind leonard leonard and she clasped his hands in hers and drew him back to the fireside bring forth the best robe and put it on him and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my love was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found my god i thank thee and then out of the white hair and the blind blue eyes slowly came back to me the face of that handsome gentleman which had so near beguiled our milisent to her undoing and had wrought such ill in derwentdale joyce he saith in a greatly agitated voice i would never have come hither had i reckoned thou shouldst wit me thou wert out of thy reckoning then she answereth i tell thee as i told dulcie years agone that were i low laid in my grave i should hear thy step upon the mould above me i came he saith but to hear thy voice once afore i die look upon thy face can i never more but i thought to hear the voice of the only woman which ever loved me in very truth and unto whom my wrongdoing is the heaviest sin in all my black calendar pardoned sin should not be heavy saith she nay quoth mr norris but it is the heaviest of all come in leonard saith aunt joyce tenderly nay my merciful joyce let me not trouble thee saith he for if thou canst not see it in my face i know in mine heart that i am struck for death i have seen it she made answer and thou shalt spend thy last days no whither but in the manor house at minster lovel nor with any other nurse nor sister than joyce morrell leonard for forty years i have prayed for this day dash not the cup from my lips ere i have well tasted its sweetness i caught a low murmur from mr norris lips passing the love of women then he held out his hand and aunt joyce drew it upon her arm and led him into her privy parlour i left them alone till she called me to that interview there should be no third save god nor was it much that i heard at after some dread accident had happed him at after which his sight had departed and his hair had gone white in a few weeks he had counted himself so changed that none should know him i doubt if he should not have been hid safe enough from any eyes save hers he lived about three months thereafter never in all my life saw i man that spake of his past life with more loathing and contrition even in death raptures of thanksgiving had he none he could not as it seemed rise above an humble trust that god would be as good as his word and that for christs sake he that had confessed his sins and forsaken them should find mercy he alway said that it was one word of aunt joyce that had given him even so much hope she had said to him that day in the copse after she had sent away milisent and mei shall never give thee up leonard i shall never cease praying for thee till i know thou art beyond all prayer it was those prayers joyce that brought me back he said after mine accident i had been borne into a cot by the wayside where as i lay abed in the back chamber i could not but hear the goodman every day read the scriptures to his household those scriptures seethed in mine heart and thy prayers were alway with me it was as though they fitted one into the other i thought thou hadst prayed me into that cot for i might have been carried into some godless house where no such thing should have chanced me but ever and anon mixed with gods word i heard thy words and thy voice seemed as if it called to mecome back come back i thought if there were so much love and mercy in thee there must be some left in god the night that mr norris was buried in the churchyard of minster lovel as we sat again our two selves by the fireside aunt joyce saith to me or maybe to herself i should think i may go now whither aunt said i home edith she made answer hometo leonard and anstace and to christ the work that was set me is done nunc dimittis domine dear aunt joyce said i i want you for ever so long yet if thou verily do edith saith she i shall have to tarry and surely she that hath borne forty years travel in the darkness can stand a few days more journeying in the light i know that when the right time cometh my father will not forget me the children may by times feel eager to reach home but the fathers heart longeth the most to have them all safe under his shelter and very gravely she addedthey that were ready went in with him to the wedding and the gate was shut up the end
