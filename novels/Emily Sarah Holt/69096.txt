outward things while keeping at thy side content to fill a little space so thou be glorified miss waring in a large bedroom on an autumn afternoon two girls were divesting themselves of their outdoor attire after a walk they were dressed alike though their ages were eleven and nineteen their costume consisted of brown stuff petticoats over which they wore cashmere gowns of a white ground covered with brownstemmed red flowers and edged with quillings of green ribbon these dresses were high in the back and on the shoulders but were cut down square in the front the sleeves reached to the elbows and were there finished by white muslin frills the girls wore highheeled shoes the heels being red and brown worsted stockings which the petticoat was short enough to show plainly on the dressingtable before them lay two tall white muslin caps called cornettes abundant in frills and lace but having no strings the hair of both girls was dressed high over a frame standing up some three inches above their heads and when the elder put on her cap it increased her apparent height by at least three inches more the chamber in which they were dressing was long and low two large beams being visible in the ceiling and the casement not two feet in height ran nearly across the width of the room there was a faint delicate scent of lavender the furniture comprised a large fourpost bedstead an unwieldy wardrobe a washstand a dressingtable and two chairs the carpet was only round the bed and washstand the rest of the floor being left uncovered and shining with age and use the walls were wainscoted about halfway to the ceiling the higher portion being painted a dull lightgreen the girls turned to leave the room o lucy your cornette lucyaged elevenmade a dash at the dressingtable and seizing her cap by its frills to the severe detriment of the lace stuck it on her head in the first way that occurred to her and was about to rush downstairs without further ceremony that will not do lucy said the elder girl you know what henrietta will say go to the mirror and put your cornette on properly muttering something which sounded like a statement that she did not care what henrietta said lucy retraced her steps to the glass pulled off the cornette and stuck it on again in a style very little better than before this done she joined her sister who was halfway down the stairs it was a fine old wooden staircase which the girls descended worn by the feet that now were silent and at its base a long narrow passage stretched right and left our young friends turned to the right and after passing on for a few feet entered a door on the left hand which led to the family parlor this room had already three occupants two young ladies and a boy of fourteen the two former were dressed like lucy and her sister except that the younger of them who sat at a tapestryframe in the corner of the room wore broad pieces of brown velvet round her neck and wrists the boy who was equipped in outdoor costume part of which consisted of a pair of thick and preeminently splashed boots sat on a low chair staring into the fire whistling and playing with a ridingwhip lucy your hair was the shocked exclamation with which the newcomers were received oh my hair is all right i brushed itthis morning said lucy the last words in a much lower tone than the rest and then she asked of her whistling brother have you heard anything charley charley shook his head without ceasing to whistle harry is not come yet no said charley in a very discontented tone and he has taken bay fairy and i cant go out tis enough to provoke a saint that bent you master charley said a new and cheery voice as an elderly woman appeared carrying a little teatray from behind the heavy japanned screen which stood near the door she was dressed in a black woollen gown low in the neck with a white muslin kerchief above and a cap of more modest pretensions than those of the young ladies what does the impertinent old woman mean by calling me a sinner inquired charley addressing himself to his boots you bent said old cicely setting down the teatray well stand up and let us look at you do you are the first ever i see that wasnt no sinner to which cutting observation charley replied only by banging the door between himself and the unwelcome querist ay it bent for none of us to set ourselves up i thatns meditatively remarked old cicely in her turn to the teapot mrs henrietta theres a poor old man at the yarddoor my dear and i cant tell where to look for madam maybe youd see to him poor soul henrietta the eldest sister answered by quitting the room cicely arranged the teacupslarge shallow cups of delicate chinaon a small round table in the window the tea is ready mrs bell she said will you please to pour it the decorated young lady who sat at the tapestryframe rose languidly and began to pour out the tea while cicely set four chairs round the little table having done which the latter calmly took one of them herself and producing a large colored handkerchief from her pocket carefully spread it over her black woollen dress well truly said she for she was in a talkative mood this evening there is no end to the good in a dish of tea i am sorry i ever said what i have done against it my dears and i wish madam would drink it tis so heartening like it is a newfangled sort of drink theres no denying but surely i wonder how we ever got on without it cicely said henrietta coming in i have told dolly to give the poor man some meat and dry straw in the shed for tonight very good mrs henrietta answered cicely ill see as he gets it mrs bell ill be obliged to you of another dish of tea there were only four teadrinkers in this family and until a few months previous there had been only three the gentlemen despised what they considered a washy and exclusively feminine beverage and the mistress of the house could by no means be induced to taste it it was a newfangled drink she said and newfangled things of whatever description she abhorred people never drank tea when she was a child and why should they want it now this was madam passmores logic and under its influence she drank no tea still she did not forbid her daughters indulging in it young people she allowed were given to newfangled things and could be expected to be wiser only as they grew older she was a little annoyed when the logic of the young people adverse to her own made a teaconvert of cicely aggett who was about twentyfive years her senior but madam passmore was a quiet passive sort of woman who never kept anger long and was in her heart a fatalist what must be must be she used to say and many a time had she consoled herself with this comforting adage under troubles of various kinds she said so when her son harry went into the army she said so when her husband broke his leg in foxhunting and she said so but with tears when her little daughter margaret died she had no political opinions but those of her husband who was a fervent whig but deep down in her heart she was a profound tory in all domestic matters for she disliked change and novelty beyond everything she never put down a new carpet until the old carpet was quite beyond endurance not from any parsimonious motive but simply because she liked best those things to which she was most accustomed she never would have slept with comfort if her bed had been turned with its side to the wall instead of its back nor would she ever have conceded that a new lamp burnt half so brightly as the old one her surviving family consisted of two sons and four daughters who were remarkably alike in personall but one the neighbors who were sufficiently high in position to visit with squire passmore of ashcliffe often wondered how it was that celia passmore was so unlike every other member of the family they were tall and stately in figure she was small and slight they had abundant light hair hers was thin and dark their eyes were blue or gray hers brown most of all was she unlike her twinsister isabella who was considered the beauty of the family and was very well aware of it there was nothing remarkable about any of the others but celia some said was sadly plain poor girl and it must be a great mortification to madam passmore who had been a country belle in her young days cicely aggett whom we have seen seated at the table with her young mistresses was one of a class wholly extinct in our days she was a dependent but not a servant she had some fifty years before this been madam passmores nurse and she now filled a nondescript position in the family of her nursling she was always ready to help or advise and considered nothing beneath her which could add to the comfort of any member of the family but she took all her meals in the parlor and was essentially one of themselves she was the confidante of everybody and all knew that she never abused a trust madam passmore would as soon have thought of turning the dog out of the room before making a confidential communication as of turning out cicely simply because cicelys doglike fidelity was completely above suspicion the tea was now finished lucy who had not yet arrived at the dignity of a teadrinker was roaming about the room as cicely departed with the teatray there is harry she exclaimed looking out of the window he must have some newshe is waving something above his head henrietta may i run and meet him henrietta gave consent and away went lucy at the top of her speed down the broad avenue which led from the house through the park the young officer was trotting up on bay fairy with his spaniel pero panting after him but he reined in his horse as lucy came up to him a victory he cried a victory at malplaquet a glorious victory run lucya race who will tell father first lucyif it were possible there was very little doubt of that she ran back as fast as she had come turning her head once to see how harry was getting on he was not urging his horse beyond a walk it was evident that he meant to give her a chance of winning she ran towards the stableyard where she knew that the squire was and at last arriving triumphantly first at the yardgate burst suddenly into the arms of her father as he was just opening the gate to come out hallo said the squire when this unexpected apparition presented itself hoitytoity what is the matter lucibelle avictory was all that lucy could utter where who told you he asked excitedly harry said the panting lucy somewhere infrance i thinktis aqueer name in france sir at malplaquet said harry who now rode up quickly having goodnaturedly allowed his little sister the pleasure of winning the race a great victory under the duke of marlborough and he handed the gazette to his father that is glorious said the squire i will go in and tell mother not that motherthat is madam passmorecared anything about victories but she liked to see her husband pleased and would have welcomed equally a victory or a defeat which had wrought that desirable end harry walked into the house with his father and lucy having regained her breath followed them why charley where have you been asked the squire as that young gentleman made his appearance here is a splendid victory over the french and you are not here to cheer where have i been repeated charley in a very glum tone well i like that i have been at home sir kicking my heels together for want of anything else to do your party and harry had taken all the horses i did not know you wanted fairy charley said harry kindly i am sorry i took her come my lad no use in crying over spilt milk said the squire it is saturday night charley and people ought to be at peace on saturday night i hate saturday nights and sundays too and i dont want to be at peace said charley walking off on that afternoon while harry was riding home with the news of the victory of malplaquet an event was taking place in london which the family at ashcliffe little imagined yet which very nearly concerned one of them in an upper room of a house in holborn bars sat half a dozen men in conclave the door of the chamber was double the inner of green baize the outer of strong oak barred and bolted as if the conference were desirous to avoid eavesdroppers at one side of the table sat three men all of whom had passed middle age we have little to do with them so they may be succinctly described as two short men and one tall one opposite stood three others who were all young and it is with one of these alone that we are intimately concerned he was about twentysix years of age tall and slight he wore a black wig and his eyes also black were peculiarly brilliant and penetrating yet his complexion was moderately fair and he was not devoid of a fresh healthy color there was great quickness combined with some natural grace in all his motions and he evidently comprehended the meaning of his elder and slower companions before their sentences were above halffinished here brother cuthbert are your instructions the tall man was saying you remember i am sure the private orders which i gave you a week past with reference to certain information to be gained and brought to the king perfectly fatherall of them replied cuthbert in a clear pleasant voice very well now listen to another order my lady ingram writ to the general a month past to send on an errand for herif it might be done with any other we should haveone of our number who could be trusted for secrecy speed diligence and discretion we have named you brother cuthbert bowed low in answer this matter of her ladyships pursued the tall man is of course of secondary importance and may not indeed directly conduce to the interests of the church it must nevertheless be borne in mind that should the sons die unmarried as it is desirable the elder should the daughter will become heir to the ingram estates i mentioned something of this to you last night brother cuthbert bowed again moreover for other reasons known to the general it was thought desirable to grant her ladyships request your destination in the first place is exeter where you will be met by my lady ingrams gentlemanusher mr gilbert irvine who is able to give you any information concerning her affairs which you may find it necessary to ask from exeter you will proceed after doing your business there to ashcliffe hall an old mansion on the road to moreton hampstead belonging to one john passmore a whig country gentleman here is a sealed paper which you will open at exeter it contains further instructions a plan of ashcliffe hall and various notes which you may find useful and here are ten guineas which my lady ingram has transmitted mr irvine will accompany you to ashcliffe and you can employ or dismiss him at that place as circumstances may arise in the mean time we recommend to you not on any consideration to neglect either the general and constant necessity of serving the church as the opportunity may present itself nor the special secret service on which you go touching the king and cause if you require more money apply to any one of us three we rely upon you not on the one hand to be more lavish of either time or money than is necessary nor on the other to leave the work only halffinished i will do my utmost father to order myself by your instructions replied cuthbert lifting his head you will supply yourself with a surname which even mr irvine must not know not to be your real name select one which shall not be so uncommon as to attract notice nor so common that letters would be likely to miscarry you can consider this at your leisure and let us know tomorrow of what name you have thought since we shall not require you to set out before tomorrow evening what say you to stevens suggested cuthbert in a moment a grave consultation among the elder jesuits followed ending with the approval of cuthberts suggestion you are very young my brother to be trusted with so grave and important a matter as his majestys errands are warned the elder priest in conclusion we have relied upon your ingenuity and devotion let us not have cause to regret choosing you you will not do that father answered cuthbert not so much proudly as coolly and confidently and making his adieux to the conclave mr cuthbert stevensfor so we must henceforth call himwithdrew from the room we shall see him again shortly but for the present we must return rather more rapidly than he could travel to ashcliffe hall celia said lucy to her sister a few hours later as the latter tucked her up in bed do you thinkis it verydid you hear what charley said about sunday yes dear charley was in a passion and did not mean what he said i hope but do you think that it isvery wickedto get so tired on sunday asked lucy slowly as if she were half afraid of bringing her thoughts to light for i do get dreadfully tired celia sermons endless sermons all day long for as if the sermon in church were not enough father must needs read another at home on sunday nights celia do you think it is very wrong to get tired of sermons i suppose said celia thoughtfully that must depend on the sort of sermon i never seem to get a chance of hearing any sort but one said lucy and i cant understand them well lucy it is not pleasant to be obliged to sit still and listen to what you do not understand celia admitted oh i get so tired said lucy flinging herself on another part of the bed as if the very thought of the coming sunday fatigued her dont take the light away just yet celia no dear i have my clean ruffles to sew on for tomorrow answered celia sitting down to her work celia do you understand dr braithwaites sermons not always remember what a learned man he is lucy we must not expect very wise men to talk like you and me i wish he did not know quite so much then said lucy i could understand him if he would talk like you aught i can do for you mrs celia my dear asked old cicely looking in prithee give me those ruffles you have been sewing all day cicely asked lucy returning to the charge do you understand dr braithwaites sermons no my dear scarce a word said cicely i wonder at your listening so quietly well you see my dear i has my thoughts said cicely fitting the ruffle if aught goes on that i cant understand why i has my thoughts when master reads a sermon of an evening well sometimes i understand and sometimes not if i do well and good but if i dont i can sit and think and i think miss lucy that theres a deal of difference between you and me but theres a cruel deal bigger difference between either of us and him up yonder it must be a sight harder for us to understand him than it is to understand parson braithwaite but what has that to do with it cicely asked lucy wonderingly why my dear bent that what all sermons is forto teach us to understand god just the beginning you know must be hard it always is why when madam had me learned to readold madam your grandmother my dearsdo you think i liked learning the christcrossrow wasnt it very hard think you keeping day after day asaying a b c d when there wasnt no sense in it but tis all through the christcrossrow that ive learned to read the book eh but i have thanked old madam many a hundred times for having me learned to read the book well my dears tis always hard at the beginning and sure the beginning of learning him must be harder nor learning to read why cicely you are as bad to understand as dr braithwaite maybe so my dear if a little one asked you for to tell him what big a was like i think youd scarce make him understand without showing him and if you want to know what he is like i think you must read the book tis like a picture of him i dont know any other way without you read the book do you mean the bible cicely but dr braithwaite does not say much about that i havent got nought to say about parson braithwaite miss lucy but surely all that is good in any sermon or aught else must come out of the book but we could read that at home so we could my dear mores the pity as we dont but theres somewhat in the book about thatas we bent to stop going to church where is that cicely i never saw it i havent a good memory not for particular words my dear and i cant tell you without i had the book but tis there certain sure celia had been quietly looking in her little bookcase while cicely was speaking it contained many things beside booksbaskets pincushions bottles of hungary and lavender water and other heterogeneous articles but there were about half a dozen books absolutely her own and one of them was a biblea bible which she very rarely opened she acknowledged to herself with a feeling of shame looking for it and bringing it out she secretly wiped the dust from the covers and offered it to cicely here is one cicely can you show us what you mean not in your book mrs celia if i had my own book i could my dear tis chokefull of marksbits of worsted mostly i often have it lying open by me when im adarning stockings or some such work and if i finds a particular nice bit why down there goes a bit of worsted into him eh but i have some fine bits marked with them worsted my dears if you havent read the book you dont know what nice reading there is i think i will read it said lucy gaping you cant without you have glasses my dear said cicely quietly finishing off the ruffle glasses why cicely exclaimed lucy yes miss lucy glasses was cicelys persistent answer not such like as i works with my dear them is earthly glasses but there is heavenly glasses and you cant rend the book without and you must ask him for them he is sure to give them if you ask him i think i could find that bit mrs celia if you will give me bold celia passed the bible to the old woman and she opening at the first chapter of st matthew slowly traced the lines until she reached the passage which she wanted now look here mrs celia this is him celia took the book and read where cicely pointed if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him stop a bit said old cicely that bent just the one i meant lets look a bit on after a little more searching she discovered her text read that please mrs celia she said celia read in a low tone if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him lucy seemed to have dropped asleep cicely asked celia how shall we know if we have the holy spirit feel him my dearfeel him said cicely with a light in her eyes i reckon you dont want telling whether you are happy or not do you no indeed replied celia smiling no more youll want to be told whether you have him resumed old cicely triumphantly but how did you get him given pursued celia why my dear i wanted him and i asked for him and i got him tis just so simple as that i never knew aught about it till i read the book im only a very simple ignorant old woman my dear maybe the reason why i dont know no more is just that i am such a dunce he cant learn me no more because i havent no wits to be learned youve got plenty of wit mrs celiayou try why just think the lots of things you know more than me you can write and make figures and play pretty music and such like and i know nought but sewing and dressing meat and drink and reading the book mayhap the lord gives me fine things to think about just because i know so little of other thingsa sort of making up like you see but you try it mrs celia my dear i fear i scarce have your glasses cicely answered celia with a sigh ive done the ruffles now said cicely rising you come to me into my little room when youve time mrs celia and ill show you some of them fine bitsany time you like and as to the glasses you ask for em goodnight mrs celia ashcliffe hall was up at six on weekdays but when the sunday came round it was not its custom to rise before eight costumes were resplendent on that day and took some time in assuming on sundays and special galadays only the young ladies wore hooppetticoats and patched their faces their attire today comprised quilted petticoats of lightblue satin silk brocaded gowns extremely long in the waist cornettes of lace lacetrimmed muslin aprons white silk stockings and shoes with silver buckles their gowns too had trains which for comfort were fastened up behind looking like a huge burden on the back of the wearer they looked very stiff as they rustled down the stairsall except lucy whom no costume on earth could stiffen though even she wore a graver and more demure air than usual which perhaps was partly due to the coming sermons the girls drank their tea lucy joining them in the meal but using milk instead of the fashionable beverage by the time they had done madam passmore and the squire were downstairs they always breakfasted in their own room on sunday mornings then john the old coachman slowly drove up to the front door the great familycoach drawn by two large dappled longmaned and heavylooking horses the coach held eight inside so that it conveniently accommodated all the family cicely included with the exception of charley who generally perched himself on the great box which was quite large enough to admit him between john and the footman the church was barely half a mile from the hall but none of the ashcliffe family ever thought of walking there such a proceeding would have involved a loss of dignity it was a fine old gothic edifice one of those large stately churches which here and there seem dropped by accident into a country village whose population has dwindled far below its ancient standard the pews were about five feet high the church having been recently and fashionably repewed there was a great pulpit with a carved oak soundingboard an equally large readingdesk and a clerks desk the last occupied by a little old man who looked coeval with the church the squire bestowed great attention upon the responses which he uttered in a loud sonorous tone but when the psalm was overone of sternhold and hopkins version for ashcliffe church was much too old and respectable to descend to the new version of tate and bradyand when the clergyman had announced his text which the squire noted down that in the evening he might be able to question charley and lucy concerning itno further notice did anything obtain from the owner of ashcliffe hall settling himself into a comfortable attitude he laid his head back and in a few minutes was snoring audibly madam passmore generally made efforts more or less violent to remain awake for about a quarter of an hour and then succumbing to the inevitable followed her husbands example henrietta kept awake and immovable so did harry but isabella generally slept for above half the sermon and lucy would have followed her example had she dared the fear of her eldest sister just opposite her keeping her decorous the discourse was certainly not calculated to arouse a somnolent ear dr braithwaite generally began his sermon in some such style as thisthat most learned doctor of the schools styled by them of his age the angelical doctor whose words were as honey yea were full of sweetness and delight unto the ears of such as followed him did in that greatest and most mellifluent of the writings wherewith he regaled his study did i say observe for the edification of the whole church and the great profit of them that should come afterand then came a showerbath of latin dashing down upon the unlearned ears of his congregation greek he rarely quoted since there was no one in the parish who understood it but himself so that it was but seldom that he impressed the farmers with a due sense of the heights and depths of his learning by uttering a few words of that classic tongue and whether his quotation were from pindar or st paul made no difference to them until her conversation with lucy and old cicely on the previous evening celia had been in the habit of considering the sermon as something with which she had nothing to do except to sit it out with patience and decorum she was beginning to think differently now and she tried hard to follow dr braithwaite this morning through his discourse of an hour and threequarters but the sentences were long the style involved and the worthy doctor had got hold of a very unpromising subject he was preaching upon the ceremony of baptism in the primitive church and its relation to the heresy of the manichans and after half an hour during which she felt confused amid a throng of exorcisms white robes catechumens deacons immersions fireworshippers arians pelagians and gnostics celia gave up her hopeless task old cicely sat quite still her eyes fixed on the closed prayerbook on her knee a soft pleased smile every now and then flitting across her countenance and celia longed to know of what she was thinking which appeared to be so much more interesting than dr braithwaites manichans in a cheery sunny little room on the afternoon of the same sunday sat old cicely with her bible on her lap there were several unoccupied rooms in ashcliffe hall and cicely had chosen this as hers where the evening sun came lovingly in and dwelt for a season with lingering beams on walls and furniture the same pleased smile rested on the old womans lips as she slowly traced the words with her finger along the page for cicely read with little fluency and she said half aloud though she was alonehe hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him bent that good now may i come in cicely asked a soft voice at the door surely my dear surely was the answer im just alooking over some of them fine bits where i has my marks ill set a chair mrs celia but the chair was set already and celia sat down by the old woman now show me what you like best she said well my dear i do read most of these here four tis all good you knowthe very best of reading of course but i can understand these here bestmatthew mark luke and john theres nice reading in lukevery pretty reading indeed but the beautifullest of em all my dear thats john he is upanddown like is john you see i cant get used to the book like as you would theres five bits of johntwo long uns and two little uns and one middling now the last of em i dont understand tis main hard only a bit here and there but when i do come to a bit that i can understand tis fine to be sure but tis this piece of him after luke that i reads mostly and the next piece of him after that look it was an old worn book bound in plain brown calf which lay on cicelys lap the pages were encumbered with an infinitude of ends of worstedblack brown and gray these were cicelys guideposts she was slowly pursuing the lines with her finger till she came upon the passage which she wished to find now my dear you read that celia read and this is the promise which he hath promised us even eternal life wait a bit cried old cicely theres another in this big piecea rare good un let me find him and turning hastily over the leaves of her book she picked out by the help of the worsteds the verse she wished read that mrs celia and this is life eternal that they should know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent bent that nice delightedly asked old cicely but how are we to know him said celia wearily o cicely i wanted to ask you of what you were thinking this morning in the sermon which pleased you so mightily you smiled as if you were so happy did i my dear answered old cicely smiling again well i dare say i did and i was cruel happy thats sure twas just these two verses mrs celia as ive been ashowing you id read em last thing yesterday and surely they did feel just like honey on my tongue so as i couldnt nohow make out what parson braithwaite were asaying about them many keys i falls back you see on my two verses well thinks i if he has promised us sure we need not be afeard of losing none of it if you promise somebody somewhat my dear mayhap afore you come to do it youll feel sorry as youve promised and be thinking of harking back as jack says but there is no harking back with him i think afore he promises he looks of all sides and you know if he sees everything no wonder he promises so sure well then i thinks again what has he promised us eternal life why thats another bolt like put on the door if tis eternal life surely we cant never let it go no more but cicely interrupted celia dont you feel that you are often doing wrong of course i am so my dear said cicely every day in the yearay and every minute in the day but then you see i just go to the book look what i was areading when you came in she pointed to the verse which had engaged her for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we should be made the righteousness of god in him look there mrs celia heres one that did no sin and yet bare the punishment that our sin must needs have and if he bare the punishment that did no sin then belike we must go free for whom he bare it dont you see tis just a matter of fair dealing the law cant punish bothhim as did the wrong and him as didnt so the other must go free but we must do something to please god cicely we must have something to bring to him it cannot be that jesus christ hath done all for us and we have but to take to ourselves what he hath done and to live as we list well my dear said cicely ive got my thoughts upon that too you look here i dont find as ever i did a thing to please god afore i took him that died to stand for me i never cared aught about pleasing him and do you think hed be like to be pleased with such work as that if he can see into our hearts why it must be just like talking and do you think madam would be pleased with me however well i sewed and swept if i just went saying forever tis not to please you im working i dont care a bit about you i think i do want to please him said celia slowly dont you stick at thinking child said old cicely with a pleased look go on to knowing my dear well then as to bringing something to him look here in this other part cicely turned to isaiah and after a little search pointed out a verse which celia read but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away if the queen was acoming this way my dear and we was all of us agoing out to see her what would you think of me if you see me ransacking the house for all the foul clothes i could find to tie up in a bundle and saying there im agoing to give these to the queen wouldnt you think i was only fit for bedlam you see it dont say all our iniquities are as filthy rags we should be ready to own that dear no tis all our righteousnesses will you tell me then what we have to bring to him that is above all kings and lords well and last of all as to living as we list i do find that mostly when we have made it up like with him we list to live after his ways not alwayssurely not always she added sadly shaking her head truly we are a pack of goodfornoughts een the best of us yet it do hurt to think as weve grieved him when we come to see all he has done and will do for us thems my thoughts upon that mrs celia why did you never speak to meto any of usin this way before now cicely asked celia very thoughtfully and gravely truly my dear i take shame to myself that i never did replied cicely but you see there was two reasons firstly tisnt so very long since i come to know it myselfleastwise not many years then you see when i did know i hadnt the face like for a good while seemed so bold and brassy like for me to be atalking i thatns to the likes of you as knowed so much more than me and somehow it never seemed to come natural till last night and then it come all at once out of what miss lucy she said about parsons sermons celia remained silent for a minute the mention of dr braithwaites sermons had opened up a vein of thought she wondered if anywhere there were men who preached sermons of a different kind from his such as she and even old cicely might understand and from which they could derive benefit was there any preacher who instead of enlarging on the angelical doctor was satisfied to keep to jesus christ and him crucified a wild desire sprang up in her heart to go to london and hear the great men who preached before the queen she did not mention this to cicely celia knew full well that it would appear to her not only preposterous but absolutely perilous harry was the only member of the family who had ever visited the metropolis and this by virtue of her majestys commission the squire considered it a hotbed of all evil physical moral and political had he walked down the strand he would honestly have suspected every man he met to be a jesuit in disguise or at the least a jacobite which he thought scarcely better he believed that the air of the capital was close and pestilential that all honesty and morality were banished from its borders that all the men in itwith the exception of the duke of marlborough and the whig ministerswere arrant rogues and all the womenexcluding the queen and the duchess of marlboroughwere heartless and unprincipled there was some ground for his belief but he sometimes excepted the wrong persons all these facts and feelings floated through celias mind and she felt that to bring her wishes to light would probably hinder their accomplishment she sat silent and thoughtful cicely she asked at length rather abruptly do you not find some parts of the bible very hard to understand a vast sight my dear said cicely a vast sight sure theres a deal thats main hard to a poor old ignorant body such as me then what do you do cicely when you come to a piece that you cannot understand leave it alone my dear theres somewhat about the middle of the booki cant say the words right never has em patabout the road being made so straight and smooth like that the very fools cant shape to lose the way well i think the books a bit like that itself for i am a fool mrs celia and i wont go to deny it surely god will show me all i want and all thats meant for me thinks i and so what i cant understand i think bent for the likes of me and i leave it to them tis meant for now all about those jews on their way to the promised land and the forty years they spent in the wildernessi cannot see what that has to do with us eh mrs celia my dear dont you go to say that urged old cicely earnestly wasnt they hardhearted and stiffnecked folks and bent we hardhearteder and stiffneckeder but is it not very gloomy cicely to be always thinking of death and judgment and such horrid things said celia with a little shudder never thinks about em my dear was old cicelys short answer why cicely i thought religious people were always thinking about them dont know nought about religious people as you call em said cicely never came across one all i know is i never thinksnot any whileabout death and judgment and such like you see i havent got to die just nowwhen i have itll be a hard pull i dare say but theres dying grace and theres living grace he dont give dying graceat least so i thinktill we come to dying so i leave that alone he knows when im to die and hell be sure to see to it that i have grace to die with and as to the judgment my dear i have no more to do with that than the othera sight less it seems to me for we have all got to die but if i understand the book right them that trust in him havent no judgment for to stand if he has taken all my sins away what am i to be judged for dont you see mrs celia eh no tis not we need think over the judgment but the poor souls that have to stand itwho will not take christ and have nought of their own celia sat silently gazing out of the window on the fair sward and trees of ashcliffe park she had not found any answer when lucy burst in with no previous ceremony and with the exclamation what are you doing here celia didnt you hear the bell for the sermon oh me i wish it was over perhaps lucy was not the only person who wished it the sundayevening sermon at ashcliffe was a rather fearful institution to more mature and sedate persons than she first one of the squires sonsharry when he was at home charley if notread the psalms and lessons for the day and it was necessary that they should be read very loud this was disagreeable when they contained a number of hebrew names which charley at least had no idea how to pronounce he was consequently reduced to make hits at them which passed muster in all but very flagrant cases as fortunately for him his father was little wiser than himself this ordeal over the sermon itself was read by the squire and commonly lasted about an hour and a half it was never very entertaining being most frequently a discourse on the moral virtues in tone heathenish and in style dreary beyond measure after the sermon the whole family repeated the lords prayerany other prayers the squire being a layman would have thought it semisacrilege to read then all remaining in their places charley and lucy were called up to repeat their catechism each answering alternately and standing in as stiff a position as possible when this was over they had to repeat the text of dr braithwaites sermon and that one who remembered it best was rewarded with a silver groat this was the last act of the drama the young lady and gentleman being then pounced upon by cicely and ordered off to bed after saying goodnight all round the squire finished the day with a bowl of punch and a game of cards or backgammon in which it never occurred to him to see any incongruity with his previous occupations later came supper after which the ladies retired leaving the squire to finish his punch alone and the whole household was in bed by ten at the latest the sermon this evening was a discourse upon covetousnessa vice to which none of the hearers were addicted and after listening to a learned prologue concerning the common derivation of misery and miser with a number of quotations and instances to show it celias thoughts began to wander and roamed off once more to her conversation with old cicely the gazette sir said harry coming into the room in boots and spurs one morning about three months after the sunday in question great tumults in london regarding one dr sacheverell who hath preached a jacobite sermon and much inflamed the populace and tis said the queen will not consent to his being deprived likewise hang all jacobites cried the squire likewise pursued his son tis said the pretender will take a journey to rome to speak with the pope and hang the pretender twice over and the pope three times thundered his father hardly necessary sir though you might find it agreeable observed harry in his courtly way moreover tis thought he is gathering an army wherewith he means to come against our coasts if any evil should chance to her majesty let him come growled the squire well send him packing in half the time anything else i see nothing of import replied harry handing the newspaper to him who is dr sacheverell harry asked celia from the window where she sat with her work there is but little regarding him was the answer he is of derbyshire family and was sometime tutor at oxford twas on the th of november gunpowder plot day last that he preached before the corporation of london saith one of the newspapersi brought the newsletter as well as the gazetteand speaking upon perils among false brethren which he chose for his discourse he denounced the bishops and the lord treasurer and spake of the lords who aided in the revolution as men that had done unpardonable sin where is all that in the gazette asked the squire turning the little sheet of paper about and looking down the columns to catch the name of the obnoxious preacher not in the gazette what i said last sir answered harry tis in the sermon whereof i brought a copy thinking that you might wish to see it the bookseller of whom i had it told me that a prodigious number had been sold methinks he said thirty thousand thirty thousand sermons exclaimed lucy under her breath leather and prunella observed the squire from behind his gazette maybe so sir responded harry very civilly yet a sermon sold by the thousand one would think should be worth reading hold your tongue lad men dont buy what is worth reading by the cartload growled the squire tis only trash that is disposed of in that way very likely sir responded harry as before yet give me leave to ask how many prayerbooks have been printed in england since the reign of queen elizabeth the squire only grunted being deep in the gazette and harry turned his attention elsewhere i should like to have heard dr sacheverell said celia timidly nonsense celia answered isabella from her embroideryframe you dont want to hear a man preach treason i was not thinking of the treason sighed celia celia why do you want to hear dr sacheverell asked charley as he sat on the step of the dais which elevated the window above the rest of the chamber celia hesitated colored and went on with her work without answering she and charley were alone in the room if you wanted to hear what he had to say about what they call treason you dont need to be afraid of telling me said charley i dont know whether i shall not take up with treason myself o charley exclaimed celia dont talk in that way think how angry father would be if he heard you o celestina exclaimed charley in his turn this was his pet name for his favorite sister had she possessed a long name he would probably have abbreviated it as she had a short one he extended it o celestina i am so tired of being good i am tired of sundays and grammar and the catechism and sermons and keeping things tidy and going to church and being scolded andim tired of everything said charley suddenly lumping together the remainder of his heterogeneous catalogue charley said celia slowly and wonderingly i am and i am half determined to go off and have no more of it father may say what he likes about treason and hang the pretender as often as he pleases but i say tis a grand thing to think of the kings son whom we have kicked out living on charity in a foreign land and trying with such wonderful patience to recover the throne of his fathers i should like to be with him and bivouacisnt that what harry calls itbivouac in forests and march on day after day always seeing something new and then at last have a battle wouldnt it be glorious for you to fight with harry and one of you kill the other no i dont think it would i didnt say anything about fighting with harry resumed charley a little sulkily no i should not like that but as to anything else i just tell you celia that if some day i am not to be found you will know i am gone to st germains to fight for the kingthe king and charley drew himself up at least two inches as he said the last words hush charley do i wont hush and i really mean it charley i shall have to tell father if you talk any more nonsense like that said celia really alarmed celia do you know what it is to feel downright wicked asked charley in a different tone yesnonot as you mean i fancy no i dont think you do i wish you did charley well i mean i wish i didnt father talks of hanging things i feel sometimes as if i could hang everything me demanded celia smiling no i wouldnt hang you and i wouldnt hang mother pursued charley meditatively nor bay fairy nor lucy nor the black cat nor harryi think not nor cicely except first thing in a morning when she rouses me up out of a nice sleep or last thing at night when she packs me off to bed whether i will or not i am not sure about father as to the rest they would have to look out for themselves now charley said celia laughing celia you dont know what it is to feel wicked i wish i could get something to make menot keep good because i have to dobut make me want to be good celia was silent for a moment then she said very slowly and hesitatingly charley i suppose we shall only want to be good when we want to please god and to be like jesus christ i dont know anything about that said charley turning round to look at her i know very little about it said celia blushing but i have begun to think charleyonly just latelythat we ought to care more about pleasing god than anything else is that what makes you such a darling of a sister said charley ill think about it if it be you are always trying to please everybody it seems to me but i dont think i could keep it up celia i dont care much about pleasing anybody but myself charley said his sister with a great effort there is a verse in the bible which i was reading this morningeven christ pleased not himself she spoke very shyly but she loved this younger brother dearly and longed to see him grow up a really great and good man and she found it easier to talk to charley lucy and cicely than to others she would not have dared to quote a text to henrietta well but you know we cant be like him said charley reverently we must before we can go to heaven well then i might as well give up at once answered charley beginning to whistle oh no charley dear said celia so earnestly that charley stopped whistling and looked up in her face he will help us to do right if we try i do want you to grow up a good man loving god and doing good to men wont you ask him charley well perhapsill see about it said charley as his sister stroked the light hair affectionately away from his brow at any rate i dont think ill go to st germains just yet you are a dear old celestina tennyson idylls of the kingenid the alphabet which in the hornbooks was surmounted with a cross and the lines christs cross be my speed in these

presented him to st andrews holborn in and after some years spent in comparative obscurity he died on the th of june sidney godolphin earl of godolphin ii a bat behind the wainscot he gazed on the river that gurgled by but he thought not of the reeds he clasped his gilded rosary but he did not tell the beads if he looked to the heaven twas not to invoke the spirit that dwelleth there if he opened his lips the words they spoke had never the tone of prayer a pious priest might the abbot seem he had swayed the crosier well but what was the theme of the abbots dream the abbot were loath to tell w m praed harry said celia coming down with her cloak and hood on one fine day in the following spring one of the pegs in the closet in our room is loose will you make it secure for us while we are walking the whole family were going for an excursion in the woods as it was lucys birthday and harrys sprained ankle kept him at home he could stand without pain for a short time but could not walk far and a horse would not have been able to carry him through the thick underwood delay was suggested but as lucy very truly if somewhat selfishly asserted another day would not have been her birthday all things considered the squire had decided that the excursion should not be put off and the party set out accordingly after they were gone harry went up to celias room to see what would be required the setting to rights of the offending peg was soon effected he was retiring from the closet when he set his foot upon a little round substance which he guessed to be the head of a nail sticking up from the floor of the closet close to one of the back panels ah observed harry apostrophizing the nail you must come out you will be tearing miss lucys gown and she wont like having to mend it harry accordingly proceeded to attempt the removal of the nail but he found to his surprise that neither his hand nor his tools seemed strong enough to pull it out its position close to the back of the closet made it all the more difficult was it really a nail he looked at it more closely it had a brass head and harry came to the conclusion that it was a knob placed there on purpose but for what purpose it would go neither backwards nor forwards but when harry tried to pull it to one side to his astonishment a little door flew open so neatly fitted into the closet floor as to defy detection the nail or knob being fixed in the midst below the little door appeared a tiny box with a second brass knob fixed in it at the bottom was a brass plate from a small round hole in which the knob protruded now then remarked harry let me look at you what are you for he very soon discovered that upon touching it the moment that the little knob was pushed inwards the whole panel in the back of the closet suddenly sprang back showing that it was in reality a concealed door the catch closing it having been liberated by pressing the little knob in the tiny box what was behind the door it was impossible to see without a candle for the closet was a deep one and the opening of its door cut off the light from the bedroom window harry quietly came out of the closet locked the bedroom door and went to his own chamber to fetch a taper and his sword he was determined to follow up his discovery the light of the candle revealed no array of skeletons but a narrow passage which he saw on stepping into it to be the head of a very narrow spiral staircase with the candle in one hand and the sword in the other harry in whose mental vocabulary fear had no place calmly walked down the staircase the excitement of the adventure overpowered any pain which he felt from his ankle a faint smell of dried roses met him at the foot of the stairs on the right hand stood a heavy door harry gave it a strong push and being unlatched it slowly opened and admitted him he stood in a very small square chamber there was no window a table was in the middle two chairs stood against the wall and in one corner was a handsome chest on which two books were lying all the furniture was of carved oak harry opened the books and then the chest the former were a latin missal and breviary the latter was occupied by a set of church vestments a crucifix a thurible and sundry other articles whose use was no mystery to the travelled discoverer so you are a priests hidingplace said harry dryly to the concealed chamber so much is plain they say mass at this table well i did not know we had one of these at ashcliffe i wonder how many years it is since this was inhabited i protestupon my word i do believe it is inhabited now he had suddenly perceived that while on the stairs the dust lay thick there was none resting on the furniture within the chamber books chest chairs tableall bore evidence of having been used so recently that no considerable accumulation of dust had time to gather on them harry looked coolly around and descried another door opposite to the one by which he had entered opening this he found himself at the summit of a second spiral staircase down which he wentdown down until he fancied that he must be descending below the foundations of the house at length the spiral form of the staircase ended and a further flight of steps ran straight down harry wondered whether he was going into the bowels of the earth but he kept onwards until once more stopped by a door this door opened readily being unlatched like the others and he looked out into darkness casting his eyes upwards he saw in the direction wherein he supposed the sky should be a small round patch of blue well you were a cunning fox who planned this hole thought he one end opens into the closet in celias room and the other into the old well in the garden there must be some means of climbing up out of the well i presume and the worthy gentleman who makes this his abode is probably well acquainted with them i wonder if my father and mother know of this if not i had better make up the entrance and not tell them my mother would be too frightened to sleep in any peace if she knew that such a place was hidden in the house and my father would rouse all devonshire about it i wonder too who they are that use it are they still priests or jacobite fugitives or are they highwaymen whatever they be i must make up this door as soon as i am a little better able to exert myself thus thinking harry withdrew from the secret chamber and regained celias room pulling to the door he found that the panel and the hidden box closed each with a spring he left the bedroom and went downstairs meditating upon his discovery a fortnight later when his ankle had regained strength he took the opportunity when both the sisters were out to make a second visit to the secret chamber he found its arrangements slightly altereda proof that its mysterious occupant had been there within a few days the books were gone and one of the chairs was now standing by the table harry dragged some ponderous logs of wood to the outer door which led into the well and by means of these barricaded the door effectually against any return of the refugee during the interval he had taken the opportunity of asking a few questions of different persons which might give him some idea whether they were aware of the existence of this concealed chamber mother he asked one evening when madam passmore had been lamenting the sad fact that things wore out much sooner than when she was a girl had you ever any of that fine carved furniture like madam harveys no my dear not a bit said his mother bell he asked on another occasion do you ever hear rats or mice in your wainscot oh they tease me infinitely answered isabella they make noises behind the wainscot till i cannot sleep and for the last week i have put cotton wool in my ears to keep out the sound cicely he inquired lastly did you ever see a ghost no master harry i never have replied cicely mysteriously thus hinting that there might be some people who had done so i never see one nor never want but they do haunt old houses thats a truth how do you know that if you never saw one laughed harry well my dear exclaimed cicely if youd a been down with me in the scullery one night last weeki couldnt sleep and i went down for to get a bit of victuals and washed my hands in the sculleryi say if youd aheard the din they made over my head you might have thought somewhat who made it cicely them said cicely in a mysterious whisper nay i never saw none but my grandmothers aunts motherinlaw she did ah she is a good way off us said harry satirically but you know this house is rather too new for ghosts a fine old castle now with all manner of winding stairs and secret passagesthat would be the place to see a ghost eh my dear dont you give me the horrors cried cicely why i could never sleep in my bed if i lived in a place where them secret places and such wasno never lie quiet i couldnt nay master harry nobody never seed no ghosteses in this house ive lived here eightandtwenty year come martlemas and i ought to know and pray cicely who was your greatgrandmothers first cousins niece or whatever she were and what did she see my grandmothers aunts motherinlaw master corrected cicely she see a little child in a white coat how very extraordinary commented harry gravely master harry im certain sure you dont believe a word of it for all you look so grave said old cicely shaking her head sorrowfully i cant say that i do at present but you see i have not heard the particulars yet then you shall master said old cicely rather excitedly twas at dagworth in suffolk in the house of one master osborne where she served as chambermaid he had been a while in the house had the ghost and nobody couldnt get to see himno not the parson though he used to reason with him on doctrine and godliness they oft heard him acalling for meat and drink with the voice of a child of one year which meat being put in a certain place was no more seen he said his name was malke and after a while one day she spoke to him and begged him for a sight of him promising not to touch him whereupon he appeared to her as a young child in a white coat and told her that he was a mortal child stole by the goodfolk and that he was born at lanaham and wore a hat that made him invisible and so quoth he doth many another he spoke english after the manner of the country and had many roguish and laughterstirring sayings that at last they grew not to fear him how long did he stay there now you are asking me more than i know master but dont you never go to say again that theres no such things as ghosteses when my grandmothers aunts motherinlaw seen him with her own two eyes and mr osborne kept no dogs or cats i suppose master harry you dont believe it well to be sure i never did youll be saying next thing that theres no such things as the goodfolk when ive seen their dancingrings on the grass many a hundred times im sore afeared master harry that it havent done you no good agoing for a soldieri am and harry found that all his arguments produced no further effect than the conviction of old cicely that he had been in bad company from the information thus gained however he formed these conclusionsfirst his mother knew nothing about the secret chamber secondly cicely was equally ignorant thirdly it was situated as he had surmisedabove the scullery or behind itprobably bothand below his sister isabellas bedroom fourthly it had been inhabited as recently as the preceding week all the more reason he thought for stopping up the means of ingress and all the more for not revealing to old cicely that her ghost was in all probability a popish priest on the evening of the spring day upon which harry thus barred the refugee out of his hidingplace celia was strolling through the park alone she fed the fawns and the swans on the ornamental water and wandered on with no definite object until she reached the boundary of her fathers grounds she sat down on the grass near a large laurel and became lost in thought there happened at this place to be a small gap in the hedge near her through which her position was plainly observable from the road she started as she heard a sudden appeal made to her young madam pray you a penny for the love of god celia turned and looked at the speaker he was a dark goodlooking man dressed in clothes which had once been handsome but were now ragged and threadbare his eyes dark sunken and very bright were fixed earnestly upon her she held out to him the penny for which he asked when he said abruptly your pardon madam but are you squire passmores daughter yes i am celia passmore she replied thinking nothing of the query be not too certain of it answered the stranger softly god and our lady bless you and gently taking the offered coin from celias hand he withdrew before she could recover from her horror at the discovery that she had been conversing with a papist when she recovered herself his words came back to her with strange meaning the blessing she took to be merely his way of thanking her for the alms which she had bestowed but had he not told her not to be too sure of something of what had she said anything to him beyond telling her name celia concluded that the poor fellow must have been wrong in his head and began to feel very compassionate towards him she sauntered back to the house and into old cicelys room where she found its occupant mending stockings with her old brown bible lying open on the table before her cicely i have had such an odd adventure have you so mrs celia what was it my dear why a poor man begged of me over the hedge and said such strange thingsasked me my name and told me not to be too sure of it was it not droll instead of a laugh rising to her lips as celia expected a strange light sprang to old cicelys eyes as she lifted her head and gazed at her not a glad lightfar from it a wild startled sad expression which celia could not understand ay sweetheart said the old woman in a voice not like her usual tones did he so and what manner of man oh not badlooking answered celia a comely man with black hair and eyes his clothes had been good but they were very bad now and he was a papist for he said our lady bless you a papist cried old cicely in a voice of horror yes said celia smiling at her tone why cicely are you afraid of being murdered because there is a papist in the county eh no my dear answered old cicely slowly thats not it poor soul god comfort you when you come to know come to know what cicely what youve never been told yet my dearand yet he told you if you did but know i dont understand you cicely i am glad you dont my dear but tell me what you mean no mrs celia ask madam if you must tell her what you have told me but if youll take my counsel youll never ask her as long as you live cicely what riddles are you talking replied celia i will ask mother the opportunity for doing so came the next day about an hour after dinner madam passmore sat knitting peacefully in her especial chair in the parlor henrietta was absent superintending household affairs and isabella with the velvet ornaments tied round her neck and arms was occupied as usual with her endless embroideryframe we shall have an assembly on monday observed madam passmore speaking to nobody in particular that is right said isabella rather less languidly than usual i am so glad who are coming mother dr braithwaite and his wife squire and madam harvey and squire and madam rowe nobody else asked isabella in a disappointed tone well that i dont know child answered her mother maybe some of the young folks may come from over the hill are they coming to dinner no for the afternoon put on your blue satin petticoats girls and your best gowns and bell bid harry to have ready the bassettable in the corner we will draw it out when tis wanted but you will have dancing mother said isabella in a tone which indicated that her enjoyment would be spoilt without it please yourself child said madam passmore i dont know who youll dance with unless johnny and frank rowe should come the old folks will want no dancing i should think they would rather have a quiet game how tiresome said isabella well i dont think so replied madam passmore when you come to my time of life you wont want to be sent spinning about the room like so many teetotums yet i was reckoned a good dancer once to be sure and you liked it mother asked celia yes i suppose i did i was young and foolish said madam passmore with a little sigh but really when you come to think it over tis only fit for children i think i would rather have a good game of hunttheslipperthere is more sense in it and quite as much moving about and a great deal more fun so very vulgar sighed isabella contemptuously very vulgar madam bowed harry who had entered while his mother was speaking almost as vulgar as eating and sleeping i wish you would go away harry i dont like arguing with you by all means madam said harry bowing himself out of the parlor madam passmore laughed well girls she said i think i shall have to give the ladies some tea though it is a newfangled drink and as you are used to pour it for your sisters bell you had better take the charge of it very well mother and celia can you get some flowers and bits of green from the evergreens they will look better than nothing in the jars that great laurel at the other end of the park can spare some and as you take long walks i leave that to you o mother suddenly cried celia in a voice which showed that her thoughts were on anything but evergreens i want to tell you something yesterday i was sitting by that great laurel when a man begged of me through the hedge i gave him a trifle and he asked me if i were squire passmores daughter i told him yes my name was celia passmore and he told me in answer not to be too certain of it was it not droll but the thing yet more strange was that when i told cicely of it she said i had better tell youno she said i had better not tell youbut that you could tell me what it meant if i asked you so very strange what did it mean mother madam passmore was silent for a few moments when she spoke it was to say in quite another tone softer and tenderer than her previous one thou art nineteen celia my dear yes mother answered celia rather surprised at the information i was nineteen on the third of june ay born the same year as bell said madam passmore gravely and celia thought a little sadly well i will tell thee my dear for thou oughtest to know and thou art now a woman grown ay i will tell thee but wait until tuesday after the assembly will be better squire passmore was riding leisurely home after having himself carried the invitation to his old friends mr and mrs harvey of ellersley he had nearly reached his own gates when he suddenly pulled up to avoid running over a pedestrian the latter met him as he turned a corner and was apparently too deeply engaged in his occupationthat of searching into a portfolio in his handto see any one coming he was a young man of some sixandtwenty years and the brightness of his dark penetrating eyes struck the squire as he looked up and hastily drew to one side with an apology your servant sir i beg your pardon for my carelessness another time said the squire in his hearty voice i should advise you to delay looking into your portfolio till you are round the corner thank you for your advice which i shall certainly take returned the young man might i askcan i be mistaken in thinking that i am addressing squire passmore of ashcliffe hall my name is john passmore said the squire and i live at ashcliffe do you want anything with me i thought i could not be mistaken answered the young man with a very deferential bow my object in addressing you sir is to request the very great favor of your permission to take a few sketches of your fine old hall i am sketching in this neighborhood in the employ of sir godfrey kneller the great london painteryou have surely heard of himand if a good sensible whig interrupted the squire if you want to sketch the hall for him you shall have leave to draw all the four sides if you like you are a painter are you i thought you must be some sort of a moonstruck fellowpainter author or what notthat you did not see me coming permit me to express my very great obligations said the artist might i venture so far as to ask your leave to take one sketch inside i have been told there is a fine carved oak staircase come and dine with me replied the squire heartily and sketch the staircase by all means we dine at twelve oclockoldfashioned folks mri have not the pleasure stevens sircuthbert stevens at your serviceand very much ah odd name cuthbert but an old nameyes a good old name tomorrow at twelve mr stevensvery glad to see you and away rode the hospitable and unsuspicious man leaving on the face of cuthbert stevens a look of amused contempt moonstruck he whispered to himself we shall see which is the cleverer john passmore esquirewe shall see lucy my dear said the squire to his wife when he came in i have asked a gentleman to dinner tomorrowa paintermaking sketches for sir godfrey knellermonstrous clever fellowtake your portrait in no timewants to draw the hall when the squire conveyed his information in this abrupt and detached style madam passmore knew from experience that he was not altogether satisfied with his own act and desired to justify himself in his own eyes he was in truth beginning to feel rather uneasy though he called the artist a monstrous clever fellow he had not seen a single sketch he had taken the man on his own word and at his own valuation he had yielded to the charm of his voice and manner and now that this was withdrawn he began to doubt whether he had done well in introducing a complete stranger into the bosom of his family so madam passmore seeing this and also acting on her favorite maxim of what must be must quietly said very well john and left her husband to his own devices noon came and with it mr cuthbert stevens the squire inspected him as he entered and could find nothing with which to be dissatisfied his taste in dress was excellent his manners were faultless and the squire began to think his first thoughts had been the best dinner passed without a single contretemps the stranger talked with the squire about hunting and poaching and was quite alive to the enormities of the latter to charley upon snaring rabbits and making rabbithutches to henrietta and isabella upon the fashions and london life with which he seemed perfectly familiar and told madam passmore of a new method of distilling cordial waters of which she had not previously heard of celia he took little apparent notice the family began to think that they had lighted on a very agreeable and accomplished man and when dinner was over and the sketch of the staircase madewhich latter the squire though no artist could see was a faithful copy and pronounced as like as two peasthe stranger was pressed to remain longer but this offer with many thanks mr stevens declined his time he said was growing short and he must make all possible use of it he had still several sketches to complete before quitting the neighborhood but he could assure mr passmore that he would never forget the kindness shown him at ashcliffe and would inform sir godfrey of it on his return to london well sir if you will remain no longer said madam passmore her kind heart compassionating his probably precarious circumstances you will put one of these raised pies in your pocket for your journey i think you liked them at dinner the artist gratefully accepted the offer with a very respectful bow he took leave charley volunteering to accompany him to the gate there was a good deal of conversation on the way through the park chiefly on charleys side the stranger contenting himself with an occasional simple and careless query at the gate they partedcharley to run home at the top of his speed and mr stevens to walk rather quickly for half a mile in the direction of exeter having so done he turned aside into a coppice bordering on the road and slackening his pace commenced whistling a lively air the verse was still unfinished when an answering whistle of the same tune was heard and the man who had accosted celia over the hedge came in view advancing to meet him well gilbert was the artists greeting any good news the same that i left you with father said the elder man in reply and if you call it good news you have the heart of a stone i am all but famished and sicktired of being cooped up in that miserable hole and the inquiries gilbert you told me all that before you know and much you cared about it answered gilbert illhumoredly kicking some dead sticks out of his way inquiries no of course nothing has come of them except what we knew before that she passes as the third daughter and she is short and dark stevens sat down on a green knoll what a surpassing clever man you are gilbert irvine he observed well father cuthbert you are uncommon complimentary remonstrated gilbert leaning back against a tree seven mortal weeks have i been cooped up in that doghole with as much to eat as a sparrow and wearing myself out dodging about to get a glimpse of this girlall to please my lady and you never slept in a bed except just these four nights we have been at exeterand the only reward of my labors which i have seen anything of yet is to be told i am an ass for my pains because of course that is what you mean my excellent gilbert your temper is a little below perfection you shall see what a mistake you have made look at me i have just been dining with squire passmore gilberts mouth opened for an exclamation but shut again without one as if his astonishment passed the power of words to express now why could not you have done the same seven weeks you have been here as you say and caught one glimpse of the girl and i who have not been here as many days have already seen and spoken to her and found out more about her than you have and i have dined like a prince in addition while you are pretty near starving gilbert nice consolation that is to give to a famished wretch snarled gilbert father cuthbert you have a heart of stone not quite so hard as that my friend answered stevens feeling in his pocket and bringing out of it the pie i only wished to show you what a very ingenious fellow you were eat that where did you get it was all the thanks gilbert vouchsafed it was offered me and i accepted it said stevens i never say no thank you to anything good always take all you can get gilbert gilbert was too busy with the pie to answer now listen gilbert i was wise enough to take no notice of the girl that any could see but i studied her quietly and i sounded the youngest brother well i am satisfied that none of them know who she is and i imagine only the parents know any thing at all she seems very comfortable and well taken care of and will probably be in no haste to leave at least so i judge from what i can see of her disposition which is quiet and timid then father cuthbert i wish you would wait a minute tis ill talking between a full man and a fasting do let me finish this pie in peace finish it gilbert and much good may it do you but how did you get in was the question that followed the last mouthful of the pie i represented myself as an artist in the employ of sir godfrey kneller did you ever see him i once had him shown to me in london and i asked leave to draw the hall and the staircase inside i knew after that mr passmore would ask me to dinner can you draw if i could not my friend i should have been unwise to take that character i can do a good many things you are a more ingenious man than i am father you are not far wrong there gilbert complacently assented the disguised priest but i cannot believe father pursued gilbert that you came over from france only to see sir edwards daughter i protest gilbert you are even more surpassing than i took you for it must be your conversation with that jezebel of yours which has dulled your wits you were a sharper fellow once you are welcome to revile my wife as much as you please father said gilbert calmly i cant think how in the world i ever came to marry the daughter of an old ranting canting covenanter the devil must have set me up to it probably he did my friend was the reply of cuthbert but to relieve your mind i came here on secret serviceyou will not ask me what it was suffice it you to know that it was at once for church and king well sighed gilbert the church is infallibleis she notand immortal she will get along all right but for the king an expressive pantomime of gilberts hands and shoulders completed the sentence fainthearted gilbert asked stevens with a smile fainthoping father said he the king will never have his ain again ay that song you were whistling by way of signal is to me the saddest of all our songs tis easy to chant it was a for our richtfu kingor i can even stand lilliburlero but the king shall have his ain againit but saddens me father cuthbert he will never have it why gilbert has your solitude made you hopeless you used to have more faith in right and in the final triumph of the good cause the cause is lost father cuthbert said gilbert stooping to pick up one of the dry twigs which lay before him tis as dead and dry as this branch and as easily to be broken by the princess and her ministers or by the elector of hanover and his as i can break thisso and the broken twig fell at stevens feet come gilbert come said stevens encouragingly remember how many friends the king has throughout england and scotland and ireland friends what are they worth asked the other good to sing awa whigs awa or to pass their glasses over the waterjug when they say the king god bless him but how many of them are ready to put their hands in their pockets to maintain your good cause how many are ready to melt down their plate as their fathers and ours did for king charles how many would die for the king now as for his grandfather then that cause triumphed gilbert said stevens suggestively did it answered gilbert more suggestively still how much worse had we been off now father cuthberthow far different if the one at st jamess had been called richard cromwell instead of anne stuart trust me england will henceforth be constant but to one thingher inconstancy she will go on as she hath gone from bad to worse with short reactions every now and then first king charlesthen my lord protectorthen a little fit of reaction and king charles again then comes king james and wounds her pride by being really a king and not a puppet and off she goes to dutch williammy lord protector over again and now the princess anne and after her gilbert after her the saints knowat least i hope they do for i am sure i dont but if these fellows had the king in tomorrow they would kick him out again the day after probably rejoined stevens calmly however it does not much matter to me i have a safe refuge in france in either casemy lady ingrams income to draw upon if we succeedand if we failwell i have friends on the other side and at the worst the jesuit college at rome would provide me with a shelter for my old age yes there is no fear for you father said gilbert but we poor wretches who have not the good fortune to be of your orderwe are proscribed exiles should we have been anything worse under oliver why you might very likely have been in the pillory said stevens and had an ear or two less than now and you might have been at tyburn gilbert took no notice of this flattering allusion he answered as if he were pursuing his previous train of thought no the king will never have his ain again there are two things that england has come to value above even her throne and her peace these are her protestantism and her liberties for these and these alone she will fight to the death of course the two monsters cannot live long together the one must devour the other in the end and whether heresy will swallow liberty or liberty eat up heresyour greatgrandsons may see but we scarcely shall on what does it depend gilbert asked stevens who seemed at once curious to draw out his companions ideas and reluctant to present his own on the man who holds the helm when the two engage in battle said gilbert thoughtfully that is a battle that may last long hinted stevens and probably will replied the other but when the present notions shall have come to their full growth as they must dowhen the king shall have permanently become the servant of the minister and the minister the mere agent of the mobwhen instead of ego et hex mens it shall have become nos without any rex at allwhen all men shake hands over the sepulchre of their religious prejudices and political passionsfather cuthbert then will be the triumph of the catholic church if only she knew how to use the intervalto be patient never to be in a hurryto instil gently and unperceivedly into mens minds the idea that all are equal have equal rights and are equally rightto work very slowly and very surely she needs but one thing more and that is the man at the helm let her choose the man he must be plausibleable to talk wellto talk in a circle and come to no conclusionto throw dust in protestant eyes the bigger cloud he can raise the better let him hold out openly one hand to protestantism and give the other behind his back to rome when the foundation is so laid and the man stands at the helmour work is finished father cuthbert but i doubt if any stuart will be reigning thennay i doubt if any will reign at all so much for england then responded stevens with a rather dubious smile and scotlandand ireland scotland said gilbert slowly i am a scot father cuthbert though tis years since i saw scotland and i tell you as a nation we are hardheaded and longsighted and we do not as a rule take up with anything before testing it but just as the sweetesttempered man can be the most terrible when he is angry so when you can throw dust in a scotchmans eyes you make him blind indeed and ireland repeated stevens the cause was lost there father on a certain st of july more than twenty years ago and as yet ireland has been rather too busy setting her own house in order to have much leisure left to meddle with ours you forget one thing gilbert said stevens gravely think how many catholic emissaries we have in ireland and scotland and how catholic the gaelic heart once was and the erse heart has ever been father cuthbert how many members of the society of jesus were in oliver cromwells army a good many admitted stevens hundreds resumed gilbert and do you think they did the cause any good well it scarce looked so at the time said stephens but in the end it seemed more like it liberty is our watchword now said gilbert liberty to do anything and everything which of course in six cases out of every ten means to do wrong so long as the church is uppermostdespotism she can allow no liberty but let the church be undermost and she must set herself to obtain it by all means liberty for the sects we ought never to forget means liberty for the church and to the church it is not of much consequence whether she herself or her friend liberty devour the dying monster protestantism when the church sits once again on the throne of great britain the first dish served up to her at her coronation banquet will be the dead body of her jackal liberty gilbert said stevens rising from his grassy seat you are not so stupid as i thought you unfortunately your talents do not lie in the particular path which circumstances have marked out for you but you have parts gilbert let us return to ashcliffe and go back to that doghole inquired gilbert suddenly subsiding into his former discontented self i fear my son gilbert said stevens placidly that the doghole will have to be your habitation for a few days longer but be comforted gilbert as soon as i can i will take your place there hope you may enjoy it muttered gilbert as they emerged on the exeter road evidence of twentyone such concealed chambers will be found in notes and queries alone they exist all over england in old houses built between the time of henry viii and that of james iipossibly later still i append the descriptions of the two which appear to have been most cleverly concealed and best preserved the first chamber is at ingatestone hall essex which was anciently a grange belonging to the abbot of barking and was in possession of the petre family from the reign of henry viii to about the secret chamber at ingatestone hall was entered from a small room on the middlefloor over one of the projections of the south front it is a small room attached to what was probably the hosts bedroom in the southeast corner of this small room on taking up a carpet the floorboards were found to be decayed the carpenter on removing them found a second layer of boards about a foot lower down when these were removed a hole or trap about two feet square and a twelvestep ladder to descend into a room beneath were disclosed the use of the chamber goes back to the reign of james i the hidingplace measures feet in length feet inch in width and feet in height its floorlevel is the natural groundline the floor is composed of inches of remarkably dry sand so as to exclude damp or moisturenotes and queries st s xi the other example is at irnham hall lincolnshire the situation of this ingeniouslycontrived place had been forgotten though it was well known to exist somewhere in the mansion till it was discovered a few years ago in going round the chimneystacks it was observed that one of the chimneys of a cluster was without any smoke or any blackness and as clean as when the masonry was new this led to the conjecture that it was not in reality a chimney but an open shaft to give light and air to the priests hidingplace yet so forming one of a group of chimneys as to obviate all suspicion of its real purpose it was carefully examined and the conjecture fully borne out by the discovery of the longlost hidingplace the opening into it was found by removing a beam behind a single step between two servants bedrooms you then come to a panel which has a very small iron tube let into it through which any message could be conveyed to the occupant of the hidingplace this panel being removed a ladder of four steps leads down into the secret chamber the hidingplace is feet long by feet broad and just high enough to allow of standing uprightnotes and queries st s xii other instances occur at oxburgh hall norfolk sawston hall cambridgeshire coldham hall suffolk maple durham watcomb and ufton court berkshire stonyhurst and berwick hall lancashire bourton gloucestershire henlip worcestershire chelvey court somerset nether witton northumberland paxhill sussex built by sir andrew borde jester of henry viii and the original of merry andrew treago hereford weybridge surrey woodcote hampshire and elsewhere in several of these instances the secret chamber was formed in the roof of the house and in two cases at least it was accompanied by a small chapel fairies the reader can appraise this ghoststory at what he thinks it worth it is not the produce of the authors imagination but may be found reported in the translation of the chronicon roberti montensis by john stowe harl ms fol b in this way the more timid of the jacobites drank the toast of the king over the water dean goodes romes tactics pp iii alone in the world speechless sorrow sat with me i was sighing wearily lamp and fire were out the rain wildly beat the windowpane in the dark we heard a knock and a hand was on the lock one in waiting spake to me saying sweetly i am come to sup with thee all my room was dark and damp sorrow said i trim the lamp light the fire and cheer thy face set the guestchair in its place and again i heard the knock in the dark i found the lock enter i have turned the key enter stranger who art come to sup with me opening wide the door he came but i could not speak his name in the guestchair took his place though i could not see his face when my cheerful fire was beaming when my little lamp was gleaming and the feast was spread for three lo my master was the guest that supped with me harriet mewen kimball grand beyond expression was madam passmore that monday afternoon whereon her party was held her hair stood at the very least six inches above her head her petticoat was of crimson quilted satin and she wore a yellow satin gown edged with rich old pointlace large silver buckles decorated her shoes and a lace cornette was perched upon the summit of her hair a splendid fan and a handkerchief nearly all lace shared her left hand and in her pocket alas dwelt a silver snuffbox her four daughters were dressed alike in their blue satin petticoats and brocaded trains with coral necklaces and cherrycolored topknots of ribbon instead of cornettes stood on the summit of their hair they also displayed fans isabella making all manner of use of hers and held handkerchiefs not quite so elaborate as their mothers their trains were not gathered up this evening so that when they walked a grand display of brocade was made on the floor about four oclock dr braithwaite and his wife made their appearance mrs braithwaite was a modest retiring little woman holding in high reverence her big learned husband but the fact of being constantly kept under the sound of quotations which she did not understand gave her a scared bewildered look which did not improve her countenance she was quietly dressed in black with lace tucker and ruffles and a white topknot on her hair which in comparison with that of madam passmore was dressed quite low goodeven madam and the young ladies said mrs braithwaite courtesying nervously i hope i see you well in health madam said the doctor bowing low over the hand which madam passmore extended to him that most marvellous and mellifluent writer of poesy of whom among the grecian dramatists the fame hath transcended squire and madam harvey said robert in a tone which drowned the doctors elaborate greek compliment this lady and gentleman lived in the great house of the next parish they were quiet people who having no children had grown somewhat prim and precise but they had honest and kindly hearts and greeted their old friends if somewhat stiffly yet cordially squire and madam rowe mr john rowe and mrs anne rowe were next announced and after a general salutation the party sat round the fire in highbacked chairs very stiff and uncomfortable the table in the window held the teatray and cicely who entered with the teapot was welcomed by all parties to whom she courtesied with hope i see you all well sirs and madams isabella her train trailing after her now approached the little table and poured out the tea cicely stood holding a waiter on which as each cup was filled she carried it in turn to the person for whom it was intended nothing was eaten with the tea tea was tea in and nothing else mr john rowe alias johnny was a slim youth of eighteen who had come to the party with the view of making himself agreeable to isabella he would scarcely have felt flattered if he had known how she regarded him she despised him supremely both on account of his slight juniority and of his taste in dress at this moment he wore yellow silk stockings green breeches a white waistcoat embroidered in blue a gray silk coat heavily laced with silver and a very large fullbottomed wig of flaxen color though his natural hair was almost black as he had also dark eyes and black eyebrows his wig certainly was not in the best taste isabella all but shuddered at his combination of colors as he advanced to salute her and did not receive him by any means warmlya calamity which he poor innocent fellow humbly set down to his want of personal merit not knowing that it was caused by the deficiencies of his costume squire passmore was nearly as smart as his young guest but he was dressed with much better taste in a dark green coat and breeches with silver lace white waistcoat and white silk stockings the party sat still and sedately on their row of chairs round the firemrs braithwaite eclipsed and silent for madam passmore was on one side of her in the yellow satin and madam rowe on the other attired in emerald green these two ladies were talking across her further on was madam harvey in dark crimson conversing with mrs anne rowe who was dressed in simple white and henrietta next to squire rowe the younger daughters of squire passmore were out of the group and so were john rowe and charley as celia crossed the room just behind the assembled elders madam rowes hand detained her come and talk with me my dear tis an age since i saw you you dont grow any taller child i have done growing said celia with a smile well so i suppose how different you are from all your sisters to be sure i am sure mrs bell must be a head taller than you are not quite so much as that said celia still smiling short and sweet madam rowe observed squire harvey who overheard her ay i wont contradict you there she said and how old are you now my dear seventeen nineteen madam dear me well how time does go to be sure you and your sister are just a year older than johnny i remember you should hold yourself up more my dear always make the best of yourself you dont bridle so well as you might either really you use not all your advantages madam rowe that is what i am always telling her said isabella with a faint assumption of energy and she takes no more notice well my dear answered madam rowe administering a dose of flattery you know we cannot all be as handsome as you isabella bridled colored and remained though silent evidently not displeased supper followed about six oclock and afterwards the bassettable was wheeled out by harry and the three squires sat down with dr braithwaite to enjoy their favorite game after basset came prayers as dr braithwaite was present of course he officiated and casting aside his cards gravely took the bible in his hand instead of them a prayer followedlong prolix involved and stony more like a sermon than a prayer nor a very simple sermon neither the party now took their leave dr and mrs braithwaite walked to the vicarage which was very near as it was only a short distance from ellersley to ashcliffe squire harvey and his wife came and returned in their coach the distance to marcombe was longer and the rowes were on horseback harry went out and assisted the ladies to mount mrs rowe riding behind her son and anne behind her father now miss lucy my dear come you away to bed said cicely taking sudden possession of that personage what could i have been thinking of not to come for you before i should like to know to think of you being up at this time a quarter to nine i do declare i dont know what you were thinking of but i wish you would think about it every night answered lucy resigning herself to fate in the person of cicely well i shall go to bed also said isabella yawning and rising from the embroideryframe i protest i am as tired as if it were sunday evening that john rowe is the most tedious young man you had better all go my dears responded madam passmore goodnight to you all goodnight celia celia fancied that her mother repeated the greeting to her with a tenderness in her voice which was scarcely usual with her was she thinking of the coming revelation she found cicely helping lucy to undress cicely she asked sitting down how do you pray oh that horrid dr braithwaite cried lucy i nearly fell asleep before he had half done make haste miss lucy my dear youd ought to have been abed long ago how i pray mrs celia why just like anybody else like dr braithwaite oh me said lucy parenthetically no not like parson braithwaite my dear why i couldnt even follow parson he said such hard words i never tried said lucy calmly im too sleepy to talk any more goodnight and she composed herself on the pillow and closed her eyes you dont pray like dr braithwaite i am sure cicely said celia but how do you pray well my dear the prayers my mother taught me there was three on emthe our father and the i believe and matthew mark luke and john i says the our father yet and i believe now and then but ive left off to say matthew and them for when i comes to think it sounds like the papishes and i dont see no prayers like it in the book neither i mostly prays out of the book now just the words that david did and moses and the like of they unless i wants somewhat very particular and then i asks for it quite simple like just as id ask you for a drink of water if i couldnt get it for myself celia lay silent and thoughtful but matthew mark luke and john roused lucy in a minute whats that about matthew cicely well my dear im not sure that tis more than foolishness but my mother taught it me and i used to say it a many years matthew mark luke and john bless the bed i lie upon four parts around my bed four angels guard my head i lay me down upon my side i pray that god my soul may guide and if i die before i wake i pray that god my soul may take o cicely exclaimed lucy laughing it does sound rather like praying to the apostles cicely suggested celia but the end of it is better thats where it is mrs celia and thats why i dropped it now dont you begin talking tonightgo to sleep theres dears therell be as many hours in tomorrow as today eh but my dear did you ask madam as i said yes cicely said celia halfrising she will tell me tomorrow the troubled look in old cicelys face deepened but she only said as she took up the light go to sleep dear hearts i ask your pardon madam said cicely courtesying low as madam passmore opened her bedroomdoor in answer to her tap but could i have a minutes speech with you if you please come in cicely and sit down is anything the matter well madam said cicely glancing round the room as if to make quite sure there were no listeners im afeared theres somewhat up about mrs celia this afternoon as i was agoing down the lane to mally rihlls with the cordial water and jelly you was pleased to send for sick robin there was a fellow met me that i didnt half like the looks of i should know him again for he stopped me and began to talkasked the way to moreton and i doubt if he really wanted to go for he took the tother turning when he come to it and asked whose the park was and if master was at home and was going on to what family he had and such like impudent questions if you want to know all that says i youd better go up and ring the bell and ask squire his own self i says well he didnt ask me no more questions after that but went shuffling on his way and took the wrong turning but when i got to mallys and while we sat a bit she tells me that my gentleman had been there asking for a drink of water and a lot more impertinence and asked her right out if there warnt a young lady at the park of the name of celia and how old she were and when her birthday were and all on like that and mallyyou know madam shes but a simple souli could hear from her story she up and told him everything he asked and maybe more than he asked for aught i know and what does he do but seeing no doubt what a simple soul she was outs with a tablebook and actually sets down in black and white what she was atelling of him the impudent rascal say i to mally when i hears that and why couldnt you have given it him hot and strong as i did i says and she says he looked so like a gentleman for all his shabby coat with nigh a quarter of a yard of lace pulled off the bottom and all aflapping about in the wind as is both full and cold today as she hadnt the heart to say nothing impertinent says she but impertinent says i i think after all the impertinence hed given you you might have give him a dose without hurting of him much says i so i thought id come and tell you madam at once you have done right to tell me cicely said her mistress i thinki am afraidthere will be some inquiry for the dear child before long well madam and thats what im afeared on too said cicely and to see mrs celia sitting there so innocent like she must know cicelyshe must know soon if i was you madam id tell her now said cicelyasking your pardon for being so bold as to say it to you yes cicely so i shall replied madam passmore in a very despondent tone madam said cicely suddenly would you be offended with me if i said a word to you my good cicely why should i speak your mind seems to me madam said cicely confidentially as you havent asked the lord about this trouble and though he knows all things yet he likes to be asked and told about em he says so somewheres now if i was you asking your pardon madam and didnt like for to tell mrs celia and im sure i shouldnt id just go and tell him itd come a sight easier would telling her after that you see madam the lord dont put troubles on us that he dont know nothing about hes tried em all himself and he knows just where they pinches and when he must needs be bring one on us or we shall be running off down the wrong road like so many chickens he whispers like with it dont be downhearted child ive tried it and i know cicely how did you come to know all this inquired her mistress in astonishment bless your heart madam i dont know nothing humbly disclaimed cicelynever did nor never shall tis with the lords lessons like as with other lessonstakes the like of me a month or more to spell out a word where there be folksd read it off plain i knows nothing only i knows the lord madam passmore made no answer but in her secret heart she wondered for the first time whether the one thing which cicely owned to knowing were not worth a hundredfold all the things which she knew sit down celia my dear i will now tell you all i know madam passmore spoke rather sadly and celia sat down with a beating heart celia said her mother again would you like me to tell you right at once or by degrees at once if you please mother let me know the worst i am not sure that i know that my dear sighed the lady however i will say the worst i know celia you are not my daughter mother was celias inconsistent but very natural exclamation i have told the truth said madam passmore gently but whowho are my father and mother asked celia in a bewildered tone i know not my dear celia only you are not our child nor akin to us i will tell thee all about it it was on the th of june my dear when bell was seven days old nineteen years ago is bell not my sister then no i know nought of any of thy kindred but hark i beg your pardon mother please go on my husband came up into my chamber where was only cicely beside with the babe on her lap and he said lucy my dear there is a strange thing happened at the park gates a little babe lies there all aloneit would move thy motherly heart to see it shall we send and take the poor little soul in i said send cicely to see and fetch it so cicely brought it ina poor weak babe that had scarce strength to breathe it was lapped in fine white linen laced with real point and there was a gold pin fastening a paper on its little coat with but one wordcelia well to be sure cicely had some work to bring it round for hours we feared it would die but at last it seemed a little easier and we thought it breathed stronger and when my husband next came up he said well lucy shall we send the babe away but i said nay john it seems fairly to ask pity from us let us keep it and bring it up as our own and call it bells twinsister it will never harm usperchance bring a blessing with it for truly it looks as if god almighty had sent it to us so we did that i do not know my dear whether it was quite right of us to call you bells twinsister i am afraid not for certainly it is not true but as to your having brought a blessing with you thats true enough but that is how it was celia sat still and silent feeling crushed and cut off from all she loved by this disclosure you have no thought she said slowly at last who i was nor whence i came well my dear my husband thought you might be the child of some jacobite forced to fly who must needs leave you behind twas plain you were not forsaken because your father was too poor to keep you for he must have been well to do to judge from the lace on your clothes and the gold pin mayhap some nobleman for aught i know mother said celia with a great effort think you that my parents whosoever they were could bepapists the last word was scarcely more than whispered it conveyed to the passmore mind the essence of all that was wrong cruel and fearful i trust not indeed my dear replied madam passmore kindly but evidently struck and distressed by celias question for i know nought now celia child dont take this to heart remember thou art as much our daughter bound to us by every bond of love and custom as before i spoke a word regarding this there is ever a home for thee at ashcliffe child and truly i scarce love my own better than i do thee let it not trouble thy mind go and chat with harriet and bell to keep off the vapors farewell my dear madam passmore kissed celia and let her go she did not follow her advice to go and chat with her sisters but walked very slowly along the passage which led to her own room she felt as if all around her were changed and she herself were isolated and lost heretofore the old house and its furniture had seemed a part of herself now they felt as if suddenly placed at an immense distance from her even the portrait in the passage of the squire passmore who had fought at edgehill brandishing his sword fiercelyeven the china dragons which faced the hallwindowold familiar objects seemed to scowl at her as she went by them she would be celia passmore no longer at another time she would have smiled at the superstitious fancyonly natural nowthat these disowned her as a daughter of the house she turned aside sadly mechanically into the little room where old cicely sat sewing and singing her joint occupations ceased when she saw celias face eh my dear i see madams told you come hither and sit down a bit is it very sore dear heart cicely do you know any more celia asked without answering her question i know nought more than madam said cicely i went and fetched you sweet heart and a nice little babe you was though you did keep crying crying on for everlasting such beauties of clothes as theyd wrapped you in i never see a bit of finer lace than was on them nor never want and the cambric was just beautiful i have them laid by if youd like to see oh let me see them cicely i meant to have asked mother what a mockery the last word seemed now cicely unlocked one of her cupboards and produced the clothes very handsome ones as she had said yellow with time and edged with rich point the gold pin was still there with the paper on which a manly yet delicate italian hand had written the one word which alone remained to celia of her unknown origin she wondered whether it were her fathers writing cicely she said suddenly was i ever baptized whether afore we had you or not mrs celia i cant say replied old cicely quietly madam thought this herepointing to the papermeant as you wasnt and theyd like you to be christened celia and master thought it meant as you was christened already so old parson herringhim as was here afore parson braithwaitehe christened you in church as it stands in the prayerbook if thou hast not been baptized or what it is squire thought thatd do either way and you saw nothing when you went to fetch me cicely nothing at all my dear there might have been somebody awatching you knowthe place is so thick with treesbut i see nought of any sort the long pause which followed was broken by cicely who perceived that celias handkerchief was coming surreptitiously into requisition if i was you mrs celia i wouldnt trouble my dear very like nobodyll ever come after you and if they did why a grown lady like you might sure say where youd bewithout your own father and mother asked you id never counsel you to go again them though it would be a sore job parting from you to be sure you see my dear youve lived here nineteen years and never a word said but that man cicely said celia under her breath well that man my dear repeated cicely doubtfully hes very like of no kin to you only somebody as knowed who you be he was a papist said celia in the same tone but even so cicely should i make no search for my father and mother i am theirs whoever they were even if they were papists and the handkerchief came out openly cry it out my dear youll be all the better for it after and if youll list me mrs celia youll never trouble no more about this by yourself but just go and tell the lord all about it he knows who they be child and he made you their child knowing it and my dear i do find tis no good to carry a burden to the lord so long as i just get up and lift it on again im very much given to lifting on again mrs celia and perchance you be but when i find that why i just go and go again till i can lay it down and come away without it takes a deal of going sometimes that do but what would you think of me if i says mrs celia you carry this linen upstairs if you please and then goes and walks off with it myself old cicelys homely illustration was just what celia wanted thank you cicely she said i will try to leave the burden behind father cuthbert stevens sat in his lodging at moreton complacently turning over the contents of his portfolio to his landlady he had told the same tale as to squire passmore representing himself as an artist in the employ of sir godfrey kneller and had to her thinking verified his story beyond all doubt by producing in partpayment of his debt a new shopsign representing a very fat and amiablelooking lion standing on one leg the other three paws flourishing in the air while the eyes of the quadruped were fixed on the spectator mrs smith considered it a marvellous work of art and cut off a large slice of mr stevens bill accordingly mr stevens passed his sketches slowly in review tearing up the greater part and committing them to the safe custody of the fire but when he came to the staircase at ashcliffe he quietly placed that in security in a special pocket of the portfolio he was too wise to speak his thoughts aloud but had he done so he would have said i have not done with this yet tomorrow i propose to pay a visit to marcombe and this will secure me an unsuspected entrance into mr rowes family where i may obtain some further information on which a little paper and lead will be well spent gilbert irvine had rather remonstrated on stevens telling the same tale to mrs smith as to the squire at ashcliffe reminding him that it was well to have two strings to ones bow stevens answered with that calm confidence in his own wisdom which never forsook him it is sometimes desirable my good gilbert not to have too many strings to ones bow this is my official residence mr passmore or some other country gentleman may find that i am lodging here what do i gain in that case by representing myself to this excellent woman as a retired seacaptain or an officer on leave of absence no i am an artist at ashcliffe and i am an artist at moreton my private residence iselsewhere i am a citizen of the world i am not troubled by any inconvenient attachment to country or home i can sleep on a featherbed a green bank or a deal board i can eat black bread as well as pt aux truffes ah but can you do without either growled gilbert in reply to return from this episode mr stevens was now alone having as we saw parted with gilbert that afternoon the latter returning to the hidingplace at ashcliffe very much against his inclination the former worthy gentleman had supped on a hashed partridge obtained in an unsportsmanlike manner which would have disgusted squire passmore for while stevens could talk glibly against poaching or anything else when he required a savory dish he was not above setting a snare on his own account he had just placed safely in the pocket of the portfolio such sketches as he deemed it politic to retain when a slight noise at the door attracted his attention and looking up he saw gilbert irvine with white face and dilated eyes standing in the doorway we are betrayed hissed the latter mr stevens rising quietly closed the door behind gilbert and set a chair for his excited visitor dont be rash gilbert observed he calmly tying the strings of the portfolio bash muttered gilbert between his closed teeth i tell you they have discovered the hidingplace have they then it was fortunate that i thought of dining today with mr passmore father cuthbert do you care for nothing on earth said gilbert raising his voice gilbert remarked mr stevens in his most placid manner i have already desired you not to be too rash allow me to remind you that calling me father cuthbert in a protestant house and especially in that tone of voice is scarce likely to advance our interests as to my caring for nothing on earth i shall care to hear your information when you can deliver yourself of it in a reasonable manner gilbert with some difficulty repressing his indignation came to the conclusion that the being before him was inaccessible to feeling when i arrived at the well said he i was very near falling into it i ah rash as usual commented stevens affectionately patting the portfolio i lighted safely on the ledge of the door pursued gilbert but when i gave the necessary push i found that it refused to stir it had been made up from the inside something underneath the door which stuck of course said stevens i took out my knife replied gilbert and with great difficulty steadied myself so that i could pass the blade under the door there was nothing underneath but the door refused to stir what did you do then came back to you directly to ask you whether we ought to leave the country you did not try at the other end in broad daylight mr stevens what can you be thinking of the interests of the cause my friend ah well i have the greatest respect for the interests of the cause but i have also a slight disposition to attend to the interests of gilbert irvine that is precisely your bane my excellent gilbert and there are other defects in you beside and pray what excuse could you have devised to gain entrance gilbert i wonder at your marvellous incapacity for lying now it comes quite natural to me seems so said gilbert grimly well as your disposition to attend to the interests of gilbert irvine is so strong i will not require more of you than to attempt the entrance by night i noticed when i left the house that one of the drawingroom windows was unfastened you can get in that way and pass through mrs celias chamber im blessed if ill try that style of putting my neck in a noose for you more than this once gilbert burst forth i dont ask it of you more than this once replied stevens and suppose they have fastened the window since you were there as is probably the case if you cannot get in come back to me we must find out whether they have discovered the hidingplace but i will take the next chance myself and gilbert it shall be in broad daylight gilbert stared at him and shook his head with an incredulous laugh you are a poor conspirator gilbert lamented stevens can you plaster a wall no said gilbert i can can you mend a harpsichord not i indeed i can and can you make a tansy pudding holy mary such womens work women are useful my friend in their wayoccasionally and it is desirable now and then even for the nobler sex to know how to do womens work now i dare say you have not the least notion how a shirt is made i can sew beautifully by the head of st barbaragilbert began avoid catholic oaths gilbert if you please and never be above learning pick up all you canno matter what it may come in use some time i wish you would tell me how you mean to get in mr passmore was observing at dinner that he wanted a new underfootman i shall offer myself for the place gilberts eyes and mouth opened rather wide i can carry coalscuttles my friend said mr cuthbert stevens insinuatingly and i could black a boot in a week or as soon as my purpose was served i should have a bad cough find that the work was too hard for me and leave father cuthbert you are a clever fellow said gilbert slowly father cuthbert made no attempt to deny the impeachment and where am i to be while you are blacking your boots and carrying your coalscuttles quietly pursuing your inquiries between here and exeter and keeping out of scrapesif you can you will find me here again this day month on the evening of the next day squire passmore saw and engaged a new underfootman a tall personable fellow said he to his family very wellspoken and capable he seems he comes from exeter and his name is george shepherd and much vexed was he for he had taken a fancy to his new servant when four days later robert announced to him that george had such a bad cough and found the work so hard for his weak chest that he wished to leave at the end of the month it bent always the strongestlooking as is the strongest observed cicely on the subject and im afeared madam that george is but weakly for all he looks so capable madam passmore who felt very sorry for poor george tried dietdrinks linseed tea and lozenges but all were to no purpose and at the end of the month the new footman left what are you doing mr stevens demanded gilbert irvine as he entered the lodgers room at moreton on the same evening that the underfootmans place at ashcliffe hull was again left vacant goodevening gilbert responded mr stevens without looking up only making my official shirts into a rather smaller and neater bundle they may serve again you know and what news asked gilbert you were right said mr stevens they have found it out and have made up the welldoor but mrs celia knows nothing about the hidingplace though she sleeps in the chamber well and why couldnt you believe me at first what have you gained by all your trouble why could i not believe you repeated stevens because you are rash as i always tell you and what have i gained a months board and lodging and thirteen and fourpence look at it ugh said gilbert to the shillings well i would not have blacked a lot of dirty boots for you if youd been twice as many a mistake gilbert a sad mistake said stevens tying up his bundle never be above doing anything for the good of the church nor telling any number of lies responded gilbert well and where are we to go now back to france and report to my lady ingram as quickly as possible and what then that is for her to say i should think she will come and fetch the girl and how are we to live meanwhile you as you please for me being now so well equipped and in good practice answered mr cuthbert stevens with an insinuating smile if i found it impossible to get any other sort of work i could take another place as footman time passed calmly on for some months after madam passmores disclosure to celia the latter gradually lost the fear of being claimed by strangers and devoted herself to the very diligent study of the scriptures the squire and madam passmore became slowly grayer and cicely aggett a little whiter than before but nothing occurred to break the quiet tenor of events until henriettas marriage took place in the summer of the bridegroom was the heir of a family living in the adjoining division of the county and the day was marked at ashcliffe by much splendor and festivity the bride showed herself quiet and practical on this occasion as on all others and as she had made her mark but little she was comparatively little missed cicely cried because she thought it was the first break in the family and dolly because she fancied it was the proper thing to do but henrietta herself would have scorned to run the risk of spoiling her primrose silk by tears everything was done en rglewedding and breakfast throwing the slipper dancing and a number of other small observances which have since been counted tedious or unseemly and when the day was over and henrietta carey had departed to her new home things sank down into their old groove at ashcliffe hall when the year dawned only the three younger sisters of the family were at home harry had rejoined his regiment and charley was away on a visit to his eldest sister and her husband so matters stood at ashcliffe hall on that new years day when what celia dreaded came upon her the peculiar drawing up of the chin towards the throat known as bridling was a very essential point of fine breeding at the date of this story of la petite patentre blanche there are as many versions as lines the one i give in the text rests on oral tradition there is another known to me probably an older version which i should have preferred if i could have been quite sure of the words it was used by a woman who died in at the age of and who therefore was born four years before the death of queen anne it was repeated to me when a child of eight and the only copy i can recover is my own record at the time i give this for what it is worth matthew mark luke and john bless the bed that i lie on four corners to my bed four angels at their head one to read and one to write and two to guard my bed at night the vapors were preeminently the fashionable malady of the reign of queen anne the name answered to the sensation now known as ennui but doubtless as miss strickland suggests in her lives of the queens of england it was frequently used when its victim was suffering from nothing more remarkable or novel than a bad temper iv my lady ingram she had the low voice of your english dames unused it seems to need rise half a note to catch attentionand their quiet mood as if they lived too high above the earth for that to put them out in anything so gentle because verily so proud so wary and afraid of hurting you by no means that you are not really vile but that they would not touch you with their foot to push you to your place so selfpossessed yet gracious and conciliating it takes an effort in their presence to speak truth you know the sort of womanbrilliant stuff and out of nature elizabeth barrett browning the tories were in power in the winter of the duke of marlboroughs credit at home had long been sinking and he was now almost at the lowest point in the queens favor on that very new years day of which i have spoken for the first time in the annals of england a ministry had endeavored to swamp the house of lords by a wholesale creation of peers politically speaking squire passmore was anything but happy for he was a fervent whig he sat in the parlor that morning inveighing angrily against the earl of oxford and all who followed or agreed with himthe queen herself of course exceptedfor the edification of madam passmorewho was calmly knottingisabella and celia tis pity john said madam passmore quietly that you have no tories to list you i wish i hadthe scoundrels exclaimed the squire o mother cried isabella rising hurriedly from her seat in the window sure here is some visitor of quality there is a carriage at the front door with arms on the panels what arms asked her father i dont understand anything about arms said isabella and one of the coats i cannot see rightly the one nearer here is all cut up into little squares and in one part there is a dog on his hind legs and in another a pair of yellow balls the squire came to the window to see for himself dog balls cried he a lion rampant and bezantsthe goose well father i told you i did not understand it remonstrated isabella in an injured tone madam my lady ingram announced robert in a voice of great importance the squire turned round directly and offered his hand to conduct the visitor to a seat like a wellbred gentleman of his daymadam passmore rising to receive her and her daughters of course following her example the stranger was a tall commanding woman with great stateliness of carriage and much languor of manner she had evidently been very handsome but was now just past her prime her eyes and hair were dark her voice low and languishing altogether it struck celia that she was very like what isabella would be in a few years allowing for the differences in color she took the chair to which the squire led her and addressed herself to madam passmore there was a little peculiarity of distinctness in her pronunciation you wonder to see me madam she began madam i am honored by your ladyships visit i am the widow of sir edward ingram who held a commission under his majesty king james i come to speak with you on business with me asked madam passmore a little surprised you are madam passmore of ashcliffe hallyes pray continue madam your daughters madam inquired the visitor with a languid wave of her hand towards the young ladies yes does your ladyship wish to see me without them not at alloh not at all which is mademoiselle celia the womans french exclaimed the squire under his breath celias blood rushed to her face and neck and then ebbed leaving her white and faint as she rose and came slowly forward is this my mother she was asking herself in a mental tumult ah that is you stand a little farther if you please i wish to look at you no this is not my mother said celia to her own heart not by the half so tall as i should likequite petite said lady ingram scanning celia with a depreciatory air and so brown you cannot bridleyou have no complexion eh ma foi what an englishlooking girl the squire had almost arrived at the end of his patience madam passmore said quietly i ask your ladyships pardon but perhaps you will tell me why you make these remarks on my daughter i beg yours said lady ingram languidly i thought i had told you she is a foundlingexactly et bien she is my daughterthat is my husbands daughter thank heaven not yours growled the squire heard only by isabella my husband was married twice pursued the visitor unconscious of his rising anger his first wife was an englishwomanshort i suppose and brown like this girl i am the second wife ne mademoiselle de la croix daughter of monsieur the marquis de la croix tu peux membrasser ma fille celia would have obeyed somewhat reluctantly had she understood her stepmother she stood still unaware that she had been addressed at all since she had never learned the language in which lady ingram had spoken to her well you will not i beg your pardon madam answered celia speaking for the first time and in a very tremulous voice i did not understand what you said you speak french no madam possible exclaimed lady ingram you have never taught her to speak french she speaks only english ma foi quelle famille i could scarce teach her what i knew not replied madam passmore with quiet dignity cest incroyable drawled lady ingram well child come here and kiss me how awkwardly you stoop your carriage is badvery bad ah well i shall see to all that you will be ready to return with me on thursday this was only tuesday celia heard the question put with a sinking of dismay how should she go yet how should she refuse my lady ingram said squire passmore coming forward at last if you were this childs own mother or if her father were yet alive i could not of course set myself against your taking her away but you tell us that you are only her stepmother and that her father is dead it seems to me therefore that she is at least as much our child as yoursrather more indeed seeing that we have brought her up from her cradle and you have never cared to see her until this day moreover i hope your ladyship will not take it ill of me if i ask you for some proof that you really are the childs stepmother what proof shall i give you mr passmore asked lady ingram quietly i have every wish to satisfy you if you desire to see proofs that i am really lady ingram ask the servants my name or look here she drew a letter from her pocket and held it out to the squire the direction wasto my lady ingram madam said the squire returning the letter with a bow i do not in the least doubt that i have the honor of addressing my lady ingram but can you satisfy me that you are celias stepmother if my word is not enough to satisfy you mr passmore answered lady ingram not at all annoyed i know of nothing that will do it the marriageregisters of celias parents or my own would give you no information concerning her and she has no register of baptism i believe however that her name was written on a paper left with her in sir edwards hand if you will produce that paper i will show you more of his writing which you can compare with it i think the fact of my knowledge on the subject ought to prove to you that i am the person whom i represent myself to be the writing on the two papers when compared tallied and squire passmore felt that lady ingram was right and that she could not produce any proof of her relationship so strong as the mere fact of her knowledge of celias name and origin if she really were celias stepmother he had no wish to prevent his adopted daughter from making acquaintance with her own family and he saw nothing for it but to take lady ingram at her word i am satisfied madam that you have some relation to celia said he and as to her visiting youfor i cannot consent to her being taken entirely awaylet the child choose for herself sure she is old enough ah said lady ingram shrugging her shoulders slightly very well you shall decide chre celia at the least you will visit me i will visit you madam with pleasure answered celia a little to the damage of truth but these dear friends who have had a care of me from my childhood i could not leave them entirely madam the sentence ended in tears i am not an officer of justice ma belle said lady ingram laughing faintly ah well a visit let it be you will come with mefor a visiton thursday i will attend your ladyship you live near madam asked madam passmore wondering whether she could live so far away as the next county i live in france was the unconcerned answerin paris in the winter and not far thence in the summer the squire almost gasped for breath and where is your summer dwelling madam i think if you please that i have a right to ask oh certainly at st germainenlaye st fiddlesticksandfiddlestrings roared the squire sir observed lady ingram apparently a little startled at last pope pretender and devil thundered the exasperated whig ah i only know one of the three said lady ingram subsiding and pray which is that madam grimly inquired he le roi jacquesyou call the pretender said she calmly drawing on her glove if you please madam asked celia with an effort do you know what was my mothers name white blacksome colori know not whether red green or blue she was a nobodya mere nobody replied her successor dismissing celias insignificant mother with a graceful wave of her hands have i any brothers or sisters madam sisters no two brothersone son of your mother and one of mine they live with you madam my son philip does said the baronets widow your brothersir edward nowis away on his travels the saints know where but he talked to me much about you before he went and philip teased me about youso i came celia said the squire sternly this woman is an alien a tory and a papist will you still go ought i not father she asked in a low tone judge for yourself child he answered kindly i think i ought to go said celia faintly i am a catholic mr passmore it is true remarked lady ingram quietly yet you need not fear me sir edward my husband was protestant and so is his son edward and i do not interfere we are all surely going to heaven and what matter for the different roads i think i ought to go repeated celia but madam passmore thought still more faintly than before on thursday then answered lady ingram touching celias cheek with her lips ah ma chre how i will improve you when i have you to myselfhow i will form you that bon ton that aisance that maintienyou have them not you shall soon adieu well sure tis sore to lose you mrs celia my dear observed cicely aggett as she sat sewing but more particular to a strangeramong them dreadful papistsand such a way off too why tis nigh a hundred mile from here to paris bent it i dont know how far it is said celia honestly but i am sure tis a very long way well anyhow youll not forget us dear heart i shall never do that cicely but dont talk as if i were going away altogether tis only a visit i shall soon come backin a year at the longest maybe my dear answered cicely quietly and maybe not mrs celia a year is a long time and we none of us know what the lord may have for us afore then not one of us agoing along with you well youll have him with you and hell see to you a deal better than we could but to think of you going among them wicked cruel papists dont have no more to do with none of them than you can helpdont my dear depend upon it mrs celia they bent a bit better now than they was a hundred and fifty years ago when they burned and tormented poor folks all over the country as my grandmother used to tell me what did she tell you about it cicely she were to exetera mrs celia and she lived till i was a matter of fifteen and many a tale shes told me of their doings in them old times but the one i always liked best was one her mother had told her her mother had been a young maid when the burnings was agoing on she were to londonb and was woman to a lady one of them as was burnt tell me about it cicely requested celia with feelings of curiosity and horror struggling for precedence ill tell you all i know about it my dear there your ruffles is done ill take mrs bells next well mrs celia her name my greatgrandmothers mistress was kyme she was to lincolnshire leastwise her husband for she was a london lady herself an old family them kymes be theyve dwelt in lincolnshire ever since moses for aught i know mrs annethat was her namewas a sweet gentle lady but her husband mr kyme wasnt so likely hed a cruel rare temper ive heard my grandmother say well and after a while mr kyme he came to use mrs anne so hard she couldnt live with him no longer and she came back to her father and mother she never went back to lincolnshire she took back her own name and everybody called her mrs anne askew instead of madam kyme i never understood quite the rights of it and im not sure my grandmother did herself but however some way mrs anne she got hold of a bible and she fell areading it and of course she couldnt but see with half an eye when she come to read that all them papishes had taught her was all wrong when she didnt find not one of their foolishnesses set down in the book and by and by the priests came to hear of it i dont just know how that were i think somebody betrayed her but i cant tell who not my greatgrandmother im sure for she held her lady dear ay but there was a scrimmage when they knowed poor young lady all turned against her her own father and mother and all and the priests had their wicked will they took her to newgate and tried first to talk her over but when they found their talk was no good but mrs anne she held fast by what god had taught her they had her into the torturechamber celia drew a long breath ah said old cicely slowly shaking her white head tis easy to say god forgive them but truly i misdoubt whether god can forgive them that tear the flesh and rent the hearts of his saints what they did to that poor young thing in that torturechamber god knoweth i make no doubt tis all writ down in his book but mrs anne she stood firm and not one word could they get out of her and my lord chancellor who was there he was so mad angry with her that he throwed off his gown and pulled the rack with his own hands at last the doctors saidfor they had doctors there the devils to tell them how much the poor wretches could bearthe doctors said that if mrs anne had any more she would be like to die under it so then they took her down but afore they let her be they kept her two hours longer asitting on the bare floor and my lord chancellor atalking at her all that ever he could then at last when they found her too much for them they took her away and laid her to bed as weary and painful bones quoth she to my greatgrandmother had i as ever had patient job i thank my lord god therefor and if that warnt a good christian saying my dear id like to hear one well for some months after that she laid in prison the wicked priests for ever at her wearying her life out with talk and such so at the end of all when they saw it was no good they carried her out to smithfield there to die they carried her out really for every bone in her was broken and if she had lived fifty years after she could never have set her foot to the ground again but mrs anne she went smiling and they said which saw her as joyful as if she were going to her bridal there at the stake with the faggots round they offered her last thing a pardon if she would come round to their evil ways ah they knew not the strength within her they saw not the angels waiting round when that poor broken body should be ashes to take up the glad soul to the lords rest what was pardon to her poor crushed thing she had seen too much of the glory of the lord to set any price on their pardons so when they could do nought more with her they burned her to ashes at the stake old cicely added no comment was any needed but if she had known the words spoken at one such holocaust by the mother of the martyr she might fitly have ended her tale with them blessed be jesus christ and his witnesses bon jour ma chre you look a little better this morningnot quite so english et bien you are ready to come celia had never felt so english as at that moment she forced back the tears which felt as if they would work their way out in spite of her and said in a very low voice i am ready madam let us lose no time then said lady ingram rising and allowing her hoop to spread itself out to its full width i wish you a very good morning madam she swept slowly and statelily across the room leaving celia to exchange passionate kisses with all the members of the family and then almost blinded by the tears which would come at last to make her way to the coach which was standing at the door there there my dear said lady ingram a little querulously when the coach had been travelling about five minutes that is quite enough you will make your eyes red there is nothing absolutely nothing so unbecoming as the red eyes these people are not your familynot at all so good i do not see anything to cry about she does not mean to be unkind thought celia to herself she is only heartless truebut what an only lady ingram having done her duty to her stepdaughter leaned back in the coach and closed her eyes she opened them again for a moment and said we arrive on tuesday in london i start for paris not until the next tuesday then the dark languishing eyes shut again rather to celias relief the ponderous vehicle worked its way slowly along the muddy roads celia sat by her stepmother and opposite was lady ingrams maid a darkbrowed frenchwoman both were remarkably silent lady ingram went to sleep and the maid sat upright stony and passive frequently scanning the young stranger with her black eyes but never uttering a word that evening the coach clattered into chard where they slept the friday saw them at shaftesbury the saturday night at andover where they put up for the sunday on the monday evening they reached bagshot lady ingram declaring that she must have the morning to pass bagshot heath and adding a few anecdotes of her past troubles with highwaymen which terrified celia two men travelling on horseback who were staying at the inn joined their forces to the carriage and the heath was passed without any attack from the highwaymen about ten oclock when they were a little past the heath lady ingram desired celia to keep her eyes open we are just entering windsor she said and though i have not time to stop and let you see the castle yet you may perhaps get a glimpse of it as we pass they passed the castle and drove down the park suddenly the coach came to a full stop the stupid man exclaimed lady ingram what does he the question was very soon answered for william the footman sprang from his perch and presented himself at the carriagewindow lady ingram let down the glass what is the matter she asked testily if you please madam was the answer there is a coach coming with gentlemen on horseback and two running footmen in attendance and shale thinks it must be the queens draw to one side immediately commanded lady ingram and then open the door and we will alight all alighted except the coachman and lady ingram took celias hand and stood with her just in front of her carriage the running footmen passed them first carrying long wands and dressed in scarlet and gold livery lady ingrams practised eye detected at once that the liveries were royal then came three gentlemen two riding in front the third behind the coach a large handsome but very unwieldly vehicle lumbered slowly after them in it were seated three ladiesone alone facing the horses the others on the opposite seat which is the queen madam asked celia excitedly the princess anne will sit alone facing the horses replied her stepmother the lady who occupied the seat of honor and whom alone celia noticed was the fattest woman she had ever seen she had a fat round face and ruddy complexion dark chestnut hair and regular features her eyes were gray and the expression of her face though kindly was not indicative of either liveliness or intellect she wore a black dress trimmed with ermine and a long black hood lined with the same fur not until the queen had become invisible to her did celia notice her ladies on the opposite seat one of them was remarkable for a nose not extremely beautiful and abundance of curls of a dusky red streamed over her shoulders celia glanced at the other and came to the conclusion that there was nothing particular about her so that is abigail hill said lady ingram in a peculiar tone when the coach had driven past i thought she had had more in herat least to look at is that the lady with the red hair madam no my dearthe other the redhaired one is the duchess of somerset lady ingram still stood looking after the royal carriage with a meditative air i should like to see abigail hill she said as if to herself i cannot tell how to do it but we must not delay even for that get in my dear celia got into the coach wondering what reason her stepmother could have for wishing to see lady masham and also why she did not give her the benefit of her title lady ingram resumed her own seat in silence and leaned back in the carriage apparently cogitating deeply mile after mile the travellers journeyed on until the dusk fell and at the little inn at bedfont the coach pulled up william appeared at the window please your ladyship we can cross the heath tonight he said theres a regiment of colonel churchills just before the host says they havent been gone five minutes then bid shale hasten on without stopping to bait answered his mistress we must overtake them for i do not mean to stop on the road another night unless it cannot be helped the horses were urged on as fast as they could go and in about a quarter of an hour they came up with the regiment under whose guardianship they crossed the dreaded hounslow heath without fear of molestation at hammersmith the coach stopped again after a little parley between william and the innkeeper four men came out of the inn with torches in their hands two of them placed themselves on each side of the coach and they slowly journeyed on again it was quite dark now gradually the road became busier and more noisy and houses appeared lining it at intervals at length they had fairly entered the metropolis the coach worked its way slowly along the muddy streets for it had been raining since they left staines and the shouts of the linkmen were almost deafening as they proceeded another coach suddenly appeared and attempted to pass them this could not be permitted the coachman whipped his horses the linkmen screamed the great coach swayed to and fro with the unusual pace lady ingram opened the window and looked out while the maid clasped her hands and shrieked in her own tongue that she was killed not at all ma bonne was the calm response of the mistress then turning to celia she asked you are not afraid not unless you tell me there is something to fear madam answered celia in the quiescence rather of ignorance than of courage ah i like that answer replied lady ingram smiling her approval and patting celias cheek there is good metal in you ma chre it is only the work that asks the polishing celia wondered what the process of polishing would be and into what kind of creature she would find herself transmuted when it was finished william said lady ingram putting her head out of the window whose coach is that other sir john scoresbys madam a baronet of three years later observed lady ingram quietly sinking back into her seat it is impossible to give way ah madame faltered the bonne in a shrill key madame will renounce her right we shall be over we shall be dead impossible my good thrse was the placid answer i know what is due to myself and to others to a baronet of one day earlier i should of course give place without a word but to one of a day laterimpossible replied lady ingram waving her hands with an air of utter finality but if we are all killed faintly shrieked thrse absurd said lady ingram but if i were thrse know that i should have the consolation of dying in the discharge of my duty no soldier can do more ah madame is so high and philosophical lamented thrse madame has the grand thoughts cest magnifique but we others who are but little people and cannot console ourselveshlas meanwhile the battle was raging outside the coach shouts of scoresby and ingram violent lashings of the struggling horses oaths and execrations at last the flashing of daggers when things arrived at this point lady ingram again let down the glass which she had drawn up and celia like a coward shut her eyes and put her hands over her ears thrse was screaming hysterically ah remarked the baronets widow in a tone of satisfaction replacing the window we shall get on nowwilliam has stabbed the other coachman thrse give over screaming in that wayso very unnecessary and celia my dear do not put yourself in that absurd positionit is like a coward but the man madamthe poor coachmanis he killed questioned celia in a tone of horror my dear what does that signify said lady ingram a mere coachmanwhat can it matter but will you not ask madam pursued celia in a very pained voice impossible my dear replied lady ingram i could not demean myself by such a question nor must you really celia your manners are so wanting in repose you must learn not to put yourself into a fever in this way for every little thing that happens imagine i lady ingram stopping my coach and yielding precedence to this upstart scoresby to inquire whether this persona man of no family whateverhas had a little more or less blood let out by my footmans thrust ridiculous and lady ingram spread out her dress celia shrank back as far as she could into the corner of the coach and spoke not in words to the only friend she had present with her oh send me back to ashcliffe was the strong cry of her heart this woman has no feelings whatever unless there be some very necessary work for me to do in paris send me back home but there was very necessary work to be done before she could go home after another quarter of a mile spent in struggling through the mud the coach drew up at the door of a large house william who seemed none the worse for his battle opened the door and held out his arm to assist his ladies in alighting lady ingram motioned to thrse to go first and the maid laid her hand on the arm of her fellowservant ah bah exclaimed she as she reached the ground why you not wipe de blood from de sleeve you spoil my cloakfaugh you had better not use your dagger william observed lady ingram as she stepped out unless it be necessary it frightens madam celia and with a peculiar smile she looked back at her stepdaughter celia followed lady ingram into a lighted hall where servants in blue and gold liveries stood round holding tapers in silver candlesticks they seemed to recognize lady ingram though celia noticed that williams livery was different from theirs and therefore imagined that the house she was entering must be that of a stranger lady ingram walked forward in her usual stately manner until she reached the head of the staircase closely followed by celia and thrse on the second step from the top stood a gentleman in full dress blue and gold a conversation ensued between him and lady ingram accompanied by a great deal of bowing and courtesying flourishing of hands and shaking of heads which being in french was of course lost upon celia but could she have understood it this was what she would have heard you do me such honor monsieur it is due to you madame the second stair monsieur i am entitled only to the head of the staircase madame will permit me to express my sense of her distinction you overwhelm me monsieur pray let madame proceed not until monsieur has done so precedence to the ladies by no means before his majestys consul here then appeared likely to be an obstacle to farther progress but after a good deal more palaver the grave point of precedence which each was courteously striving to yield to the other was settled by lady ingram and the consul each setting a foot upon the top stair at the same moment they then passed forward hand in hand celia as before following her stepmother the three entered a large handsome drawingroom where a further series of bowing and courtesying ensued before lady ingram would sit down celia supposed that she might follow her example and being very tired she seated herself at the same time as her stepmother for which act she was rewarded with a glance of disapprobation from lady ingrams dark eyes she sprang up again feeling puzzled and fluttered whereupon the consul advanced to her and addressed her in french with a series of low bows celia could only courtesy to him and look helplessly at her stepmother lady ingram uttered a few languid words in french and then said in english to celia pray sit down you have to be told everything so she sat silent and wearied until after a time the door flew open and half a dozen servants entered bearing trays which they presented first to lady ingram and then to celia the first tray contained cups of coffee the second preserved fruits the third custards the fourth various kinds of sweetmeats celia mentally wondered whether the french supped on sugarplums but the fifth tray containing cakes she succeeded in finding something edible lady ingram she noticed after a cup of coffee and one or two cakes devoted her attention to the sugarplums you are tired asked lady ingram turning to celia very well you shall go to bed i will leave the forming of your manners at present by and by i shall have something to say to you thrse will dress your hair in the morning adieu come and embrace me thrse appeared at the door and after giving her some directions in french her mistress desired celia to courtesy to the consul and follow thrse the maid led celia into a tolerably large room with a french bed which thrse informed her that she would have to herself ah dat you have de hair beautifuls said thrse as she combed it out i arrange it tomorrow mademoiselle like madame celia liked no part of this speech she knew that her hair was not beautiful and felt that thrse was flattering her while whatever might be her feelings on the subject of lady ingram she had no intention of communicating them to her ladyships maid her answer was distant and evasive aha said thrse with a soft laugh to herself perhaps mademoiselle shall like monsieur philippe monsieur philippe love to hear of mademoiselle celias heart warmed in a moment to her unknown brother how old is he she asked nineteen said thrse and my eldest brother how old is he sir edward asked the french maid ah i see him very little he is two tree five year older as monsieur philippe he come never celia resolved to question thrse no further and the latter continued brushing her hair in silence that will do thrse she said when this process was completed i will not keep you any longer she explained seeing that the french girl looked puzzled mademoiselle undress herself asked thrse with open eyes yes thank youi like it better i wish to read a little first de great ladies read never laughed thrse mademoiselle leave de book in englands madame not like de read i will never leave you in england whispered celia to her little bible resting her cheek upon it when thrse was gone but oh how shall i follow your teaching here i know so little and have so little strength and a low soft whisper came into her heartlo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world when mademoiselle is ready madame wish speak with her at her dressingchamber this message was brought to celia by thrse the next morning she was already dressed and reading ah dat mademoiselle is early exclaimed thrse lifting her eyebrows mademoiselle read always there was a concealed sarcasm about everything this woman said to her which was particularly distasteful to celia she rose and closed her book only replying i will come to my lady now thrse led her along the passage into a handsomelyfurnished room where robed in a blue cashmere dressinggown lady ingram sat with her long dark hair down upon her shoulders ah good morning early was her short greeting to celia who bent down and kissed her now my dear pursued lady ingram please to sit down on that chair facing me i have two or three remarks to make you shall have your first lesson in the polishing you need so much celia took the seat indicated with some trepidation but more curiosity very well said her stepmother now first about blushing you must get rid of that habit of blushing thereyou are at it now look in the mirror and see if it does not spoil your complexion a woman of the world celia never blushes it is quite oldfashioned and obsolete so much for that but madamcelia began and hesitated go on my dear said lady ingram you are not putting enough powder on the left side thrse if you please madam i cannot stop blushing pleaded celia doing it very much it depends upon my feelings well it looks as if you could not answered lady ingram with a short hard laugh but my dear you must and as to feelings celia a modish woman never has any feelings feeling is the one thing absolutely forbidden by the mode laugh as much as you please but mind how you feel merry and as to crying that is not allowable except in particular circumstances it looks well to see a girl weep for the death of her father or mother and within reasonable limits for a brother or sister but if you are ever left a widow you must be very careful not to weep for the loss of your husband that would stamp you instantly and it is not bien sant for a mother to cry much over her childrencertainly not unless they are quite babies a few tearsjust a fewmay be very well in that case if you have a laced handkerchief at hand but you must never look astonished no matter what happens to you and celia last night when the consul spoke to you you absolutely looked perplexed i felt so madam said celia is not that just what i am telling you replied lady ingram with that graceful wave of her hands which celia had seen before my dear you must not feel feeling is the one thing which the mode cannot permit pardon me madam answered celia looking perplexed now but it seems to me that you are trying to make me into a statue exactly so my dear celiathat is just it a modish woman is a piece of live marble she eats she drinks elegantly and in small quantitiesshe sleeps taking care not to lie ungracefullyshe walks glidingly and smoothlyshe converses but must be careful not to mean too muchshe distributes her smiles at pleasure but never shows real interest in any person my dear a heart is absolute ruin to a modish woman she may do anything she likes but feel now look at me have you seen any exhibition of feeling in me since you have known me celia felt herself quite safe in acquitting lady ingram on that count no of course not continued her stepmother i hope i know myself and the mode too well now as to walking what do you think the consul said to me last night when you left the room celia confessed her inability to guess it he said what a pity that young lady cannot walk celias eyes opened rather widely it is quite true you absolutely cannot walk you have no idea of walking but to go backwards or forwards a walk should be a graceful gliding motion only just not dancing therethat will do for this morning as to walking you shall have dancing lessons but remember the other things i tell you you must not blush nor weep nor eat more than you can helpin public of course i mean you can eat an ox in your own chamber if you pleaseand above everything else you must give over feeling you can go now if you wish it madam you order impossibilities said celia with tears in her eyes i will eat as little as you please if it keep me alive and i will do my best to walk in any manner you wish me i will try to give over blushing if i can though really i do not know how to set about it but to give over feelingmadam i cannot do it i do not think i ought to do it even at your command i must weep when i am sorrowfuli must laugh when i am diverted i will not do it more than i can help but i cannot make any promise beyond that ah there you are said lady ingram laughing you island english with your hearts and your consciences every man of you a pope to himself well i will not be too hard upon you at first ma belle that will do for the present by and by i shall exact more celia had a request to prefer before she went madam she asked trembling very much if it pleased you and you had no desire that i should do otherwise would you give me leave to hear dr sacheverell preach on sunday ma chre said lady ingram how can i a catholic choose between your protestant teachers you shall go where you like the consul has been so good as to place one of his carriages at my disposal and as i shall remain here all the day i place it at yours i will bid william ask where your great doctor preaches celia went slowly back to her own room feeling very strange very lonely and very miserable though she hardly knew why as soon as she reached it she proceeded to contravene all lady ingrams orders by a good cry she felt all the better for it and having bathed her eyes and comforted herself with a few words out of her book she was ready when thrse came to summon her to go down to breakfast with her stepmother they breakfasted in a room downstairs the consul and his wife being present the latter a voluble french woman who talked very fast to lady ingram the days passed drearily to celia but she kept looking forward to the sunday on which she hoped to hear a sermon different from dr braithwaites when the sunday arrived the carriage came round after breakfast to take celia to hear dr sacheverell who william had learned was to preach at st andrews that morning to holborn therefore the coach drove and celia entered st andrews church alone she was put into a great pew presently filled with other ladies and the service was conducted by a young clergyman in a fair wig who seemed more desirous to impress his hearers with himself than with his subject then the pulpit was mounted by a stout man in a dark wig who preached very fluently very energetically and very dogmatically a discourse in which there were more politics than religion and very much more of henry sacheverell than of jesus christ all the attention which celia could spare from the service and the preacher was concentrated in amazement on her fellowworshippers they were tolerably attentive to the sermon but on the prayers they bestowed no notice whatever all were dressed in the height of the fashion and all carried fans and snuffboxes the former they flourished handled unfurled discharged grounded recovered and fluttered all through the service whenever the fans were still for a moment the snuffboxes came into requisition and the amount of snuff consumed by these fashionable ladies astonished celia they talked in loud whispers with utter disregard to the sanctity of place and circumstances and the tone of their conversation was another source of surprise to their hearer do you see sir thomas i am sure he is looking this way there is lady bettyno on your left lady diana has not come this morning how modishly she dresses look at the duchesswhat a handsome brocade that lace cost five guineas the yard i am certain then came a fresh flourishing of fans varied by the occasional rising and courtesying of one of the ladies as she recognized an acquaintance in the fashionable crowd did these women really believe themselves in the special presence of god thought celia surely they never could there was one point of the service at which all their remarks were hushed their fans still and their attention concentrated this was during the singing celia found that no member of the congregation thought of joining the psalmody which was left to a choir located in the gallery at the close of each chant audible comments were whispered round how exceeding sweet what a divine voice she hath beautiful that ela and when the prayers followed the snuffboxes and fans began figuring again on the whole celia was glad when this service was over even dr braithwaite was better than this and then she thought of her friends at ashcliffe and how they would be rumbling home in the old familycoach as she stepped in her loneliness into the consuls splendid carriage did they miss her she wondered and were they thinking of her then while her heart was dwelling sadly and longingly upon them she doubted not that they did both et bien said lady ingram interrogatively when she met celia after dinner did you like your great preacher not at all madam not at all then i wonder why you went you look disappointed ma belle you must not look disappointedit gives awkward lines to the face heretake some of this cake to console you it is particularly good celia took the cake but not the consolation at eleven oclock on tuesday my child we depart for paris do not give yourself any trouble thrse will do all your packing only you must not walk in paris until you have some clothes fit to be seen i will order stuffs sent in at once when we arrive and set the women to work for you do you know madam if you pleasecelia hesitated and seemed a little uncomfortable go on child said lady ingram never stop in the middle of a sentence unless you choose to affect the prettyinnocence style well do you know madam whether there be any protestant service in paris i imagine there is a huguenot prche somewhereor was one i am not sure if i heard not something about his majesty having stopped them do not put your protestantism too much forward therethe court do not like it i have nothing to do with the court madam said celia with sudden firmness and i am a protestant and i cannot disguise my religion oh dear your protestant consciences murmured lady ingram but you have to do with the court my friend it is to the court that i am taking you do you suppose that i live in the atmosphere of a recluse when i am an old woman of eighty ma chre very likely i shall repair to a convent to make my salvation but not just now if you please i am not an old woman celia was beginning but lady ingram interrupted her precisely ma belle the very reason why it is so absurd of you to make a recluse of yourself as i see you would like to dounless indeed you had a vocation but so far as i know protestants never have such things what things madam vocations my dearcalls to the religious life madam exclaimed celia very much astonished ought we not all to lead religious lives you are so absurd laughed lady ingram you absolutely do not understand what is meant by the religious life my dear child for a child you are indeed the life which we all lead is the secular we eat drink talk sleep dance game and marry these are the seculars who do these things the religious are those who having a call from heaven consecrate themselves entirely to god and deny themselves all pleasures whatever and so much of necessaries as is consistent with the preservation of life their mortification is accepted by heaven when extreme not only for their own sins but for the sins of any secular friend to whom they may desire to apply the merit of it now do you understand ma foi what a grave saintlike conversation you provoke not at all madam let me hear your views then had celia been left free to choose lady ingram was about the last person in her little world to whom she would have wished to give a reason for the hope that was in her but she felt that there was no choice and she must make the effort though not in her own strength she lifted up her heart to god for wisdom and then spoke with a quiet decision which surprised her stepmother madam i believe all persons to be religious who love god and whom god loves because god loved us he gave his son to die for us that we who believe in him might have eternal life it is he who saves us not we who make our own salvation and it is because we love god that we wish to serve him well my dear answered lady ingram slowly as if considering celias speech i can see very little difference between us except that you would have all men hermits and friars instead of some we both believe in jesus christ of course and no doubt there is a certain sense in which the religious feel love to god and this love inclines them to the cloister i do not therefore see wherein we differ except on a few unimportant points celia saw an immense distance between them on points neither few nor unimportant but the courage which had risen to a high tide was ebbing away and her heart failed her well this will do for today my fair divine said lady ingram with a smile now bring me my silkwinders and hold that skein of red silk while i wind itor stay is that a matter of conscience my little votaress on the lords day madam it is if you please very well let the silk alone i can wind it tomorrow just as well would it be breaking the sabbath for you to tell thrse that i wish to speak with her pray dont if you feel at all uncomfortable celia gave the message to thrse and then locked herself into her own room and relieved her feelings by another fit of crying ab a devonshire phrase as well as an american one signifying in the former case she belonged to or lived at the place foxes acts and monuments ed townsend vol v p abigail hill was a cousin and dependent of sarah duchess of marlborough and supplanted her in the queens favor she was a violent tory she married samuel masham one of the

a bedroom and an antechamber where you can take lessons in french and dancing good evening st estphe is monsieur philippe here monsieur philippe is not at himself madame he ride out with monsieur bontems lady ingram knitted her brows as if the information were not agreeable to her she alighted and desired celia to follow her upstairs through suites of spacious rooms splendidly furnished and along wide corridors she led the way to a quiet suite of apartments at one end of the housean antechamber a bedroom and a small but elegant boudoir these are your rooms she said i will give you a new attendant for i must have thrse to myself now these will be entirely at your disposal within certain restrictions i shall visit you every morning to have your masters opinions as to your improvement

that no madam i am very glad to hear it ah my sister of st ursula said lady ingram laughing but remember this is only until you are formed and the sooner that happens the better pleased i shall be i am anxious to obey your wishes in everything not forbidden by my conscience madam very well said lady ingram still laughing the conscience requires a little formation too ma belle as well as the manners farewell i will send your attendant she sailed away with her usual languid stateliness and celia went forward into the bedroom she was vainly endeavoring to find an unlocked drawer in which to place her hood and cloak when a low quiet voice behind her said here are the keys madam will you allow me to open them for you celia looked up into a face which won her confidence at once its owner was a woman of middle height whose age might be slightly under sixty her dress was of almost quaker simplicity and black her hair and eyes were of no particular color but light rather than dark her face wore no expression beyond a placid calm but celia fancied that she saw a peculiar deep look in the eyes as if those now passionless features might have borne an expression of great suffering once oh thank you said celia simply is it you whom my lady promised to send i am to be your woman madam i am her ladyships sewingwoman my name is patient irvine the ladys woman of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was the ancestress rather of the modern companion than of the maid she was called by her christian or surname sewed for her mistress and assisted her in dressing but in every other particular the mistress and maid were upon equal terms the woman was her ladys constant companion and nearly always her confidante she sat at her mistresss table went with her into company and appeared as a member of her family when she received her friends as a rule she was the equal of her lady in education and not seldom her superior her inferiority lay in birth and fortune sometimes in the latter only and what would you like me to call youpatience or irvine asked celia of her new acquaintance patient if you please madam patientnot patience i was not baptized patience madam my father was a scottish covenanter and he named me his firstborn child thepatientwaitingforchrist what a strange name involuntarily exclaimed celia yes madam very strange i doubt not to such as have never met with our puritan practice of scripturetext names i have known divers such do the puritans then commonly give their children such names very often madam i had an aunt who was called welovehimbecausehefirstlovedus they called her love for short i suppose yes madam answered patient in her calm passive manner celia thought this very odd indeed and turned the conversation lest she should get comic associations with texts of scripture of which she could not afterwards divest herself she wondered that patient did not feel the ludicrous strangeness of the practice not knowing that all sense of the ludicrous had been left out of patients composition and how long have you lived in france patient since i was of the age of twenty years madam celia you know my name then said celia smiling i know you madam much better than you know me i have borne you about in mine arms as a babe of a few hours old and just now when i saw you you looked to mine eyes as the very image from the dead of my dear miss magdalene patient do you mean my mother yes madam i ask your pardon for calling her such a name but it ever sounds more natural to mine ear she was my lady ingram for so short a time and i knew her as miss magdalene when she was but a wee bonnie bairn what was her name magdalene grey madam she was the ministers daughter at the manse of lauchie where my father and i dwelt then she was a scottish lady yes madam at least she was born in scotland and her mother was scottish her father mr grey was english by descent though his fathers had dwelt in scotland for three generations afore him and where did my father meet with her he was not scottish he was not madam and i will tell you all the story if it please you but will you not dress now you can tell me while i comb my hair patient i want to know all about it may i do it for you madam i can speak now if that be your pleasure but tis almost necessary that i tell mine own story in hers will it pain you patient asked celia kindly no madam i am far past that answered patient in her calm passionless voice then please to let me hear it my fathers name please you patient began was alexander leslie and he dwelt on lauchie farm near to the manse and sith mr grey our minister wedded mrs jean leslie of the same clan it fell out that miss magdalene and i were somewhat akin though in worldly goods she was much beyond us for mr grey was not one of our poor ministers of scotland but a rich englishman who made his way into what the english deemed our wild valleys for no cause but only the love of christ miss magdalene being an only bairn without brother or sister it so fell that i and roswith were called up whiles to the manse to divert her you and who roswith my sister what strange names your father gave his daughters ay that was a strange name and all said so it came out of an old chronicle that he had a very ancient book and he deemed it a fair name and gave it in the baptizing to his youngestborn those were evil days madam on which we fell yet why should i call them evil when they were days of growing in the truth and of the great honor of suffering for the lords sake mr grey your grandfather madam was a very gracious man and did preach most savory discourses wherefore he was one of the first on whom the blow fell and when king charles sent his troopers into our parts under command of claverhouse bidding them hunt and slay all that would not conform unto his way they came one of the first places into our valley many an humble and honest husbandman that feared god was hung up at his own door by the wicked claverhouse and his troopers and many a godly man and woman was constrained to dwell in caves and dens of the earth until this enemy was overpast i could tell many a tale of those days that would stir your blood madam if it pleased you to hear it we were amongst those whom the lord was pleased to honor by permitting them to suffer for his names sake mr grey refused to fly he was dragged down one sabbath morn from the pulpit in lauchie kirk claverhouse himself being at the door he had been preaching unto us a most sweet godly and gracious discourse of casting care upon the lord and standing firm in the truth and just when he was speaking that great and precious promise of the lord lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world the troopers burst in then the whole kirk thronged around our minister and sought to free him from the evil men mine uncle jock leslie fell thrust through with the swords of the troopers and many another but at length they had their wicked will and bound us men women and children two and two with one strong rope like a gang of slaves going to the marketplace i was greatly honored to have the next place to mr grey hand in hand with whom walked miss magdalene a sweet young maid of scarce fourteen years his godly wife was bound just before with janet campbell an old wife of nigh eighty so we were marched down eleven miles to the shore ah but my heart ached for miss magdalene and roswith ere we reached it it was a grand comfort to find roswith bound with me for she was but a wee wean of eight years and i a grown maiden of twenty doubtless this was the lords mercy when we came to the sea we saw a great ship lying afar off and we were all thrust into boats to carry us thither when we were aboard the troopers some of whom came with us did drive us below and shut down the hatches upon us which it being summer time was hot and painful and many women and children fell sick therewith whither we were to go we knew not only mr grey surmised that they thought either to sell us for slaves in barbary unto the heathen there or else to convey us unto the kings plantations in virginia or those parts though if they were bound unto virginia he knew not wherefore they should set sail from the eastern part of the kingdom for three days and nights we were thus kept under hatches to our much discomfort and the ship sailing northwards with all the speed the sailors could make during which time we were greatly comforted with the thought of christ our lord and the three days and three nights which he was in the heart of the earth likewise mr grey did oft exhort us and prayed us to bear all that should come upon us meekly and bravely and as unto the lord then some of us which were mighty in the scriptures did say certain parts thereof for the comfort of the rest in particular old jamie campbell janets guidman and elsie armstrong his sisters daughter so passed these three days until the wednesday even and then arose a great and mighty tempest with contrary winds driving the ship down so that notwithstanding all the skill of the shipmen she lost in one day and night more than she had gained in all the three verily she fled like a mad thing afore the violence of that wind and on the thursday night a little on the hither side of midnight she flying as thistledown afore the wind we felt a mighty shock and suddenly the water came in at our feet with a great rush mr grey said he thought the ship must have lighted on some rock and that a hole was driven in her then the shipmen opened the hatches and in dolorous voices bade us come up on deck for we were all like to drown wherefore we ascended the ladders thirtyfive in all our company i alway holding tight the hand of my wee sister when we were upon deck we found from the words of the shipmen that they were about to loose the boats so when all the boats were loosed the troopers filled two of them and the seamen the third and no room was left for the prisoners then in this time we thought much on paul and his shipwreck and how the seamen were minded to kill the prisoners lest any should escape and we marvelled if they counselled to kill us seeing there was no room for us in the boats o patient surely they laid no hands on any of you no madam they left that to the wind and the sea the three boats cast off and we prisoners stood alone on the deck of the sinking ship we had neither wit nor material to make any more boats nor rafts and when we saw our death thus before usfor our ship like pauls was stuck fast in the forepart but the sea beat freely on the hinderwe stood like men stupid and amazed for a short season but then above all the noise of the storm came mr greys voice which we were used to obeying saying brethren in a few hours at most perchance in a few minutes we shall stand before god let our last hour be employed in his worship then we gathered all around him on that part of the ship which was fast on the rock and he led the exercise with that psalm o god the heathen entered have thine heritage by them defiled is thine house on heaps they laid jerusalem after the psalm there was an exhortation our minister bade us remember that we were the lords freedmendoubly so now since our enemies had cast us away from them and we were left only on the mercy of our god moreover he recalled that of david saying in his strait let me fall into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great then he prayed with us and while the exercise yet lasted and mr grey was still praying and entreating the lord to deal with us in his mercy whether for life or for deathbut if it should be death as there seemed no other to grant if it so pleased him an easy dying unto the little children in especialwhile he prayed the ship parted asunder with a great crash and the waves leaping up on that part which stuck fast swept every soul of us out into the boiling sea o patient what a dreadful story and how many were saved four madam only four out of thirtyfive ah madam the thirtyone were happier than any of the four who were saved patient miss magdalene and wee jamie campbellold jamies grandsonand roswith and me and not one of the others said celia pityingly not one they were carried by the angels into the rest of the lord and he would not grudge them the crown of martyrdom and how did you get ashore that madam i never knew i mind falling into the water and sinking down it seemed to me far and low therein and then i was buoyed up again to the top and i tried to make some little struggle for life but the waters closed over me again and i knew no more the next minute as it felt i was lying with mine eyes shut methought in my little bed at lauchie i thought i had dreamed a bad dream sith i felt stiff and sore and cold and wet all over but as i awoke i felt it was truly so and at last i oped mine eyes and strove to sit then i saw that i sat on the seasand and above me the blue sky and i all alone and an exceeding bitter cry rose to my lips as it came back upon me what had been when i fancied i heard a bit groan no so far from me and i struggled up on my feet and crept rather than walked wondering i had no bones broken to a cleft of the rocks whence methought the groan came and there was jamie campbell lying sorely bruised and hurt and when i stooped to him he lifted up his eyes and saith o patient i thought all were drowned and that there was none here but god i said are you sore hurt my poor bairn yea quoth he for i cannot move nor sit and methinks i have some bones broke poor laddie he was in a sad way indeed i tare mine own clothing to bind up his bruises and promising to return to him i set out to see if any other might have been saved from the wreck ever hoping to find my father my mother or mr grey i walked upon the sand to the right hand and saw no sign of any soul then i turned to the left hand and passing jamie walked far that way not a soul did i see and i was about turning again in despair accounting that he and i were the only two alive when all at once i fancied i heard roswiths voice i stood and hearkenedsure enough it was roswiths voice for i never could mistake that i could not hear whence it came and so weak was i become with sorrow and weariness and fasting that methought she was speaking to me from heaven then i called roswith and heard her cry as in joy patient o miss magdalene patient is alive here is patient and before i knew aught more her little arms were around me and miss magdalene white and wan stood at my side how had they been saved they knew that no more than i did madam truly roswith like a bit fanciful lassie said she thought the lord sent an angel to help her and talked of walking over some rocks i had not the heart to gainsay the bairn and how did i know that the lord had not sent his angel well we all got back to jamie campbell but what little i could do for him was no good he died that forenoon then i said we would set forth and seek some house for it was eleven hours gone since we had eaten food but afore we could depart the tempest which was somewhat lulled washed up two bodies at our feet mr greys and elsie armstrongs we poor weak maids could do nought for their burying but miss magdalene cut off a lock of her fathers hair and kissed him and wept over him then we set out to try and find some house near when at last after two hours good walking we reached a cot we found to our sorrow that they spake a strange tongue miss magdalene was the only one of us that could speak their speech and she told us that the country where we were thus cast was the north of france patient patient irvine where are you here sir answered patient to the voice without your brother madam mr philip ingram celia was halfway across the room before she remembered that one side of her hair was still floating on her shoulders i will take him into your closet madam said patient as she left the room the colloquy outside was audible within mr philip will you wait a few minutes i have not ended dressing madams hair but by the time you have changed your boots she will be ready to see you pray what is the matter with my boots they are splashed all over sir my lady would not allow you to come into madams closet with such boots as those which you know leather and prunella never mind my boots nor my mother neither sir responded patient in a tone which admitted of but one interpretation well come i dont meanyou are always making me say something i dont mean you dear old tease sir i must obey my ladys orders must you really well then i suppose i must eh madam patient if you will please to change your boots mr philip quietly repeated patient madam will be ready to receive you in a few minutes very well madam patient i will obey your orders and the boots were heard quickly conveying their owner down the corridor celias hair was soon put up for she was very wishful to make the acquaintance of her halfbrother and she was in the boudoir waiting for him before mr philip ingram had completed the changing of his objectionable boots come in she said with a beating heart to the light tap at her door are you my sister celia i am very glad to see youvery glad i must congratulate dear old patient on having finished you sooner than i expected the first greeting over celia looked curiously at her halfbrother he was not like what she had anticipated and except for a slight resemblance about the eyes he was not like lady ingram he looked older than his yearsso much so that if celia had not known that he was her junior she would have supposed him to be her senior by some years philip ingram was of middle height inclining rather to the higher side of it slenderly built thin lithe and very active in his movements with much quickness physical and mental he had dark glossy hair brilliant dark eyes and a voice not unmusically toned well madam he said at last laughingly i hope you like me as well as i do you celia laughed in her turn and colored slightly i have no doubt that i shall like my new brother very much she said whom do you think me like that is just what i cannot settle said philip gravely considering her features you are not like ned except about the mouth you have his mouth and chin but not his eyes and forehead am i like my father dont recollect him a bit said philip he died before i was three years old edward is not here is he no he is on his travels where has he gone the stars know where he did not ask me to go with him and if he had done my ladymother would have put an extinguisher upon it i wish he were here tis only endurable when he is what is it that you dislike everything in creation said philip kicking a footstool across the room you speak very widely replied celia laughing and thinking of charley passmore i speak very truly as you will shortly find madam to your cost wait until you have been at one of her ladyships evening assemblies i am not to go until she is better satisfied with my manners said celia simply philip whistled you will not lose much he answered dont you like them what is there to like asked philip dissecting the tassel of the sofacushion a thousand yards of satin and lace or the men and women under them whose hearts are marble and their brains sawdust celia ingram dont let my mother spoil you from the little i see of you now i know you are not one of them indeed i guessed that from what my mother told me she said you were absolutely without a scrap of fine breedingwhich she meant as a censure and i took as a compliment i know what your grand ladies are and what their fine breeding is and i hope you are a true english girl with a heart in you and not one of these finnicking fussy fickle faithless frenchwomen philip let the sofacushion go when he had relieved his feelings by this burst of alliteration i hope i have a heart dear philip replied celia but can you find no friends anywhere just one said philip that is beside ned you see when ned is here he is master but when he is away i am not master her ladyship is mistress and master too but surely philip you do not wish to disobey your mother disobey my mother answered philip reflectively and resuming the sofacushion well madam i never get much chance of doing that you dont know the sort of game my mother can play sometimes what do you mean philip i will tell you what i mean celia there is a very very pleasant prospect before you imprimis madam you will be converted that is if she can manage it and if she cant it will show that you are a clever hand in the latter case the probability is that she wont think you worth the waste of any more time but if she succeed in converting you she will then proceed to form you she will turn your feet out and pinch your waist in and stick your head up and make you laugh when you are angry and cry when you are pleased she will teach you to talk without interruption for an hour and yet to have said nothing when the hour is over you will learn how to use your eyeshow to look at people and not see them and who to see or not to see i can give you a hint about that myself a man who wears no orders is nobodyyou may safely omit seeing him a man of one order is to be treated with distant civility a man of two with cordiality but a man who wears three is to be greeted with the most extreme pleasure and held in the closest friendship but if i dont like the man i cannot make a friend of him said celia in a puzzled tone my dear that doesnt come into consideration you will have to learn never to look at the man but only at his coat and decorations a man is not a man in genteel society he is a consul a marquis or a nobody never look at nobodies but if a duke should lead you to a chair be transported with delight you have a great deal to learn i see well after you have got all this by hearti am afraid it will take a long whilemy mother will proceed with her work the last act will be to take your heart out of you and put instead of it a lump of stone cut to the proper shape and size and painted so as to imitate the reality too exactly for any one to guess it an imitation and then with a lot of satin and velvet and lace on the top mrs celia ingram you will be finished oh dear i hope not said celia involuntarily so do i echoed philip significantly but philip i want to ask you one thingare you not a protestant i asked philip with a peculiar intonation no you are a papist said celia in a very disappointed tone no said philip again then what are you asked she astonished neithernothing he answered rather bitterly i am what half the men of this age are sister celianothing at all i call myself a catholic just to satisfy my mother and when i see her becoming doubtful of my soundness in her faith i go to mass with her half a dozen times to quiet her conscienceand perhaps my own but catholic as i amso far as i own to anythingi do not believe you have read more protestant books or heard more protestant preaching than i have i have tried both religions in turn and now i believe in nothing i have lost all faith whether in religion in morality in man or woman i see the men of this city protestant and catholic either bent on pursuing their own pleasures or on seeking their own intereststhinking of and caring for themselves and nothing in the world else and i see the women such as i have described them to you i find none of either faith any better than the rest what wonder then that the fire of my faiththe old bright happy trust of my childhoodhas blackened and gone out but philip dear brother pleaded celia in great pain surely you believe in god i believe in nothing said he firmly celia turned away grieved at her very heart listen to me celia resumed philip now quite serious you will not betray me to my motheri see that in your eyes you see i can believe in you he added smiling rather sadly there was a time when i believed all that you do and more when i was a little child i used to think that as patient told me god saw me and loved me and was ready to be my friend and father all that i noticed different from this in the teaching of my other nurse jeannette luchon was that she taught me to think this of the virgin mary my patron saint and my guardian angel as well as of god had i been struck deaf dumb and blind at that time i might have believed it all yet perhaps it would have been as well for me but i grew up to what i am i watched all these highly religious people who visit here i heard them invoke the virgin or the saints to favornot to forgive mind youbut before its committal to prosperwhat they admitted to be sin i saw my own mother come home from receiving the eucharist at mass and tell lies i knew they were lies i was taught that it was very wicked in me to tell lies and also that in receiving the eucharist she had received christ himself into her soul how could i believe both the one and the other i was taught again that if i committed the most fearful sins a man like myself sitting in a confessional could with two words cleanse my soul as if i had never sinned how could i believe that when from that cleansing i came home and found it no whit the cleaner i turn to protestantism i hear your preachers tell me that without holiness no man shall see the lord that god has purer eyes than to behold sin and many another passage to the like effect the next week i hear that one of the pastors flock or perhaps the very preacher himself has been guilty of some glaring breach of common honesty does the man mean me to believedoes he believe himselfwhat he told me from the pulpit only a few days earlier romans and english all are alike i find the most zealous professors of religion in both communions guilty of acts with which i who profess no religion at all would scorn to sully my conscience i have seen only one man who seems to me really honest and anxious to find out the truth and he is about where i am only that his mind is deeper and stronger than mine and therefore he suffers more but edward oh edward he is a protestant after your own heart but he could not enter into my feelings at all he is one of your simple honest folks who believe what they are taught and do not trouble themselves about the parts of the puzzle not fitting philip i do not know what to say to you answered his sister candidly i do not think we ought to look at other people and take our religion from what they do or do not do but only from god himself if you would read the bible i have read it he interrupted and do you find nothing to satisfy you there asked celia in surprise i will tell you what i find very ancient writings and very beautiful language which i admire exceedingly but nothing upon which i can rely not in gods word how do i know that it is gods word how can i be sure that there is a god at all celia was silent such questions had never suggested themselves to her mind before and she knew not how to deal with them at length she said philip i believe in one god who is my father and orders all things for me and who gave his son jesus christ to die for me instead of my dying for my own sins is this so difficult to believe i believe that you believe it said philip smiling but you do not believe it yourself she asked with a baffled feeling i have told you he said that i believe nothing philip she answered softly i do not understand your feelings and i do not know what to say to you i must ask my father i will lay it before him tonight and as he shall give me wisdom i will talk with you again so she closed the subject not knowing that the quiet certainty of conviction expressed in her last words had made a deeper impression upon philip than any argument which could have been used to him come in said lady ingram that afternoon in reply to celias gentle tap at her door i thought it was you ma chre i am glad you are come for i have something to say to you yes madam responded celia resigning herself to another lecture when you have taken dancinglessons for a month so that your deportment is a little improved i wish you to be present at my first assembly for this year do not be alarmedi require nothing more of you than to dress well and sit still i shall present you to my particular friends saying that you do not yet speak french and none of them will then address you but such as are acquainted with english you must remain in a corner of the room where your awkward manners will attract no notice and i shall put you in philips charge and desire him to tell you who each person is and so on you will then have the opportunity of seeing really fine breeding and distinguished manners and can help in the formation of your own accordingly as you will then understand what i require of you yes madam said celia again i have ordered stuffs for you and they are now in the house my assembly will be on thursday week there is quite time enough to make you one dress and you will not appear again until you are formedat least that is my present intention thrse will take your measure this evening and cut out the dress which patient can then make i wish you to have a white satin petticoat and a yellow silk bodice and train guarded with lace and i will lend you jewels thank you madam answered celia giving herself up to all her stepmothers requirements when you feel tiredi dare say you are not accustomed yet to late hoursyou may slip out of the room and retire to you own apartments nobody will miss you no madam meekly responded celia again to this not very flattering remark i think that is all i need say pursued lady ingram meditatively i do not wish to encumber and confuse your mind with too many details or you will certainly not behave well i will instruct patient how you must be dressed and i will look at you myself before you descend to the drawingroom to be sure that no ridiculous mistake has been made thrse shall dress your hair now help yourself to the chocolate patient will you bring your work into my closet i want to hear the end of your story if you please madam i must try the skirt on you in a little while by your leave so patient and the white satin petticoat came and settled themselves in celias boudoir you had just landed in france when you left off patient i am anxious to know if you found friends twould make it a very long tale madam to tell you of all that we did and suffered ere we found friends it was a hard matter to see what we should do for had i sought a place as woman to some lady i could not have left roswith alone and no lady would be like to take the child with me so i could but entreat the lord to show me how to earn bread enough for my wee sister and myself the woman of the house who took us in after the shipwreck was very good unto us the lord inclining her heart to especial pity of us and she greatly pressed us to go on to paris where she thought we should be more like to meet with succor therefore we set out on our way to paris the lord went with us and gave us favor in the eyes of all them whom we had need of on our road most of the women whom we met showed much compassion for roswith she being but a wee bit wean and a very douce and cannie bairn to boot it was in the month of october that we arrived in paris here the lord had prepared a strange thing for us there was an uncle of miss magdalene by name mr francis grey who was a rich gentleman and a kindly he had been on his travels into foreign parts and was returning through this city unto his place and by what men call chance miss magdalene and i lighted on this gentleman in the paris street we returning from the buying of bread and other needful matters he was as if he saw her not for he afterward told us that he had heard nought of the harrying of lauchie nor of our shipwreck but she ran to him and cast her arms about him calling uncle francis and after a season he knew her again but at first he was a man amazed when he heard all that had come upon us and how miss magdalene was left all alone in the world father and mother being drowned he wept and clipped her many times and said that she should come with him to his inn and dwell with him and be unto him as a daughter for he had no child then she prayed him to have compassion upon us also patient and roswith leslie who as john saith had continued with her in her tribulation and it pleased her to say had aided and comforted her mr francis smiled and he said that i patient should be in his service as a woman for her and for roswith she quoth he will not eat up all my substance poor wee thing so she shall come too and in time patient must learn her meetly unto the same place to some other lady thus it was madam that at the time when we seemed at the worst the lord delivered us out of our distresses then you went back to scotland no madam we never went back for when mr francis heard all of the harrying of lauchie and the evil deeds of the kings troopers and the cruelty of claverhouse he said there could be no peace in scotland more and sent word unto his steward to sell all and remit the money to him he bought a house at paris and there we dwelt all it was in her uncles house then that my mother met my father there madam sir edward took her to england for they married in january while king james yet reigned and sir edward was great with the king and had a fine land there her son your brother madam that is sir edward now was born in london in the summer of patient what kind of man was my father he was a very noblelooking gentleman madam tall with dark eyes and hair yes but i mean in his mind and character well madam answered patient rather doubtfully he was much like other men he had good points and bad points he was a kindly gentleman and openhanded he was not an angel you scarce liked him i think patient i ought not to say so madam he was alway a good and kind master to me truly he was not the man i should have chosen for miss magdalene but i seldom see folks choose as i should in their places yet that is little marvel since fifteen years gone patient leslie made a choice that patient irvine would be little like to make now patients dry sarcastic tone warned celia that she had better turn the conversation and where was i born patient well madam you know what happened that summer your brother was born he that was called prince of wales was born in the same month and in october king james fled away sending his wife queen mary and the babe to france when king william landed it was expected that he would seize all belonging to the malignants this was not so entirely yet so much that sir edward was sore afeared to lose his he kept marvellous quiet for a time trusting that such as were then in power would maybe not think of him but when king james landed in ireland he was constrained to join him but he left my lady behind and me with her at his own house in cheshire after the battle of boyne water whereat he fought it happed as he feared for all his property was escheated to the crown at this time mr francis grey came back into the country and for a time sir edward and my lady abode with him at a house which he had near the border on the english side but sir edward by his work on the boyne had made the place too hot for to hold him and he bethought himself of escaping after king james to france so about march we began to journey slowly all down england from the border to the south sea sir edward was mortal afeared of being known and seized so that he would not go near any place where he could possibly be known and having no acquaintance anywhere in the parts of devon made him fix upon plymouth whence to sail it was in the last of may that we left exeter we had journeyed but a little thence when i saw that my lady who had been ailing for some time was like to fall sick unto death i told sir edward that methought she was more sick than he guessed but i think he counted my words but idle clavers and foolish fancies at last she grew so very bad that he began to believe me patient he said to me one morn i shall go on to plymouth and inquire for a ship tend your lady well and so soon as she can abide the journeying she must come after if i find it needful i may sail the first it was on a monday that sir edward rode away leaving my lady and the little master with me and roswith to tend them at a poor cot the abode of one betty walling betty walling of ashcliffe why patient i know her do you so madam she knows you i guess and could have told you somewhat anent yourself not that she knew my ladys name i kept that from her it was on the friday following that you were born saving your presence madam you were such a poor weak puny babe that none thought you would live even a day betty said i mind poor little soul twill soon be out of its sufferingyou may take that comfort i myself never reckoned that you could live i marvel whether madam passmore would remember betty wallings coming unto her one wet even in june to beg a stoup of wine for a sick woman with her that sick woman was my dear lady it was the saturday eve and she died on the sunday morning i laid her out for the burying which was to be on the wednesday and was preparing to go thence unto plymouth afterward with roswith and the babes when on the tuesday night i was aroused from sleep by a rapping on the window i crept to the casement and oped it and was surprised to hear my masters voice saying softly patient come and open to me i ran then quickly and let him in he looked very white and tired and his dress soiled as if he had ridden hard and long quoth he how fares magdalene as softly as i could break it i told him that she would never suffer any more but she had left him a baby daughter which he must cherish for her sake he was sore grieved as ever i saw man for aught after a while he told me much quickly for there was little time he had not entered plymouth when riding softly in the dark another horseman met him and aroused his wonder by riding back after him and away again and this he did twice over at length the strange horseman rode right up to him and asked him plainly are you sir edward ingram holding king jamess commission and when he said he was then said the horseman if you look to sail from plymouth i would have you know that you are expected there and spies be abroad looking for you and you will be taken immediately you show yourself if you love your life turn back sir edward desiring to know both who he was and how he knew this the horseman saith that i may not tell you but ride hard or they will be on your track for they already misdoubt that you are at ashcliffe where if your following be i counsel you to remove thence with all the speed that may be sir edward said that he had ridden for life all through three days and nights and now we must move away without awaiting aught and we will go quoth he by bideford for they will expect me now if they find i have given them the slip to take passage by portsmouth or southampton and will scarce count on my turning westward it grieved us both sore to leave my lady unburied but there was no help and betty passed her word to follow the body and see that she was meetly laid in her grave and how will i carry the babe quoth i nay truly said he sorrowfully the babe cannot go with us it will bewray all by its crying we must needs leave it somewhere at nurse and when better times come and the king hath his own again i will return and claim it for master edward was a braw laddie that scarce ever cried or plained while you madam under your leave did keep up a continual whining and mewling which would have entirely hindered our lying hid or journeying under cover of darkness so i called betty when it grew light and conferred with her and she said leave the babe at the gate of the hall and watch it till one cometh to take it madam passmore she told us was a kindly gentlewoman that had sent word she would have come to see my lady herself if she also had not been sick and at this time having a little babe of her own betty thought she would be of soft heart unto any other desolate and needful babe so i clad you in laced wraps and pinned a paper on your coat with a gold pin of my ladys and sir edward wrote on the paper your name celia the which my poor lady as she lay adying had felt a fancy to have you called he said he had ever wished should he have a daughter to name her grissel which was my lady his mothers name but quoth he if my poor magdalene in dying had asked me to name the child nebuchadnezzar i would not have said her nay he was such a gentleman as that madam in his deepest troubles he scarce could forbear jesting so i carried you to the hall and laid you softly down at the gate and rang the bell and hid and watched among the trees there first the master rode up looked strangely on you though pitifully enough but touched you not and anon came out a kindlylooking woman of some fiftyandfive or sixty years and took you up and carried you away in her arms chirping pleasantly unto you the while so i was satisfied for the babe that was cicely aggett said celia smiling dear old cicely she told me about her finding me the next hour pursued patient saw us thence we got safe to bideford and away the lord aiding us and after some tossing upon the sea landed at harfleur in fourteen days thereafter thence we came up to paris unto mr francis greys house which he had given unto my lady in dowry and sir edward bought another house at st germains for he had had prudence to put some of his money out to interest in this land so that all was not lost and now tell me patient how did he meet my stepmother i must pray you to leave that madam for the time and try on this skirt thrse hath given me the pieces for the bodice john graham of claverhouse viscount of dundee was the eldest son of sir william graham and lady jane carnegy his wife he was a descendant of the royal line of scotland through his ancestress the princess mary daughter of king robert iii he fell at killicrankie july in person he was eminently beautiful in politics devoutly loyal in character a remarkable instance of the union of the softest and most genial manners with the sternest courage and most revolting cruelty in action his least punishment as a general was death and his persecution of the hapless covenanters was restrained by no sense of humanity or compassion ps lxxix sam xxiv embraced at st jamess palace june maria beatrice leonora only daughter of alfonso iv duke of modena and laura martinozzi born at modena october married by proxy at modena september and in person at dover november to james duke of york afterwards james ii died of cancer at st germainenlaye may and buried at chaillot this name was given both during the rebellion and the revolution by each party to its opponents fought july vi the troubles of greatness good majesty herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased shakespeare very fair turn round yes i think that will do now do you understand how to behave to people if you please madam i do in england but i dont know about france said celia in some trepidation as to what her stepmother might require of her absurd said lady ingram good manners are the same everywhere and etiquette very nearly so now how many courtesies would you make to a viscountess i should only make one to anybody madam unless you tell me otherwise incroyable i never saw such a lamentable want of education as you show you have no more fine breeding than that stove now listen and remember to a princess of the blood you make three profound courtesies approaching a little nearer each time until at the last you are near enough to sink upon your knees and kiss her hand to a duchess not of the blood or a marchioness three courtesies but less profound and not moving from your place to a countess or viscountess two to any other person superior or equal to yourself one inferiors of course you will not condescend to notice do you understand and will you remember i will do my best madam but i am afraid i shall forget i believe you will first thing now listen again i expect tonight the duchesses of longueville and montausier the marchioness de simiane and other inferior persons what kind of seat will you take will you please to instruct me madam asked celia timidlyan answer which slightly modified lady ingrams annoyance you are very ignorant said that lady it is one comfort that you are willing to be taught my dear when we are merely assembled en famille and there is no etiquette observed you can sit on what you like but if there be any person present in an assembly of higher rank than yourself you must not sit on a chair with a back to it and whatever be the rank of your companions on no occasion must you occupy an armchair you will take your place this evening on an ottoman or a foldingstool you will remember that i will remember madam replied celia should any member of the royal house condescend to honor me by appearing at my assembliesi do not expect it tonightyou will rise making three deep courtesies and remain standing until you are desired to seat yourself yes madam very well now go down into the drawingroom and find a stool somewhere in the corner where nobody will see you thus graciously dismissed celia retired from her stepmothers dressingroom with a long look at lady ingram whom she had never before seen so splendidly attired she wore a blue robe with a long sweeping train robe and train being elaborately embroidered with flowers in white crimson and strawcolor a petticoat of the palest strawcolored satin a deep lace berthe and sleeves of lace reaching to the elbow long white gloves advanced to meet the sleeve and jewels of sapphire and diamond gleamed upon the neck and wrists her hair was dressed about a foot above her head and adorned with white plumes sapphires and diamonds celia descended to the drawingroom feeling stiff and uncomfortable in her new yellow silk and white satin and nervously afraid of losing her bracelets and necklace of topaz and diamonds which lady ingram had lent her for the occasion in the drawingroom she discovered mr philip resplendently arrayed in white and crimson and occupied in surveying himself intently in the mirrors o celia said he when she uttered his name i am glad you have come early it is such fun to see the folks come in and do all their bowing and courtesying and i shall have some amusement tonight in watching your innocent astonishment at some things my woodland bird or i am mistaken please be seated madam here is a place for you in a nice little corner and i shall keep by your side devotedly all the evening has my ladymother seen and approved that smart new gown of yours celia smiled and answered affirmatively that is a comfort quoth mr philip now i liked the looks of you a good deal better in that brown cashmere but i am an absolute nobody as you will find very shortly if you have not done so already the brown cashmere will go on again tomorrow and i shall not be sorry for it but philip stop look outsomebody is coming a gentleman in dark blue led in a lady very elaborately dressed in pink as they entered by one door lady ingram came forward to receive them from another she stood and made three courtesies to which the lady in pink responded with one then lady ingram came forward and taking the hand of her guest turned to celia and philip in the corner bon soir ma tante observed the latter unceremoniously from his station behind celias chair celia this is my sister the duchess de montausier lady ingram condescended to say and celia rising made two low courtesies having already forgotten the number of reverences due three whispered philip too low to be overheard thus saving his sister a scolding the duchess returned the compliment with a single courtesy celia thought a rather distant one but her astonishment had not yet left her at the meeting between the sisters is that really your aunt she asked of philip yes my mothers sister answered philip smiling why they courtesied so was celias ungrammatical exclamation ah you think it unsisterly the one my dear is a duchess the other only the widow of a baronet you must not consider the sistership celia laughed within herself to think how the squire and madam passmore would look if they saw her and isabella courtesying away at each other in that style now dont lose all these folks resumed philip as more people entered that little man dressed in black with a black wig to whom my mother is courtesying nowdo you see him i was just looking at him replied celia i cannot say that i like him though i have no idea who he may be whybecause he is so short oh no i hope i should never dislike a man for any natural infirmity i thought he looked very cross he has the happy distinction of being the crossest man in france said philip well he looks like it said celia but one of the most distinguished men in france my dear that is the great duke de lauzun who has spent ten years in prison for treason who aspired to the hand of mademoiselle the kings own cousin and whom king james trusted to bring the queen and the prince of wales over here from england i wonder he trusted him observed celia i never wonder at anything philosophically answered mr philip ingram now look to your right do you see the lady in black with fair hair and blue eyes who seems so quiet and uninterested in all that is passing i think i do that is a cousin of my mothers who would not have appeared here if it had not been a family assembly she is a jansenist thirty years ago she was a famous beauty and a very fashionable woman now all that is over what is a jansenist philip ah there you puzzle me i thought you would want to know that you had better ask my cousin charlotteshe can tell you much better than i can i do not like to speak to any one said celia timidly can you not tell me something about them well this much i can tell youthey are very bad people who lead uncommonly holy livesergo holiness does not make a saint philip you are laughing at me no my dear i am laughing at the catholic church not at you the jansenists are a sort of hereticcatholics whom all real catholics agree to call very wicked they hold all manner of wrong doctrines according to the bishops and my ladymother and they lead lives of such austerity and purity as to put half the saints in the calendar to shame now this very cousin charlotte of mine who sits there looking so quiet and saintly with her blue eyes cast down and her hands folded on that sombre black gownwhen my mother was a girl she was the gayest of the gay about fifteen years since she became a jansenist from that day she has been a very saint she practices all kinds of austerities and is behaved to almost as if she were a professed nun of course in the eyes of all true catholics her jansenism is her worst and wickedest action i dont quite see myself how anything can be so very wrong which makes such saints of such sinners but you see i am a complete extern as the religious call it i should like to know something more about these people philip what doctrines do they hold now what a remarkable attraction anything wrong and perilous has for a woman observed mr philip ingram with the air of a philosopher well my dear i have only heard one but i believe they have a sort of confession or creed indicating the points whereon they differ from the church that one is that there is no such thing as grace of congruity and that men are saved by the favor of god only and by no merit of their own but philip that is the gospel exclaimed celia turning round to look at him that is what we protestants believe is it my dear well i have no objection now return to your condition of a statue or you will have a lecture on awkwardness and want of repose in your manners oh i know all about that do you think i was born such a finished courtier as you see me as to merit i have lived long enough to find out one thing and that is that people who are always talking of merit are generally least particular about acquiring it while those who believe that their good deeds are worth nothing have the largest stock of them that is natural said celia thoughtfully is it asked philip again well it looks like the rule of contrary to me but you see i have no vocation now look at the lady who stands on my mothers leftthe one in primrose do you see her i see her said celia i like her face better than some of the others who is she the marchioness de simiane daughter of the countess de grignan and granddaughter of the late clever marchioness de svign her flatterers call her an angel she is not that but i dont think she is quite so near the other set of ethereal essences as a good many of the people in this room what an opinion you have of your friends philip my friends are they responded philip with a little laugh how many of them do you suppose would shed tears at my funeral there is not one of them who has a heart my dearmerely lumps of painted stone as i told you these are not men and womenthey are only walking statues do you call that cross little man a walking statue asked celia smiling hescarcely he is too intensely disagreeable i should rather like to see the lady to whom you said that man took a fancy philip is she here ah my sister answered philip in a graver voice than any in which he had yet spoken you must go to the royal vaults at st denis and search among the coffins to do that she was buried twenty years ago she was so unfortunate as to have a heart and he has a piece of harder marble even than usual so when the two articles met the one broke the other i never can tell whether you are jesting or serious philip a little of both generally my dear dont lose those ladies who are going through the courtesying process nowthey are distinguished people the elder one is the duchess du maine one of the daughters of the prince of cond who is emphatically the prince in french society the younger is mademoiselle de noailles the daughter of the duke de noaillesa famous belle as you may see she will probably be disposed of in a year or two to some prince or dukewhoever offers her father the best lump of pinmoney we dont sell young ladies in the market here as they do in barbary we manage the little affair in private but tis a sale for all that it sounds very bad when you look at it in that light philip a good many things do so my dear when you strip off the gilding his majesty gave a cut of his walkingstick once to a gentleman with whom he was in a passion and was considered to have honored him by that gracious notice now if he had been the barons son and the other the king whipping to death would have been thought too good for him after such an insult to majesty we live in a droll world my sister but philip there must be differences between peoplegod has made it so arent therewith a vengeance on my word here comes bontems the kings head valetdechambre now we shall have some fun you will learn the kind of differences there are between peoplelouis xiv and you to wit what do you mean by fun you shall hear here is a chair monsieur bontems and i am rejoiced to see you sir i am your most obedient servant responded a dapper little gentleman dressed in black and silver with a long sword by his side and large silver buckles in his shoes he sat down on the seat which philip indicated i trust that his most christian majesty enjoys good health this evening began that young gentleman with an air of the greatest interest in the reply to his question sir i am happy to say that his majesty condescends to be in the enjoyment of most excellent health very condescending of him i am sure commented philip gravely may i venture to hope that his royal highness the duke de berry is equally condescending sir answered monsieur bontems looking much grieved i regret exceedingly to state that monseigneur the duke is not in perfect health on the contrary he has this very day been constrained to take medicine how deeply distressing lamented mr philip ingram putting on a face to match his words and might i ask the kind of medicine which had the felicity of a passage down monseigneurs most distinguished throat and the honor of relieving his august sufferings sir answered monsieur bontems not in the least perceiving that he was being laughed at it was a tisane of camomile flowers i unfeignedly trust that it has not affected his illustrious appetite sir was the reply always commencing by the same word i am much troubled at the remembrance that his royal highnesss appetite at supper was extremely bad he ate only two plates of soup one fowl fifty heads of asparagus and a small cherry tart ah it must have been very bad indeed said mr philip with a melancholy air he generally eats about a couple of geese and half a dozen pheasants does he not sir said monsieur bontems interrogatively i am happy to say sir that all the members of the royal house have tolerably good appetites but scarcelytwo geese and six pheasantsno sir yes i have gathered that they have from what i have heard you say answered philip gravely monsieur bontems i am anxious to inform my sisterwho speaks no frenchof the manner in which his majesty is served throughout the day i am not sure that i remember all points correctly it is your duty is it not to present his majestys wig in the morning and to buckle his left garter the left sir asked monsieur bontems somewhat indignantly the right any of his majestys ordinary valets may touch the leftit is my high office to attend upon the august right leg of my most venerated sovereign i beg your pardon a hundred thousand times you have it sir said monsieur bontems affably a young gentleman who shows so much interest in his majestys and monseigneurs health may be pardoned even that but you are a little mistaken in saying buckle his majesty is frequently pleased to clasp his own garters it is my privilege to unclasp them in the evening would you kindly explain to me that i may translate to my sister his majestys mode of life during each day sir i shall have the utmost pleasure replied monsieur bontems laying his hand upon his heart madam he continued addressing himself to celia though she could understand him only through the medium of philip first thing in the morning when i rise from the watchbed which i occupy in the august chamber of my sovereign having noiselessly dressed in the antechamber i and monsieur de st quentin first gentleman of the chamber reverently approach his royal bed and presume to arouse our sovereign from his slumbers then monsieur de st quentin turns his back to the curtains and placing his hands behind him respectfully presents the royal wigs properly curled and dressed for his majestys selection pardon my interrupting you i thought the kings attendants never turned their backs upon him sir his majesty cannot be seen without a wig profanity cried monsieur bontems looking horrified this is the only part of our service in which we are constrained to turn our ignoble backs upon our most illustrious master i beg your pardon and understand you now pray proceed when the king has selected the wig which he is pleased to wear st quentin puts away the others and then his majesty placing his wig on his august head with his own royal hands he indicates to me by a signal that he is ready for the curtains to be undrawn as soon as i have undrawn the curtains there is the familiar entre this is attended by the princes of the blood and by his majestys physicians then i pour into the hands of my sovereign a few drops of spirits of wine and the duke daumont first lord of the bedchamber offers the holy water now his majesty rises and i present his slippers after putting on his dressinggown if it be winter his majesty goes to the fire the first entre follows the king shaves on alternate days monsieur de st quentin has the high honor of removing the royal beard and washing with spirits of wine and water our sovereigns august chin i hold the glass while his majesty wipes his face with a rich towel then while his majestys dresses the grande entre takes place his most christian majesty is assisted in dressing by the grand master of the robes monsieur daumont a marquis graciously chosen by the sovereign monsieur de st quentin my humble self three valets and two pages thus as you will see many attendants of the crown are allowed the felicity of approaching near to the person of our most illustrious master too many cooks spoiling the broth i should say was the translators comment fancy ten people helping a fellow to put his coat on his majestys shoes and garters are clasped with diamonds at this point the king condescends to breakfast on an enamelled salver a loaf is brought by the officers of the buttery and a folded napkin on another the cupbearer presents to the duke daumont a golden cup into which he pours a small quantity of wine and water and the second cupbearer makes the assay the goblet carefully rinsed and replenished is now presented to his majesty upon a golden saucer the napkin is offered by the first prince of the blood present at the entre his majesty then intrusts to my hands the reliquary which he wears about his neck and i carefully pass it to one of the lower attendants who carries it to the royal closet and remains there in charge of it the royal shirt is then presentedby the grand master of the robes if no person of more distinction be present but if any more august persons have attended the entre it is passed on till it reaches the first prince of the blood i assure you on frosty winter days i have known it perfectly cold on reaching his majesty though always carefully warmed the persons of distinction through whose hands it had to pass being so numerous ah pride costs more than hunger thirst or cold observed mr philip ingram that is a copy i had set me ages ago but what a very cool proceeding when his majestys lace cravat is presented he is pleased himself to indicate the person who shall have the honor of tying it then i bring him the overcoat which he wore on the previous day and with his own august hands he removes from the pockets such articles as he is pleased to retain lastly monsieur de st quentin presents to him on an enamelled salver two handkerchiefs laced with superb point now his majesty returns to his ruelle for his private devotions two cushions are placed there upon which his majesty condescends to kneel here he prays aloud all the cardinals and bishops in the chamber following his royal accents in lower tones i hope he learns his prayers by heart then or all his cardinals following will put him out abominably was the interpolation this time oh dear philip murmured celia it reminds me of daniel and darius save of thee o king no he is a little better than that our sovereign pursued monsieur bontems now receives the envoys of foreign powers not one of which powers is worthy to compete with our august master i say draw that mild objected mr philip ingram then he passes into his cabinet and issues his orders for the day when all retire but the blood and a few other highly distinguished persons after an interval of repose his majesty attends mass how sadly he must want his repose after mass and a visit to the councilchamber at one oclock his majesty dines this is either au petit couvert or au grand couvert the grands couverts are rare his majesty commonly dines alone in his own cabinet at a small table three courses and a dessert being served monsieur de st quentin announces the repast and his majesty takes his seat if the grand chamberlain be there he waits on the sovereign when he is absent this is the privilege of monsieur de st quentin another interval of repose ensues before his majesty drives out he frequently condescends at this time to amuse himself with his favorite dogs then he changes his dress and drives or hunts on returning he again changes his attire and after a short period in his cabinet repairs to the apartments of madame de maintenon where he remains until ten the hour of supper at a quarter past ten his majesty enters the supperroom during which interval the officers have made the assay what is the assay asked celia of philip who repeated the question the assay said monsieur bontems condescending to explain is the testing of different matters to see that no attempt has been made upon the most sacred life of his majesty there is the assay of the plates which are rubbed with bread and salt the knife the fork the spoon and the toothpicks which will be used by our sovereign all these are rubbed with bread and salt afterwards eaten by the officers of the assay to make sure that no deleterious matter has been applied to these articles every dish brought to the royal table is tested by the officers ere it may be set before his majesty and the dishes are brought in by the comptrollergeneral an officer of the pantry a comptroller of the buttery and an equerry of the kitchen preceded and followed by guards whose duty it is to prevent all manner of tampering with the meats destined for the king poor man said celia compassionately i am glad to be beneath all that caution and preparation this done proceeded monsieur bontems the housesteward enters with two ushers bearing flambeaux then comes his most christian majesty all the princes and princesses of france are already standing round the table his majesty most graciously desires them to be seated six nobles stand at each end of the table when his majesty condescends to drink the cupbearer cries aloud drink for the king whereupon the officers of the cellar approach with an enamelled goblet and two decanters the cupbearer pours out the officers taste the cupbearer presents the goblet to the sovereign and as he raises it with his illustrious hand to his august lips the cupbearer cries aloud the king drinks and the whole company bow to his majesty what a tremendous bore it must be was mr philips comment how can the poor fellow ever get his supper eaten his majesty commonly begins supper with three or four platesful of different soups some light meat followsa chicken a pheasant a partridge or twothen a heavier dish such as beef or mutton the king concludes his repast with a few little delicacies such as salad pastry and sweetmeats when he wishes to wipe his hands three dukes and a prince of the blood present him with a damp napkin the dry one which follows i have the honor to offer his majesty usually drinks about three times during supper how much at a time inquired philip with an air of deep interest sir replied monsieur bontems gravely his majestys custom in this respect somewhat varies the goblet holds about halfapint and the king rarely empties it at a draught a pint and a quarter call it said philip reflectively after supper his majesty proceeds to his bedchamber where he dismisses the greater number of his guests he then passes on to his cabinet followed by the princes and princesses about midnight he feeds his dogs does he feed them himself sir there are occasions upon which those indescribably happy animals have the honor of receiving morsels from his majestys own hand the king now returns to his bedchamber and the petit coucher commences an armchair is prepared for him near the fire and the encas is placed upon a table near the bed this is a small repast prepared lest it should be his majestys pleasure to demand food during the night it is most frequently a bowl of soup a cold roast fowl bread wine and water and how many dukes are required to give him those sir my humble services are esteemed sufficient he appears to be much less august at some moments than others satirically remarked the translator when our sovereign enters his chamber he hands to me his watch and reliquary and delivers to monsieur daumont his waistcoat cravat and ribbon two valets and two pages assist us in the removal of the garments honored by his majestys wear when the king is ready i lift the candlestick and deliver it to the nobleman indicated by my sovereign for that unparalleled honor all persons now quit the chamber save the candlebearer the physician and myself his majesty selects the dress which he will wear the next morning and gets into bed can he get into bed by himself i should have thought it would have required five dukes and ten marquises to help him after the physician has visited his august patient he and the candlebearer retire i close the curtains and turning my back to the royal couch with my hands behind me await the pleasure of my sovereign it is to me that he delivers the wig passing it outside the curtain with his own illustrious hand i now extinguish the candles light the nightlights and take possession of the watchbed i wonder if you dont occasionally faint under such a weight of honorand bother observed mr philip ingram not to monsieur bontems well now we have got his most christian majesty in bed let him stay there monsieur bontems i am unspeakably indebted to you for your highlyinteresting account and shall never forget it as long as i live i beg you will not allow me to detain you further from the company who are earnestly desirous of your enchanting conversation though less sensible of your merits than i am monsieur bontems laid both hands upon his heart and made three bows sir i beg you will not depreciate your high qualities sir i take the utmost delight in conversing with you and the headvalet of the chamber allowed himself to be absorbed among the general throng well is he not a comical specimen said philip to celia he often makes me laugh till i am exhausted and the beauty of it is that he never finds out at what one is laughing and to think who it is that they worship with all these ritesan old man of seventyfour with one foot in the grave who has never been any better than he should be really it reminds one of herod agrippa and them of tyre and sidon thou shalt honor the face of the old man whispered celia softly my dear said philip i dont complain of their honoring him let them honor him as much as they likehe is their king and they ought to do but what we have just heard is not honoring him to my thinkingit is teasing and worshipping him i assure you i pity the poor fellow with all my heart he must have a most uncomfortable time of it no if i were to envy any man it would not be louis xiv who would it be philip asked celia with a smile simeon stylites perhaps said philip drily i would quite as soon be the one as the other i dont know who he was replied celia a gentleman of the olden time who worked out his salvation for forty years on the top of a tall pillar was the answer accompanied by an expression of countenance which celia had seen before in philip and could not understand are you tired he added suddenly scarcely yet she answered it is all so new to me but what time is it philip philip pulled out a watch about three inches in diameter ten minutes to one do you mean to say it is one oclock in the morning asked celia in a voice of unmitigated amazement and horror it certainly is not one oclock in the afternoon replied philip with much gravity i had no idea how late it was let me go philip please do and celia made her escape rather hastily but lady ingram was not justified in saying that nobody would miss her as she would have seen if she had noticed the lost and ennuy look of mr philip ingram after the disappearance of celia antoine nompar de caumont marquis de peguilin and duke

xii lev xix vii the night boswith died thou art not weary o sweet heart and glad ye are not weary o ye wings of light ye are not weary goldensandalled feet and eyes lift up in heaven were we with thee we never should be weary any more so sleep sweet love and waken not for us ah wake not at my cry which is of earth for thou these twenty years hast been of heaven still not thy harp for me i will wail low that my voice reach thee not beyond the stars only wait for me o my harper since when thou and i have clasped hands at the gate we never shall be weary any more o patient i am very sorry to have kept you up so late as thisi had no idea that you would wait for me exclaimed celia as hastening into her bedroom she found patient quietly at work beside the fire i should have done that madam at whatever hour you had returned was patients answer as she helped celia to unclasp her topaz and diamond ornaments and put them away carefully in their cases i thought you were early my lady often does not quit her assemblies till daydawn you see responded celia a little apologetically awaking to the fact that patient had not expected her for another hour or two i am so little accustomed to these things i never was up at such an hour as this before all the better for you madam said patient quietly you do not like these assemblies i have nothing to do with them madam but if you had persisted celia looking for patients opinion as a sister in the faith but patient seemed scarcely willing to impart it you command me to answer you madam she said i want to know patient replied celia simply what concord hath christ with belial answered patient madam when i was but a young maid i looked on the world as divided into many sectscovenanters independents prelatists anabaptists and the like and i fancied that all who were not covenanters as i was must needs be more or less wrong methinks i am wiser now i see the world as divided into two camps only and the army wherein i serve hath but one rallyingcry they that believe and they that believe nothere are the camps what think ye of christthat is the rallyingcry i see the church as a great school holding many forms and classes but only one master and i think less now of a fellowscholar sitting on another form from mine and seeing the other side of the masters face if i find that he heareth his voice and followeth him madam what think you all those great ladies downstairs would say if you asked them that questionwhat think ye of christ poor souls they never think of him and with them in the enemys camp i have nought to do so long as they remain there but may we not win them over to our side queried celia ah my dear young lady answered patient rather sadly i have seen that question lead many a disciple astray who did run well when a man goes over to the enemys ground to parley it ends at times in his staying there methinks that it is only when we carry the master with us and when we go like the preachers to the poor savages in the plantations that we have any hope of doing well tis so easy to think i go there to please god when really we only go to please ourselves patient remained silent for a few minutes but said presently the sabbath afore the harrying of lauchie madam which was communion sabbath mr grey preached a very rich discourse from that word he hath made with me an everlasting covenant after fencing the tables he spake from that other word of paul ye are christs and in speaking on one headhe dividing his discourse into thirtyseven points wherein believers are christshe said one word which hath stuck in mine heart since then we are all vastly readier quoth he to try to follow the master in the few matters wherein he acted as god and therefore beyond us than in the multitude wherein he did act as our ensample for an hundred who would willingly follow unto the pharisees feasting there is scarce one who is ready to seek out sinners saying unto them go and sin no more whereupon he took occasion to reprove them among his flock that were of too light and unstable a nature loving overmuch gadding about and taking of pleasure i was then a young maid and truly was somewhat exercised with that discourse seeing that i loved the customs yearly observed among us on the st day of november which the papistical folk called halloween what customs patient divers light and fantastical vanities madam which you were no better to hear tell ofsuch like as burning of nuts with names to them and searching of eggs brake into glasses for the discovering of fortunes which did much delight me in my tender age though now i know that they be but folly if not worse moreover they would throw apples in tubs of water and the laddies and lassies with their hands tied behind would strive to reach them by mouth and many other siccan fooleries it sounds rather amusing patient so it might be madam for we bairns which were of too small age for aught less foolish but for us who are members of christs body and have heard his voice and followed him what have we to do with the deeds of this weary and evil world which we cast off when we arose to follow him maybe i had better not have said this unto you madam seeing that saving your presence you are yet but a young maid and youth is naturally desirous of vain delights when you are a little further on in the way the lord will teach it you himself even as he hath taught me to tell you the truth patient while i quite see with you in the main i think you a little severe in the particular i do not doubt it madam the lord knoweth how to deaden your heart unto this world and he can do it a deal better than i but if you be his the which i doubt not it must needs be i have scarce a choice now said celia in a low voice feeling doubtful how far she ought to make any remark to patient which might seem to reflect on lady ingram that i perceive madam answered patient in the same tone onlyif you will condescend to pardon the liberty i take in saying ittake heed that the pleasing and obeying of man clash not with the pleasing and obeying of god for all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of lifeis not of the father but is of the world patient there is one thing which i feel very much herethe want of a protestant service i used to feel that very sore madam not that i miss it not now specially at times yet scarce me thinks so sadly as i once did at first i was much exercised with that word forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and i marvelled whether i ought to remain in this place but i began to think that it was not i that had forsaken mine own land but the lord which hath caused me to be cast out thence i having moreover passed a solemn word to my dear lady when she lay adying that i would not leave master edward his lone in this strange land while he was yet a bairn then me thought of some words of mr grey in that last sermon he ever preached a soldier quoth he hath no right to choose his position so now seeing that since the dragonnades as they called the persecution here there is no worship permitted to be had and also that the lord and not i hath placed me here i am content every sabbath ay every day he preacheth unto me in the word and there is no finer discourse than his what persecution patient asked celia as she lay down on her pillow this king hath never been a persecutor hath he ay hath he madam the morn if it please you i will tell you some stories of the dragonnades my lady hath given me further work to do for you and if you think meet i can bring my sewing into your closet as aforetime pray do patient i like your stories goodnight goodnight madam and the lord be with you your very obedient servant mrs celia ingram observed mr philip lounging into his sisters boudoir the next morning i hope your early rising has done you no harm i rose at my usual hour which is six i rose at my usual hour which is nine o philip cried celia laughing well now what earthly inducement have i to rise earlier i am doomedfor my sins i supposeto spend four mortal hours of every day in dressing breakfasting dining and supping moreover i am constrained to ride a horse item i have to talk nonsense fourth and lastly i am the docile slave of my ladymother is there anything in the list i have just given you to make a fellow turn out of bed three hours before he cant help it i should not think there was except in the last item not in the last item madam seeing that her gracious ladyship does not shine upon the world any sooner than i dohave you not discovered that yet it seems to me philip that you want something to do well that depends said philip reflectively it might be something i should not relish well said celia a trifle scornfully i never would lead such a useless life as that philip would either find something to do or make it how very like a woman you talk loftily remarked mr philip ingram putting his hands in his pockets celia laughed merrily i dont like it celia resumed philip more seriously but what can i do i wish exceedingly that my mother would let me go into the army but she will not edward you knowor you dont knowis a colonel in king jamess army so that he can find something to do i wish you would talk to my mother about it i echoed celia in an unmistakable tone you repeated her brother my dear philip you surely very much mistake my position with her i have no more influence with my lady ingram thanthan her little pug dog a precious lot then retorted mr philip for if anybody ruffled the tip of miss venuss tail they would not be asked here again for a twelvemonth it is you who mistake mrs celia the only way to manage my mother is to stand up to herto let her know that you can take your own way and you will neither you nor i have any right to do that philip replied celia gravely i have not that i allow said philip i dont quite see that as regards you her ladyship is not your mother i think that she takes to me the place both of father and mother and that i have no more right to argue with or disobey her than them that is your view is it inquired philip meditatively well if you look at it in that way of course you cannot ask her so be it then i must be contented i suppose with my customary and highly useful mode of life i find no lack of occupation observed celia no you are a woman said philip and as patients old rhyme of which i never can remember the first line says womans work is never done women do seem to possess a marvellous and enviable faculty of finding endless amusement in pushing a needle into a piece of linen and pulling it out againcant understand it oh has my mother told you that we are going to st germains next week no said celia rather surprised then there is a piece of information for you she expects me to go i suppose if you dont i wont said mr philip ingram dogmatically is thethecourtbegan celia very hesitatingly is the pretender there come out with it nowi shall not put my fingers in my ears yes madam the pretender is there and his mother too and all the rest of them oh sighed celia much relieved i thought you would be a jacobite you are a whig then mrs celia asked philip in an amused tone i do not know that i am a politician at all she answered but i was brought up to the whig view all right said mr philip accommodatingly dont let my mother know itthat is all i think my fathersquire passmore i meancelia explained a little sadly told her so much at our first meeting so much the better and you expected to find me a redhot jacobite did you to tell the truth i dont care two pins about it neither does my mother only tis the mode here and she has taken it up along with her facewashes laces and lutestring of course i would not call the king anything but your majesty to his faceit would hurt his feelings poor gentleman and i dont see that it would do any good but if you ask me whether i would risk the confiscation of my property when i have any in aiding a second restorationwhy not i do you consider yourself an englishman or a frenchman philip well upon my word mrs celia ingram you are complimentary do i consider myself an englishman or a frenchman i am an englishman madam and proud of it and i will thank you not to insult me by asking me whether i consider myself a frenchman i beg your pardon dear philip replied celia laughing but you have never been in england have you neveri wish i had what is the pretender like philip well madam the jacobites say he would be only and wholly like his father if he were not so very like his mother while you whigs are of opinion that he resembles some washerwoman at egham or bricklayer at rotherhithedont remember which and doesnt matter but what or whom do you think him like not very like his mother in my judgment which is very unbiased except in his height and the shape of his hands and mouth still i should not call him unlike her of his likeness to his father i can say nothing for i dont remember king james who died when i was only eight years old the son is a very tall manthere is over six feet of him i should saywith a long face nearly ovaldark eyes rather fineand a pleasant goodnatured sort of mouth is he a pleasant man to speak to does he talk much to the first questionyes he is by no means without brains and is very gracious to strangers to the secondno very little if you are looking for me thrse in your wanderings up and down here i am at her ladyships service it is not her ladyship sir dat want you dupont tell me to say you dat monsieur colville is in your rooms colville that is jolly and mr philip ingram took his immediate departure celia guessed that mr colville was the solitary friend of whom he had before spoken now patient i want to hear about the dragonnades oh surely you are not making up all those dresses for me yes madam answered patient in her passive way my lady has ordered it well sighed celia i wonder when i am to wear them patient gathered up one of the multifarious dressesa blue gauze oneand followed her mistress into the boudoir you have never seen king louis madam never i should like to have a glimpse of him some day i never have and i hope i never shall do you think so badly of him patient they call him the great methinks they might fitly give the same title to the devil he is a man with neither heart nor conscience god forbid that i should judge any man yet tis written by their fruits ye shall know them and the fruits of this king are truly dreadful it doth look as if the lord had given him over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient privately he is a man of very evil life and publiclyyou will hear shortly madam what he is tis now methinks nigh upon twenty years since what they called the edict of nantes was done away with that decree passed by some former king of this country did permit all the protestants to hold their own worship and to be visited in sickness by their chosen ministers this being too gentle for this king he therefore swept away his dragoons were sent into every place throughout france with orders to force the the poor protestants to go unto the wicked mass and to harry them in all manner of ways saving only to avoid danger of their lives one sabbath thereto appointed they drave all in every place to mass at the point of their swords goading and pricking on such as lagged or showed illwill thereto i saw one crowd so driven from a windowfor my lady being a papist kept safe them in her house or else it was that i was not counted worthy of the lord to have that great honor of suffering for his sake poor souls whiteheaded men there were and tender women and little innocent frightened children it was a sight to move any human heart i heard many a tale of worse things they did breaking into the houses destroying and burning the household furniture binding and beating the men yea even the women drumming with hellish noise in the chambers of the sick until they swooned away or were like to die burning the houses of some and the workshops of others all this we heard and more patient how dreadful said celia why tis near what they did in the days of queen mary they only went a little further then on the same roadthat was all methinks answered patient calmly when the lord readeth in the books before men and angels the stories of the persecutions in england and in scotland he will scarce forget the dragonnades of france i did not know that there had been any persecution in scotland patientexcept what king charles did i suppose that was a sort of persecution did you not madam asked patient quietly turning down a hem i was not thinking of king charles but of the earlier days when tender women like helen stirk and margaret wilson perished in the waters and when the bloody cardinal brent master george wishart that true servant of god and the evangel in his devilsfire at st andrews i never heard of all those people patient ay perchance so madam i dare say their names and their sufferings scarce went beyond their own land replied patient in a constrained voice as if her heart were a little stirred at last but the lord heard of them and scotland heard of them and rose and bared her arm and drave forth the men of blood from off her soil the lord is their avenger at times in this lifebeyond this life always tell me something more about them patient who was master wishart he was a scottish gentleman of good birth a wishart of pitarrow madam who giving himself up unto the service of god and the evangel in dundee and other towns and bringing the blessed word and the blessed hope unto many a poor hungered soul was seized by the bloody cardinal beaton and brent to death as the reward of his labors in the year of our lord they that did know him at that time and master john knox afterward did say unto divers persons as i have heard that even master john was not fit to stand up with george wishart he was a true man and one that spake so good and sweet words as did move the hearts of such as heard him i think the lord knew how to ease him after his sore pain and that now that he hath had rest in heaven for one hundred and seventy years he accounts not that he bare too much for the lords sake that one bitter hour at st andrews and who was helenwhat did you say her name wasand margaret wilson helen stirk madam was a wife that was permitted to die along with her guidman for the name of the lord which she counted a grand mercy i can tell you a little more concerning margaret wilson for she died no so long since and my fathers sisters son duncan mintyre saw her die it was at wigtown on the th of may in the year that king james became king duncan had business in the town where some of his kith on his fathers side dwelt and hearing that two women were to be put to death he like a harebrained callant as he was was set on seeing it i heard not much about margaret maclauchlan who suffered at the same time save that she was the widow of one john millikan a wright of drumjargan and a woman notable for her piety and discretion but that of maggie wilson took much effect upon mine heart seeing that she was a young maid of just eighteen years mine own age she and agnes her sister as duncan told us were children of one gilbert wilson of glenvernoch who with his wife were prelatists maggie and agnes who were not able to conform unto the ill prelatical ways wherein their father and mother were entangled had joined many meetings of the covenanters on the hillsides or in the glens for preaching or prayer how old was agnes was she a married woman no madam she was younger than maggiea maid of thirteen years but patient i never heard of such a thingtwo girls thirteen and eighteen setting themselves up to judge their parents religion and choosing a different one for themselves said celia in astonishment for she could not help thinking of the strong expletives which would have burst from squire passmore if she and lucy had calmly declared themselves presbyterians and declined to accompany that gentleman to church as usual madam their father and mother were prelatists said patient evidently of opinion that this settled the question they could not go with them to church and read the massbook oh you mean they were papists no madamprelatists repeated patient a little perversely not that i see much disagreement indeed for methinks a prelatist is but a papist with a difference yet i do trust there be prelatists that will be saved and i can scarce think that of papists i dont understand you patient i suppose these prelatists are some sect that i have not heard anything about said celia with much simplicity for she never supposed that patients stern condemnation was levelled against her own church and would have been sorely grieved and bewildered had she known it go on if you please patient did not explain and proceeded with her history when the late king james became king on the death of his brother he put forth a proclamation granting liberty of conscience unto all sects whatsoever for a time the puritans rejoiced in this mercy thinking it a favor unto them but later they became aware that twas but a deceit to extend ease unto the papists maggie and agnes wilson the which were in hiding did shortly after this proclamation venture into the town being wishful to speak with their kinsfolk they never reached their kith being betrayed by one patrick stewart who came upon them with a band of men and lodged them in the thieves hole thence they were shifted to another chamber wherein margaret maclauchlan already abode thomas wilson their brother did strive to set them free thereby but harming himself and they were had up afore the sheriff and the provost and some others the indictment of them was for attending fieldconventicles and for joining in the rebellion at bothwell bridge and airsmossthey poor feeble souls never having been near the same places the jury brought the charge in proven and the three women were doomed to be justified by water they were to be tied to stakes below the mark of the tide in the water of blednoch near wigtown until they should be dead the tide sweeping over them in its flow howbeit the lord restrained them of having their will upon the young maid agnes maybe they were nigh shamed to justify such a bairn however they tarried in her case but on the day appointed which as i said was may th one named windram being in command over a band of soldiers did hale margaret maclauchlan and margaret wilson to the place of execution the first stake whereto margaret maclauchlan was tied was fixed much deeper in the bed of the river than the other they hoping that maggie wilson should be feared at her death being the sooner and so brought to recant moreover one of the town officers did with his halbert press and push down the poor old wife who having the lesser suffering of the two was soon with the lord as she strave in the bitterness of death quoth one to maggie wilson what think ye of that nay quoth she what do i see but christ in one of his members struggling there then maggie bring tied unto the nearer stake after singing of a psalm did read a chapter of the word and prayed so that all might hear and while she was apraying the water overflowed her and to see the devilish cruelty of these men they left her till she was nigh dead and then lifting her out of the water did use all care and means to recover her as if they meant mercy but it was but that she might die over again they murdered her twice overpoor poor maid for she was past feeling when they got her out then when she could speak this windram did ask her if she would pray for the king much cause they had given her she then answered that she wished the salvation of all men and the damnation of none then a maid which stood by duncan and had sobbed and wept aforetime which he thought must be of kin or friendly unto her did cry most dolefully dear margaret oh say god save the king say god save the king god save him if he will quoth she for i desire his salvation windram now drawing near commanded her to take the oath unto the king abjuring of the solemn league and covenant i will not quoth she i am one of christs children no sooner had she thus spoken than one of the towns officers with his halbert thrust her back into the water crying tak anither drink my hearty so she died patient said celia in a low constrained voice did god let those men go scathless not so madam the towns officer that thrust her back was ever after that tormented with a thirst the which no draught could slake and for many generations the children of the other which kept down the old wife with his halbert were all born with misshapen hands and feet patient said celia again in the same low reverent tone i wonder that he suffers such things to be i marvelled at that madam years agone it seemed very strange unto me that he suffered us to be haled down to the beach at the harrying of lauchie and that the storm should come on us and cut off so many lives of his servants it exercised me very sore and how did you settle it patient i do not know that i should have settled it madam had i not met with an ancient gentleman a minister that used at one time to visit mr francis in paris here he was a reverend man by the name of colville one of mine own country that had fled out of scotland of old time and had been dwelling for many years in switzerland and germany was he akin to this mr colville who is philips friend this young gentleman is his grandson madam and little good he doth mr philip i fear if he were a wee bit more like his grandsire i would be fain howbeit grace goeth not by inheritance as i know he was a very kindly gentleman madam this old minister and when he had sat a while ben with mr francis and miss magdalene he oft would say now let me go but and speak unto the leslies and one dayah that daywhen roswith was very ill i asked of him the thing which did exercise me and he said unto me gently and kindly holding mine hand in his quavering hand for he was a very ancient gentlemandear child quoth he dost thou know so little thy father thou mindest me of my little son saith he when the fire brake out in mine house when i hasted up into his chamber which was above the chamber afire and tare the blankets from his bed and haled him thence somewhat roughly the bairn greet and asked of me what made me so angry well i could not choose but smile to think of the babes blunder and he saith i see thou canst understand that why dear child quoth he thou art about just the same blunder as my bairn thy father sendeth a messenger in haste to fetch thy soul home to him and lo father sayest thou why art thou so angry we are all little children quoth he and are apt to think our father is angry when he is but short with us because of danger and dost thou think lassie he said that they which saw the face of god first thing after that storm rebuked him because he had fetched them thither by water so then i saw mine error did this old gentleman teach you a great deal patient i keep wondering whence you have all the things you say to me i dont think such things as you do and even cicely aggett who is some twenty years older than you does not seem to know half so much about god as you do where do you get your thoughts and your knowledge where the lord doth mostly teach his children madamby the rivers of babylon where i sat down and wept i think he that beareth the precious seed commonly goeth forth weeping for we cannot enter into the troubles and perplexities of others which have known none ourselves and if it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest who are we that we should grudge to be made like unto our brethren likewise that is a deep word madamthough he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered i have not got half down to the bottom of it yet but for the matter of that i am but just hoeing at the top of all scripture and scarce delving any depth well patient said celia with a perplexed melancholy air if you think you are but hoeing on the surface what am i doing my dear bairni ask your pardon madam corrected patient dont ask it patient replied celia softly i like thatit sounds as if somebody loved me eh lassie said patient suddenly losing all her conventionality and much of her english did ye no think i loved miss magdalenes bairn i was the first that ever fed you that ever dressed you that ever bare you about i was just fon on you when you were a bit baby patients voice became suddenly tremulous and ceased celia rose from her chair and kneeling down by patients side threw her arms round her neck and kissed her patient held her tight for a moment the lord bless you my ain lassie she faltered you are just that miss magdalene oer againher ain brown eyes and her smile and her soft bit mou the lord bless you celia resumed her seat and patient her calm respectful tone but the former understood the latter a great deal better after that episode and never forgot what a wealth of love lay hidden under that quiet manner and somewhat stiff address well patient what were you going to say to me i scarce think madam that you have had much dwelling by the waters of babylon as yet i dont mean that you have had no sorrow at all i misdoubt if any man or maid ever grew up to your age without knowing what sorrow was but there are griefs and griefs and tis one thing to visit a town and another to abide there david knew what it was my tears have been my meat day and night quoth he and though in the main i conceive that and many another word in davids psalms to point unto him that was greater than david yet i dare say twas no pleasant dwelling in the cave with all them that were bitter of soul neither fleeing on the mountains afore king saul nor yet abiding in gath he felt them all sore crosses i little doubt do you think that is what our lord means patient where he says take up the cross and follow me i think he means whatsoever is undelightful to flesh and blood that cometh in the way of following him is the gate strait yet follow me is the way narrow yet follow me art thou faint and cold and anhungered and aweary yet follow me my grace is sufficient for thee my footsteps are plain before thee my eye is ever over thee follow me but patient dont you think that sometimes the footsteps are not so very plain before us we cannot see them when we dont look for them madamthat is certain ah but when we dois it not sometimes very difficult to see them madam blind eyes cannot see we are all blind by nature and even they that are gods children i believe cannot sin but it dims their eyes even of them perchance more see men as trees walking than as having the full use of their spiritual eyes well it matters little how we see men if only we have eyes to see christ yet which of us after all ever really hath seen him but anent crosses madam i have a word to say if you please theres a wonderful manufactory of crosses ever aworking among all gods saints whatever else we are unskilful in we are uncommon skilled in making of rods for our own backs and very sharp rods they are mostly i had a deal sooner with david fall into the hand of the lord than into the hands of men but above all may the lord deliver me from falling into mine own there is a sharp saying madam which maybe you have heardhe that is his own lawyer hath a fool to his client i am sure he that ruleth his own way hath a fool to his governor yet every man among us would be his own god if he might what else are all our murmurings and disputings of the will of the lord but patient you dont call grieving murmuring you would not say that every cry of pain was a murmur surely when god uses his rod to us he means us to feel it certainly madam he means us to feel it else there were no use laying it on us there is a point doubtless where grieving doth become murmuring and where that is the lord knoweth better than we he makes no mistakes he will not account that murmuring which he that crieth doth not intend to be such i think he looks on our griefs not as they be to him nor perchance to others but as they are to us just as a kindly nurse or mother will comfort a little bairn greeting over a bit plaything that none save itself accounted the losing of worth naming we are very foolish i am afraid sometimes said celia thoughtfully foolish ay we are so returned patient setting our hearts like jonah on bit gourds that grow up in a night and are withered in a nightquarrelling with the lord when his wisdom denies us our own willmewling and grumbling like ill bairns as we be at a breath of wind that crosses ussaying all of us at our hearts i am and none else beside mewho is the lord that i should obey him the longer i live madam the more i am ever marvelling at the wonderful grace and patience and love of the lord that he should bear with such neerdoweels as we are even at our very best i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed patient was silent for a while and celia broke the silence patient what became of roswith i never hear you name her now but always as belonging to past time patient did not answer for a moment then she said her voice a little less calm than usual there is no time madam for her she will never grow old she will never suffer pain she will never weep any more the master has been and called for her she is dead said celia sympathizingly dead nay alive for evermore as he is because he liveth we shall live also she is in the beatific vision before the face of the father and shall never sin nor suffer nor depart any more and we here in this body of pain and sin call them dead o roswith o my soul my love my darling my wee bit bonnie bairn sister and daughter in one whom i loved as david jonathan as mine own soul surely i am the dead and thou art the living celia sat amazed at this sudden flow of passionate words from her usually imperturbable companion she had seen her moved only a short time before but not like this patient bent her head low over her work and did not look up for some minutes when she spoke it was to say very softly she never looked up rightly after the harrying of lauchie she lived but she never laughed rightly again the doctor deemed that the ship wreckthe shock and the cold and the hungerhad wrought the ill maybe they had but she never was a strong likely lassie she was ever gentle and quiet in all her ways and could no bear much putting upon and after that she just pined and wasted away it was after miss magdalene diedafter my lady that is now was weddedthat the end came it was one sabbath afternoon and i poor fool fancied her a wee bit better that day she was lying on the bed in our chamber and we had been cracking of divers thingsof our lord christ and his resurrection and that sweet prayer of his in john and the like her voice was very low and softbut it was ever that i thinkand her words came slowly and with pauses and when we ended our crack she saith patient sister sing to me i asked her what dear heart and she saith the twentythird psalm so i sang the lords my shepherd ill not want he makes me down to lie in pastures green he leadeth me the quiet waters by and now and then just for a line i heard her weak voice joining in i sang to the end and she sang the last lines and in gods house for evermore my dwellingplace shall be when i had done i thought the place felt so still as if the angels were there surely they were so for in a few minutes after i made an end of singing she arose and went to the father i have been alone with god since that night roswith died i shall go some day but it seems afar off now perchance it may be nearer than i deem the lord knoweth the time and he will not forget me there was a long silence when patients voice ceased celia spoke first patient you said once that you would tell me how my father met with my stepmother but i want to know also why no one ever sought me out until now there was no chance madam so long as you were a child the troubles in england were too great to allow of sir edward returning himself i believe he charged my lady on his deathbed to seek you out and wherefore she tarried i know not i had a mind once to go myself and i named it to her but was called a fool for my pains and bidden to sit quiet and sew but i was glad to see you thank you dear patient said celia affectionately and now tell me about the other do you know madam that my lady was a widow when she wedded sir edward no exclaimed celia i never heard of that but philiphe is really my brother is he not oh yes madam mr philip is your brother i will tell youafter my lady magdalene died sir edward was for a time sore sick and the doctors bade him visit and go about for the recovery of his health i am scarce certain that it was the best thing he could do howbeit he did as they bade him among the gentlemen whom he used to visit where he whiles took his son master edward and me as his nurse was the marquis of la croix and another was one mr camillus de lorient the marquis was a stately old french gentleman a kindly man to his own i think but one that held himself mortal high and seemed to think that laboring men and the like were no better if so good as his dogs and his horses the marchioness his wife was much of the same sort only im thinking she wasnt quite so stiff as he they had no sonand very grieved they were for itonly three daughters madam claudia madam sophia and madam amata the last young lady is dead she died a maid and to my thinking she was a hantle the best of the three madam sophia you saw the other evening she wedded the duke of montausier madam claudia is my lady i had never any great taking for frenchmen but to my thinking mr camillus de lorient was the best and pleasantest frenchman i ever saw there was something about him so douce and kindly to everybody and tis very seldom the case with the french nobles sir edward came one day into the nursery as he often did to play him with the bairn and said he patient next week i shall go to monsieur de la croixs chteau in the provinces and mademoiselle aime has begged for edward to come too so get him and yourself ready mademoiselle de la croix is to be married to monsieur de lorient well we went to the castle and surely there were fine doings madam claudia in white satin and all the fine ladies and gentlementhey were quite a picture to look at after the wedding and the revellings were over madam claudia and her husband went up to paris for a while and then to pay a visit to mr camillus father and mother who lived some way off sir edward meanwhile thought of going home too but monsieur and madam they begged of him to stay till mr camillus came back and madam amata who was mighty fond of children and took wonderfully to little master ned she begged him not to take the bairn away so the end of it was that he stopped ever so long and master ned and me we stopped too about two months after the wedding mr camillus and his new wife came back to the castle and the fine doings began again there was nought but feasting and junketing for a fortnight and one morning at the end of that time sir edward and mr camillus and one mr leroy and three or four gentlemen more that were staying at the castle they went out for a stroll in the park i know not rightly how it was but there arose some words among these gentlemen and they came to quarrelling sir edward held fast by mr camillus who was a great friend of his but mr leroy whose blood was up because of something that had been said at last struck mr camillus a blow everybody cried directly that he must fight him sir edward ran back to the castle for pistols for the gentlemen were not armed and he came in all haste into the chamber where i was sewing with little master at his hornbook and bade me tell madam claudia as gently as i could that there was to be a duel between mr camillus and mr leroy i went up into the chamber where the three young ladies were together and madam sophia was trying of a new gown i told as quiet as i could what had happened madam amata cried out and ran to her sister and clipped her round the neck she said claude ma soeur ma bonne ma belle go go to camille and ask him not to fight i looked at madam claudia she went as white as a sheet the first minute but the next she lifted her head up proudly and she said shall i ask him not to revenge an affront to his honor noblesse oblige ma soeur you are such a child aime was all madam sophia said as she looked round from her tiringglass you always call me so said madam amata but this is dreadfulit is death perhaps my sisters madam sophia took no heed of her but went on trying her new gown and showing her woman where it did not please her for a minute i thought that madam claudia was going to give way and have a good cry but she did not i scarce knew then that tis not our deepest sorrow that we weep for she sat down still very white and taking no heed to her sisters new array though she poor thoughtless maid kept calling to her didnt she like this and did she no think that was too long and tother too narrow madam amata came softly up to me and whispered ma bonne go down and bring us the first news so i slipped out and downstairs about half an hour after a gentleman came ina french gentleman but i forget his name nowwho i knew had been at the fighting i called to him and asked him to pardon me for being so bold as to speak to him but for the love of god to tell me the news news quoth he what of the duel oh they have fought and monsieur de lorient has fallen sir edward ingram is carrying him hereand mr somebody i dont mind who it was is he dead sir i said all of a tremble i really dont know says he quite careless i think not quite i hadnt the heart to speak another word to such a man i crept up again to the young ladies chamber and i knelt down by madam claudia and told her she must make ready for the worst she shivered all over and then scarce opening her white lips she said is it all over i said they think not quite but sir edward is bringing him hither when she heard that she rose and glided down the stairs to the hall madam amata following her and i likewise even madam sophia was a trifle touched i think for she said a bad word as those french ladies do when they are astonished but madam amata was very white and crying for if mr camillus had really been her brother born i dont think she could have loved him much better than she did just as madam claudia reached the hall sir edward came in and the other gentleman bearing poor mr camillus covered with blood there was a marble couch in the hall with silken cushions they laid him down there and he just spoke twice first he said to sir edward tell my mother gently and take care of my claude and then when madam claudia came and knelt by him he said dieu vous garde mamie then he laid his head back and died but when he died madam claudia threw her arms about him and laid her head down on his breast in spite of the blood and then suddenly springing to her feet she flung up her arms wildly in a way that sent a shudder through me and the next minute she would have fallen on the ground if sir edward had not caught her first let us carry her up patient to her own chamber poor soul he saith so we took her up i and he and i laid her quiet on her bed madam amata followed us and poor young maid it was pitiful to see her she had never been taught to do more than make fancywork and play the violin and such and now she wanted to nurse her sister and did not know how to set about it do tell me ma bonne what i can do for claudemy poor claude she kept saying to me twas a long while ere madam claudia came round and when she did she wept and mourned every minute of the day for four days i dont think she ever quite loved anything again as she had loved him celia could hardly associate the idea of such mourning as this with her cold fashionable impassive stepmother you think it scarce like madam asked patience seeing her thought in her face i know what you thinkay and more than you have thought that if you will forgive me to say it you deem her cold and hard so she is ah madam wherever sorrow softens and sanctifies not it chills and hardens i am sure if i had known her but now i could never have thought her that bright lassie whom i saw in her early maidenhood you see madam the lord sends sorrow to us all but where he has to touch one of his chosen with it he brings it himself and there is a vast difference between the two there be to whom the having been with grief is the having been with jesus and that always softens and tenders the heart i think we hardly come to know the lords best comforts till we come to know how sorely he can afflict whiles but grief without jesusah that is worth calling grief there is little more to tell now madam for you know the endthat sir edward wedded madam claudia i will confess i did think they might have waited a trifle longer if it were only to the end of the year after mr camillus death he had scarce been dead six months and my lady magdalene not the year out when they were married howbeit that was their business not mine madam sophia said in her odd way that if her sister did not care she saw no reason why she should but the tears stood in madam amatas eyes though she said nought i liked madam amata very much she died about two years thereafter patient whom do you think philip likehis father or his mother neither much madam sir edward is like his father only that he hath his mothers mouth do you know when he will be back patient i do so long to see my own brother no madam he went off rather unexpected now madam celia if you please to try this gown why patient what have you done to that blue gauze inquired lady ingram entering so noiselessly that neither knew of her presence until she spoke it is cut absurdly short in front turn round my dear mais cest affreux pull the rag off i beg of you is that thrses cutting or yours patient thrses madam incroyable i shall scold her right well for it it is atrocious cest une chose dchirer de coeur celia looked up into lady ingrams eyes saw how calm and careless they were and wondered if there were left in her anything of that early claude de la croix whose sad story she had been hearing matt xxii sam xxiii cor iii john viii john ii heb x matt vii rom i october by henri iv of france april it is said that thomas wilson endeavored to relieve his

muloch we have been absent for a long time from ashcliffe hall in fact nothing has occurred there since celias departure of sufficient moment to be recorded but on easter tuesday of harry returned home for a short time he brought plenty of town news political and otherwise twelve new tory peers were created on new years day the squire swore at this piece of information and the duke of marlborough has fallen in disgrace so we heard lad so we heard said his father discontentedly somebody ought to be ashamed of himself and prince eugene is come to england on a visit to her majesty tis thought to plead for the duke o harry have you seen prince eugene yes lucy several times do you wish to know what he is like well fancy a small but wellmade man with a dark complexion a large roman nose black eyes lively and piercing and black hair do you think the queen will listen to his pleading for the duke i doubt it tis scarce so much with the duke as with the duchess that she is herself displeased and prince eugene has already offended her by coming to court in a bagwig instead of the peruque she said to her ladies that next time she supposed he would come in his nightcap prince eugene you see is a soldier accustomed to think very little of matters of this kind and in all points of etiquette the queen is mighty particular and what other news is there harry well sir the secretary for war a young man named robert walpole has been sent to the tower for bribery why on earth have they sent him there for that asked the squire sarcastically does not every one of the ministers sell all his secretaryships didnt he buy his place to begin with doubtless sir answered harry and every year the duchess of marlborough whose perquisite they are either gives or sells the queens old gowns but when the blame must be laid on some one tis easy to find a man to bear it any other piece of roguery asked his father no sir i remember none said harry just before i left london the queen was touching for the evil tis a solemn ceremony i am told though i was not able to see it tis stale news i fear that there hate been prosecutions of newspaper writers for attacks on the ministry no harry i had not heard of that said the squire quickly likely enough a set of beggarly printers daring to bring out lampoons on gentlemen in the queens service served em right there have been a good many of the lampoons i believe is it only the whig ministers who suffered from these rascally newspapers asked his father both sides sir answered harry well i am glad the tories got a bit of it chuckled squire passmore there are gentlemen on the other side sir i think hinted harry quietly nothing but rogues on the other side my lad said his father why how could they be on the other side if they werent rogues why father said lucy who could take more liberties with that gentleman than any one else and knew it you dont think everybody wrong who isnt on the same side as you there can be only one right side said the squire as evasively as oracularly i am on it because tis right well my politics said charley yawning are that tis right because im on it a piece of exalted egotism which provoked universal laughter i met in london with a rather pleasant fellow remarked harry who told me he had been at ashcliffe and had the honor quoth he of dining with you a man of the name of stevens ob aye a painter said the squire well he had been in a painters employ returned his son but is now in a newspaper office he is employed on the gazette what made him change his trade in that way he told me that the painter who had employed him had been but a temporary patron and having now done with him he had been unable to get further employment in that line and having some parts in the way of writing he had offered his services to one or two of the whig papers and is now in the gazettes office he is a sensible fellow said his father a right whig i could see and a thorough conscientious man could any person have lifted up the veil and revealed to him the history and identity of one george shepherd he would have felt both amazed and humbled at the moment that this conversation was going on at ashcliffe the thoroughly conscientious man of whom they were speaking was seated in the backparlor of a newspaper office in london he had two companions a man in a fair wig and another in a black one the wearer of the black wig a largelimbed longfaced solemnlooking man had just folded up some letters after perusal well mr mist what say you asked he laying down the letters if you prefer to sever our connection rather than engage to do as i wish of course you are at liberty to do so but unless you will keep measures with me and be punctual in these things i cannot serve you further nor be concerned any more i really beg you not to name such a thing mr de foe replied mist bowing and nervously twisting a piece of paper i am your very humble servant in these mattersall of them and i engage readily to conduct the journalwill you repeat your terms mr de foe the government mr mist have treated you with lenity and forbearance resumed de foe oracularly they permit you to seem on the same side as before to rally the flying post as much as you please and all the whig writers and even the word whig and to admit any foolish trifling things in favor of the tories such as really can do them no good nor the government any harm well mr de foe said mr mist with a sigh that is liberty enough i am resolved that my paper shall for the future amuse the tories but not affront the government that mr mist announced his dictator is the only way to keep yourself from a jail and to secure the advantages which now rise to you from it for you may be assured the complaint against you is so general that the government can bear it no longer would you mind telling me from whom you speak sir mr mist meekly wished to know i should mind it very much mr mist be satisfied that you have been spoken toay and warned mr mist was fully convinced of that you will write mr mist a declaration full enough to satisfy the government of your intention to make no further attack upon them mr mist would do anything he was told the poor little mouse was entirely at the mercy of the lion he withdrew to pen his declaration and left the archconspirators together you see mr stevens what difficulties we government spies have to contend with sighed the author of robinson crusoe but you know that of course as well as i do bowing in the house of rimmon responded stevens with a peculiar smile i fancy the spies on the other side have their difficulties also in which observation though de foe was completely unaware of it mr stevens was alluding to himself bowing in the house of rimmon repeated de foe i thank you mr stevens for so apt a comparison you see sir i am for this service posted among papists jacobites and high toriesa generation which my very soul abhors i am obliged to hear traitorous expressions and outrageous words against her majestys person and government and her most faithful servants and to smile at it all as if i approved of it you are scarce the first person mr de foe who has been constrained to smile at what he disapproves well his lordships instructions are positive you have them i think from himself asked stevens deferentially through mr buckley i introduced myself to mr mist in the disguise of a translator of foreign news with his lordships approbation who commissioned me in this manner to be so far concerned in this weekly paper of mists as to be able to keep it within the circle of a secret management and also prevent the mischievous part of it but neither mist nor any of those concerned with him have the least guess by whose direction i do it you mr stevens are one of ourselves so i speak freely to you quite so answered stevens dryly some time ago resumed de foe i was concerned in the same manner with dyers newsletter old dyer was just dead and dormer his successor being unable by his troubles to carry on that work i had an offer of a share both in the property and management well i immediately sent to the minister who by mr buckley let me know twould be a very acceptable piece of service for that letter was really very prejudicial to the public and the most difficult to come at in a judicial way in case of offence given upon this i took upon myself and do still take the entire management of the paper so that the style still continues tory that the party may be amused and not set up another which would destroy the design of course your object was not wholly political smilingly suggested stevens you mean there was a matter of money betwixt us of course there wasmoney or moneys worth we have it on good authority that the laborer is worthy of his hire answered stevens still smiling ah mr de foe tis in truth such as you and i that rule kingdomsnot kings nor ministers when stevens left the office of mists journal which was in truth mists private habitation he sauntered slowly for a while along the busy streets turned into a whig coffeehouse which he frequented every tuesday morning and called for a dish of coffee and the postboy wandering on turned into another tory coffeehouse which he frequented every tuesday afternoon and called for a glass of usquebagh and the st jamess chronicle having made his weekly impression on the society of the two coffeehouses he sauntered on again until he reached grays inn road here his proceedings suddenly changed he walked up the road with the air and pace of a man who had no time to spare and entering a whitesmiths shop inquired in a rather loud tone whether butler the whitesmith could attend to a little matter of business mrs butler who was in the shop having informed him that her husband was at leisure to undertake anything required stevens sinking his voice to a low whisper asked further is the old horse in the old stall he is sir answered mrs butler in the same tone adding in a louder one pray go upstairs sir and speak with butler yourself stevens found his way without difficulty up a dark and rickety staircase in the corner with the intricacies of which he appeared well acquainted and pausing at a door on the right hand at the head of the stairs placed his lips to the keyhole and gave a low soft whistle the door opened with a spring and mr stevens was admitted to the chamber within in the room in question two men were sitting at a green baize table covered with books and papers the younger was about the age of stevens himself and he looked up with a nod and smile of recognition to the newcomer the elder a baldheaded man with a fringe of white hair did not stir from his close examination of the papers on the table until stevens stood before him your blessing father requested the young priest the old man looked up abruptly peace be with thee brother cuthbert said he in a harsh brusque tone and he went back immediately to his papers the younger man pointed to a seat at his side which stevens took but neither ventured to interrupt the studies of the old priest until he at last laid down his papers and took off his spectacles well brother what news said he looking up at stevens in answer to this query stevens gave him a condensed account of the information which he had just received from de foe that is awkward father is it not asked the younger of the strangers not at all my son said the old jesuit placidly wiping his spectacles the protestants are welcome to work against us as much as they please they cannot combine they have no organism hence their wiles are mere shadows compared with ours they are sure to fade and fail sooner or later however we are not above learning even from enemies it might be as well to have a friend so employed on some few whig papers could you manage that he asked suddenly turning to the young stranger the person addressed smiled but shook his head rather hopelessly i do not think i could father boniface said he no assented the old man your talents do not lie in that direction brother cuthbert here is employment for youyours do my talents commonly lie in any direction to which i find it convenient to turn them father said stevens with as modest an air as if he were disclaiming praise instead of bestowing it upon himself and as i hold a general dispensation for anything that may be needful i have no scruples in using it the old man having finished a very careful cleansing of his glasses put them on and inspected stevens through them brother cuthbert said he had you been suffered to sink into the abyss of heresy as at one time seemed likely it would have been a great loss to the church well i rather think it would was the cool reply of mr cuthbert stevens it was a blessed act of our brother arnold resumed father boniface an inspired thought which led him to steal you away an infant untainted by heresy from the cradle wherein your heretic mother had laid you while she went to watch the dancing on the villagegreen that was brother cuthberts introduction to the church jerome observed he turning to his companion our brother arnoldhe is among the blessed now i trust for i have myself offered hundreds of masses for the repose of his soulhe found in a village in france an infant in a cradle by a cottagedoor with none to watch over it impelled by philanthropy he inquired how this was from the nextdoor neighbor and was told that a huguenot carpenter lived in the cottage he was out at work and his wife had gone to see the dancers this must not be said arnold i will myself carry the infant to his mother and reprove her for such foolish conduct i should have told you that the village being full of these misguided heretics arnold in his zeal to recover some of these straying sheep to the true fold had attired himself as a heretic teacher you will do well master pastor said the neighbor for though she is kindly and wellmeaning tis her worst fault to love gadding about and she is very young and needs teaching so arnold took the babe and instead of going to the green piously brought it to us at the monastery thou wert a sad trouble for a long time brother cuthbert for the brethren were not wont to deal with such tender young creatures and thou wouldst eat nothing presented to thee and didst wail and howl ceaselessly and the old priest shook his head sorrowfully as if he remembered too well the trouble which the huguenot baby had brought upon the brotherhood stevens laughed and so did jerome but the latter seemed to enjoy the novel idea more of the two do you know the name of the village father it might be a good act to endeavor to win over some of these huguenots we thought it better brother cuthbert that you should not know the name of your birthplace ties of kindred are strong at times and as i have often observed to you when a man becomes a priest he ceases to have any kindred ties the church is your mother her monks are your brethren her nuns your sisters be satisfied stevens was far too much accustomed to instant and implicit submission to offer the slightest remonstrance to this slight mandate but this was the first time that he had ever received a detailed account of his origin he knew that he had been brought to the monastery as an infant but hitherto he had known nothing more and had naturally supposed himself to be a foundling in this idea he had grown up he had never loved any human being nor so far as he knew had any human being ever loved him but that afternoon a vision rose before him of the poor huguenot mother coming back from her thoughtless expedition to find her darling gone he wished he could have found her he would have tried to convert her to romanism if he had done so for he honestly believed his church the true one but she might perhaps have loved him and nobody ever had done so hitherto in these papers brother cuthbert resumed the old jesuit you will find instructions in cipher i need not charge you to keep them carefully stevens put them safely away in a private pocket and i will detain you no longer stevens had reached the door when he turned back father boniface if you think it not an improper request would you tell me in what part of france i was found father boniface looked into his young friends face and thought it a very improper request but he had his own reasons for not bluntly refusing an answer in auvergne my son he said shortly ask no more cuthbert stevens passed out of the whitesmiths shop without stopping for his customary five minutes chat with mrs butler ah poor gentleman said she to herself hes had a bit of bad news he had had something like it he walked very rapidly up grays inn road knowing little and caring less whither he was going till he found himself in the fields beyond clerkenwell there he threw himself on the grass and resting his head upon his hands gave himself up for one hour to mournful and profitless visions of that auvergne home and of the unknown father and mother who might have loved him once and i shall never see them he thought so near the waldensian valleyswhat a stronghold of heresy they must be ah well i can say every day a mass with an intention for my parents who knows if god may be merciful to them after all the soul is worth more than the body and eternal happiness is worth more than any amount of ease or felicity in this world from what a fate therefore have i been rescued i ought to be very thankful but gratitude and love are the last things into which a man can scold himself and stevens did not feel so thankful as he thought he ought to be he might have been more so had he known that father boniface had not troubled himself to tell him the exact truth it was from the outermost village of the val martino in the waldensian valleys not from auvergne that he had been stolen away and in that val martino though he was never to know it every night knelt lucetta carmagnoli mourning before godless for the martyred husband or for the two brave young sons slain in battle than for the lost firstborn whose fate she could guess only too well wavering from hour to hour between the passion of hopeoh that ishmael might live before theeand the passion of despairwould god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son such prayers and tears seem lost sometimes but are they not in thy book what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter it is not only simon the son of jonas who is asked now in the tempest now in the still small voice lovest thou me more than these stevens rose from his green couch and walked back to london his heart had been dormant all his life till now and it went easily to sleep again his conscience the jesuits had crushed and twisted and trained so early that it never troubled him with a single pang by the time that he had reached fleet street and had solaced his inner man with a second dish of coffee and something in it at the tory coffeehouse mr cuthbert stevens was himself again and if he did look back on the hour spent in the fields at clerkenwell it was only to reflect with momentary annoyance that as he would have phrased it he had made a fool of himself and it was very rarely indeed that he thought that substantive applicable in the slightest degree to the rev cuthbert stevens well there is one comfort he meditated as he sat imbibing the mixture nobody saw me do it and fortified by this consideration and the coffee c mr stevens walked into the residence of the editor of the postboy and expressed his desire for an interview with that rather awful individual there was a smile on his lips when he came out he was engaged at a high salary to supply foreign news to the columns of the whig paper mr buckley the ministerial agent had spoken very highly of mr stevens to the editor mr stevens was rejoiced to hear it and he told the truth for once when he said so the editor thought mr stevens set a rather high value on his services mr stevens could assure him that he had received innumerable applications from the tory side and it was only his deep attachment to the whig cause and his respect for the postboy in particular which had led him by asking so little rather to underrate the importance of the information he could supply the importance indeed of the information which stevens could have supplied would not have been overrated at double the figure but of this little fact the editor of the postboy was unconscious here we part with the rev cuthbert stevens the rest of his life was a mere repetition with variations of what we have seen the whigs continued to take him for a whig spy the tories for a tory while he himself cared in reality for neither and was devoted but to one thing and ready to be either neither or both in the service and at the command of that church which supplied to him the place of home and parents and friends and god and at the close of such a life followed the priest and the crucifix and the unction and the false hope which shall perish and the death that has no bands ere this rome has employed and destroyed many a cuthbert stevens what do the crushed devotees matter to the idol let the car of juggernaut roll on thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double perhaps the greatest of lucetta carmagnolis mercies was what she thought the bitterest of her sorrowsthat she never knew what became of her lost child it is time for us to return to france on one of these spring afternoons of celia stood looking out of her bedroom window they were in lady ingrams countryhouse at st germainenlaye she was very curious and yet almost afraid to see the palacethat house in which as she knew he dwelt whom squire passmore called the pretender and lady ingram the king celia herself had owned to no politics at all she found it quite work enough to steer between her religious scyllas and charybdises without setting up political ones in all things not absolutely wrong she was resolved meekly to submit to lady ingram so that her stepmother might have no just cause for dissatisfaction with her in respect to those few points which to her were really matters of conscience when patient came quietly in with an armful of the linen which she was unpacking and putting away celia said patient do you know where the chteau is the pretender dwells over yonder madam answered patient pointing in the direction which she wished to indicate so you call him the pretender observed celia smilingly i was taught madam when a wean that the people should have nought to do with an uncovenanted king moreover the reign of his highness the lord protector being so much better for the faith hath perhaps turned me a little against this one and all his celia laughed softly to herself what would squire passmore have said from whose lips the gentleman so respectfully designated by patient was at the gentlest that scoundrel oliver she began to wonder how many more phases of political feeling she should find i ask your pardon if i have grieved you madam said patient when celia remained silent i would not willingly do that sir edward i know was strong for king james and would doubtless have been so for his son and tis most like you will feel with your father only we were taught otherwise when king james was driven out of london i heard that the sabbath after in scotland a certain godly minister did discourse from that wordand death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts i think that was rather too strong patient said celia doubtfully perchance so madam indeed i know there be some that do think king charles the first safein heaven i mean god grant it i only know that he was a deceitful man and an uncovenanted king i have always heard him called a martyr patient he was not that said patient less calmly than usual at least not if a martyr be a witness for the lords truth did he not try to force prelacy upon scotland call such a man a martyr a martyr to prelacy forsooth a martyr to deceit and broken faith and cruel oppression we were the martyrs madam and patient shut a drawer wrathfully for her i dont know much about it patient said celia honestly i have been taught to believe that king charles was a good and misfortunate man but now i can hardly tell what to believe among you all mysquire passmore thinks that king charles was a good man and a martyr yet calls this man the pretender and will scarce hear him named with patience my stepmother thinks them both good and you think them both bad i cannot tell what to think celia came from the window as lady ingram entered the room patient she said lay out mrs celias new courtdress on the bedyou know which it is my dear this afternoon i will lead you to kiss the queens hand your manners are slightly improved and i wish you to show respect to the court very well madam resignedly answered celia you will enter behind me stop and go forward when i do when i draw aside come forward kneel and kiss the queens hand when she offers it should she speak to you remain kneeling while you answer unless she command you to rise if she do not speak rise draw to one side as i shall have done and stand there yes madam do not look about you keep your eyes on the queen dont look awkward be selfpossessed i will do my best madam lady ingram tapped celias cheek with her fan a sign that she was unusually gracious be ready in an hour she said and departed thrse came next to dress celias hair patient in solemn and evidently disapproving silence helped her to dress she found herself when the process was over in a quilted pink satin petticoat a bodice and train of white satin trimmed with gold braid white satin shoes long white gloves pearl necklace and bracelets her hair was dressed very high and adorned with pink roses and pearls as celia looked at herself in the glass she felt much inclined to sing with the celebrated little old woman sure this is none of i but much time was not allowed her for the indulgence of that feeling your servant madam observed philips voice in the corridor accompanied by a tap at the door dont keep us waiting pleasewe shall be very cross if you do i protest arent you smart mr philip himself was scarcely less so he wore a light blue coat embroidered in gold a white satin waistcoat and breeches white silk stockings and white satin shoes with large rosettes in the drawingroom stood lady ingram attired in white and gold turn round was her greeting to celia and philip nonsense not you as philip made a pirouette in answer that will do now follow me and whatever you feel dont look awkward or afraid celia meekly followed her stepmother to the carriage which rolled away with the trio and in a few minutes deposited them at one of the halfdozen doors of a large and stately mansion on the terrace before them ladies and gentlemen were walking and chatting most of them in rather shabby though full courtdress lady ingram bowed to two or three gave her hand to her son and once more enjoining celia to keep close behind passed on into the palace this is english ground madam observed philip over his shoulder celia wished it were up lofty staircases through suites of rooms past groups of servants in the royal livery of england worn and faded she followed lady ingram and philip until in one apartment a lady dressed in black rose to meet them and shook hands with lady ingram you can go in to the queen my friend she said there is only his majesty with her there were only two persons in the room beyond a gentleman stood at the window reading the gazette a lady in mourning sat writing at a very shabby little table in the middle of the room a glance at each assured celia that they were mother and son and she speedily discovered who they were by lady ingrams kneeling before the quietlooking lady in mourning who sat at the shabby little table ah ma chre said the lady in a soft voice turning to her adding i am very glad to see you it is long since i had the pleasure lady ingram answered in french and still kneeling i have been in paris madame and in england for a short time i had the honor to inform your majesty that i was going there to fetch my stepdaughter this is your daughter asked the queen turning with a smile to celia lady ingram drew aside to leave room for her she scarcely speaks french yet she observed as celia knelt and looked up into the face before her she was much struck with that smile it changed the aspect of the whole face the air of subdued sadness which had dwelt upon the classic regular features and in the quiet soft eyes passed away and a brighter expression lighted them brilliantly while the smile remained she could fancy what that face might have been in the old days when at the close of the coronation nearly thirty years before the westminster students had called up that smile by their spontaneous shout of vivat regina maria celia forgot all about kissing the queens hand until she heard lady ingrams voice beside her whisper in a subdued tone cette folle then she blushed painfully and hastily performed her homage the charm which enfolded the jacobites had been cast around her the spell of voice and eyes and smile which she would never forget any more why so hurried my child asked the soft voice in celias own tongue do not be frightened of me i pray you frightened of her no indeed thought celia as she rose from her knees with a smile in answer to the queens what fright she felt was not for her majesty but for lady ingram as she regained her feet she suddenly saw that the queens son was standing beside his mother the formidable mortal whom squire passmore would have knocked down as his first greeting and patient have sermonized as an uncovenanted king hardly knowing what she did celia knelt again and kissed the hand that was extended to her it was a soft white hand which did not look as if it would hold the sceptre very harshly and on one finger glittered a large gold ring set with a balas ruby upon which a cross was engraved celia would have regarded that jewel with deep interest and veneration had she known its romantic history stranger than any romance this was the last relic of jamess fallen fortunes the ancient coronationring the weddingring of england which had gleamed from many a royal hand before and had been employed to many a strange end while philip in his turn performed his homage celia studied the royal persons before her first the king he was tall very talla man whom few would pass without wondering who he was rather thin but with all this not ungraceful and with an air of much distinction about him an oval face he had with a bright complexion a forehead smooth and high but not at all broad arched eyebrows eyes of a dark rich brown large and very soft a mouth rather too large for strict proportion but bearing an expression of mingled sadness and sweetness which grew into fascination when he smiled his smiles were rare and his voice seldom heard but very often celia caught a momentary upward glance of the eyes accompanied by a silent motion of the lips and she wondered if it were possible that he was praying he wore no wig only his own dark chestnut hair curling over his shoulders this was the king whom england had cast out she would have none of him under any pretext rather than be ruled by this son of her own she had set a stranger over her which was not her brother celia wondered for the first time in her life whether england had done well she turned with a sigh from the son to the mother who was conversing familiarly with lady ingram seated beside her the queen maria beatrice or mary as the english called her celia thought a most fascinating woman she resembled her son in height and form being very tall and slender her face was oval her complexion clear and fair but very pale her mouth rather large but her smile to celia perfectly enchanting her hair eyebrows and eyes were black the eyes were very large clear and brilliant though when they smiled as they were doing now it was as if remembering they had wept and knowing they should some day weep again and now tell me all about it my dear the queen was saying to lady ingram sophia gave you my message about the bishop yes madam and i am quite delighted to think of it your majesty is aware that the tories are in greater power than ever dean atterbury said so in his last note replied the queen opening her desk and apparently searching for the letter he has written often lately and very kindly celia listened in much surprise to hear that an unsuspected protestant dignitary was in constant and familiar correspondence with the court of st germains your majesty has not heard from the duke from blenheim no not since i saw you but the duchess of tyrconnel was here not long ago and she tells me that there seems no hope of the dukes return to power celias astonishment grew does your majesty fear that the princesssuggested lady ingram no my dear no replied the queen rather sadly i do not think she can have discovered she is not naturally suspicious and you know that the duchess has been her dearest friend for many years i scarcely think much of that answered lady ingram beside as your majesty knows this woman abigail who has crept up to power on the wreck of hers and who is a better friend of ours than ever she was has all the influence now over the princess anne and she would doubtless willingly let her know if she discovered it simply to spite the duchess and prevent her return to power of course the supplanter would not like to be supplanted i know it my dear lady ingram i know it responded the queen with a sadder air than ever also your majesty will rememberbut here lady ingram bent forward and spoke low so that celia could hear no more she had heard quite enough already to make her doubtful of the truth and honesty of everybody in the room but philip is this your first visit to france celia looked up suddenly to find herself addressed by the king yes sir she said hesitating very much coloring and doubting whether in saying your majesty she would have been doing right or wrong yes this is my first visit do you like it not so well as england spoken like a true englishwoman said the king with his rare smile neither do i remembering that he had been carried away as an infant in arms celia wondered what he knew about it i hope you are one of my friends was the next question celia looked up blushed and looked down again i do not know sir she said i compliment you on your honesty said he tis a rare quality celia was beginning to think it was i beg your pardon sir she replied timidly i was brought up to think otherwise let us hope to convert you he answered i assure you that your friends can hope for no great degree of prosperity till they become mine and i am not without hopes of changing all england on that question do you think it impossible i almost do sir said celia smiling and playing with her fan a little nervously we shall see who is right added the king ingram have you seen colville lately and i assure your majesty said lady ingram rising that i shall make the fullest inquiries about it and direct sophie to do so so be it my dear said the queen quietly farewell you will bring this little maid again i had a daughteryou know in arcadiaonce fiat voluntas tua the last words were spoken very low and falteringly the beloved princess louise surnamed by her father la consolatrice had been taken away from her mothers eyes as with a stroke only six weeks before and for one minute celia forgot dishonesty and popery and everything else on the part of the exiled house as she looked pityingly into the teardimmed eyes of the almost desolate mother there were four graves at westminster beside the one at chaillot and the young man who stood beside the queen was the last of her children the only son of his mother and she was a widow and the verdict celia whispered to her own heart at the close wasyes england has done wellhas done right but oh if it had not been necessary chocolate announced mr philip ingram to himself simultaneously with the presentation of himself at his sisters boudoirdoor patient bring me a cuptheres a good soul why how long is it before supper scarcely two hours i know said celia but i had very little dinner and i am hungry you dined on your coming interview with the queen did you well how do you like her i like her face very much and feel very sorry for her you like her face repeated philip putting his hands in his pockets what a droll answer do you mean that you dislike her voice or what part of her nothing in that way philip i wonder if there is a scrap of honesty left in the world precious little my deari can tell you that patient you are a diamond of the first water the last remark by way of receipt for the chocolate well i think so i never could have imagined that such men as the duke of marlborough and dean atterbury were eating the queens bread and deceiving her every day by writing to these people and offering help philip laughed so that is what has angered and astonished you why any man in paris could have told you that months ago tis no secret my innocencefrom any but the princess anne tis rank dishonesty exclaimed celia warmly i dont complain of their helping this court but of their want of truth if they are jacobites let them have the manliness to say so you are such an innocent responded philip still laughing why my simple little sister all is fair in politics as in love and war i dont see that all is fair in any of the three what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong excellent my logical damsel but what are right and wrong that is the first question is there a certain abstract thing called right or virtue or does right differ according to the views or circumstances of the actor i do not understand you philip to do right is to obey god and to do wrong is to disobey god there was no wrong in adams and eves eating fruit what made it wrong was gods having forbidden them to touch that one tree st paul says where no law is there is no transgression upon my word you are a regular divine butleaving st paul on one side for the presenthow according to your theory shall we discover what is wrong just by not leaving st paul on one side answered celia smiling for the bible is given us for that purpose very few definite rules are to be found in the bible my doctor of divinity quite enough for all of us philip pardon me the very thing i think is that there are not enough a few more thou shalts and thou shalt nots would be of infinite service your view if i understand it is to bring the bible to bear upon every act of life but how you contrive to do so i cant imagine now look here i will give you a case my fair casuist would it be right or wrong for me at this moment sitting on this sofa to take a pinch of snuff i must ask you a few questions before i can answer catechize by all means what is my name philip eugene who gave me this name dont recollect in the least what did they do for me why one of them gave me a gold goblet and another a set of silver apostlespoons and i am not aware that they did anything else for me philip philip remonstrated celia laughing in spite of herself please dont let us jest upon these serious subjects i dont want to ask those questions well i wont jest my dear i will be very quiet and grave does your mother object to your taking snuff not exactly i dont think she much likes it then your question is answered if she does not like it it isfor youwrong oh you arrive at your conclusions in that roundabout sort of way that is rather clever but i will see if i cannot puzzle you yet i have no doubt you can very easily said celia you may readily propound fifty such cases which i could not answer you see those are not my circumstances and we can scarce expect that god will give us grace to see what is right in difficulties which he does not lay upon us do you not think so patient i do so madam i have ever found it harder to see the way out when i had hedged up mine own way than when the lord as with noah had shut me in ah there you come round to your divinity said philip lightly whatever i ask you you always centre there and patient will say amen to all your propositions i have no doubt but to return to our point of departure i hardly see your rank dishonesty in the acts of the court i believe thisthat if the queen thought it dishonest she would not do it she is considered here a very religious woman not in your way i dare say but we freethinkers you know do not set much value on small differences if a man be sincere that is the chief thing even some of the more enlightened of the catholic fathers allow that does not the bible say that there are twelve gates to heaven there is a reference for you a reference thatll no hold water mr philip said patient looking up for though there be twelve gates into the city theres only door into the fold and ill be fain to know how you are shaping without passing the one door to get in at any of the twelve gates for whoso entereth not in by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber philip added celia softly there is but one gate and one way to life which is jesus christ ah at it again said philip lifting his eyebrows and finishing his chocolate always at it answered celia in the same tone out of the abundance of the heart the mouth must speak philip your idea about sincerity will lead you terribly astrayi am sure it will there is but one truth and if a man believe falsehood will his thinking it truth make it so sincerity is not the chief thing the chief things are faith and love in us and the lord jesus christ out of us he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life o philip listen to me this once it is not a vain thing for thee because it is thy life philip looked into his sisters earnest eyes rose and kissed her and sat down again you are a capital little sister he said and admirably cut out for a rligieuse i am quite glad the protestants dont take to that amusement or i should certainly lose you and i like you too well to afford it celia sighed her words did not appear to have made the faintest impression what a sigh said philip my dear little celia do you take me for an utter reprobate that you think it necessary to mourn over me in that way philip said celia very solemnly a man must be either inside the sheepfold of jesus or outside it without is without whether the door which he refuses to enter be a yard from him or a thousand miles without the fold now without the city hereafter and without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie i know mighty few people who are in then said philip whistling and considering the carpet i am afraid so answered celia shortly but the one question for us philip isare we in a question to which mr philip ingram made no reply john churchill duke of marlborough second son of winston churchill and elizabeth drake his wife born at musbury died at windsor lodge june buried in westminster abbey august eugenio francesco fifth and youngest son of eugenio maurizio prince of carignano and olympia mancini his wife born at paris october died at vienna april sarah daughter and coheir of richard jennings

author of robinson crusoe born died in london april the account of his dealings with mist which are little to de foes credit has lately been brought to light it is contained in a series of letters from himself recently discovered in the statepaper office they have been printed in the london review june and in notes and queries d s vi these letters show painfully the utter demoralization of parties at the time in question the account given above of de foes interview with mist is taken almost verbatim from his own letters and has received no further change than was necessary to throw it into the form of dialogue but the event has been antedated by six years it really took place in and lords townshend and sunderland were de foes employers see de foes letters quoted above gen xvii sam

germainenlaye may celia folded her letter addressed it and sat thinking how would they receive it she pictured lucy rushing into the parlor waving it above her head and isabella languidly rebuking her for her rough entrance she could guess the squires comments on many things she had said and she knew that the very mention of the pretender would call forth some strong participles madam passmore would fold up the letter with dear child and drop it into her ample pocket cicely would courtesy and ask if mrs celia was acoming one month more and then surely lady ingram must be satisfied but then came another thought she would be very sorry to leave philip and patient even to return to ashcliffe would lady ingram be induced to let her take patient with her as to philip surely he could visit her if he chose mademoiselle said the voice of thrse beside her celia turned and saw that thrse was holding a little pink note which having delivered the french maid departed she broke the seal and discovered to her surprise that the note was from lady ingram herself it ran thus my daughteri shall not be able to receive you this afternoon as i am suffering from megrims i will send philip to keep you company i wish you to know that when i return to paris which will be in four days i will lead you to kiss the hand of the king of france after this you will be able to enter into company claude ingram celia dropped the note in the trepidation which it caused her she had no desire to be presented to the originator of the dragonnades and what was entering into company she was sure it meant what she would not like and might think actually wrong do you drive out this afternoon madam asked patient appearing at the door no patient said celia hesitatingly for she was still thinking of the note mr philip will drink a dish of chocolate with me here yes madam replied patient and disappeared celia changed her dress with a heavy heart and came back into her boudoir where preparations for the chocolate were made she found mr philip ingram very comfortably established on her sofa good evening madam observed that gentleman without any alteration in his attitude of repose philip what is it to go into company to dress fine and tell lies why celia gave him the note in answer ah remarked he megrims has she let me see nowthe megrims are pre letellier yes pre dumain is a cold on the chest what do you mean philip asked celia in bewilderment only my ladymothers style of cipher correspondence my dear she gives an occasional sance to her spiritual advisers on which occasion she tells the worldfibs you do not really mean it of course i do but what does she do in her sance confesses her sinsthat is so far as i can judge from my recollection of one such occurrence at which i was present when a small kitten she regales her spiritual pastor with some very spicy tales of all her friends and acquaintances i am sure you are joking philip but please tell me what it is that she wants me to do is it to go to all her assemblies precisely my grey sisterand to a few court balls and a play or two o dear sighed poor celia i never can do that dont sigh in that heartrending style said philip as to assemblies there will not be above three more this summer and we may be in china by next year what is your special grief it looks like conformity to the world answered celia in a low tone for she did not expect philip to understand her where is the world laughed that irreverent young gentleman that superb satin gown of yours or the chocolate or the talk eh patient what do you say my veteran prioress in your heart mr philip answered patient setting down the chocolatepot which she had just brought in the world outside and an evil worldly human heart within will work no little mischief ill warrant it did him no harm dining with the phariseenot that simon was an overpleasant man to do with i should say and when your heart is as pure and holy as his why sir im thinking you may go and welcome but ive work enough cut out for me in keeping the devil without mine own door without calling at his to ask how he fareth thank you dr patient rather a short sermon celia my dear i have a scrap of information for you which will make you open your eyes the shortest sermon i ever heard of was one of the most salutary sirto wit when nathan said to poor sinful david thou art the man you are very disrespectful to his israelitish majesty said philip lightly well mrs celia know that i have succeeded at last in obtaining her ladyships leave and the kings commission to go into the army lieutenant ingram madam at your service and philip rose and made a bow which would not have disgraced monsieur bontems philip are you really a lieutenant really and the best half of the battle is the battle there is a prospect of the troops being called to active service celia turned pale does your mother know that no o philip you have not been deceiving her have you smooth your ruffled brow my fair reprover i did not know it myself until after his majesty had promised me a commission of course after this i must be a fervent jacobite so dont you talk any politics in my hearing mrs patient irvine unless you wish me to fight you i shall scarce be like to do that sir unless you give me the starting quietly responded patient thank you no i will keep my hands off that gunpowdermagazine i know how you can go off sometimes when touched by a few odd matches so my charmer your interview with me on the th of next month will be the last for a while where are you going philip we march to the netherlands border and meet prince eugene we are to be at landrcies by the th of july mr philip you shall not go hence without a bible in your knapsack thank you very much am i to read it when i am not firing if i could help it sir you would not go without one other thing but that i cannot give you what thing may that be the grace of god in your heart sir you think me entirely devoid of it asked philip gravely i do so mr philip said patient looking him full in the face well you are candid if not complimentary said he tis fortunate for me that my conscience gives a rather fairer report than you do i wish edward were back i should like to have gone into battle under dear old neds wing and im in his own regiment too he must have got an awful furlough your conscience sir exclaimed patient in a peculiar voice do you think that when adam fell he left his conscience out my dear patient i wonder what you mean god has given to every man his conscience as his ruler counsellor and guide he who hearkens to his conscience is hearkening to god patient did not answer at once then she said sir i desire to speak with due reverence of the lords dealings but tis my true belief that he did nothing of the kind you say he gave tis true a guide to every man but that guide was his own blessed word and his own holy spirit not the mans poor miserable fallen conscience truly i would not take my conscience which is myself to be my ruler counsellor and guide one is my ruler which is in heaven one is my counsellorthe wonderful counsellor and one is my guidethe spirit in the word which he hath written conscience given us for a guide mr philip why paul went according to his conscience when he kept the clothes of them that stoned stephen peter went according to his conscience when he withdrew himself from them that were not of the circumcision and refused to eat with them alexander the coppersmith very like went according to his conscience when he did the church much evil to come to our own day i dare be bold to guess that king charles went according to his consciencecharles the first i mean i doubt his son had none and claverhouse and this king lewis and the pretenderay the pope himself poor old sinnerill be bound they go according to their consciences nay nay mr philip when adam fell in eden surely his conscience fell with him and just as there can be nothing more sweet and gracious than an enlightened conscience and a sanctified will so there is little worse than a blind conscience and a carnal will you have such a curious set of arguments as i never heard you are for ever talking about the fall of adam which you seem to fancy accounts for the falls and slips of you and me i never knew adam i am sure and i dont hold myself responsible for his taste in apples how do you know that adam fell as you are pleased to call it and supposing that he did what in the name of common sense has that to do with me it has more to do with you than you think for mr philip as christ is the head of his saved church so is adam the head of the whole family of man in adam all die and as to knowing that adam fell to say nought of the lords record of it i scarce think i need more evidence of that than your doubting it sir if you can look upon this world as it is at this moment and doubt that man is a fallen lost ruined miserable creature there must be something sore wrong with the eyes of your understanding or of yours suggested philip oh i see evil enough in the world i warrant you but i see good along with it now the principle you are fond of laying down is according to a text which i think you have quoted to me twenty timesin us dwelleth no good thing i wish you thought so mr philip thank you for wishing me such an agreeable view of myself but while you are fixing your eyes intently on all the evil in the world you leave the good unseen would you kindly point it out to me sir willingly take only one point there are hosts of people in the worldcatholics and others even mahometans and idolaters i dare saywhom you would consign kindly and certainly to everlasting perdition i consign no man to perdition sir the keys of hell and of death are not in my hands thank god but i read of the son of perdition who went to his own place well among all these very wicked people there is a vast deal of charity is that good or bad charity is good sir said patient cautiously paul would have counted himself nothing worth if he had not charity but then they are good for indulging it interrupted philip sir charity is a much misused word you are speaking of mere alms the which are good for them that receive them if they use them rightly and good for them that give them when given in a right spirit but these are no more evidence of a mans standing before god patient irvine have you read the twentyfifth chapter of saint matthew i have read the twentyfifth of matthew sir answered patient dryly leaving out the saint and are not the good people commended in that chapter and do they not obtain everlasting life simply and solely for their charity to the poor no sir said patient placidly well upon my word exclaimed philip sir resumed patient gravely it takes but a kindly heart to give alms for its own sake or for the receivers sake but it takes a renewed heart to give alms for christs sake not the giving of alms was the title to life everlasting but the giving them unto him was the seal and evidence of their grace they that know christ will look for a savor of him in all things and such as have it not are bitter unto them and i would call to your mind sir that tis he that believeth which shall be saved not he which giveth alms at least there is no such passage in my bible you always run off to something else said philip discontentedly however to come back to our first pointas to my conscience begging your pardon and with your gracious leave i think that god has given it to me as a guide and that i am bound to follow it patient laid down her work and looked philip in the face i read in the word mr philip of different sorts of consciences there is a defiled conscience unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled there is an evil conscience having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and nought in earth or heaven will sprinkle them to this end save the blood of christ there is a conscience lost and smothered in dead works how much more shall the blood of christ purge your conscience from dead works now mr philip see your good and charity to the poor works you see but coming from dead hearts and soulsdead works and lastly deepest and deadliest of all i read of a conscience seared with a hot iron ay there have been some of those in our day the lord protect us from it the devil hath such a grip of them that they cannot free themselves and poor blind souls they never know it but think they are doing gods service are these consciences given as guides mr philip well you see all that is saint peters opinion i ask you pardon tis paul not peter oh st paul well tis all the same ay mr philip it is all the same for it was the holy ghost that spake through both of them and his opinion is scarce to be dealt with so lightly methinks seeing that by his word we shall be judged at the last day patient took up her work again and said no more philip was silent for a time when he next spoke it was on a different subject celia i want you to come down at my mothers next assembly i should like to present my friend colville to you i am rather curious to see him she admitted mr philip if i might presume to say a word presume to say a word you may presume to say a thousand my dear old covenanter whats in the wind now i wish you went less about with that mr colville why does he wear his cravats without starch asked philip stretching himself out lazily i am afraid mr philip that he wears his soul without grace said patient determinately if he were such another as his grandsire i would wish no better than to see you in his company but i am sore afraid that he draws you off sir to places where you should not go he never draws me off reverend mother to any place where i dont choose to go i assure you he would find that a hard matter the case is scarce bettered by that mr philip replied patient mournfully nay rather worsened im thinking o mr philip bear with me sir for i have sobbed many a prayer over your cradle and many a wrestle have i had with the lord for a blessing on your soul you little ken sir how even now whenever i see you go out with that mr colville i lay the case before the lord at once i could not rest else my dear old darling said philip smiling and very affectionately i wish you did not look at me through such very black spectacles there are better men than i ammany a one but i hope there are a few worse that wont satisfy me sir answered patient i would have sir edward and you the two best men in the world and we are notat least i am not i am not sure that ned is not what a pity ay mr philip a bitterer pity than youll ken till you come to stand before god i have watched you for years sir like a mother her babe trusting to see you quietened and calmed by grace and tonight you seem to me lighter and gayer than ever tis no manner of useno manner of use i have labored in vain i have spent my strength for nought dear patient said celia as the door closed on philip have you forgotten that verse we read last sundaythough israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength it comes you know just after the text you repeated ou ay mrs celia answered patient dropping into scotch as was usual with her when deeply stirredou ay i mind that word but it was the gathering i wanted madamit was the gathering back in paris and once more attired in full court costume celia somewhat sadly joined her stepmother this visit to the tuileries was even more distasteful to her than that she had paid at st germains the idea of kneeling to kiss the hand of the man who had ordered the dragonnades came she thought very near the border of absolute wrong at the same time she did not feel so certain of the wrong as to make her resist lady ingrams order her position was exceedingly disagreeable since while she could not be sure that she was doing wrong she felt very doubtful whether she was doing right philip tried to rally her upon her sorrowful face but his banter fell flat and he looked puzzled and compassionate i am ready my dear said lady ingram as she came in but what a face do you think that i am taking you to see an execution madam said celia summoning all her courage i wish your ladyship would allow me to remain at home is this wicked my votaress asked lady ingram with the scornful smile which by this time her stepdaughter knew so well i cannot say that madam but i am not quite sure that it is right does your ladyship wish me particularly to accompany you of course i do my clear tis an opportunity which it would be a sin to lose you consider it a venial sin i suppose well you can say another prayer or two i know nothing about venial sins madam sin is sin to me but as i am not sure that this is a sin if your ladyship absolutely commands me i will go at the same time i would much rather remain ah i know what that means my rligieuse said lady ingram laughing you want an excuse for your conscience very well then i command you the coach is here come celia followed slowly lady ingram had entirely misunderstood herin all probability was incapable of understanding her any further explanation she felt would merely plunge her deeper into the mire so she sat grave and silent until the carriage drew up on one side of the place du carrousel lady ingram gave her hand as usual to philip and celia followed them in silence after the customary passage through suites of rooms they paused at a door and on giving a gentle tap a gentleman in black came out and bowed low before them madam said he my duty is my duty i regret unspeakably to be constrained to inform you that his most christian majesty can receive no person today i regret it exceedingly also answered lady ingram i can proceed i suppose to visit the ladies certainly madam lady ingram turned off through further suites of apartments and the gentleman in black straightening himself up disappeared again behind the door celia felt relieved there could be nothing wrong she thought in paying respect to the queen and princesses to whom she supposed lady ingram to refer and she followed with a lighter step and heart than before her ignorance of the state of the royal family of france was very great indeed that state in the summer of was a strange and lamentable one there was no queen yet the king was married there were no princesses save one the duchess de berry yet three of the kings daughters sat round his table every evening now celia said lady ingram looking back we will pay our respects first to the duchess de berry who is the duchess de berry celia inquired softly of philip the wife of the kings grandson he whispered in reply the duchess de berry could receive them they were told on asking and the gentleman usher opened the inner door and gave access to a large and handsome room wherein about two dozen ladies and gentlemen were seated at a table playing cards a much larger number stood round the room close to the walls watching the players lady ingram made her way to a very young girl who sat at one end of the lansquenettable and who celia thought was scarcely seventeen this surely could be the wife of nobody she mentally decided the girl certainly looked very young celia on consideration doubted if she were seventeen a soft bright innocent face she had laughing eyes and a blooming complexion she looked up with a smile as lady ingram approached her and said a few words in a low tone lady ingram took off her gloves and sat down quietly at the lansquenettable having apparently forgotten her companions are we to remain here asked celia of philip in a tone inaudible to any one but himself wait a minute till i see the result of her first venture answered philip biting his lip celia looked back at the cardtable she was accustomed to see squire passmore play cards but never for money except when he received or went into company and even then a few halfcrowns were all that changed hands she gazed with surprise on the piles and rouleaux of gold which lay upon this table and the quantity of loose pieces scattered about hands were constantly extended with a dozen or two of louis in them and one lady in particular celia noticed who piled up her gold until the tower would go no higher and each time staked the heap on a single card who is that girl next my lady ingram at the end of the table celia next inquired of her brother that is the duchess de berry said he that the duchess why philip she is scarce more than a child she is the mother of two children herself replied philip perhaps you guess her younger than she iseighteen she looks so young and innocent said celia young yesbut innocent my dear this girl of eighteen is already one of the worst women in france deuceaceah she will go on we may go philip slipped round the table to his mothers side and whispered a few words to her to which she responded without turning her head coming back to celia he gave her his hand and led her out of the room is my lady not coming she asked glancing back not when she has thrown deuceace said philip dryly she considers that her lucky number and always goes on playing when it comes at the first throw now come with me for halfanhour you will see a little of courtlife and you shall go home when you are tired we will visit the great drawingroom he led her into a large handsome room hung with crimson round the apartment lines of spectators three or four deep were standing and at a very large table in the midst about forty more were seated the game played here also was lansquenet for such immense losses had occurred at basset that the king had forbidden the latter game in all rooms but the private boudoirs of the princesses have we any right here philip whispered celia doubtfully yes said philip coolly any person known to the gentlemenushers can enter come round a little to the rightthere is more room and you will see better i will be your directory that gentleman with the blue coat and the orders on his breast at the top of the table is the duke of orleans if the king die while his heir is under age as is most likely that man will be regent of france he is considered a clever fellow celia looked and saw a man of middle height and about forty years of age he had bright eyes a laughing mouth a florid complexion and a thick flat nose the hand which held his cards was as small white and delicate as that of a woman and who are the ladies beside him celia wished to know on the right his cousin the grand duchess of tuscany and on the left another cousin the princess of conti next to her is her halfsister the dukes wife i do not quite like the grand duchesss face she is not considered particularly amiable one of her sisters was married to the duke de guise which was so marvellous a condescension that the poor man might never eat his dinner without his wifes leave every day he stood beside her chair and presented her dinnernapkin the cover was laid for her only and he might not presume to help himself even to a biscuit until her royal highness was graciously pleased to command a plate and chair to be brought for monsieur de guise then he made a low grateful bow to his very superior wife and might sit down and dine is that really true philip asked celia laughing softly perfectly true celia turned her attention to the princess of conti she liked to look at her fair quiet face with its large soft brown eyes and she was wondering what her character was when suddenly a lady who had been staking extremely high rose from her seat flinging down her cards cursing and swearing in most voluble french this was the first time that celia had heard a woman use such language and she hid her face shuddering ruined said philip coolly you had better come away the ladies and gentlemen at the cardtable set up a shrill chorus of laughter o philip take me home sobbed celia i cannot bear this she had heard squire passmore swear before now but it was generally when he was excited or angry and was commonly accompanied by a gentle hush john from his wife philip led his sister out of the room to the seats in the recess of the corridor window sit down here a minute he said and recover yourself before i take you upstairs that was an unfortunate accident if i had known i should not have brought you here o philip let me go home no more visits like this please you shall do as you like my dear said philip kindly but the next visit will be very different from this celia rose trying to compose herself and afraid of disappointing her brother she consented to be taken where he wished does madame de maintenon receive this afternoon was philips question to the usher upstairs she does sir and his royal highness the duke of bretagne is with her oh i dont want to see anybody who will swear said celia drawing back if the duke of bretagne have learned to swear answered philip gravely he must be a marvel of juvenile depravity for he will not be three years old until next february a child said celia i beg the little things pardon i have no objection to that the future king of france my dear said philip he will be louis xv if he live in a few years at the utmost now three low courtesies for madame de maintenon in a quiet pleasant chamber hung with dark blue an old lady sat showing a picturebook to a very little boy who stood leaning against her knee she did not look her age which was seventyeight her figure was rather inclining to be tall and she preserved the taste the grace and the dignity which had always characterized her a complexion of extreme fairness was relieved by black eyes very large and radiant but the once chestnut hair now required no powder to make it white mr philip ingram she said with a peculiarly pleasant smile i am very much pleased to see you my sister madame said philip as he presented celia i did not know that you had a sister she answered receiving celia very kindly louis will you give your hand to this lady the pretty little child addressed trotted forward and looking straight in celias face with his great brown eyes presented his baby hand to be kissed resisting a strong inclination to take him on her knee and kiss him celia performed her homage to the future sovereign with much gravity the little duke offered the same privilege to philip and trotted back to his picturebook my lady ingram is not with you asked the old lady in the duchess de berrys saloon at lansquenet madame ah do you play mademoiselle no madame said celia i am glad to hear it replied madame de maintenon it is a great waste of time and temper which were not given us for such uses turn over required the little prince authoritatively madame de maintenon smiled and obeyed i hope his majesty is not ill asked philip i hear he does not receive not ill but not well one of his troublesome headaches neither men nor women live forever mr ingramnot even kings true but unfortunate madame was the civil answer with which philip took his leave now we will go home said he a short visit but i thought we had better not interrupt the dukes readinglesson did you like this scene better than the other o philip how different is that lady his nurse well not precisely my dear she isonly that she is not called sothe queen the queen of france asked celia opening her eyes the king of frances wife which i suppose is the same thing only that in madame de maintenons case it is not the same thing there is a paradox a strange life that woman has led she was born in a prison the daughter of a huguenot father and a catholic mother imbibed her fathers teaching and when young was a determined little huguenot her father died early her mother took her to church and she turned her back on the altar madam daubign slapped miss fanny and turned her round but fanny only presented the other cheek strike away said she tis a blessed thing to suffer for ones religion her mother now thought there was nothing to be done with the obstinate little heretic and gave her up next the house was burntfortunately while they were out of it but for days fanny cried inconsolably her mother who appears to have been a practical matteroffact woman when this sort of thing had gone on for several days thought it desirable to treat miss fanny to a slight scolding what a little goose you are she said crying everlastingly for a house oh it isnt the house sobbed fanny it isnt the houseit is dolly well madame daubign died while fanny was still a girl and she was left entirely destitute in these circumstances she married for a home the ugliest man in france he was a comic poet a poor deformed fellow of the name of scarron fanny did not gain much by her marriage for they were very poor but her taste in dress was so exquisite that i have heard ladies say she looked better in a common gown of lavender cotton than half the court ladies in their silks and satins and her conversation was so fascinating that clever men used to dine with scarron just for the sake of hearing her talk there is a story told of one such dinner at which the servant whispered in madames ear please to tell another story there is not enough roast beef i have heard these and many other anecdotes about her from aunt sophie whose motherinlaw knew her well for many years when her husband died she was again thrown on the world and for some time she petitioned the king in vain for some little property or pension to which she was entitled us scarrons widow at last he became perfectly tired of her petitions but he had never seen her widow scarron his majesty used to say as he took up another petition am i always to be pestered with widow scarron a short time afterwards he met her somewhere and her grace beauty and wit made such an impression upon him that he gave her the appointment of governess to a posse of his children when he came to see them he saw her and widow scarron so grew in his esteem that it is supposed about two years after the death of his queen he married her and why do they call her madame de maintenon his majesty gave her the estate of maintenon and wished her to bear the name and what will become of her when he dies ah that is just the point i should think she will go into a convent i thought you said she was a huguenot so she was but she is generally supposed to be a catholic now what a pity said celia thoughtfully how much good she might have done in turning the kings heart towards the huguenots if god had permitted her on the contrary she is thought to have turned him from them many persons say that we may thank her for the revocation of the edict of nantes i can scarce believe that philip i hardly do myself do you think philip asked celia slowly after a pause that there is one really good man or woman among all your acquaintance my dear replied philip in his gravest manner i have met with so many good men and women that i have lost all faith in the article i have seen excellent mothers whose children have died from neglect excellent husbands who have run away with other peoples wives excellent sons and daughters who have left a kind mother alone in her old age and excellent friends who have ruined their friends reputations by backbiting never a one of your good men and women for me if you please we are all a bad lot togetherthat is the truth and the best of us is only a trifle less bad than the others but philip do you really know none who has the fear of god in his heart yes i know three people who have ityou and ned and patient i cannot name a fourth o philip i wish you were the fourth yourself sighed celia so do i my dear said philip so gravely that celia looked up into his face to see what he meant she was perplexed and scarcely satisfied with what she read there philip she asked dropping her eyes again do you play at these cardtables never i believe patient thinks i do but she is mistaken i threw at basset once and i shall never do it again did you lose no i won then what made you determine not to do it again a remark of leroy who was standing near he said no man ever loses at the first throw i never saw one lose the devil is too cunning for that i thought that if the habitual frequenters of the bassettable acknowledged that gentleman for their president the less i saw of it the better i think you were very wise philip said celia monsieur leroy the man whoshe stopped suddenly wondering whether philip were acquainted with the facts of which she was thinking the man whoprecisely savarie leroy i see patient has told you that sad story philip said celia very seriously i wish i could do something to help you if you do really wish to fear god my dear little sister replied philip putting his arm round her have you any idea how much you have helped me already i am not quite the gallio you and patient think mecaring for none of these things now i will just give you a glimpse into my heart i always knew what patient wasshe never concealed her thoughts on the matter but there are thirty years between her and me and i fanciedperhaps foolishlythat the religion which might be very good for her would not do for me i thought many a time if i could find some one in my own rank and near my own age who had not been brought up with patient as ned and i have and therefore had not taken the tone of his feelings from her if this person should think feel and talk in the same way that she does having derived it from a different locality and breeding and all thatwhy then i should feel that whatever else this religion of hers were at least it was a reality now this i never could have found in ned for two reasons as to religious breeding patient has brought him up the tone and color of his religion he derives from her and secondly ned is rather close not in the least sternly or unkindly sonothing of the sort but he is not such an open foolish offhanded fellow as i am it is not natural to him as it is to me to say everything he thinks to everybody who comes in his way and in religious matters particularly what he thinks and feels he keeps to himself well then you came for the first few weeks that you were here i watched you like a cat watches a mouse if you had made one slipif i had once seen your profession and practice at varianceif you had been less gentle and obedient to my mother when i could see that she was making you do things which you would much rather not do or if on the other hand you had allowed her to lead you into something which i knew that you considered positively forbiddenif i had seen anything of this celia i should have gone away more irretrievably disgusted than ever with religion and all who professed it now my dear i dont want to make you proud and puff you up but as i am telling you all this i must add that i found not one slip in you i cannot understand how you have done it it seems to me that you must have a very large amount of what patient calls grace that i who have been watching you so narrowly could detect nothing in you which i thought wrong now will you forgive me for the ordeal through which unknown to you i have been putting you the conclusion to which it has led me is thisthis thingthis religion of yours and patientscall it fear of god or what you willis a real thing it is not the disordered fancy of one good woman as i for a time imagined that it might be it is a genuine compact and converse between god and your souls and i only wish i were one of you rather to philips surprise celia who while he spoke had been earnestly regarding him with brilliant eyes and smiling lips put her head down and burst into tears my dear he said o philip i am so glad she saidso glad so thankfulso very very glad and she sobbed for pure joy then i am very glad that i have told you my dear and if it gives you any satisfaction i will say again what i have saidfrom my soul i wish i were one of you the ugly word exqueen had not yet come into use and the english spoke of maria beatrice as they would have done if she had died i must own to having left my heroines letter defective in one

authentic x anent john patterson one faithful meek fool who is led to the burning he cumbered us sorely in vanity fair miss muloch look out for rocks madam celia was patients enigmatical comment when she heard what philip had said i do not understand you patient madam there is nothing harder in this world than humility because there is nothing so near to the lord there are but two places wherein he dwelleththe high and holy heaven and the humble and contrite heart paul you mind was sent a thorn in the flesh because of the abundance of the revelations i have near always found that when i have had some work to do for the lord which was like to make me think well of myself there has either been a thorn in the flesh or a thorn in the spirit sent to me either just before or just after most commonly just before and it does not need abundance of revelations neither to set up poor fools like us anything can do that if we are trying to walk close to the lord and give no occasion for stumbling the devil can make pedestals of our very graces whereon to stick us up and cause us to fall down and worship ourselves ay of our very sins he can manys the time when i have been set up in the forenoon on account of some very thing which when i was calmer had to be laid open and repented of before the lord at night depend upon it jonah was no feeling over lowly when he thought he did well to be angry and then when a little breeze of repentance does stir the heavy waves of the soul the devil whispers how good how humble how godly you are ah his devices thank god we are not ignorant of them look out for rocks madam i am no true prophet if you find not a keen wind soon after this tell me patient does my brother edward fear god yes madam you know he does i have no anxiety about sir edward madam i only wish i were half as sure of mr philip do you think madam the way is rough and the gate strait and few there be that find it and i dont think mr philip likes rough walking but the lord kens that too if he have been given to christ of the father hell have to comeshall come to meand hell find no more to greet over than the rest of the children when we all get home to the fathers house neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand lady ingram did not return from the palace before eight oclock in the evening and then in an exceedingly bad temper fashionably so only she was much too accomplished and polished to go into a vulgar passion thrse discovered the state of her mistresss mind when she found that she could do nothing to please her the new dress of which lady ingram had expressed her full approbation in the morning was declared effroyante at night and thrse had to alter the style of her ladys hair five times before she condescended to acknowledge herself satisfied at length she appeared in her boudoir and after breakfast instead of paying her usual visit to celias room sent a message desiring celia to come to her are you not well madam was celias natural query when she saw how pale and heavyeyed lady ingram looked well yes my dear but i have scarcely slept i left fifteen hundred pounds behind me at that horrible lansquenet celias eyes opened rather wide the sum indicated was almost incredible to her simple apprehension my dear said lady ingram pettishly you are still only halfformed do not open your eyes in that wayit makes you look astonished a woman of the world never wonders i am not a woman of the world madam then my lessons have been of very little use to you i am afraid you are not really and never will be that reminds me of what i wished to say to you i am informed by some one who saw you that after you and philip left me in the saloon of the duchess he took you into the great drawingroom and that at something you saw there you burst into tears now really my dear this is totally inadmissible you scandalized those who saw you had you heard some dreadful news or some such thing it might have been proper and even laudable to shed a few tears but actually to sob in the sight of all the world just as any laundress or orangegirl might have donereally celia you must get over this weakness i beg your pardon madam replied celia timidly but really i could not help it there was a lady at the cardtable who had lost a great dealat least philip thought soand she began speaking such horrible words that it terrified me i could not help it could not help it repeated lady ingram contemptuously cannot you help anything you choose oh yes it was the countess des ferriresshe had lost and her estates every livre she had even to the earrings which she wore so of course she was ruined but you quite mistake my dearyou need not have felt terrified you are in error if you suppose that swearing is interdicted to men and even women of quality quite the contrary it is rather modish than otherwise a few gentle oaths such asand lady ingram gave a short listare quite admissible in such circumstances you would hear them from the lips of the best families in france if it were not modish of course it would be highly improper but you are entirely mistaken if you suppose it so any of those i have mentioned would be quite properfor you even i have heard much stronger words than those from the duchess de berry and she is younger than you are but mercy on us child what eyes you make they were gleaming like stars lady ingram a words had lighted up a fire behind them and every feeling of timidity was burnt up in the blaze of its indignation my lady ingram said celia with a dignity in her voice and manner which her stepmother had never seen her assume and believed to be quite foreign to her nature i did not come to paris either to deny my religion or to outrage my god in all matters which concern him not you have moulded me at your will i thought that you took to me the place of my dead father and mother and i have obeyed you as i would have obeyed them but into the sanctuary of my soul you cannot penetrate on the threshold of the temple even you must pause god is more to me than father or mother and at the risk of your displeasureat the risk of my life if needs bei must obey him the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king forever and he will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain notwithstanding all lady ingrams condemnation of feelings she was just now overpowered by her own in the foreground was amazement had her little pug venus opened its mouth and emitted a moral axiom she could hardly have been more astonished behind her surprise came annoyance amusement and respect for the strange new bravery of celia but in the background beyond all those was a very unpleasant and unusual sensation which she did not attempt to analyze it was really the discovery of a character which she could not fathom of a strength which she could not weaken of a temple into which she could not enter she had always prided herself upon her ability to read every persons character at a glance and here was the especial character which she had set down as simple and almost beneath notice presenting itself in an aspect which it was beyond her skill to comprehend she had not indeed forgotten celias confession at the outset of their acquaintance but she had set it down to her english education as a past phase of thought which she had succeeded in dispelling a little more banter on the one hand and firmness on the other would she thought rid celia of her absurd and obsolete notions she had threaded all the mazes and she meant her speech just uttered to be the last turn in the path the last struggle between herself and her stepdaughter and lo here at that last turn stood a guarded sanctuary too strong for her weapons to attack into which she knew not the way of whose services she had never learned the language a strange and sudden darkness fell over her spirit there was a power here in opposition to her stronger than her own this simple docile untaught girl knew some strange thing which she did not know and with this conviction came another and a disagreeable idea might it not be something which it immediately concerned her to know what if celia were rightif all things were not bounded by this life if there were another unknown world beyond this world guided by different laws what if god were real and heaven were real and hell were real if there were a point beyond which prayers were mockery and penances were vain a veil was lifted up for a moment which had covered all this from her a dark thick heavy veil which all her life she had been at work to weave a voice from heaven whispered to her and it said thou fool when moments such as these do not soften and convict they harden and deaden the veil dropped and lady ingram was herself againher heart more rock than ever it was in a particularly cold hard voice that she spoke again celia if you do not take care i shall wash my hands of you i will not be braved in this manner by a mere girla girl whose character is wholly unformed and whose breeding is infinitely below her quality go to your chamber and remain there until you are sufficiently humbled to request my pardon for treating me with so little respect madam was the soft answer if i have shown you any disrespect i will ask your pardon now it was not my wish to do so ah the thing which celia had shown claude ingram and at which she could not bear to look was her own heart will you then retract what you have said if i have said anything personally offensive to your ladyship i will retract it and ask your forgiveness what i have said of my own relation to god i never can retract madam for it is real and eternal lady ingram was silent for a moment then she said in her hardest voice and coldest manner go to your chamber celia courtesying to her stepmother retired without another word left alone in her own boudoir again that cloud of dread darkness rolled over claude ingram the presence of the accusing angel was withdrawn but the accusations rankled yet she sat for some time in silence and at length rose with a sudden shiver and a heavy sigh opening with a little silver key a private closet richly ornamented a shrine was disclosed where a silver lamp burned before an image of the virgin here lady ingram knelt and made an act of contrition and an act of faith the repetition of vain words put no more contrition nor faith into her heart than before she uttered them only the soul was lulled to sleep and she rose satisfied with herself and her interview do you think i did wrong patient asked celia sadly of her sole confidante at the moment when at the other end of the house lady ingram was finishing her devotions patient replied in a measured and constrained voice he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me yes i know but i am so very anxious not to be wanting in respect to hernot to put any obstacles in her way the more obstacles in her way the better madam for it is the broad road that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat celia sighed heavily but made no answer ah poor blind soul continued patient if only we would look more at all men and women in one light and measure them by one testfriends of christ or enemies of christi think we would behave different from that we do patient stitched away without saying more and celia sat looking thoughtfully out of the open window from some cause unknown to herself there suddenly rose before her a vision of the great laurel at ashcliffe and the stranger blessing her in the name of the virgin she exclaimed patient in a tone which would have startled any one less unimpressionable than the placid woman who sat opposite her madam replied patient without any change of manner celia told her the circumstance of which she was thinking and added can you guess who it was patient what manner of man was he madam celia closed her eyes and tried to recall him a tall thin comely man with a brown skin and no color on cheeks or lips dark hair somewhat unkempt bright dark eyes and a very soft persuasive tone of voice his clothes had been good but were then ragged and he looked as if he had been ill or might become so i always wondered if it could be my father but as he died when i was but a child that is not possible and what was the day madam some day in november i think i can guess who it was madam celia no it could not have been your father and i know but one who answers to that description yet i knew not that he had been in england so late as that it was my husband gilbert irvine patient exclaimed celia interested at once had he been ill nay madam twas the other way he fell ill afterward he died about twelve months thereafter poor patient do not pity me madam i had nought but what i deserved i am afraid i should not like to have all i deserve patient but what do you mean madam do you mind the israelites under joshua which accepted the gibeonites because of their spoiled victuals and clouted shoon and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord that was what i did i was a plain portionless maid having nought but my labor and he was my ladys gentlemanusher in a better place than i and a rare hand at talking any one over to what he had a mind toay he was that and so i took him because of his comely face and his flattering tongue and such like and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord and tis mine experience madam that while the lord never faileth to bring good out of evil for his people in the end yet that oft for a time when they be obstinately bent on taking their own way he leaveth them to eat of the fruit of it i say not how tis with other believers but this i know that my worst troubles have ever been them i have pulled on mine own head there is a sort of comfort in a trouble by divine ordinance which it lacks when tis only by divine permission and you know you are yourself to blame for it and little comfort i had with gilbert irvine ive envied isabel paterson in the cave with her guidmanay many and many a time and i have asked the lord to do more than a miracle for mefor to turn gilberts heart would have been on the thither side of a miracle im thinkingmore wonderful yet you mind madam added patient suddenly as if afraid of being misunderstood on this point gilbert was no a papist when i and he were wed i should have seen my way through that i think for all the blind fool that i was but it was no for five years thence he professed the evangel then and went to the preaching like any christian the lord forgive himif it be no papistry to say it anyhow the lord forgive me there are no miracles now certainly said celia reflectively i can quite fancy what a comfort it must have been to live in the days of miracles but who was isabel paterson and what cave did she live in are there no miracles now madam asked patient ah but ill be long ere i say that if the lord wrought no miracle for john patersonay and twice over tooi little ken what a miracle is but truly he was a godly man above many tis mostly elijahs that be fed by angels and ravens though im no saying that if it pleased the lord he might not work wonders for you and me tis ill work setting limits to the lord but who was isabel paterson and who was john paterson urged celia again ill tell you madam john patersonhe was isabels guidmanwas a small farmingman at pennyvenie but at one time he dwelt for a season no so far from lauchie twas when i was a young maid that these things happened i knew isabel paterson and many a crack ive had with her when i was a lassie and she a thriving young wife with wee weans about her well john her guidman was a marked man to king charless troopers and many a time they set out to hunt him down he could no dwell in his own house but was forced to seek sleepingroom on the crag of benbeoch between two great rocks only visiting his own home by stealth the first of these times the dragoons came on him as he was coming down from benbeoch to the little white farmhouse below and isabel was watching his coming from the window as he was crossing the moor they saw him and he saw them john he turned and ran and they galloped after he heard them coming over the moor and leaping the stone wall that girdled benbeoch crags and he thought ah sure tis all over with me now for only that week had claverhouse hanged davie keith at his own door and he was sib to paterson john he ran and the troops they galloped he crying mightily unto the lord to save him for his names sake and while the words were yet in his mouth and the dragoons were so near him that he could hear their speech to one another all at once his feet caught at a stone and down he fell he gave himself up for lost then for the horses were right on him but where am i going thinks he through the heather he fell through the grass through the very solid earth aneath him madam the lord made a new thing and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed him up rather than he should fall into the hands of his enemies when he came to himselffor he was a bit bruised and stunned by the fallhe felt that he was in some wide dry cavern many a foot across and he heard overhead the troopers cursing and swearing that they could not find the hole where quoth they the fox had run to earth and john down aneath was kneeling and giving thanks to the lord enjoying as he told afterwards the blessedest hour of communion with him that ever he had after a while the troopers gave it up as a bad job and off they went and when john dared to climb up out of the hole and pop up his head through the long grass and heather there was nought but the green grass and the purple heather and gods blue sky over all after a time he ventured forth and hearing a wail of a womans voice found isabel mourning on the hillside seeking his dead body never doubting that the troopers had slain him he helped her into the cave and there they knelt down together and praised the lord again and by degrees after a while they carried bedding and household goods such as could be spared to this safe shelter which the lord had provided for them and not only john but others of the brethren hid there for many a day after when claverhouse was known to be in the country patient is that really true true as gospel madam i had it from isabel her ain sel but the cave must have been there before surely maybe madam or maybe not said patient a little obstinately we ken little of what goes on in the heart of the earth anyhow it had never been found before though there were shepherds who knew every inch of benbeoch crags and there it was ready when john paterson fell in need of it and what was his second escape patient that madam was wellnigh as strange for the lord made choice of a poor silly beast as his deliverer twas indeed the earlier deliverance of the two it began just like to the otherjohn was running over the moor afore claverhouses troops a meeting in the black glen having been broke up on the rumor of their coming but this time the men had dogs with them john he ran as long as he could over longstone moss calling on the lord for deliverance as he ran all the way across the bog he kept pace with them for the horses being heavier and the troopers armed they had ill work to get on through the bog but he knowing that the moss once passed they would be far swifter than he on the hard ground looked around earnestly for some safe hidingplace coming upon a deep furrow of moss and long grass running across the bog he lay down in it scarce hoping that it could be enough to hide him but for just what men call a chance hitherto he had seen only the troopers and had not noticed the dogs but all at once as he lay in this long grass he heard their deep bay come across the moor that sound quoth he struck upon my heart like a deathknell that sense of smell which god had given them was sure and unerring and these men were now using it to hunt gods children to the death straight and sure came the hounds rushing upon him he cried once more unto the lord and then was about to rise lest the dogs should tear him when all at once he heard among the long grass at his head a whirring sound and a fox dashed close past him ay but that was a scurry horses dogs and men away they set after the fox and they never came back that day so again the lord delivered him but you dont think patient that he made the fox on purpose madam said patient a little dryly i am not in the lords counsels i should fancy that he guided a common fox to do the thing but i cannot presume to say that the bit beastie was not created there and then we are too apt to limit the lord madam but god has given over creating patient has he so madam asked patient dubiously is it no new creation when the buds spring forth when the grass groweth up and he reneweth the face of the earth god did rest the seventh day from all his works but the scripture doth not tell us what he did on the eighth moreover saith our lord that the father worketh this i knowthat if the purpose of the lord were to preserve john paterson by means of a fox that fox should sooner have been brought from the indies as on dry land than that his purpose should fail he will work and who shall let it i say observed mr philip ingram at the door what have you been doing or saying or something to my mother i have not seen her in such a state i dont know when i am afraid i have displeased her said celia but i could not help it if i had it to do over again i must say just the same thing in substance have you been running a tilt with her my pugnacious warrior asked philip glancing at his reflection in the mirror something like it i am afraid ah i thought as much when i was desired just now to talk upon some subject more agreeable than you i said i did not know any and departed doubly willing to do so as i found that she had the megrims i thought she looked poorly said celia compassionately philip indulged in a peal of laughter my sweet rustic innocence i thought i told you that megrims stood for pre letellier he is closeted with her ladyship assisting her to mourn over your lamentable departure from the faith and the mode i should not very much wonder if you were treated to a visit from his reverence oh dear said celia involuntarily he isnt such a formidable being said philip he used to confess me when i was about the height of that table and order me a certain quantity of sugarplums for penancei know it was two for squalling and four for stamping and kicking i lost my temper with tolerable frequency under that discipline patient sighed and shook her head slowly now how much wisdom lies in a shake of some peoples heads patient my dear creature you could not have conveyed your meaning half so well in words i am doubtful if you know my meaning mr philip know your meaning why it was written on your head in that shake did it not say philip ingram your education was awfully bad and you are what might be expected from it nay sir scarce that i was thinking rather of that word i am against the shepherds and yet more of that other word of john therefore shall her plagues come in one day for strong is the lord god who judgeth her spare me please exclaimed philip springing up you never quote from the revelation without a sermon after it urgent business requires my presence downstairs mrs celia ingram your servant and he shut the door laughing but the next minute he opened it again to say if pre letellier should take it into his head to come here send for me to keep you in countenance you will find the bear in its denpatient knows where but philip what do you expect people to do it was not the advent of pre letellier but his own want of occupation which to use philips elegant simile had drawn the bear out of its den pre letellier was gone some hours before and lady ingram had shut herself up desiring thrse to tell any one who asked for her that she had the vapors and could see nobody and philip thus thrown back on his own society or his sisters had selected the latter as the pleasanter of the two but what do you expect people to do was celias natural reply to philips remark that good people never did anything well my dear i can only say that if i were one of you good folks i could not live as you do if i believedreally honestly believedthat all the people or not all say onehalf say onetenth of the people around me in this city alone were going to perdition as fast as they could travel and that i knew of something which would save them if i could only persuade them to take itwhy my dear celia i could never sit quietly on this sofa i should want to go out instantly into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in it would be as cruel as helping oneself to an extra slice of plumcake in the presence of a starving wretch who had lived for a week on a handful of potatoparings philip i am sure you have been reading the bible you have quoted it several times lately i told you i had read it answered philip shortly mr philip said patient very gravely you have given me somewhat to meditate upon your words are very exercising we do scarce follow sufficiently that word consider your ways you are quite right sir more shame for us very well then you agree with me said philip well and here are all the good charitablydisposed catholics shutting themselves up in convents and telling their beads and all the good charitablydisposed protestants sitting on sofas reading their good books and mourning to each other over the wickedness of the world now is that really the best thing that either party can find to do mr philip i hope you dont mean to go to compare the poor blind souls of papists worshipping idols in those wicked monasteries with enlightened christian believers either in scotland or england objected patient with a shade of rising indignation in her tone i do not mean to say that the believers as you call them may not be doing more good to their own souls than the monks and nuns but if they sit still on their sofas what more good are they doing the world than the monks are is it not the same thing under another name are they helping to lessen by one grain the heap of wickedness they mourn over i am afraid you are right philip said celia thoughtfully that is just the failing of you good folks resumed he you hear of a poor family shockingly destitute and steeped in all manner of sin and wickedness and you say to each other isnt it dreadful you talk them overperhaps you pray them over but at the best you do anything but put on your hat and go and try to lift them out of the mire oh dear no they are far too dirty and disagreeable for your delicate fingers i am without as you know and on the principle that lookerson see most of the game those things show more plainly to us than to you look at the men in our prisons they are beyond you now but was there no time when they were not beyond you did they pass do you think in five minutes from little children saying the paternoster at their mothers knee to the hardened criminals to whom you would not dare to speak you should talk to colville he would put everything before you far better than i can a few days after this conversation celia made the acquaintance of her brothers solitary friend lady ingrams reception took place on the thursday subsequent and that lady who had not yet resumed her usual graciousness to celia nevertheless intimated her pleasure that her stepdaughter should be present as celia sat quietly in her corner moralizing to herself on the scene philips voice beside her said celia my dear allow me to introduce you mr colville mrs ingram mrs ingram mr colville celia lifted her eyes with much curiosity her first impression was that philips friend was a very thin long man with very light hair and eyes of the palest blue a stoop in the shoulders and a noticeable nose he and philip remained standing by her chair an interesting scene this observed mr colville in a deep hollow voice pleasant to see men and women enjoying themselves life is short and death certain let us be happy while we can after death the judgment the words came suddenly from celias lips and almost without her volition mr colville smiled condescendingly you are one of the oldfashioned thinkers he said i shall be happy to show you how mistaken such a notion is i always take a pleasure in disabusing young minds very generous of you said philipcelia was not sure whether seriously or ironically mistaken she exclaimed lifting her clear eyes to her opponents and thinking that her ears must have made some strange mistake tis a passage of scripture a fable madam returned mr colville coolly quite inconsistent with the character of god who is a perfect being and most injurious to the minds of men the soul i assure you is a mere quality of the body it has no substance yet is entirely material and perishes with the body of which it is a quality sir how can gods revelation be a fable was celias very grave reply and without that revelation what can we know of the character of god my dear madam replied mr colville with his pitying patronizing smile these are quite obsolete disproved notions there can be no such thing as revelation tis impossible and there are no means of any kind by which man can understand the character of god we know from nature that god is infinitely powerful and infinitely wise of his moral character we can have no idea except that he is a perfect being whatever therefore is inconsistent with perfection is inconsistent with god inconsistent with your notions of perfection you mean said philip doesnt it require a perfect creature to imagine perfection then pursued mr colville taking no notice of philip you suppose that all scripture is of divine original this is another mistake the gospel is of divine original and perhaps some portions of the old testament but the pentateuch was compiled by a most ignorant and unphilosophical man a repellent sanguinary lawgiverand the epistles are the product of heated brains paul was a cabalistic rabbi a delirious enthusiast peter a poor ignorant fisherman what could you expect from such persons entirely human madam these parts of scripture and you mr colville said celia warmly dare to sit thus in judgment upon god you presume to lay your human hand on different portions of his book and to say this is from god and this is from man sir at his bar you must one day stand and by that book you will have to be judged believe me i quite honor your warmth and kindly feelings youth is enthusiasticalgiven to heroworship tis a pity to set up for your hero a mere dead book but perhaps you misunderstand me i do not reject all scripture for the words and character of jesus i have great respect he was unquestionably a true philanthropist and an enlightened mana very excellent man but celia had risen and stood before him she forgot all about the lighted rooms and the crowds who might be watching and listening and no more she said in a voice of suppressed intensity more answered mr colville what could you wish me to say more mr colville your words complimentary as they might be if you were speaking of a man are but an insultan insult to him in whom is life and who is the brightness of the fathers glory i cannot bear them she would have passed on but colville detained her my dear madam you entirely mistake suffer me but to show you sir i shall speak with you no more he that biddeth you godspeed is the partaker of your evil deeds and celia made her way through the rooms and gained her own boudoir without another word to any one but she had not been there for five minutes before philip followed her upon my word celia said he laughing i had no idea what an amount of undeveloped soldiery there was under that quiet manner of yours you have fairly rendered colville speechlessa state of things i never saw before i beg to congratulate the successful general on the victory philip how can you like that odious man well my dear responded philip i am beginning rather to wonder at it myself he has become insipid latterly i used to think him a very ingenious fellow i am beginning to suspect that he is only a showy donkey he is an atheist said celia in a tone of horror scarce that my dear answered philip quietly he does believe in a sort of god but tis one of his own making will that deliver him in the day of the lords wrath asked celia in a low tone philip i hope i said nothing wrong i did not mean to speak uncourteously or unchristianly i hope i did not do it my dear little scrap of scrupulousness do you suppose that a soldier in the heat of battle says pray excuse me to the opposite man before he fires at him ah but the weapons of my warfare ought not to have been carnal st paul says speaking the truth in love i am afraid there was not much love in what i said tonight no dear celia the truth was so hot that it burnt it up said philip laughing dont make yourself miserable colville will hardly break his heart over it indeed i am not certain that he keeps one are you not coming down again well then goodnight on questioning her counsellor patient in a similar manner celia found her unable to see any error in her act perhaps the old fiery covenanter spirit was too strong in her to temper the words which she spoke that which to celia was merely carrying out the apostolic injunction be courteous was in patients eyes conferring with flesh and blood nay madam said she if paul himself could say if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed are we to mince our words and dress the truth to make it dainty to the world and the devil is it not written if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha you retired early last night said lady ingram to celia as she sipped her chocolate on the following afternoon you were tired i suppose no madam said celia honestly i was angry lady ingram gave her usual sign of surprise or perplexitya very slight elevation of her chiselled eyebrows with whom my dear with mr colville madam a very good family child said lady ingram gravely a younger branch it is true but still an old familyallied to the colvilles of bassingbourne they can trace their descent to the eleventh century madam mr colville and i were not disputing the length of our descent when you do my dear remember that you are of a still older family than he hubert de ingeramme went over to england with william the conqueror and before that his line had been seated at gournay and ingeramme from the days of rollo you must be careful to remember child that if there be no high titles in your house you are very ancient indeed and that after all is the real thing there are many families in france who are merely counts or barons in respect of title but whose lines are as old as the crown itself familles en velours rouge cramoisi that is what some call them and yours my dear is a crimson velvet family pray dont allow any one to dispute that i am not in the least likely madam was celias amused reply that is right my child resumed lady ingram condescendingly i am rejoiced to see that you appreciate the importance of the subject by the way has philip told you that he has received a commission from his majesty yes madam said philips sister sighing my dear answered his mother there is nothing to sigh about tis high honor to receive a commission from king james the troops i learn march for landrcies on the thnext monday and are to oppose prince eugene there about the th of next month i propose therefore to travel to landrcies where i shall take apartmentssmall and inconvenient i fear they will be but i suppose you can put up with that and then philip can come and see us from time to time while the troops are there and i shall be able to see that he powders his hair properly and does not neglect the tying of his cravats twould never do that an ingram should be unmodish even in battle only think if he were to go into action in a steenkirk i should never forgive myself and he is far too careless in that respect i can put up with anything that you can madam said celia answering only one clause of her stepmothers speech very good my dear then order patient to be ready is patient to go madam my dear said lady ingram do you think i mean to travel like a bourgeoise of course patient will go and be careful that you do not take too few gowns with you i have to spur you my rligieuse or i really think you would scarce know the difference between silk and camlet what a pity you were not born a catholic i will give the orders to patient myself that will be best she is little better than you in such matters i suppose in her case it arises from her being a scotchwoman and of no family but how it ever came to be the case with you an ingram of ingram i really cannot understand those things generally run in the blood it must be the people who brought you up they did not look as if they knew anything you think so much about family madam said celia stung in the affections by this contemptuous notice of her dearest friends pardon me for telling you that the passmores have dwelt at ashcliffe for eight hundred years my dear you astonish me said lady ingram with a faint glimmer of interest then they really are respectable people i assure you i am quite rejoiced to hear it i did think there was something a little superior in the manner of the eldest daughtersomething of repose but you english are oddso different from other people eight hundred years did you say that is quite interesting and lady ingram dropped another lump of sugar languidly into her cup of chocolate repose thought celia truly in isabellas manners there was repose enough but it had never occurred to the simple passmores to regard it as enviable on the contrary they called it idleness in plain saxon and urged her by all means to get rid of it quite interesting repeated lady ingram stirring up the sugar in a slow deliberate style which isabella would have admired really i did not know that the passmores were a respectable family i thought they were quite nobodies jonah iv cor ii matt vii john vi john x sarah duchess of marlborough once called on a lawyer who happened to be from home i dont

than a tie is said to have taken its rise from the duke of monmouths going hastily into action at the battle of steenkirk with his cravat twisted out of his way in this manner it was quite out of fashion in except among country people xi how philip came back the hour we see not when upsurging full our cup shall outflow god is merciful disengaged madam i have just half an hour to spend with you positively the last time before i don my regimentals and then hurrah for landrcies o ned i wonder where you are i wish you would come back do you travel with us philip no thank you madam that would be rather too spicy you go with your regiment i have that honor mr philip said patient as she noiselessly entered i have done your packing and what a darling of a covenanter you are to take that off my hands and i have put a little bible sir along with your linen will you please to promise me mr philip to read it dear patient answered philip letting his lightness slip from him like a cloak i will read it i have read it so much lately that i should feel almost lost without it i assure you have you done aught but read it mr philip asked patient earnestly as how queried philip sir i can conceive of none so awfully far off god and good as he that handles the bread of life but never eateth of it he that standeth just outside the gate of the fold and never entereth therein have you felt it mr philip have you believed it have you prayed over it there was no lightness about philips tone or manner as he answered i think patient i have but patient was not satisfied yet mr philip my bairn said she i do think that what you do youll do thoroughlynot half and half i think you will know whether you do mean to follow the lord or not but tis one thing to mean to go and another to set out on your journey tis one thing to think you can leave all without trying and another to leave all and im no so sure my dear bairn whether you ken your own self and whether you can leave all and follow him tis rougher walking in the narrow way than on the broad road it takes sore riving to get through the gate with some can you hold on can you set the lord always before you above all the jeering and scoffing all the coldness and neglect of the world for until the lord is more to you than any in this world youll scarce be leaving all and following him dont be deceiveddont be deceived and oh laddie dear dinna deceive your ainsel my dear old friend said philip looking up lovingly into patients face i will tell you the honest truth about myself celia do you remember what i said to you the first time that i saw you celia remembered that well it had pained her too much to be lightly forgotten well that has all passed away i believe that there is a god and that the bible is his revelation to man colvilles philosophy merely disgusts me now i must say for him though that he was talking unusual nonsense the other night he generally has something better to say than that well then i believe if i know what believing means in jesus christ perhaps i dont know what believing means i shall not feel astonished if you tell me so i believe that he died to save sinners that is instead of sinners but instead of what sinners i dont quite know for i cannot help seeing that while all mankind are sinners there is one class of sinners called saints who are quite different from the rest my puzzle at present is what makes the difference we all believe that christ died for sinners yet it seems to be only some of us that get any good from it if you can explain this to me do so i must go back to eternity to explain that said patient sir ages back ere the world had a beginning the lord god who alone was in the beginning father son and spirit covenanted the redemption of man certain persons whose names were written in the book of life were given of the father to the son unto whom and to none other the benefits of his redemption were to be applied no man quoth our lord can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and also all that the father giveth me shall come to me therefore stop stop cried philip let me take all that in before you go on to secondly do you mean to say patient that god the loving and merciful god who says he wills not the death of any sinner selected a mere handful of men whom he chose to save and deliberately left all the rest to perish was that love was that like god sir we can only know from the word what is or is not like god he ruleth over all and who shall say unto him what doest thou and when all were sunk in sin and he might justly have left all to perish shall we quarrel with him because he in his sovereign grace and electing love decided to whom the merit of his work the free gift of god should be applied that is covenanting doctrine i suppose said philip dryly celia saw breakers ahead dear patient she said very gently are you not trying to feed philip with rather too strong meat remember what our lord said to his disciples i have many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now speak you then madam celia said patient i have but one speech oh you good folks dont always agree observed philip as if he had made a discovery we quite agree answered celia i believe just what patient does but i dont think it is suited for you she is trying to make you spell words of three syllables before you can say your alphabet perfectly and i think it will be better to help you over the alphabet first dear philip those whom christ saves are those whom he makes willing to accept his salvation are you willing go your own way madam said patient in a dissatisfied tone go your own way but dont account me in agreement with the teaching of arminius my dear patient i know nothing about arminiusneither who he is nor what he teaches replied celia simply does not god make his elect willing to accept his salvation surely madam surely answered patient a little mollified but you spake of will madam now i never can accept the freewill views of that heretic arminius fire away patient cried philip from the sofa i will lay five pounds on you well really i am rejoiced to find that the saints can quarrel like sinners it makes a fellow feel himself less of an isolation this was exactly the sentiment which celia was most unwilling to foster in philips mind she paused a moment and sent up a prayer for wisdom before she spoke again dear philip the saints after all are only a few of the sinners patient and i are both human therefore open to sin and error dont take what we say either of us take what god says he cannot mistake and we may patient you will not disagree with me in this not a whit madam and i ask your pardon if i spake unadvisedly with my tongue and if i did responded celia softly least of all should we do it on such a subject as this you did not answered philip it was the old bird that was the fighting cock well dear philip said celia turning to her brother this is the great question for you and me are we willing to accept christs work and to place no reliance upon our own works he will be all or nothing we cannot save ourselves either wholly or in part our salvation is either done or to do and if it be yet to do it can never be accomplished then what place do you find for good works in your system no place as the efforts of the slave to set himself free every place as the endeavor of the child to show his love to the reconciled father well said philip reflectively i found long ago that your view was the soil which grew the finest crop of them dont look at me so patient let me talk as i think it is natural to my mind to express itself as i do i dont mean anything wrong the lord will have that out of you mr philip if you be his well replied philip gravely i suppose he knows how ay he knows how answered patient sadly but dont you give him more work in that way than you can help sir the surgeons knife may be very necessary but it never can be otherwise than painful celia did not quite agree with patient here but it was a secondary point and she said nothing philip looked at his watch and declaring that he could not stay another minute kissed celia and patient saying a landrcies as he left the room i see a long weary walk for mr philip madam remarked patient when he was gone if he be to reach the good city at all twill sure be by a path of much affliction celia was rather disposed to think the same lady ingrams expectation that she would be able to procure only small rooms at landrcies was verified the apartments to be obtained were both small and few lady ingram and celia occupied the same bedchamber until this happened celia had no idea what a very artificial flower her handsome stately stepmother really was she now found that the fourth part of her hair and nearly threefourths of her bloom were imparted every morning lady ingram sat for two hours under the hands of thrse who powdered her hair rouged her cheeks applied pearlpowder to her forehead tweezers to her eyebrows and paint to her neck fixing in also sundry false curls my lady asked patient in her quietest manner the first evening at landrcies which was the th of july if the prince eugene take us prisoners what will become of us if you please prisoners repeated lady ingram absurd patient you speak as if you thought a defeat possible the armies of the grand monarque and those of king james together to be routed by one savoyard preposterous they were put to flight at malplaquet madam which place patient pronounced to rhyme with jacket and tis not so many days since the prince took le quesnoy patient irvine you are no better than a fool said lady ingram turning round to give effect to her sentence very like madam was the mild reply of patient who was employed in giving the last fold to her young ladys dress indeed tis but the act of a fool to reason beforehand the lord will dispose matters celia i shall find you another attendant now that you can speak french and send patient back to her sewing does she speak in this canting way to you pray dont was celias alarmed reply to the first part of lady ingrams remark no more than i do to her madam she answered to the second i see said lady ingram sarcastically a nice choice of an attendant i made for you it was unavoidable at first since she was the only woman in my house except thrse who could speak english but i ought to have changed her afterwards i might have known how it would be when we return to paris i will provide you with a french woman you will do the lords will madam observed patient calmly i will do my own cried lady ingram more angrily than was her wont madam was patients answer the lords will will be done and in one sense whether you choose it or not you will have to do it leave the room you are a canting hypocrite commanded her mistress in no dulcet tones yes my lady answered patient meekly and obeyed now if that woman had had the least spirit she would have answered me again a little more rouge here thrse and lady ingram settled herself peacefully to her powderings leaving celia in a state very far from peace she felt indeed extremely rebellious cannot i have my own choice in this matter she thought to herself am i never to have my own way must i be forever the slave of this woman who is neither my own mother nor one of the lords people shall i calmly let her take from me my only friend and counsellor no i will go back to ashcliffe first and if i break with lady ingram altogether what matters it but the next minute came other thoughts patient had told her words of her grandfathers which she remembereda soldier hath no right to change his position and how could she put such an occasion to fall in her brothers way perhaps the lord was drying up all the wells in order to drive her closer to the one perennial fountain ah poor caged bird beating against the cage she little knew either how near she was to freedom nor by what means god would give it to her the st of july dawned lady ingram had risen a little earlier than usual for she expected to see philip and had been grumbling all the previous evening at his nonappearance he came in dressed in full regimentals about eleven oclock when his mother had been down for about an hour and celia for several hours goodmorning and goodbye in one he said speaking hastily and to both at once i have but ten minutes to stay marshal villars has found a weak place in prince eugenes intrenchments at denain and he is going to draw his attention by an attack this morning on the landrcies side while we come up the other way and storm denain this afternoon villars himself will be with us bentinck defends denain with seventeen battalions and fourteen squadrons mostly dutch by the way le marais has heard that ned is in camp but i have not come across him you are sure to see him before long if he be here philip said his mother suddenly the tie of your cravat is quite a quarter of an inch on one side a quarter of a fiddlestick my dear mother said philip laughing what do you think it will look like when i have been an hour in action i hope they will let me head a charge i expect to be made a prince of the empire at the very least goodbye mother adieu my son responded lady ingram a little less languidly than usual dont go into danger philip what admirable advice to an officer of his majestys army returned philip kissing her goodbye little celia i have something to tell you when i come back celia looked up from philips kiss into his eyes to see what it was they were deeper and softer than usual but she read nothing there goodbye dear philip god keep you she said and youboth replied philip in a softened tone adieu and he was gone all that day celia could do nothing she wondered to see lady ingram sit quietly knotting as if the day of the battle of denain were no more to her than other days but the day passed like other days they dined and drank chocolate and the dusk came on and lady ingram ceased knotting she had been out of the room a few minutes when patient put her head in at the door madam she said in her quiet unmoved voice sir edward is below and a strange gentleman with him will you speak with him while i find my lady celia rose and went down into the diningroom very curious to make the acquaintance of her unknown brother but it was not the unknown brother upon whom her eyes first fell she saw merely that he was therea tall dark gravelooking man but beside him stood a fairhaired man a little older than himself and with a cry of harry dear dear harry celia flew to him harrys greeting was quite as warm as celias but graver who has won was her first question she wondered afterwards that it should have been so the allies answered harry quietly i am sir edwards prisoner a prisoner whom i yield to my sister to be disposed of at her pleasure said edward coming forward and celia turning from harry greeted and thanked the real brother cordially though a little shyly have you seen philip she asked of both her apprehensions were beginning to subside we rarely know the supreme moments of our lives till they are past we open laughing the letter which contains awful tidings we look up brightly to see the unclosing of the door which lets in on us such disabling news we ever after have been graver it was with a lightened heart and almost a smile that celia asked if her brothers as she considered both had seen philip and full of apprehension as her heart had been all day she did not guess the answer from the dead silence that ensued harry was the first to speak and he addressed himself to sir edward you or i was his enigmatical question you answered edward shortly celia darling began harry looking back at her with deep compassion in his eyes and he got no further and then she knew o philip philip broke in a bitter wail from the lips of the sister who had learned to love philip so much are you sure have you seen him she asked turning first to harry and then to edward hoping against hope that there might be some mistake i have seen him replied edward and her hope died away celia resumed edward listen dear sister i have seen philip there can be no mistake on that score he will be brought here soon but i have seen also something else for which knowing him as i do i thank god so much that as yet i have hardly begun to grieve at all he lies just where he fell at the head of his troops after one of the finest and bravest charges that i ever witnessed in my life his face turned to god and the foe but this lay close to his heart look at it celia took from her brothers hand the little book which he held out to her she saw at once that it was a testament but the leaves were glued together with a terrible red at which celia shuddered as she tried to open them the first leaf was edwards direction she recognized philips wellknown hand as she turned to it at the head of the flyleaf lady ingrams name and address were faintly pencilled and below were a few lines in darker and fresher lead celia dashed the intrusive tears from her eyes before she could read them wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them lord i believe help thou mine unbelief the little book trembled in celias hand and she broke into a fresh shower of uncontrollable weeping her companions allowed her to indulge her sorrow for a few moments in silence then edward said gently who shall tell his mother i will she answered ceasing her tears by a violent effort and she left the room and went upstairs at once lady ingram was seated at her knotting where have you been she asked without looking at her stepdaughter for just then the knotting was at a difficult point and required all her attention instead of answering celia knelt down by her and uttered one worda word she had never used to her before mother lady ingram dropped her work and looked into celias face my dear she said her voice slightly trembling you have bad news to tell me at once if you pleasei do not like things broken gradually at once celia told her philip is killed with a wild shriek which rang through the house philips mother flung up her armsas celia remembered that once before in her life claude de lorient had doneand then fell back heavily and silently in her chair celia ignorant and terrified threw open the door and called for patient and thrse they came in together the former quiet and practical the latter screaming and wringing her hands eh my faith madam is dead shrieked thrse tis but a dwawm madam was the decision of patient please to open the window thrsa cut her ladyships lace whilst i fetch her water but my dear friend remonstrated thrse with an invocation in addition that will spoil her figure go downstairs and fetch a glass of water said patient with a spice of scorn thats all you are fit for madam will you please to hold her ladyships head while i get at her lace and cut it patients remedies applied lady ingram partly recovered herself in a few minutes edward was by her side when she again opened her eyes they rested for an instant on him and on celia and closed again with a long tremulous sigh which seemed to come from her heart if you will please to give me orders madam said patient quietly to celia i think her ladyship will be best in her bed and she scarce seems knowledgeable to give orders herself will i and thrsa lay her there celia spoke to lady ingram but received no answer and she gave patient the order so patient and thrse undressed the still figure and laid her to rest lady ingram continued to sleep or swoon whichever it were she seemed occasionally sensible to pain but not to sound nor did she appear to know who was about her about ten oclock celia seated at her stepmothers bedside heard a regular tramp of soldiers feet below and knew too well what they must be bringing a few minutes afterwards her brother softly entered the room celia they have brought philip here will you come and see him she hesitated a minute half for lady ingram and half for herself there is nothing painful or shocking dear i would not ask you if there were would you like to see him again or not celia rose and gave edward her hand he led her silently down to the diningroom leaving her to go in the first by herself and kneel beside the still white clay which only five hours earlier had been philip ingram ah if she only could have known what might she not have said to him had she said enough had she done her dutyher utmost had she pressed christ and his salvation on him as she ought to have done where was philip now oh that had how sad a passage tis oh that might have been how much sadder edward and harry came in and stood by her can either of you tell me anything more she faltered her eyes riveted on the calm fixed white face which would never tell anything more to her i can answered harry passmore softly i heard his last words o harry tell me pleaded celia i was stationed just opposite he said and it was my regiment that received the charge a shot killed the horse of the officer in command and he too fell i knew not whether he had received injury himself and i was so much struck by his youth and bravery that i pressed forward to aid him but as soon as i saw his face i found that the shot had struck more than the horse at this moment my adjutant spoke to me calling me colonel passmore when he heard that he saith from where he lay are you harry passmore of ashcliffe yes i said wondering that he could know me you are celias brother then quoth he with the ghost of a smile and so am i take this to her the address is on the flyleaf i was so amazed that i could but utter are you philip ingram i am he saith his breathing now very quick and short tell my mother gently take care of celia his voice now failed him and i bent my head close that i might hear anything more i heard only as if he whispered to himself the uttermost then came a long sobbing sigh and then all was over god forbid that we should limit that uttermost murmured edward softly o edward sobbed his sister do you think he is safe my sister he replied very gently can i tell you more than god does to the uttermost and he that believeth but if you had known philip as i knew him you would feel with me that something must have happened to him which had made an immense difference between what he was and is i cannot think that something anything short of the redeeming love of christ god knows dear what are the boundaries of his uttermost i can scarce think they are closer than our uttermosts yet outside the fold is outside said celia falteringly i did not mean for one moment to deny that said he i expressed myself ill if you thought so but we are toldaccording to your faith be it unto you and of what may come from faith as a grain of mustardseed and it seems to me that the words on that leaf had never been penned by such a hand as philips unless his faith were at least equal to a grain of mustardseed remember dear heart that in his hand who will not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax are the keys of death and of hell i can trust him to do right even to the brother i loved so well lady ingram returned to consciousness on the following day but thrse reported that she was very weak and low and desired to see no one but herself on the sunday morning she suddenly sent for celia and edward they found her lying propped up by pillows her eyes sunk and heavy and her face very pale she recognized her stepchildren with a faint smile come and kiss me edward she said in a low soft voice i have scarce seen you yet and celia too you loved him both of you now listen to me and i will tell you what i shall do as soon as my health and strength admit i shall take the veil at the convent of sainte marie de chaillot i have no more to live for you are both old enough to take care of yourselves and after all life in this world is not everything i shall make my retreat and after some years of penance and prayer i trust i shall have grace to make my conversion you edwarddo you propose to remain in the army i do not think i shall mother you will keep up your estates i should prefer living in england and celia what will you do my dear i shall go back to ashcliffe if nobody want me if edward wish me to live with him i will willingly do so especially in england but even then i should like to pay a long visit to ashcliffe before settling anywhere else i should be very happy to have you with me dear said edward quietly to this but i do not wish to be any tie to you there is no necessity for your living with me for i am about to marry so pray do which you prefer whom are you about to marry edward asked lady ingram turning to him with a look of some interest in her languid eyes none whom you know mother one with whom i met on my travels i am glad you are marrying she said and how is celia to return to ashcliffe oh with harry replied celia quickly he is not at liberty yet observed edward gravely but you will set him free to go with me entreated his sister i have nothing to do with it you will i suppose i make you a present of my prisoner oh thank you if harrys liberty depends on me he shall have it directly edward said lady ingram i have a favor to ask from you name it and take it mother will you see that a small pension is settled on thrse and should she wish to continue in her present position interest yourself in obtaining for her another situation i will attend to her interests as honestly and thoroughly as i think you would yourself i do not recommend patient to you since she is already rather your servant than mine and you will be careful of her i know celia has a great liking for her i dare say she will wish to take her to england do you object to that madam asked celia not in the least replied lady ingram do you continued celia this time addressing edward for a time certainly not i should not like to part with her altogether but on the other hand i should not allow you to travel to england without a woman in your company patient shall go with you and after my marriage let her return to me wherever i may resolve to dwell thank you you will write to me then i will come to you if you are willing to receive me we have seen very little of each other yet very little said celia rather sadly now my children leave me requested lady ingram faintly i am too weak to converse much send patient to me ten days later saw them journeying in company by easy stages to paris and ten days after that witnessed a solemn ceremony in the convent chapel of sainte marie de chaillot at which queen maria beatrice madame de maintenon and a brilliant crowd of distinguished persons were present when claude ingram took upon herself the white veil of a postulant edward and celia were there the latter with a slight misgiving whether she were not sanctioning idolatry to some extent even by her appearance a suspicion not laid to rest by the manifest disapproval and uncompromising speeches of patient can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned asked she but celia was determined to see the last of lady ingram and edward promised to lead her out before anything objectionable began to her it was an inexpressibly mournful ceremony the different stages of the ritesthe shearing off of the glossy hair the taking of the vows the white veil of the postulantall seemed to her as so many epitaphs on the grave of a living woman when the brother and sister went down to the guestchamber to take leave of the novice celia was sobbing hysterically lady ingram parted from both with a very warm embrace she appeared much softened farewell my child she said to celia and you will not live always in england you will come and see me at least once more and when you pray to god in your prches do not quite forget soeur marie anglique celia turned from the conventgate with a sadder heart than she ever thought she could have felt at her parting from claude ingram only for three days longer did she remain in paris the house was very painful to her now in everything philip lived again for her and she became very anxious to get home to ashcliffe of the warmth and cordiality of her reception there it never occurred to her to doubt so on the th of august celia harry

in with another well sure thats main heavy said she if you please sir is there aught by the post from master harry she added with a courtesy nothing cicely nothing said the squire looking up from his newspaper i dont know what has come to the lad he did scribble one line to let us know that he was not killed but not a word have we had from him since mayhap hes acoming suggested cicely i wish he were sighed madam passmore a merry laugh outside announced somebody and the door sprang open to the united attacks of pero and lucy anything from harry was her question too and she received the same answer and anything from harry asked charley sauntering in with his hands in his pockets these are done cicely said madam passmore take them hence and fetch another tray and bid dolly if any should come on such a wet day to have a care that she brings them not hither but into the drawingroomunless of course it were harry she added in a doubtful tone oh dear mother exclaimed isabella who had gone to the window here is a coach coming up but now lucy was at the window in a second well who is coming out she soliloquized an old womanat least noshes not old but shes older than i am you dont say so commented charley incredulously have done charleyand the fattest little yellow dogoh such a funny oneandwhy tis harry and celia celia herself an announcement which sent the whole family to the door at different paces lucy heading them celia felt herself obliged to greet everybody at once lucy was clinging to her on one side and charley on the other madam passmore was before her and the squire and isabella met her at the parlordoor i am fain to see thee once more child was the squires greeting but what a crinkumcrankum that woman has made of thee she looks quite elegant said isabella kissing her with a little less languor than usual dont tease her charley she is very tired said harry when he could get in a word we have had a long stage today so celia was established in an enormous easychair and propped up with cushions until she laughingly declared that she would require all the united strength of the family to help her out again and lucy was busy attempting to divest her of her outdoor apparel without having the least idea how to do it shall i take your hat and cloak upstairs madam said patient entering with a general courtesy celia what have you done with your yellow dog o dear cried celia in a tone of distress i was so taken up with you that i forgot her where is he patient tis asniffling and asnuffling about madam said patient call her replied celia dog summoned patientfor patient scorned to pollute her lips with the heathen name which it had pleased lady ingram to bestow upon her pet but venus was accustomed to the generic epithet from patient and came trotting up at her call patient shut the little animal in and herself out venus waddled slowly up the room sniffing at every member of the family in turn until she came to celia at whom she wagged her curly tail and half her fat body and coiled herself in peace upon a hassock at her feet celia asked the squire did you search all paris or offer a reward for the ugliest dog that could be brought you by no means father the dog is a bequest from my stepmother it was her special pet and i have not the conscience to discard it if i had the heart is she dead my dear i see you are in black for some person asked madam passmore the glad light died out of celias eyes and her voice sank to a low saddened tone no mother she has taken the veil at chaillot i am in black for philipmy brother philipwho died at denain are you then come to us for good my dear asked madam passmore tenderly for good mother if you will have me and i think you will only that i have promised to see my stepmother again but my visit to her cannot last above a day and will not be for some time to come have thee my dear child murmured madam passmore as if the reverse were the most preposterous notion of which she had ever heard do widows make nuns of themselves asked charley i thought they were always girls and that they walled them up alive when they had done with them and your woman my dear i want to plead with you for her mother she has been the best friend i have hadexcept philip and she is but lent to me for a time she was my brother edwards nurse and when he wants her again he will come and fetch her i thought you not mind my bringing her with me what should i mind my dear if you have found her a true and faithful waitingwoman and love her let her by all means abide with you and serve you such are not to be picked up everywhere my dear asked the squire uneasily i hope they have not made a tory of you celia i dont know really father was the answer i scarce think there is much difference between whigs and tories they all seem to me devoid of honesty the squire looked horrorstruck nobody has made a papist of me if that be any consolation to you i return as true a protestant as i went is this woman a tory gasped the squire patient no father replied celia smiling she is a little on the other side of you she calls oliver cromwell his highness the lord protector and wont allow that king charles was a martyr celia child thou hast been in ill company solemnly pronounced the squire i was afraid you would think so but i thought i was bound to obey my stepmother in all things not wrong surely child surely assented madam passmore therefore fatheri hope you will forgive me but i cannot in honesty keep it from youi did not refuse her wish that i should be presented to queen mary the squire gasped for breath presented was the only word he could utter i was afraid that it would vex you when you came to know dear father said celia very gently but you see i was placed in such a position that i could not help vexing either you or my stepmother and i thought that perchance i ought to obey that one in whose charge i was at the time i did not like to go i assure you but i wished to do right do you think i did wrong father now john said madam passmore before the squire could speak i wont have the child teased and made unhappy in particular when she has only just come home she meant to do right and she did right as far as she knew you must pocket your politics for once well well child confessed the squire at last we none of us do right at all times i reckon and thou art a good child in the main and i forgive thee i suppose there may be a few tories who will manage to get into heaven i hope so replied celia gravely so do i childso do i though i am a crusty old whig at the best of times but i do think they will have to leave their toryism on this side when celia went upstairs to give a longer and fuller greeting to old cicely aggett than she had the opportunity of doing before she heard the unusual sound of voices proceeding from cicelys little room she soon found that cicely and patient were in close converse on a point of theology and paused a moment not wishing to interrupt them well truly i bent so much troubled with pride as some other things cicely was saying you see mrs patient i hasnt got nothing to be proud of thats where it is if i was a wellfavored young damsel with five hundred pounds in my pocket and a silk gown and a coach for to ride in well i dare say i should be as stuckup as a peacock but whatever has an old sinner like me to be proud of why im always doing somewhat wrong all day long i am afraid i am a greater sinner than you mrs cicely said patient irvines quiet voice in answer you have nothing to be proud of and you are not proud i have nothing to be proud of and i am well surely a white devil is the worst devil responded cicely aye he is so answered patient if he was meek and lowly in heart which did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth what should we be who are for ever sinning i tell you mrs cicely some of the worst bouts of pride that ever i had have been just the minute after i had been humbling myself before the lord depend upon it there is no prouder man in all the world than the man who is proud of his humility there was no audible answer from cicely celia came softly forward eh my dear cried old cicely looking up at her i am so fain to see you back as never was sit ye down a bit mrs celia dear heart and tell me how it has gone with you this long time very well dear cicely as concerns the lords dealings with me and very ill as concerns my dealings with him thats a right good saying my dear ah the good between him and us is certain sure to be all on his side we are cruel bad all on us and did you like well sweetheart that she did not said patient when celia hesitated she has not had a bit of her own way since she left you celia laughed and then grew serious my own way is bad for me patient i never knew one for whom it was not madam except the few who were so gracious that the lords way was their way well id lief be like that said cicely the king couldnt be no better off than so so would i celia began but i am afraid that if i say the truth it will be to add in everything but one now my dear young lady said patient turning to her dont you go to grieve in this way for mr philip as you have been doing ever since i had no thought till then how he had twined himself round either your heart or mine do you think my bairn that the lord who laid down his life for him loved him so much less than we o patient if it were only my loss whose then madam i mean said celia explanatorily if i could be sure that it was his gain patient did not reply for a moment i ask your pardon madam she said at length i did not know the direction in which your fears were travelling the less perhaps that i had none to join them i am surprised to hear you patient said celia only the last time that we saw him before he bade us adieu you seemed to feel so doubtful about him that was not the last time that i saw him madam the next morn ere he set out i heard him conversing with mr colville they were on the stairs and i was disposing of your linen above now i knew that all his life long the one thing which mr philip could not bear was scorn it was the thing whereof i was doubtful if he would not stand ill and in time of temptation fall away and that morn i heard mr colville speaking to him in a way which three months earlier would have sent his blood up beyond anything i could namegibing and mocking and flouting taunting him with listening to a parcel of old womens stories and not being man enough to disbelieve and the likederiding him yea making him a very laughingstock and mr philip stood his ground john knox himself could have been no firmer he listened without a word till mr colville had ended and then he said as quietly and gently as you could yourself madamfarewell colville saith he we have been friends but all is over now betwixt you and me i will be the friend of no man who is the enemy of christ he is more to me than you areyes more than all the world madam do you think i could hear that and dare to dispute the salvation of a man who could set christ above all the world now you understand why i had no fear for mr philip he never said so much as that to me replied celia with her eyes moist and glistening he would have done so presently madam but patient it was so short a time after he had spoken so differently ah madam doth that offend you the lord can ripen his fruit very fast when he sees good and hath more ways than one to do it he knew that mr philips time was short we can scarce tell how sweetly and surely he can carry the lambs in his bosom until we have been borne there with them the next morning isabella brought forward her embroideryframe occupied just now by a brilliant worsted parrot and a couple of gorgeous peacocks the former seated on a branch full of angles the latter strutting about on a brown ground the most important shade in the parrots very showy tail was still wanting have you any work for me mother asked celia i do not wish to sit idle i can find you some my dear here is a set of handkerchiefs and some cravats for father which all want hemming and i have been obliged to work at them myself till now lucy scarce does well enough and bell is too busy with yonder birds i will relieve you of those mother and celia took the basket and established herself near the window mr john rowe to speak with madam was dollys announcement directly afterwards and madam passmore left the room charley and lucy were learning their lessons in other words charley was sitting with his neid and the lexicon open on the table before him bestowing his attention on everything in the room except those two volumes while lucy seated at the window on a hassock was behaving in much the same way to a slate what a constant plague that man is said isabella as she sorted her wools there is no doing anything for him i do believe he has been here every day for the last fortnight oh i say commented charley take that cum grano salis celia i think he has been three times dont dispute with bell charley it doesnt signify my dear he wont dispute with me observed isabella calmly selecting different shades of scarlet i never disputeit is too much trouble takes my attention from my work she went on comparing her scarlets and charley on receiving this rebuke buried himself for five minutes in the adventures of neas for a time all was silence except for the slight sound of celias needle and lucys slatepencil where is father inquired madam passmore coming into the room with a rather troubled look charley was up in a second he is in the stable i saw him go shall i run and fetch him ask him to come to me in the diningroom and both charley and his mother disappeared what is the matter now asked lucy but as nobody answered her she went back to her arithmetic in about half an hour more madam passmore entered looking grave and thoughtful isabella my child she said i have something to tell thee isabella looked up for a moment and then went back to her wools well mother she queried carelessly my dear i will not disguise from thee that john rowes visit concerneth thee he hath asked leave of thy father and me in order to his becoming thy servant now dear child neither i nor thy father desire to control thy choice thou shalt speak for thyself what sayest thou wilt thou marry john rowe or not my dear mother responded isabella still busy with the wools he will come to the wedding in a blue coat and a lilac waistcoat and lavender smallclothes i dare say if thou art so particular that he will dress in what color thou wouldst said madam passmore smiling but what is thy mind child dost thou like him i dont care anything about him but i cannot abide his suits returned the young lady comparing the skeins mother isnt asking you to marry his clothes bell exclaimed charley my dear i am not asking her to marry him said madam passmore i only wish to know her mind about it if thou dost not care about him child i suppose thou wilt wish us to refuse his addresses no i dont say that exactly replied isabella undoing one of her two skeins then what dost thou wish my dear inquired madam passmore looking rather puzzled oh do wait a minute till i settle this red said isabella i beg your pardon motheryes that will do dear tis quite a weight off my mind now then for this other matter child the other matter imports rather to thee surely than the colors of thy worsteds i am sure it does not mother asking your pardon i have been all the morning over these reds well as to john rowe i dont much mind marrying him if he will let me choose his suits and give me two hundred pounds a year pinmoney and keep me a coachandpair and take me up to london at least once in ten years i dont think of anything else please to ask him dont much mind repeated her mother looking dissatisfied and perplexed bell dear child i fear thou dost not apprehend the import of that thou dost tis a choice for thy whole life child do think upon it and leave thy worsteds alone for a while if you want a downright answer mother you shall have it returned isabella with the air of one ending an unpleasant interruption i will marry john rowe if he will keep me a coachandpair and give me two hundred a year pinmoney and take me to londonsay once every four yearsi may as well do it thoroughly while i am about itand of course let me drive in the ring and go to ranelagh and vauxhall and see the lions in the tower and go to st jamess and all on in that way there now that is settled madam passmore looked scarcely more satisfied than before but she said well my dear if that be thy wish thou hadst better go and speak with john rowe and let him know thy conditions o mother with all these worsteds on my lap deprecated isabella raising her eyebrows put them here bell interposed celia holding her apron isabella reluctantly disposed her worsteds and rose i wish john rowe were far enough she said as she left the room dear dear child murmured madam passmore looking doubtfully after her daughter she is very like my stepmother said celia quietly she reminds me of her many a time now then said isabella triumphantly reentering i have sent him away and told him he must not come teasing when i am busy when i had just found the right shade of red look at this bracelet he has given mepretty is it not he has promised all i asked and to give me a black footman as well i shall not repent marrying him i can see is that happiness my dear isabella happiness replied bell stopping in her business of transferring the wools from celias apron to her own of course why there are not above half a dozen families in the country that have black servants i wonder at your asking such a question celia i say bell queried charley just before taking himself and virgil out of the room i wonder which of you two is going to say the obey in the service that boys impertinence really gets insufferable placidly observed isabella seating herself at the frame now to finish my parrots tail the wedding of john rowe and isabella passmore was celebrated in the following spring thanks to the brides taste and orders the bridegrooms attire was faultless the black footman proved so excessively black and rolled the whites of his eyes to such an extent that lucy declared she could not believe that he was no more than an ordinary man at the end of the summer the absentees returned to marcombe and isabella came over to ashcliffe in her carriage attended by her black ganymede in order to impress her relatives duly with a sense of her importance herself attired in a yellow silk brocade almost as stiff as cardboard with an embroidered black silk slip and gold ornaments in her powdered hair and once more celia was vividly reminded of lady ingram i am going to have the black baptized the young lady languidly remarked i shall call him othello suggested charley cassibelaunuso bell do call him cassibelaunus nonsense lucy i shall call him nero then he is a christian my dear asked her mother i dont think he knows anything about it replied his mistress with a short laugh but you know tis scarce decent to be attended by an unbaptized black and he will be a christian when tis done i am not so sure of that bell said madam passmore quietly it was the first time that madam passmore had been known to express any individual opinion upon religious subjects all baptized people are christians answered mrs john rowe a little more sharply than was respectful all baptized are called christians corrected her mother i scarce think bell that if thou hast left thy black completely untaught in matters of religion that pouring a little water on his face will cause him to become suddenly learned and whether it will suddenly cause anything else of a deeper nature may be to be questioned celia listened with the greater interest because the tone of madam passmores observations was alike unexpected and unprecedented but mother said isabella a little more deferentially as well as reverently the holy ghost is always given in baptism i was taught so my dear but i am come to feel unsure that gods word saith the holy ghost is always given in baptism and bell i am not sure that he was so given to all my children you mean me i suppose mother asked isabella returning to her former tone i fear so my child responded madam passmore so sadly and so tenderly that isabella could make no scornful answer i have feared indeed for months past that i have taught you all wrong god amend it indeed i hope he is himself teaching some of you but i did not mean thee only bell i have as much fear for all of you except celia and perhaps harry have we feared god child as a family hath there not been mere form and habit even in our devotions have we not shown much unevenness and walked unequally have we cared to serve or please him at all ah my children these are grave questions and i take bitter shame to myself to have lived as many years as i have and never thought of them god forgive youand me aye to be sure my dear said old cicely upstairs afterwards to be sure madam shes acoming home to the lord i see her reading the book at odd times like making a bit of a secret of it very soon after you went and by and bye a little afore you came back she came to make no secret of it and since then ive seen many a little thing as showed me plain where she was agoing and master harry my dear he reads the book toohe does for sure cant say nothing about master worse luck then miss lucy and master charley you see theyre young things as hasnt got no thought of nothing but as for mrs bell celia quite understood without another word o cicely she said many thoughts crowding on her mind surely i shall never distrust god again but you will madam said patient looking up from her work aye many and many a time tis a lesson trust me that neither you nor i have learned yet we are such poor scholars for ever forgetting that though this very lesson be gods ab ab for us we need many a rod to our backs ere we can spell it over aye madam youll not be out of school for a while yet celia asked madam passmore that evening when do you expect your brother my dear i dont know indeed mother replied celia i expected him ere now i know not what is keeping him surely he will be here before summer edward ingram was not at ashcliffe before summer the summer passed and he did not come the winter passed and he did not come nay the whole spring and summer and autumn and winter of another year passed and the third summer of was fading into autumnstill edward did not come but when the dusk was gathering on the th of august in that year a horseman galloped into ashcliffe village with news which he was carrying posthaste to tavistock and launcestonnews which blanched in my a cheek and set many a man looking to his aimswhich called forth muffled peals from the churchtowers and draped pulpits and pews in mourning and was received with sadness and alarm in wellnigh every english home for the one thread was snapped on which englands peace had hungthe one barrier standing between england and anarchy was broken the last stuart whom the nation acknowledged lay dead in kensington palace so long as queen anne lived the embers of discord had been only smouldering the jacobites felt a halfsatisfaction in the thought that the old line still held the sceptre the whigs rejoiced in their whig and protestant queen not that the private political views of the queen were very whiggish ones on the contrary granted one thingher own personal ruleshe was at heart a tory for all the years of her reign she had been growing more and more a tory she would never have abdicated the sceptre but very little indeed was wanted to make her say when the cold grasp of the angel of death was laid upon her let my brother succeed me such a speech would have given the jacobites immense vantageground for in the state was still the sovereign and la royne le veut was sterling yet in england this the partisans of the exiled family knew well and to their very utmost through their trusted agents of whom abigail lady masham was the chief they strove to induce the queen to utter such words her decease now was the signal for the division of the country into two sharplydefined parties the tories strove for king james triennial parliaments removal of popish disabilities peace with france free trade and repeal of the union with scotland the whigs battled as fiercely for king george septennial parliaments test and corporation acts war with france protection and centralization a dreadful struggle was expected between these two parties before george louis elector of hanover could seat himself on anne stuarts vacant throne his character and antecedents were much against him all who knew him personally were aware that he was a man of little intellect and less morality moreover from both demoralized parties there was a cry for money and hands were eagerly stretched out to the elector less for the purpose of welcoming him than for the hope of what he might put into them george louis gave not a stiver he had not many stivers to give but what he had he loved too well to part with them either to whigs or tories he sat quietly at hanover waiting for parliament to vote him supplies and for his disinterested supporters to secure his unopposed landing parliamentfrom a whig point of viewdid their duty and voted liberal aids within a week or two after the queens death james was up and doing at st germains while george slumbered in his armchair at herrenhausen at length on the th of september the gentleman of doubtful or rather undoubtful morals who was facetiously styled the hope of england condescended to land upon our shores he formed his cabinet allowed himself to be crowned dissolved parliament and leaving the country to take care of itself returned to silence and tumblers of hock the english people in the main were irreparably disgusted with the man of their choice they were ready to welcome the grandson of their queen of hearts elizabeth of bohemia but they looked for a royal prince a true stuart graceful and gracious and here was a little stupidlooking man who cared nothing about them and was a stranger alike to their language their customs their manners and their politics a new edition of charles iis vices deprived of all charles iis gracesthis was their chosen king neither celtic cornwall nor saxon lancashire could bear the disappointment west and north rose in insurrection there were riots throughout england and many a dissenting chapel was levelled by the mob the riot act was made perpetual the habeas corpus act suspended a price of was set upon the head of king jamess exiled son and his hanoverian majesty meeting his parliament on the st of september civilly requested the arrest of six tory members of the house of commons while all this was doing in england in a quiet corner of scotland a little cloud was rising which had increased to goodly proportions by the th of september when lord mar unfurled in braemar the standard of king james the third on the th of november were fought the battles of sheriffmuir and prestonpans and on the nd of december a little group of seven men landed at peterhead one of whom was the royal exile now generally known as the chevalier de st george on the th of january he reached the ancient palace of his forefathers at scone but by the th his cause was lost and he retreated on montrose whence on the th of february quitting his native land he returned to france the vengeance taken was terrible head after head fell upon the scaffold and the throne of the house of hanover was established only in a sea of blood on the evening of the th of march the family at ashcliffe were gathered in the parlor the squire was playing draughts with harry the ladies working and charley and lucy engaged in the mutual construction of an elaborate work of art seacoal any cheaper yet mother asked the squire not yet said madam passmore monstrous dear is it not inquired harry nothing to what it was in my young days answered his father forty or fifty years ago at the time of the dutch war charcoals went up to one hundred and ten shillings the chaldron and those were lucky who could get them even at that price was not that about the time of the great plague yestwo or three years later then you remember the plague father remember it said the squire leaning back in his chair and neglecting his draughts men dont forget such a thing as that in a hurry my lad aye i remember it but there was no plague here was there not just in this village but wellnigh all communication was stopped between tavistock and exeter and in the kings highway the grass was growing it was awful at tavistock the town was shut up and declared in a state of siege and none allowed to approach nearer than three miles watchmen were appointed the only men permitted to hold communication with the infected town and when any provisions were needed they made proclamation and the neighboring villages brought such things as they asked to the high ground above merrivale bridge where the cordon was drawn and how did they pay for their provisions a pitful of vinegar was dug there in some hole in dartmoor and the money dropped into it none in healthy places were allowed to touch money coming from infected places without that provision surely money could not carry the infection money aye or anything else you have scarce a notion how little would carry it harry lad throw another log on the fire tis mightily cold harry obeyed orders resumed his seat and the game between him and his father proceeded for a few minutes in silence hark cried madam passmore suddenly what was that i heard nothing said lucy what was it mother asked harry looking up some strange sound as if one were about on the terrace she answered in a suppressed voice there again i am sure i hear a footstep on the gravel charley rushed to the window and endeavored to see through the darkness tis as dark as pitch i can see nothing at all observed that young gentleman i will go out and see what it is said harry rising he took his sword from where it lay and left the room bowwowwowwowwow said venus running after him as her contribution to the family excitement harry opened the front door desiring charley to guard it till his return and venus after sniffing under it rushed out of the house with him barking loudly on the terrace in a state of great perturbation harry came back after an absence of twenty minutes during which the squire had several times wondered what on earth was keeping the boy all right he said laying down his sword there are no robbers about it has taken you a precious time to find it out growled his father harry sat down again to his game i walked round the terrace to make sure he said which you might have done in five minutes grumbled the squire again now then tis your move harry placed one of his three kings in dangerous proximity to his adversarys forces thank you sir said his father satirically capturing the imperilled potentate harry tried to retrieve himself and succeeded in placing the second king in the same position harry lad what has come to you asked the squire looking at him you were playing better than usual till just now but your walk round the terrace seems to have destroyed your skill i beg your pardon sir answered harry uncomfortably i will endeavor to play better and he carried out his attempt by placing in imminent peril his last remaining piece nay nay said his father leaning back in his chair tis no use going on lad did you see a ghost on the terrace i did not sir i assure you returned harry well i wonder what is the matter with you said the squire here lucy come and let me see if you can do any better lucy took her brothers vacated seat celia said harry a quarter of an hour afterwards turning to her would you mind bringing your needle and thread upstairs i want you to help me with something which i cannot well bring here oh yes harry i will come with you answered celia rethreading her needle and following harry out of the room with it in her hand harry led her upstairs motioned her into her own room and much to her surprise locked the door and pocketed the key harry something is the matter she said something is the matter celia repeated harry i have brought you here to tell it you what did you see on the terrace she asked fearfully sir edward ingram was the answer harry where is he why did you not tell me nobody must know celia except you and meand perhaps patient but i would rather not tell even her if we can avoid it sir edward is in hiding having fled from sheriffmuir and a party of men have been riding him down he says since last night they know he is somewhere in the neighborhood and will most likely be here to search the house in an hour or less i will readily risk my life for the man who saved it at denain and i know his sister will help me but where can we hide him faltered celia here was harrys short answer opening the closetdoor in the closet o harry that is not safe enough they would find him in a minute my dear little celia you dont know half the secrets of your own chamber look a touch of the secret spring caused the paneldoor to spring outward and celias eyes to open very wide indeed i never knew there was such a place she cried i believe no one knows but myself and now you i discovered this room five years ago but i did not wish to alarm you for i had reason to believe it was then inhabited tis one of the old priests hidingholes now watch how the door is opened and then contrive as best you can to procure food for sir edward he says he is wellnigh famished while you are with him i will go to the outlet where a passage leads to the garden and remove the logs which i put at the door five years since as silently as i can make haste every minute may be priceless celia ran downstairs feeling utterly bewildered by the position in which she was suddenly placed entering the larder she possessed herself hastily of a large loaf and a jug of milkmaking some excuseshe scarcely knew whatto patient whom she found there and discovered harry and a lamp waiting for her at the closetdoor he had some carpenters tools in the other hand a hurried greeting was exchanged between edward and celia who conversed in whispers until harry returned announcing that the passage was now open to the garden and that to avoid suspicion both had better go down again to the parlor you must talk in the night he said harry and celia went back to the parlor the latter sat down to her work hardly seeing a stitch she set they had not been downstairs many minutes when lucy sprang up triumphantly exclaiming that she had won the game at the same moment the sound of horses feet was audible outside and a loud attack was made on the great bell which hung in front of the house open to his majestys troops the cry could be distinctly heard in the parlor goodness me gasped madam passmore dropping her work in terror the squire had recourse to stronger language than this harry whose composure seemed quite restored went to the door and opened it with every appearance of haste oh said he in a cordial tone how do you do wallace pray come in my father will have infinite pleasure in making your acquaintance father here is an old comrade of mine your servant mr passmore said captain wallace bowing with his hat in his hand yours ladies i am very sorry for the ill errand i come on there is a jacobite hiding in this neighborhood a colonel in the rebel army and a man of rank and influenceone sir edward ingram i am in charge to search all the houses hereabouts and i am sure you will not take it ill of me if i ask leave not to omit yours though the loyalty of mr passmore of ashcliffe must ever be above suspicion jacobites be hanged burst from the squire sir you do me great honor no jacobites in my houseat least not if i know it pray search every corner and cut all the cushions open if you like thank you mr passmore only what i expected from a gentleman of your high character i may begin at once by all means captain wallace called in one of his menleaving the others to guard the house outsideand after an examination of the parlor they proceeded upstairs harry loyally volunteering to light them in about an hour they returned to the parlor mr passmore said captain wallace tis my duty to question every person in the house to make sure that this rebel has not been seen nor heard of you do not object a form you knowin such a case as this a mere form question away said the squire i have neither seen nor heard of him and dont want to do either now for the ladies madam passmore answered the question with a quiet negative it can scarcely be necessary to trouble the young ladies gallantly remarked the captain but if they please to say just a word we have seen and heard nothing at all sir said lucy innocently replying for both and the captain did not repeat his question neither he nor the squire apparently noticing the suspicious silence of the elder sister i must if you please ask leave to examine the servants madam passmore rang the bell and ordered all the household up they assembled in wonder and each in turn responded to the captains queries by a simple denial of any knowledge on the subject patient stood last and when captain wallace came to her he accidentally put his first question in a different form from before do you know sir edward ingram ay do i said she celia listened with a beating heart the innocent ignorance of patient might work them terrible harm which she would be the last person in the world to do wittingly you know him repeated the captain in surprise do you think i shouldna ken the bairn i nursed oh you are his nurse are you i was so twentyfive years back when did you see him last four years past where at havre in france celia breathed more freely have you heard anything of his movements of late what do you mean inquired patient cautiously well did you hear that he was likely to come into this neighborhood or anything of that sort i cannot say i havena heard that was the quiet answer when did you hear that he was expecting to come four years past but he didna come and i heard a short space back that he might be looked for afore long patient spoke slowly and thoughtfully who told you that my kinsman willie mintyre are you a scots woman ay said patient with a flash of light in her eyes humph muttered the captain difficult folks those mostly to get round when did you see willie mintyre an eight days or two since cannot you tell me the day i dinna keep a diary book responded patient dryly whence had he come whence should he come but from scotland where was he going i didna ask him patients information appeared to have collapsed all at once and her scotticisms to increase what is willie mintyre a harper how long was it since he left scotland you are a learned gentleman sir ye ken better nor me how many days it would take what else did he tell you about sir edward ingram he told me he was looking unco sick when he saw him anything more i have na mair to say sir without you have you are a clever woman involuntarily admitted the captain passing his hand across his forehead as if in thought well and when did he tell you to expect sir edward he didna tell me to expect him what did he say about him the twa things ive told you when did he say he was coming asked the captain impatiently afore lang but when he didna name ony day captain wallace was no match for patient as might be seen have you seen sir edward since you saw mintyre no sir have you heard of his being here since then being where anywhere in this neighborhood patients answer came slowly this time as if she were considering something before speaking but it was no sir are you telling me the truth asked captain wallace knitting his brows i couldna tell ye aught else answered patient tis no lawful to do evil that good may come but no good will come sir of your hunting a man to death to whom christ hath given power to become one of the sons of god oh dear a puritan murmured wallacea covenanter for aught i know mr passmore these are the most impracticable people you ever meetthese puritans particularly when they are scots there is not much loyalty among them and what little there is is sacrificed to their religion at any moment im loyal sir said patient softlyto any covenanted king but needs be to the king of kings the first i fear you are a dangerous character said captain wallace severely i am surprised to meet with such an one in this house however you wont lie to me being a puritanthat is one good thing they never tell lies now listen do you know where sir edward ingram is at this moment the no sir came readily enough this time well i suppose you can go said captain wallace doubtfully but i am not at all satisfied with youmark that your witness is very badly given and very unwillingly i may want you again if it should be needful to search the house a second time i certainly shall do so you have only just escaped being put under arrest now ive told you the truth sir said patient pausing i will tell you the truth any day but if it were to come to thisthat my dying could save you from finding my bairn sir edward i wouldna haud my life as dear as yon bittie of thread upon the floor she courtesied and departed ah that shows what the woman is said captain wallace carelessly an enthusiasta complete fanatic well mr passmore sir said the squire energetically i am by no means satisfied with this the house shall be searched again if you please and i will join the party myself harry fetch a longer candlefetch two that woman may have hidden the fellow anywhere ill have every corner looked into there shall be no question of any hiding of jacobites in my house charley go and get a candle too you girls have a lot of gowns and fallals in that closet in your room go and bundle them all out make haste oh i say what fun remarked charley to whom any connection between the hunted man and his favorite sister never occurred lucy left the room laughing to execute her fathers behest and celia dared not but follow lest her absence should be remarked the two girls went hastily upstairs and at the top they found patient standing ill help you mrs lucy said she and as lucy passed onyou ken something madam celia dont let those bloodhounds read it in your eyes as i do and be calm the lord reigneth my bairn yes dear patient i know was celias faltering answer and she went quietly into her own room matt xi pet ii luke viii in the sunken circle which marked one of the habitations of the ancient iberii the aborigines of britain one of their villages stood above merrivale bridge with a long avenue of stones still visible intersected here and there by circles and at a little distance is a monolith xiii lady griseldas ruby ring he looketh upon us sweetly with his wellknown greeting peace and he fills our hearts completely and the sounds of the tempest cease but we know that the hour is come for one of us to go home bm celia found lucy already engaged in emptying the closet patient came in and helped her until the bed was covered with cloaks and dresses they heard the searchers coming slowly toward them on the other side of the passage the squire especially urging that not the smallest corner should be left unsearched at length they tapped at the door for admittance charley came in first holding his candle high above his head as if his mission were to explore the ceiling you be off said the squire roughly as soon as he saw patient why father interposed lucy she has only been helping us to move these things you told us to make haste lucy was unconsciously proving a useful ally wow came in a little smothered bark from somewhere and venus waddled from under the valance and the dresses overhanging it go down veny said celia adding apologetically she will get in the way she felt a terrible secret fear lest venus should prove a more able searcher than any other of the party ill carry her out of the wayand suiting the action to the word lucy caught up the little dog and shut her outside a close examination was made of the room charley got into the closet and held his candle up nothing there thanks to the young ladies said captain wallace laughing as he looked in nohed be a clever fellow who could hide there added the squire in blissful ignorance why heres a nail said charley close to the wall youll tear your gowns on it ill pull it out celias very heart sank leave it just now charley said harry coolly we shall want you and your candle charley sprang down and rejoined the searching party outside the door they were also joined by venus who followed them into the next room which had been the bedchamber of isabella she picked out captain wallace and followed close at his heels paying no attention to anybody else the room was searched like the others the last thing which the captain did being to look up the chimney no sooner did he approach the fireplace than venus gave an angry growl and made a futile attempt to bite him through his thick boots what is the brute growling at demanded the squire i dont know indeed said harry the growling continued so long as captain wallace was near the chimney but nobody except venus knew why as soon as the party turned from isabellas room to henriettas which was the next venus trotted back to celia at the close of the inspection both captain wallace and squire passmore were forced to acknowledge that no trace of any hidden fugitive could be discovered they went downstairs five minutes later harry came lightly up again and called to celia who was helping lucy to replace the dresses in the closet she found him in isabellas chamber let us look at this chimney celia he said it must be very near the hidingplace what made veny growl he had brought a small ladder from the housemaids closet with which he mounted as far as he could go inside the wide old chimney when he came down he looked pale and excited celia we must get him out of the house if either wallace or my father should think of returning to see the cause of venys growling he will infallibly be discovered the chimneys join and every sound from one room can be heard in the other venus is wiser than we are the dog knew though i did not that there was a shorter passage to the concealed chamber from bells chamber than from yours what shall we do whispered celia go downstairs and fetch from the buttery such provisions as you can take to sir edward of any portable kind converse with him if you will but let it be in the lowest tones and if you hear any noise in this chamber be as mute as mice i will go down and set my father and wallace at some game and get my mother to prepare henriettas chamber for him as it is too late for him to think of leaving tonight now then i shall go and have a horse ready saddled as near as is safe when the clock strikes nine lead sir edward down to the well door you cannot miss it if only you keep going down i will meet you with a lantern at the well at nine or as soon after as possible is the well low enough with all this rain water up to the ankles but he will not care for that harry and celia left the room softly departing on their several errands wallace said the former coming into the parlor do you think it is necessary to keep your men on guard outside tis a bitter cold night and if they may come into the kitchen the poor fellows would be none the worse for a hot supper i do not think it is necessary said the captain captain wallace having called the men in harry took them to the kitchen and desired molly the cookmaid to give them as good a supper as she could with hot ale for which robert was despatched to the cellar this done harry went upstairs to his own room silently opening his windowwhich fortunately for his project was at the northeast corner of the house away from both parlor and kitchenhe climbed down the limetree which stood close beside it and took his way noiselessly to the stable meanwhile celia who had concealed in her pocket and by means of the dressinggown over her arm two standing pies came back to her own room and descended to the concealed chamber see what i have brought you she said to the fugitive the troops are here and have searched the house twice and harry thinks that we must get you away tonight he will have a horse ready for you and will meet you at the well at nine oclock do you mind going through a foot of water i should be a sybarite if i did smiled edward in reply celia i am bringing you into danger and i am very sorry for it i begin to think now that it was but a cowardly act to seek shelter here yet when a man is riding for life he scarce pauses to choose his course you have brought me into no danger dear into which i did not choose to be brought she answered but if they found you edward what would they do to you what they did but a few days since on tower hill to my friend lord derwentwater he said gravely celia shuddered as the agony and ignominy of that horrible scaffold came up before her eyes they will not do it without the lords permission added he quietly celia i am in grave doubt whether i have done right in this matter not that i could ever see it right to fight against king james nor that i doubt which would have been the right side to take at the time of the revolution i cannot quite seewhat i know would be patients view and is the view of many good menthat we had no right to fight for a popish king i do not judge those who thought soto our own master we all stand or fall but i see the matter in another light it was not that king james being a papist was made king out of his turn but that being heir to the throne he became a papist i see an immense difference between the two god not we made him our king god made the present king james his son knowing that he would be brought up a papist what right had we to cast him off now the case is altered he is cast off and considering the danger of popery have i now any right to bring him in again this is my difficulty and if i can leave england in safety i do not think i shall draw my sword in the jacobite cause again though i never could take the oath of allegiance to any other king i will never dare to attempt the prevention of the lords will if only i can be certain what the lords will is in this matter well i do not see the question quite as you do it seems to me that they were right to cast off a popish king but we have no time to discuss politics tonight you will leave england then at once there is no hope of life otherwise the elector of hanover and his ministers can have no mercy for us who fought at sheriffmuir and when am i likely to see you again edward when the heavenly jerusalem descendeth out of heaven from god he answered softly no sooner responded celia tearfully god knoweth he said how do i know i have a fancy sometimesa foreboding if you willthat my life will not be long so much the better yet i do not wish to be longing selfishly for rest ere the lords work for me is done look here celia look well at this ring so that you will know it again in any place after any lapse of time he drew the ring from his finger and passed it to her it was an oldfashioned gold ring set with a single ruby inside it was engraved in obsolete spelling a posy in thys my chance i doe rejoyce i shall know this again said celia returning the ring after a close inspection tis an old jewel a family heirloom said edward our mother was married with that ring it came into out family as the weddingring of lady grissel fleming our grandmother i will endeavor to contrive dear cicely that by some means this ring shall reach your hands after my death when you next see it in the possession of any but myself it will signify to you that i have entered into my rest edward where is your wife asked celia suddenly a spasm of pain crossed edwards face i have no wife he said the lord had more need of my flora than i had and two summers past he said unto her come up higher i am almost glad now that she was spared this i saw her but twice after i parted from you at havre and i do not think it will be long now ere i shall see her again you seem to like the prospect edward said celia remonstratingly have i so very much to live for my sister i can do no good to you especially now that we must be parted and my sole object in life is to do and suffer all the will of god do you wonder if i wish at times that it would be the lords will to summon me home there was a short pause broken by edwards sudden exclamation celia she looked up to see what was coming how long have you known of this chamber harry said he had known of it for five years i never heard a word about it before tonight did he suspect that it was occupied i think he said it was or had been shortly before he discovered it would you like to know by whom very much why edward how do you know there is not time to explain that but i can tell you that father stevens a jesuit priest was in hiding here for some time and for about two months gilbert irvine what were they doing here and how did they get their provisions what stevens was doing i cannot say but gilberts object was you he was sent here by my mother to make himself acquainted with you by sight and to discover all he could about you and your friends here as to provisions he catered for himself in the village and elsewhere but on two or three occasions when he dared not venture out and was very hard bestead he supplied himself from mr passmores larder how did he get there through your room edward it was a bold move and might have cost him dear if you had awoke do you mean to say that he did it while lucy and i were sleeping in the room yes said edward with his grave smile celia sent her memory back to the time and a dim vision gradually revealed itself to her of one winter night when awaking suddenly she had fancied she heard mice in the wainscot and the next morning the black cat had suffered at the hands of molly for the absence of a partridge and a cold chicken from the buttery but how came my stepmother to know anything about this hidden chamber through stevens who at one time was among her confessors oh the priests know their old hidingplaces though the owners may have lost the tradition of them have you seen my lady ingram of late within the last six months how does she at chaillot the nuns say she is killing herself with austerities and she looks as though she might be she has her salvation to make you see what a dreadful delusion sighed celia one of mans hundred usurpations of the prerogative of god if man may not save himself wholly he will save himself in part he will do anything rather than let christ do everything tis just the world the flesh and the devil in a peculiar shape and of a very fair color puffed up by his fleshly mind saith st paul of this manner of mortifying of the flesh the subtlest serving of the devil lies i think in this kind of renouncing of the world and the world in whatever shape passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever as edward spoke the last word the old clock in the hall struck nine both rose and edward drawing celia to him kissed his last farewell god be brother and sister to you dear he said and keep thee in all thy ways set thee in the secret place of the most high that thou mayest abide under the shadow of the almighty christ be with thee amen they went softly down to the door opening into the well outside of which was harry with a ladder there was another figure there beside harrys but the moonlight was not sufficient to show who it might be say farewell to patient for me said edward i wish i could have seen her adieu in another minute edward was safely landed as soon as he touched the ground the second figure came forward and threw its arms round his neck eh my bairn my bairn sobbed a voice which both edward and celia knew well i could never bear to let you go but a word the lord bless thee and guide thee my ain bit laddie that i nursed edward returned the embrace very warmly patient had always been far more of a mother to him than lady ingram he seemed disposed to hesitate for a moment but harry urged him away and motioned to celia to return she left the three on the outside of the well harry and edward hastening to the place where the horse waited and patient silent and motionless watching her darling pass from her sight celia was early downstairs the next morning harry met her in the hall and contrived to whisper along with his morning kiss all right further communication was impossible for the squire was just behind them and the three entered the parlor together they found captain wallace looking out of the window goodmorning captain said the squire i suppose you have heard nothing of your man nothing whatever mr passmore well ill have the house searched again by daylight first thing after breakfast your energy is most laudable mr passmore but really after two previous searchesis it necessary necessary or unnecessary it shall be done sir said the squire warmly no man on earth shall have the shadow of reason for suspecting any concealment of rebels in ashcliffe hall you will do me the favor to accompany me and harry and charley shall come too i shall be most happy sir responded harry tis splendid fun commented charley i only wish we could find him the search took place and not a corner was left an examined except only the undiscovered hidingplace which alone needed examination the squire pressed captain wallace to be his guest for another day and so for a different reason did his eldest son captain wallace accepted the offer after a decent show of reluctance to save his conscience harry no longer pressed him to stay after the following morning and he left the next day father said harry in the evening i fear i am about to draw your displeasure upon me but i have done what i thought right and i must bear it sir edward ingram left this house at nine oclock yesterday evening left this house cried the squire and madam passmore in a breaththe former adding some very powerful language which shall not be reproduced here left the house harry repeated calmly the squire exploded a second time telling his son among other equally pleasant assertions that he was a disgrace to his family and his country and would come to the gallows before he was much older father was harrys dignified reply i am sorry for nothing except that i have angered you this man whom wallace was seeking is a gentleman and a protestant and at the battle of denain he saved my life and gave me my liberty without ransom would you as a man of conscience and honor have advised me to give him up after that the squire growled something inaudible father said celia rising in her turn very white and trembling this was my brother whom we concealed in your house last night i will take half or more than half of whatever blame is due harry concealed him but it was in my bedchamber and i brought him food and assisted in his escape could i have delivered up my brother to deaththe only brother i have left father have you the heart to say so no my dear said madam passmore pouring a little oil upon the turbulent waters no i am sure he never wouldnever madam passmores gentle deprecation of his wrath appeared to set the squire free to explode a third time lucy he exclaimed turning to his wife in one of the severest tones he had ever used to her i am a whig and my father was a whig before me and my grandfather fought for king charles at edgehill and naseby and i have brought up these children to be whigs and if they arent tis a burning shame a murrain on the day that sent my lady ingram here after our celia but hang it all how can i help it said the squire suddenly breaking down if this fellow be celias brother and have saved harrys life as a man of honor i could not bid them do otherwise than try to save hisno not if he were the pope himself tis not nature for a man to take sides against his own children botheration he concluded suddenly veering round again that isnt what i meant to say at all i intended to be very angry and i have only been an old foolthats what i am you are a dear old father who cant be cross when he thinks he ought to bethats what you are said lucy coaxingly get along with you hussey returned the squire shaking his fist at her in a manner which lucy very well knew was more than half makebelieve and pray colonel passmore after allowing me to search the house three times and find nothing i should like if you please to know where you hid your refugee you shall see that father said harry rising and he led the way to the hidingplace followed by the whole family cicely bringing up the rear when she heard the noise they made each member expressed his or her amazement in a characteristic manner oh my buttons isnt that capital said charley i wish i had known last night it would have been ten times better fun i think you enjoyed yourself sufficiently returned his brother gravely what a horrid dark hole harry said lucy i never knew of such a place here exclaimed his mother well mr henry falkland passmore you are an uncommon cool hand asserted his father and who helped you to get your jacobite safely away i wonder celia and patient irvine did patient know where he was harry asked his mother gravely not when wallace questioned her i told her afterwards but the astonishment of the whole group faded before that of old cicely aggett well i do declare was what she said if ever anybody did no nobody couldnt never have guessed the like of thisthat they couldnt ive lived in this house threeandthirty years come martlemas and i never never did see nor hear nothing this like in all my born days only just to think and them things i took for rats and ghosteses was papishes eh but id a cruel deal rather have a hundred rats and mice nor one of them wicked papishes and ghosteses too pretty nigh well to be sure my dears the lord has preserved us wonderful and tis uncommon thankful wed ought to be you will sleep tonight madam i trust said patient that evening as she bound up celias hair and you my poor patient said celia i fear you slept not much last night no madam answered patient quietly i watched unto prayer well i hope edward is quite safe by this time sighed celia you will never see him again madam said patient solemnly patient exclaimed celia in sudden terror lest she might have heard some bad news best my bairn said patient reading her thought in her face i have heard nothing but tis borne in upon metis borne in upon me the lord hath said unto me he shall surely die celia listened in awe and wonder patient you are not a prophetess she said ah madam i think more than one of us hath been a prophet where our hearts beloved are concerned was it not revealed unto alexander peden that he should die in scotland and did he not say unto the captain of the ship appointed to carry him unto the american plantations the ship is not launched that shall carry me thither and where did he die in scotland madam as the lord had showed him and they laid his dust on the gallows hill of the city i reckon the lord can see it as easily there as in the kirkyard it is a kirkyard now one after another came and laid their dead beside peden and from a gallows hill tis become a buryingplace it was said indeed that mr renwick saw further than many but he was not known unto me and i can say nought thereanent but that the secret of the lord is with them that fear him may be a deeper word than we ken and as to george wishart all knew that he was called to be a prophet of the lord and john knox likewise but there were giants in their days we be smaller men now yet the lord is the same now as then and he doeth whatsoever he will tis not the worthiness nor holiness of the man that maketh a prophet but the breath and spirit of the lord within him and i being less than the least of all his do know of a surety that i shall never see master edward any more patients lips quivered and some seconds passed ere she could speak again ay the will of the lord be done she said presently he knoweth them that are his and he will not let us fail of a meeting in our fathers house rest my bairn you need it two months afterwards came a letter to squire passmore bearing neither date nor signature though edwards hand was unknown to her celia claimed the precious paper at once dear sisterlast night i landed at corunna i shall be safe for the present and the lord is ever with me thank better than i could all who helped me you will know from whom this comes love to both of you god keep you celia carried the paper to patient whom she guessed to be included with herself in the both of you thank you madam said patient when she had read it tis a comfort to hear that he is in safety yet i cannot forget that the lord hath showed unto me that he shall die in the flower of his age the th of june was celias thirtieth birthday she was seated at work in the parlor with madam passmore and lucy when a ring at the great bell summoned robert to the front door and was followed by his announcement of mr colville celia looked up in surprise to see if philips friend had sought her out no this was certainly not her pantheist adversary he was a smaller and slighter man with a much pleasanter expression of face than his namesake yet with the same pale blue eyes and flaxen hair and some resemblance in the features mrs ingram he asked a little doubtfully with a smile and a low bow mrs celia ingram celia rose to receive him wondering all the time who he was and what he wanted with her that is my name sir she said a little timidly i once knew a mr colville in paris who was my brother said the visitor in explanation it was arthur colville whom you met in paris i am david colville i have been commissioned to give something into your hands and none others the signification of which i believe you know i received it at barcelona on the th of january last and he drew a pocketbook from his breastpocket out of which he took and held forward to celia something which brought a pang to her heart and a cry of pain to her lips it was the ingram heirloom lady griseldas ruby ring which was to be the signal to edward ingrams sister that he had entered into his rest when was this she faltered at last at barcelona on the th of january david colville repeated i had met him for i also was journeying in spain three weeks before i saw the end was near and i stayed with him and tended him till he died where is he buried the spaniards allow no burial to heretics madamnot more than they allow to a horse or a dog he lies in a quiet meadow near the inn at barcelona i took care of that thank you murmured celia but no burialserviceo edward the soft answer from david colville almost startled herthy brother shall rise again yes i know she said and you mr colvilleyou do not share your brothers philosophical views god forbid was the uncompromising reply i have yet hope that arthur may see the error of his ways may i ask if mr arthur colville is well i have not seen him for many years said david madam may i ask in my turn if patient irvine be yet here i think she would remember me as an old playmate of ned and philip in the days long ago when we were all boys at paris patient received david colville very affectionately and his news very quietly i knew it would be so she said with christ which is far better david colville left an agreeable impression of himself on the minds of both celia and patient when he shook hands with them at parting there was sore mourning for edward ingram at ashcliffe if it would please the lord to ask me also sighed patient no dear patient i want you said celia lovingly so long as you really want me madam i shall be kept here but the lord knoweth better than you what you need and our work is done when he calleth us yet so much there my father my mother roswith mr grey and lady magdalene and mr philip and now my ain bairn maister edwardand patient broke down now patient my dear said cicely from her chair for she was infirm nownow patient my dear dont you go to fret over the lords mercies cant you see child that he is but taking all your jewels to keep them safer than you can and that hell give them all back to you up yonder tis such a short time heresuch a short time ay i ken that said patient but youre a deal further on than i am cicely why my dear if you mean i shall die sooner i dont know who told you and if you mean that i know more about the lord than you im sure tis the first time ive heard of it maybe children we cant tell which of us is the furthestthe lord knows the one nearest him is the furthest on and we are always straying from him said celia sighing it scarce seems in us to keep always near him when you were a little babe my dear said cicely i remember if you were frighted at aught you used to makebelieve to throw your bits of arms about my neck and cling close to me but after all it warnt your clinging as kept you from falling but me holding of you we are all as babes in the lords arms my clear tis well surely for us to keep clinging to him but after all it bent that as holds ustis his keeping of us it bent always when we are looking at him that he is closest to us he may be nearest when we cant see him and im sure of one thing childif the good shepherd didnt go aseeking after the lost sheep the lost sheep would never turn of itself and come home to the good shepherdit would only go farther and farther in the great wilderness until it was wholly lost he calleth his own sheep by namebent that itand leadeth them out deary me what was we atalking about it seems so natural like to get round to him celia smiled sadly as philips remark occurred to herthere you come round to your divinity for eleven years longer george louis of hanover sat on the throne of england every year he sank lower and lower in the estimation of his subjects when he first landed in in tones more deep than loud england had demanded her queen and had no answer now through these thirteen years she had seen her king chosen out of all the princes of europe living apart from every member of his family and keeping up a court which only the complete demoralization of her nobles made them not ashamed to visit and though very dimly and uncertainly yet reports did reach england of a guarded prison in hanover and of a chapel in it where every communion sabbath a whiterobed prisoner knelt down before the holy table and laying her hand upon it solemnly protested in the presence of god that she had done no wrong deserving of that penalty and england began to wonder if she had spoken well in summoning to her helm the husband and gaoler of this woful whiterobed captive if the grand question of protestantism had not been at stakeif she could have retained that and yet have had back her old linethe throne of george louis would have trembled and fallen under him not the fifteen nor the fortyfive brought so near a second restoration as the evil and miserable life of that crowned sinner from hanover so early as george had persuaded parliament to repeal that clause of the act of settlement which made obligatory the perpetual residence of the sovereign and no sooner had the clerk said le roy le veut to the repeal than george set out for hanover with extreme delight at his release after that he spent as little time in england as was possible on the th of june george louis landed from england on the dutch shores he was travelling onwards towards osnabrck when on the night of the th an unknown hand threw a letter into his carriage the king who was alone opened it in the expectation of seeing a petition there were only a few lines in the letter but they came from the dead and were written as with fire what met his eyes was a summons from sophia dorothea of zelle written on her deathbed in the preceding november at ahlden calling on him in gods name to meet her before his tribunal within a year and a day the king was intensely superstitious what more happened in that carriage where he sat solitary holding in his hand the open letter from his dead wife none ever knew but when the carriage stopped at the gates of the palace of osnabrck george louis was dead there were no mourners least of all could england mourn for the man who had so bitterly disgraced her and had made her feel ashamed of her choice before all the world on the contrary there were bonfires and bellringings and universal rejoicings for the accession of george augustus whom england welcomed with hope in her heart that he would restore the honor which his father had laid in the dust a vain hope and a groundless joy it is on that summer day the th of june that i take leave of the passmores a quiet family partylucy growing into another and a livelier celia charley toning down into a second harry isabella when she condescends to shine upon ashcliffe in her glories of carriage and nero being the only discordant element she and john rowe get on very well by reason of the lady being mistress and john her obedient servant squire and madam passmore have grown more white and infirm and on one quiet summer night in the preceding year without sound or forewarning the angels of god came down from heaven to bear cicely aggett home to the fathers house but patient lives on for her work is not yet over on that afternoon celia and harry had rung the bell at the gate of sainte marie de chaillot and had asked for an interview with soeur marie anglique and in the guestchamber there came to them a pale slender wornlooking woman in a nuns garb who assured them as she had done before on several occasions that she was making her salvation that she trusted she had by this time nearly expiated all her sins and that a very short time in purgatory would suffice to purify her only once during the interview did her stoic calmness give way and that was when she said of the purgatory she anticipated and there i shall see philip and celia felt that nearly all she could do was to pray earnestly that this wandering sheep might see philip elsewhere then they took leave of claude ingram and she went back to the convent chapel and tried to make a little more of her salvation by kneeling on the cold stones and repeating interminable litanies and ave marias so we leave her to her hard taskhardest of tasks in all the worldto stand before god without a mediator to propitiate the judge by the works of the law for without shedding of blood is no remission the summer evening is drawing to a close as outside the convent harry and celia pause to watch the sunset how beautiful god has made this world says one of the travellers how much more beautiful it must be in that other land very far off the heavenly jerusalem where is no need of the
