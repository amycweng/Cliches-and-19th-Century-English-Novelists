out in the fortyfive or duncan keiths vow by emily sarah holt this book is written in the style of a diary written by the youngest of four sisters she is a very sensitive young girl and her observations are very acute most of them are of a religious nature and the description of the work of a preacher called whitefield is very well worth reading i felt quite emotional while reading it as you may gather from the title the book is set in the time of at the time the bonny prince charlie landed in an attempt to claim his title to the throne currently held by the elector of hanover who was not very popular among the people we meet in this book most of whom would be called jacobites it is interesting to see that jacobite families like this one were more or less left alone except when they actually took up arms the book takes about hours to read aloud some of the speech is in broad lowland scots but you will probably have little difficulty in understanding it you will probably come away from reading this book resolved upon an amendment of life if so then the book has done its work this is the first book by this author that we have come across lent to us for the occasion and i am sure we shall add a few more by her in due course out in the fortyfive or duncan keiths vow by emily sarah holt chapter one we alight at brocklebank fells sure there is room within our hearts good store for we can lodge transgressions by the score thousands of toys dwell there yet out of door we leave thee george herbert girls said my aunt kezia looking round at us i should just like to know what is to come of the whole four of you my aunt kezia has an awful way of looking round at us she begins with sophyshe is our eldestthen she goes to fanny then to hatty and ends up with me as i am the youngest i have to be ended up with she generally lays down her work to do it too and sometimes she settles her spectacles first and that makes it feel more awful than ever however when she has gone round she always takes them offspectacles i meanand wipes them and gives little solemn shakes of her head while she is doing it as if she thought we were all four going to ruin together and had got very near the bottom this afternoon when she said that instead of sitting quiet as we generally do hattyshe is the pert one amongst usactually spoke up i should think we shall be married aunt kezia one of these days shant we my dear if you are was my aunt kezias reply more solemn than ever the only wedding present that i shall be conscientiously able to give to those four misguided men will be a rope apiece to hang themselves with oh dear i do wish she would not said fanny in a plaintive whisper behind me considering who brought us up aunt kezia replied impertinent hatty i should have thought they would have had better bargains than that hester you forget yourself said my aunt severely then though she had only just finished wiping her spectacles she took them off and wiped them again with more little shakes of her head and i did not bring you all up neither my cheeks grew hot for i knew that meant me my aunt kezia did not bring me up as she did the rest i was thought sickly in my youth and as brocklebank fells is but a bleak place i was packed off to carlisle where grandmamma lived and there i have been with her until six weeks back when she went to live with uncle charles down in the south and i came home to brocklebank being thought to have now outgrown my sickliness my aunt kezia is fathers sister and has kept house for him since mamma died so of course she is no kin to grandmamma at all i know it sounds queer to say father and mamma instead of father and mother but i cannot help it grandmamma would never let me say mother she said it was oldfashioned and vulgar and now when i come back father will not hear of my calling him papa which he says is newfangled finnicking nonsense i did not get used either to saying papa as i did mamma for grandmamma never seemed to care to hear about him i dont believe she liked him she never seemed to want to hear about anything at brocklebank i dont think she ever took even to the girls except fanny they all came to see me in turns but grandmamma said sophy was only fit to be a country parsons wife she knew nothing except things about the house and sewing and mending she said fine breeding would be thrown away upon her she might do very well grandmamma said with her snuffbox elegantly held in her left hand and taking a pinch out of it with the mittened fingers of her rightthat is grandmamma not sophyshe said sophy might do very well for a country squires eldest daughter and some parsons wife to cut out clothes and roll pills and make dumplings but that was all she was good for then hattys pert speeches she could not bear one bit grandmamma said it was perfectly dreadful and that her great glazed red cheeksthat is what she called themwere insufferably vulgar she wouldnt like anybody to hear that such a creature was her granddaughter she wanted hatty to take a lot of castor oil or some such horrid stuff to bring down her red cheeks and make her slender and ladylike she was ever so much too fat grandmamma said and she thought it so vulgar to be fat she wanted to pinch her in with stays too but it was all of no use hatty would not be pinched and she would not take castor oil and she would eat and drinklike a ploughboy grandmamma saidso at last she gave her up as a bad job then fanny came and she is more like grandmamma in her ways and she did not mind the castor oil but swallowed bottles of it and she did not mind the stays but let grandmamma pinch her anyhow she pleased so i think she rather liked fanny i was pale and thin enough without castor oil so she did not give me any for which i am thankful for i could not have swallowed it as meekly as fanny it looked very queer to me after grandmammas houseful of servants to come home and find only four at brocklebank and but three of those in the house and my aunt kezia doing half the work herself and expecting us girls to help her grandmamma would hardly let me pick up my kerchief if i dropped it i had to call willet her woman to give it to me and here my aunt kezia looks as if she thought i ought to want no telling how to dust a table or make an apple pie she has only cookmaid and chambermaidmaria and bessy their names areand sam the servingman there is the old shepherd will but he only comes into the house by nows and thens grandmamma had a black man who waited on us she said it gave the place an air and that there were gentlewomen in carlisle who would scarce have come to see her if she had not had a black man to look genteel i dont fancy i should care much for people who would not come to see me unless i had a black servant i should think they came to visit him not me but grandmamma said that my old lady mary garsington in the close never came to see anybody who had less than a thousand a year and did not keep a black she was the grandest person grandmamma knew at carlisle for most of her friends live in the south i do not know exactly where the south is nor what it is like of course london is in the south i know that but grandmamma used to talk about the south as if she thought it so fine and my uncle charles once said nobody could be a gentleman who had not lived in the south they were all clodhoppers up here he said and you could only get any proper polish in the south fanny was there then and she was quite hurt with it she did not like to think father a clodhopper and i am sure he is not besides our ancestors did come from the south our grandfather william courtenay who bought the land and built brocklebank belonged note wiltshire and his father was a devonshire man and a courtenay of powderham whatever that may mean father knows more about it than i do and so i think does fanny grandmamma once told me she would never have thought of allowing mamma to marry father if he had not been a courtenay and a man of substance she said all his other relations were so very mean and low she could not have condescended so far as to connect herself with them why i believe one of them was only a farmers daughter and i think from what i have heard grandmamma and my uncle charles say that another of them had something to do with those low people called dissenters i dont suppose she really was onethat would be too shocking but grandmamma always went into the clouds when she mentioned these vulgar ancestors of mine so i never heard more than that poor wretched mother of your grandfathers my dear or that dreadful farming creature whom your grandfather married i once asked my aunt dorotheathat is uncle charless wifeif this wretched greatgrandmother of mine had been a very bad woman but she said oh no not badand i think she might have told me something more but my uncle charles put in in that commanding way he has could not have been worse my dear dorotheaconnected with those dissentersso i got to know no more and i was sorry father once had two more sisters who were both married one in derbyshire and one in scotland they both left children so we have two lots of cousins on fathers side our cousins in derbyshire are both girls their names are charlotte and amelia bracewell and there are two of our scotch cousins but they are a boy and a girl and they have queer scotch names angus and flora drummond at least they were boy and girl i suppose for angus drummond must be over twenty now and flora is not far off it it is more than ten years since we saw the drummonds but the bracewells have been to visit us several times amelia bracewell is fanny made hotter or fanny is amelia and water which you like she makes me laugh and my aunt kezia sniff the other day my aunt kezia came into the room while we were talking about amelia and she heard fanny say she is so full of sympathy she always comes and wants you to sympathise with her she just lives upon sympathy so full of sympathy said my aunt kezia turning round on fanny so empty child you mean what poor weak thing are you talking about cousin amelia bracewell answered fanny she is such a charming creature dont you think so aunt kezia such a dear sympathetic darling it is well you told me whom you meant fanny said my aunt kezia pursing up her lips i should never have guessed you meant amelia bracewell from what you said well how differently two people can see the same thing to be sure dont you like her aunt kezia returned fanny in an astonished tone if i am to speak the full truth my dear said my aunt kezia i am afraid i come as near to despising her as a christian woman and a communicant has any business to do i never had any fancy for birds of prey birds of prey exclaimed fanny blankly birds of prey repeated my aunt in a very different tone she is one of those folks who are for ever drawing twopenny cheques upon your feelings and there are no funds in my bank to meet them i can stand a bucketful of feeling drawn out of me but i hate to let it waste away in a drop here and a driblet there about nothing at all now i will just tell you girlsi once went to see a woman who had lost fifteen hundred a year all at a blow without a bit of warning what she had to say wasthe lord has taken it and he knows best i can trust him to care for me well about a week afterwards i had a visit from another woman who had let a pan boil over and had spoilt a lot of jam she wanted me to say she was the most tried creature since adam and i could not girlsi really could not i have not the slightest doubt there have been a million women worse tried since the battle of prague never mention adam as to amelia bracewell who carries her fan as if it were a sceptre and slurs her rs like a londoner silly chit i have hardly any patience with her charlottes bad enough but amelia my word she takes some standing i can tell you now i always admired the way amelia sounds her rs or i suppose i ought to say the way she does not sound them it is so soft and pretty then she writes poetryall about the blue sea and the silver moon or else the gleaming sunbeams and the hoary hillsso grand i never read anything so beautiful as amelias poetry she told me once that a gentleman from london who was fourth cousin to a peer of some sort had told her she wrote as well as mr pope only think charlotte is as different as she can be her notion of things is to go down to the stable and saddle her own horse and scamper all over the country all by herself father says she is a fine girl but she will break her neck some day my aunt kezia says saint paul told women to be keepers at home and she thinks that page must have dropped out of charlottes bible she does some other things too that i do not fancy she would care for my aunt kezia to hear she calls her father the old gentleman and sometimes the old boy i do not know what my aunt kezia would say if she did hear it i wonder what flora drummond is like now i used to think she had not much in her perhaps it was only that she did not let it come out however i shall have a chance of finding out soon for she and angus are coming to stay with us on his way to york where his father is sending him on some kind of business i do not know what it is and i dont care business is always dry uninteresting stuff flora will stay with us while angus goes on to york and then he will pick her up again as he comes back i wish the bracewells might be here at the same time i should like flora and amelia to know one another and i do not think they do at all it is shocking dull here at brocklebank i dare say i feel it more than my sisters having lived in carlisle all my life so to speak and as to my aunt kezia i do believe if she had her garden and orchard and kitchen and dairy and her workbox and a bible and prayerbook and the compleat gentlewoman she would be satisfied to live at the north pole or anywhere but i am perfectly delighted when anybody comes to see us if tis only ephraim hebblethwaite he is the son of farmer hebblethwaite lower down the valley and i believe he admires fanny fanny cannot bear him she says he has such an ugly name but i think he is very pleasant and i suppose he could change his name though i cant see why it signifies beside him and ambrose catterall and esther langridge we know no young people except our cousins father being squire of brocklebank we cannot mix with the common folks old mr digby is the vicar and i do not think he is far short of a hundred years old he is an old bachelor and has nobody to keep his house but our sams mother a scotchwomanold elspie they call her he does not often preach of late yearsexcept on good friday and easter sunday and such high days a pleasant old man he used to be but he grows forgetful now for the last time we met him he patted my head just as if i were still a little child and i shall be seventeen in march he has been vicar over sixty years and christened father and married my grandparents i do wish we had just a few more friends it really is too bad for we might have known the family at seven stones only two miles off if they had not been whigs and there are five sons and four daughters there father would no more think of shaking hands with a whig if he knew it than he would eat roast beef on good friday i should not care why should one not have some fun because old mr outhwaite is a whig i shall have to keep my book locked up if i tell it all i think as i have been doing now i would not have hatty get hold of it for all the world and as to my aunt keziai believe she would whip me and send me to bed if she read only the last page here comes ambrose catterall up the walk and i must go down though i do not expect there will be any fun he will stay supper i dare say and then he and father will have a game of whist with sophy and fanny and i shall sit by with my sewing and hatty will knit and whisper into my ear things that i want to laugh at and dare not if i did father would look up over his cards with a black brow and say silence in such a tone that i shall wish i was somebody else who i dont know only not caroline courtenay father does not like our namesat least mine and sophys mamma named us and he says we have both fine romantic silly names hatty was called after his mother and that he likes and fanny is after a sister of mammas who died young but father never gives over growling because one of us was not a boy four girls he says four girls and never a lad who on earth wants four girls ill sell one or two of you cheap if i can find him but i dont think he would if it came to the point i know for all his queer speeches sometimes he is proud of fannys good looks and sophys good housekeeping and even hattys pert sayings i know by the way he chuckles now and then when she says anything particularly smart i dont know what he is proud of in me unless it is my manners of course having lived in carlisle with grandmamma i have the best manners of any and i speak the best i know sophy talks shockingly broad she says aw wanted him to coom boot he would not fanny has found that will not do so she tries to imitate my aunt dorothea and amelia bracewell but she goes on the other side of her pattern and does not sound the u full where she ought to do it but says the basin is fell of shegar hatty laughs at them both and lets her u go where it likes but she is not so bad as sophy i think i shall try and put the notion into my aunt kezias head to have the bracewells here for christmas i know angus and flora will be here then and later that would make a decent party if we got ephraim hebblethwaite and ambrose catterall too after all i went on writing so late that i only got downstairs in time to see ambrose catteralls back as he went down the drive he could not stay for some reasoni did not hear what father growled as he heard him go off singing down the walk where on earth did the fellow get hold of that piece of whiggery said he just listen to him i listened and heard the refrain of the whigs favourite song send him victorious happy and glorious long to reign over us disgusting stuff said father with some stronger words which i know my aunt kezia would not let me put down if she were looking where did the fellow get hold of it his father is a decent tory enough what is he at now listen girls ambroses tune had changed to king george he was born in the month of october tis a sin for a subject that month to be sober ill forbid him my house cries father starting up ill send a bullet through his head ill october him and sober him too if he has not a care fan wheres fan go to the spinnet girl and sing me a right good tory song to take the taste of that abominable stuff out of my mouth nay brother saith my aunt kezia who was pinning a piece of work on the table surely a man may use respect to the powers that be though they be not the powers he might wish to be powers that be saith father powers that shouldnt be you mean ill tell you what keziayou may have been bred a tory but you were born a puritan whereon earth you got it as for that fellow ill forbid him my house king george forsooth let me hear one of you call the elector of hanover by that name and illill come along fan and give me a tory song so fanny sat down to the spinnet and played the new song that all the tories are so fond of how often she made britain arise from out the azure waves i am sure i dont know but she and father with her sang it so many times that all that day i had britons never shall be slaves ringing in my ears till i heartily wished they would be slaves and have done with it at night when we were going to bed after father had blessed us hatty runs round to his back and whispers in his ear dont send ambrose catterall away theres a good father says she there will be two of us old maids as it is father laughed and pinched hattys ear so i saw my gentlewoman had been thinking the same thing i had but i dont think she ought to have said it out stay now why should it be worse to say things than to think them is it as bad to think them as to say them oh dear but if one were for ever sifting ones thoughts in that waywhy it would be just dreadful not many people are careful about their words but ones thoughts no i dont think i could do it really i suppose my aunt kezia would say i ought i do so dislike my aunt kezias oughts she always thinks you ought to do just what you do not want if only people would say now and then that you ought to eat plumpudding or you ought to dance or you ought to wear jewels but no it is always you ought to sew or you ought to carry some broken victuals to old goody branscombe or you ought to be as sweet as a rosebud when hatty says things at you stop would it be so if i always wanted to do the things i ought i suppose not then why dont i but why ought i theres another question i wish we either wanted to do what we ought or else that we ought to do what we want i was obliged to stop last night all at once because i heard hatty coming up the garret stairs i always write in the garret and keep my book there so that none of the girls shall get hold of ithatty particularly she would make such shocking game of it i had only just put my book away safely when in she came what on earth are you doing up here cried she what are you doing said i looking for you she says then why should not i be looking for you said i because you werent miss caroline courtenay and she makes a swimming courtesy oh yes you dont need to tell me you have a secret my young gentlewoman i know as well as if i had seen it o pussy have you come too do you know what it is pussy does she come up here to read her lovelettersdoes she oh how charming wouldnt i like to see them how does she get them pussy she has been rather fond of going to see elspie this past week or two is that it pussy wont you tell me my pretty pretty cat hatty dont be so absurd cried i we know dont we pussy says hatty in a provoking whisper to the cat in her arms i thought there would be somebody at carlisle that she would be sorry to leavedidnt you pussycat what is he like pussy tall and dark ill wager with a pair of handsome mustachios and the most beautiful black eyes you ever saw wont that be about it pussy i could have thrown the cat at her how could any mortal creature be sweet or keep quiet talked to in that way i flew out hatty you are the most vexatious tease that ever lived do for pitys sake go down and let me alone you know perfectly well it is all stuff and nonsense oh how angry she is my pretty pussy says hatty hiding her laughing face behind the cat it was all nonsense you know but really when she gets into such a tantrum i begin to think i must have hit the white what do you say pussy i stamped on the garret floor hatty will you take that hideous cat down and be quiet cried i dear dear to think of her calling you a hideous cat doesnt that show how angry she is people should not get angryshould they pussy she will box our ears next i really think we had better go my darling tabby so off went hatty with the cat in her arms but as she was going down the stairs she said i am sure for me to hear we will come some other time wont we pussy when the dragon is out of her den and we will have a quiet rummage you and i and well find her loveletters now is not that too bad what is one to do job could not have kept his temper if he had lived with hatty i wish she would get marriedi do fanny never interferes with any oneshe just goes her way and lets you go yours and when sophy interferes it is only because something is left untidy or you have not done something you promised to do she does not tease for teasings sake like hatty and then when i came down after having composed my face and passed hatty on my way into the parlour what should she say but didnt you wish i was in heaven just now i should not have cared where you were if you had kept out of the garret said i hatty gave one of her odious giggles and away she went now how can i live at peace with hatty will anybody tell me i am so delighted my aunt kezia has come into my plan for having the bracewells here at christmas along with the drummonds it might be as well said she if we could do some good to that poor frivolous thing amelia but dont you get too much taken up with her caroline my dear she is a silly maid at best oh amelia is fannys friend not mine aunt kezia said i and charlotte is sophys and is flora to be yours said aunt kezia i have not made one yet i answered i do not know what flora is like as well to wait and see trow says my aunt kezia sam was bringing in breakfast while this was said and as soon as he had set down the cold beef he turned to my aunt kezia and said then shes just a braw lassie miss flora nae mair and nae less and shell bring ye a mickle gude and nae harm why how do you know sam asked my aunt kezia hoots my mithers sisters daughter was her nurse said he helen raeburn they ca her and her mans ane o the macdonalds trust me but i hae heard monie a tale o thae drummondstheir faither and mither and their gudesire and minnie an a what is angus like sam said i atweel hes a bonnie laddie but no just sam stopped short and pulled a face not just what says my aunt kezia yell be best to find oot for yersel mrs kezia im thinkin and off trudged sam after jelly and we got no more out of him i wonder where the living creature is that could stand hatty there was i at work this morning in the parlour when in she camethere were sophy and fanny tooholding up something above her head busk ye busk ye my bonnie bonnie bride sang hatty look what ive found just now in the garret oh yes miss caroline you can look too hatty if you dont give me that book this minute cried i i did think i had hidden it out of search of your prying fingers dear yes and of my bright eyes i feel no doubt laughed hatty you are not quite so clever as you fancy miss caroline carlisle is a charming city but it does not hold all the brains in the world what is it hatty said sophy dont tease the child wait a little miss sophia if you please this is a most interesting and savoury volume wherein miss caroline courtenay sets down her convictions on all manner of subjects in general and her unfortunate sisters in particular i find hatty do be reasonable and give the child her book said fanny it is a shame oh you keep one too do you miss frances laughed hatty i had my suspicions i will own what do you mean said fanny flushing only that the rims of your pearly ears would not be quite so ruddy my charmer if you were not in like case well i find from this book that we are none of us perfect but so far as i can gather fanny comes nearest the angelic world of any of us as to hatty you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you have been so dishonourable as to read what was not meant for any one to see my beloved sophy dont halloo till you are out of the wood and you are not out by any means you are vulgar and illbred my dear you say coom and boot and you are only fit to marry a country curate and cut out shirts and roll pills i say what asked sophy disregarding the other particulars you say coom and boot my darling and it ought to be kem and bet said hatty with such an affected pronunciation that sophy and fanny both burst out laughing what do you mean said sophy amid her laughter thenfanny my dear you are not to escape you are better bred than sophy because you take castor oil hatty what nonsense you are talking i cried unable to endure any longer but hatty went on taking no notice but you drop your rs deah and say deah carolinecant manage it right my dearand you are slow and affected hatty you know i never said so i screamed then as to me pursued hatty casting her eyes up to the ceiling as to poor me i amwell not one of the angels on any consideration i tease my sweetest sister in the most cruel manner well that is true hatty if nothing else is said fanny i have horrid glazed red cheeks and i eat like a ploughboy and i dont take castor oil castor oil is evidently one of the christian graces how can you be so ridiculous said sophy see you have made the poor child cry with passion my dear which is a very wicked thing as i am sure my aunt kezia would tell her a little castor oil would what is that about your aunt kezia came in another voice from the doorway oh i was so glad to see her hoitytoity why what is all this girls said she severely hester what are you doing what is cary crying for hatty is teasing her aunt said fanny she is always doing it i think give me that book hester said my aunt kezia and hatty passed it to her without a word now whom does this book belong it is mine aunt kezia i said as well as my sobs would let me and hatty has found it and she is teasing me dreadfully about it what is it my dear said my aunt kezia it is my diary aunt kezia and i did not want hatty to get hold of it she says such things aunt kezia you cant imagine about you and all of us i am sure i never said anything about you aunt kezia i sobbed if you did my dear i dare say it was nothing worse than all of you have thought in turn saith my aunt kezia drily hester you will go to bed as soon as the dark comes take your book cary and remember my dear whenever you write in it again that god is looking at every word you write hatty made a horrid face at me behind my aunt kezias back but i dont believe she really cared anything about it she went to bed of course and it is dark now by halfpast five but she was not a bit daunted for i heard her singing as she lay in bed fair rosalind in woful wise note and afterwards i hae nae kith i hae nae kin note if father had heard that last my aunt kezia would have had to forgive her and let her off the rest of her sentence i have found a new hidingplace for my book where i do not think hatty will find it in a hurry but when i sit down to write now my aunt kezias words come back to me with an awful sound god is looking at every word you write i suppose it is so but somehow i never rightly took it in before i hardly think i should have written some words if i had was that what my aunt kezia meant note this and similar expressions are northern provincialisms note fair rosalind in woful wise six hearts has bound in thrall as yet she undetermined lies which she her spouse shall call note perhaps the most plaintive and poetical of all the popular jacobite ballads chapter two tawny eyes she has two eyes so soft and brown take care she gives a sideglance and looks down beware beware trust her not she is fooling thee longfellow here they all are at last and the house is as full as it will hold the bracewells came first in their great family coach and four charlotte and amelia and a young friend whom they had with them her name is cecilia osborne and she is such a genteellooking girl she moves about not languidly like amelia but in such a graceful airy way as i never saw she has dark hair nearly black and brown eyes with a sort of tawny light in themlarge eyes which gleam out on you just when you are not expecting it for she generally looks down amelia appears more listless and affected than ever by the side of her and charlottes hoydenish romping seems worse and more vulgar the drummonds did not come for nearly a week afterwards i was rather afraid what cecilia would think of them for i expected they would talk scotchi know angus used to doand cecilia is from the south and i thought she would be quite shocked but i find they talk just as we do only with a little scots accent as if they were walking over sandhills in their throatsas least that is how it sounds to me flora has rather more of it than angus but then her voice is so clear and soft that it sounds almost pretty a young gentleman came with them named duncan keith who was going with angus about that business he has to do they only stayed one night didnt note mr keith and angus and then went on about their business but father was so pleased with mr keith that he invited him to come back when angus does which will be in about three weeks or a month so here we are eight girls instead of four with never a young man among us father says when angus and mr keith come back we will have ephraim hebblethwaite and ambrose catterall to spend the evening and perhaps esther langridge too i dont feel quite sure that i should like esther to come she is not only as bad as sophy with her buts and her comes but she does not behave quite genteelly in some other ways and i dont want cecilia osborne to fancy that we are a set of vulgar creatures who do not know how to behave i dont care half so much what flora thinks cecilia has not been here a fortnight and yet i keep catching myself wondering what she will think about everything it is not that i have made a friend of her in fact i am not sure that i quite like her she seems to throw a sort of spell over me does cecilia as if i were afraid of her and must obey her i dont half like it my aunt kezia has put us into rooms in pairs while they are here in sophys chamber where i generally sleep are sophy and charlotte in fannys which she and hatty have when we are by ourselves are fanny and amelia in the green spare chamber are hatty and cecilia and in the blue one flora and me my aunt kezia said she thought we should find that the pleasantest arrangement but i do wish she had given flora to hatty and put cecilia with me i am sure i should have understood cecilia much better than hatty who will persist in calling her cicely which she says she does not like because it is such a vulgar nameand so common too cecilia says she wishes she had not been called by a name which had a vulgar short one to it she would like to have been either camilla or henrietta she thinks my name sweetly pretty but she wonders why we call hester hatty which she says is quite low and ugly and hardly is the proper short for hester she says hatty and gatty are properly short for harriet and hester should be essie which is much prettier but then we call esther langridge essie and we could not do with two essies i know father used to call mamma gatty but grandmamma said she always thought it so vulgar grandmamma was always talking about things being vulgar and so is cecilia i notice that some peoplefor instance my aunt kezia and floranever seem to think whether things are vulgar or not cecilia says that is because they are so vulgar they dont know it i wonder if it be but cecilia saysshe said i was not to repeat it thoughthat my aunt kezia and sophy are below vulgarity when we were dressing one morning i asked flora what she thought she is as genteel in her manners as cecilia herself only in quite a different way cecilia behaves as if she wanted you to notice how genteel she is flora is just herself it seems to come natural to her as if she never thought about it so i asked flora what she thought vulgarity meant and if people could be below vulgarity i should not think they could get below it said she it is easy to get above it if you only go the right way how can you get below a thing which is down at the bottom but how would you do flora not to be vulgar learn good manners and then never think about them but you must keep up your company manners said i why have any said she what always have ones company manners on cried i and be courtesying and bowing to ones sisters as if they were people one had never seen before nay those are ceremonies not manners said flora by manners i do not understand ceremonies but just the way you behave to anybody at any time it is not a ceremony to set a chair for a lame man nor to shut a door lest the draught blow on a sick woman it is not a ceremony to eat with a knife and fork or to see that somebody else is comfortable before you make yourself so why but that is just kindness cried i what are manners but kindness said flora let a maiden only try to be as kind as she can to every creature of god and she will not find much said in reproof of her manners are you always trying to be kind to everybody flora i hope so cary she said gravely flora have you any friend said i i mean a particular frienda girl friend like yourself yes she said my chief friend is annas keith mr duncan keiths sister yes said flora do tell me what she is like said i i am not sure that i could said flora and if i did it would only be like looking at a map suppose somebody showed you a map of the british isles and put his finger on a little pink spot and told you that was selkirk how much wiser would you be you could not see the yarrow and ettrick and breathe the caller air and gather the purple heather and i dont think describing people is much better than to show places on a map such different things strike different people how said i i dont see how they could in the same face as we were coming from carlisle with uncle courtenay said flora smiling i asked him to tell me what you were like cary well what did father say i said and i felt very much amused he said oh a girl with a pale face and a lot of light thatch on it with fine ways that she picked up in carlisle but when i came to see you i thought that if i had had to describe you those were just the things i should not have mentioned come then describe me flora said i laughing what do you see i see two large earnestlooking blue eyes she said under a broad white forehead eyes that look right at you clear honest eyesnot at least the sort of eyes i like to look at me then i see a small nose let my nose alone please said i i know it turns up and i dont want to hear you say so flora laughed very well i will leave your nose alone underneath it i see two small red lips and a little forward chin a rather selfwilled little chin if you please caryand a good figure which has learned to hold itself up and to walk gracefully will that do for a description yes i said looking in the glass i suppose that is me is it cary that may be all i see but is it you why it is only the morocco case that holds you you are the jewel inside and what that is really and fully i cannot see god can see it and you can see some of it but i can see only what you choose to show me or now and then what you cannot help showing me do you know that you are a very queer girl flora girls dont talk in that way cecilia osborne told me yesterday she thought you a very curious girl indeed i think my match might be found said flora rather drily for one thing cary you must remember i have had nothing to do with other girls except annas keith father and angus have been my only companions and a girl who has neither mother nor sisters perhaps gets out of girls ways in some respects but you are not the only womankind as father calls it in the house said i oh no there is helen raeburn answered flora but she is an old woman and she is not in my station she would not teach me girls ways then who taught you manners flora oh father saw to all that helen could not she said helen could teach me common decencies of course such as not to eat with my fingers and to shake hands and so forth but the little niceties of ladylike behaviour that were beyond herfather saw to those well i think you have very pleasant manners flora i only wish you were not quite so grave thank you for the compliment miss caroline courtenay said flora dropping me a courtesy i would rather be too grave than too giddy that very afternoon cecilia osborne asked me to walk up the scar with her somehow when she asks you to do a thing you feel as if you must do it i do not like that sort of enchanted feeling at all however i fetched my hood and scarf and away we went we climbed up the scar without much talkin fact it is rather too steep for that but when we got to the top cecilia proposed to sit down on the bank it was a beautiful day and quite warm for the time of the year so down we sat and cecilia pulled her sacque carefully on one side that it should not get spoiledshe was very charmingly dressed in a sacque of purple lutestring with such a pretty bonnet of red velvet with a gold pompoon in frontand then she began to talk as if she had come for that and i believe she had it was not long before i felt pretty sure that she had brought me there to pump me how long have you known miss drummond she began well all my life in a fashion i said but it is nearly ten years since we met ten years is a good deal of your life is it not said cecilia darting at me one of those sideglances from her tawny eyes i tried to do it last night and made my eyes feel so queer that i was not sure they would get right by morning well i suppose it is said i i am not quite seventeen yet you dear little thing said cecilia imprisoning my hand what is miss drummonds father a minister said i a scotch presbyterian i suppose she said turning up her nose i did not think she looked any prettier for it well said i i suppose he is and mr anguswhat do they mean to make of him do you know flora hopes he will be a minister too his father wishes it but she is not sure that angus likes the notion himself dear me i should think not said cecilia he is fit for something far better what can be better i answered you have such charming ideas replied cecilia she put in another word which i never heard before and i dont know what it means she brought it with her from the south i suppose unsounsophyno unsophisticatedi think that was it it sounded uncommon long and fine i know i suppose scotch ministers have not much money continued cecilia i dont knowi think not i answered but i rather fancy my uncle drummond has a little of his own cecilia darted another look at me and then dropped her eyes as if she were studying the grass and mr keith she said presently is he a relation i dont know much about him said i only what i have heard flora say he is no relation of theirs i believe i think he is the squires son the squires son cried cecilia in a more interested tone and who is the squireis he richwhere is the place as to who he is said i he is mr keith i suppose i dont know a bit whether he is rich or poor i forget the name of the placei think it is abbotsmuir or something like that either an abbot or a monk has something to do with it and you dont know if mr keith is a rich man said cecilia i thought in rather a disappointed tone no i dont said i i can ask flora if you want to know not for the world cried cecilia laying her hand again on mine dont on any account let miss drummond know that i asked you such a question if you like to ask from yourself you knowwell that is another matter but not from me on any consideration i dont understand you miss osborne said i no you dear little thing i believe you dont understand me said cecilia kissing me what pretty hair you have and how nice you keep it to be sureso smooth and glossy come had we not better be going down do you think so down we came and found dinner ready and i do not think i ever thought of it again till i was going to bed then i said to florado you like cecilia osborne ithink we had better not talk about people cary if you please but there was such a pause where i have drawn that long stroke that i am sure that was not what she intended to say at first then you dont said i making a hit at the truth and i think hitting it in the bulls eye well no more do i flora looked at me but did not speak oh how different her look is from cecilias sudden flashes she has been trying to pump me i am sure about you and angus and mr keith said i and i think it is quite as well i knew so little what about said flora oh about money mostly said i whether uncle had much money and if mr keith was a rich man and all on like that i cant bear girls who are always thinking about money flora drew a long breath that is it is it she said in a low voice as she tied her nightcap but it was rather as if she were speaking to herself than to me cary perhaps i had better answer you i am afraid miss osborne is a very dangerous girl and she would be more so than she is if she were a shade more clever so as to hide her cards a little better dont tell her anything you can help but what shall i say if she asks me again because she wanted me not to tell you that she had asked but to get to know as if i wanted it myself tell her to ask me said flora with more spirit than i had expected from her when cecilia began again as she did asking me the same sort of things i said to her why dont you ask cousin flora instead of me she knows so much more about it than i do cecilia put her hands on my shoulders and kissed me because i like to ask you said she and i should not like to ask her my aunt kezia was just coming into the room miss cecilia my dear said she do you always think what you like of course mrs kezia said cecilia smiling at her then you will be a very useless woman said my aunt and not a very happy one neither happyah said cecilia with a long sigh this world is not the place to find happiness no it isnt said my aunt kezia for people who spend all their time hunting for it it is a deal better to let happiness hunt for you you dont go the right way to get it child i do not indeed answered cecilia with a very sorrowful look ah mrs kezia the heart knoweth his own bitterness that is scripture i believe yes it does said my aunt and it makes a deal of it too oh dear mrs kezia cried cecilia how could anybody make unhappiness if you dont you are the first girl i have met of your sort saith my aunt kezia turning down the hem of a kerchief then when she came to the end of the hem she looked up at cecilia my dear there is a lesson we all have to learn and the sooner you learn it the better and happier woman you will be the end of selfishness is not pleasure but pain you dont think so do you ah but you will find as you go through life that always you are not only better but happier with gods blessing on the thing you dont like than without it on the thing you do ay it always turns to ashes in your mouth when you will have the quails instead of the manna ive noted many a timefor when i was a girl and later than that i was as selfwilled as any of youthat sometimes when i have set my heart upon a thing and would have it then if i may speak it with reverence god has given way to me like a father with an obstinate child he has said to me as it were poor foolish child you will have this glittering piece of mischief well have your way and when you have cut yourself badly with it and are bleeding and smarting as i did not wish to see you come back to your father and tell him all about it and be healed and comforted ah dear me the dullest of us is quite as clever as she need be in making rods for her own back and then if our father keep us from hurting ourselves and wont let us have the bright knife to cut our fingers with how we do mewl and whine to be sure we are just a set of silly babes my dearthe best of us my aunt dorothea once told me said i that the papists have what they call exercises of detachment perhaps you would think them good things aunt kezia for instance if an abbess sees a nun who seems to have a fancy for any little thing particularly she will take it from her and give it to somebody else eh poor foolish things said aunt kezia bits of children playing with the fathers tools they are more like to hurt themselves a deal than to get his work done ay god has his exercises of detachment and they are far harder than mans he knows how to do it he can lay a finger right on the core of your heart the very spot where it hurts worst men can seldom do that they would sometimes if they could i believe but they cannot except god guides them to it manys the time ive been asked with a deal of hesitation and apology to do a thing that did not cost me a farthings worth of grief or labour and as lightly as could be to do another which would have gone far to break either my back or my heart different folks see things in such different ways ill be bound now if each of us were asked to pick out for one another the thing in this house that each cared most about we should wellnigh all of us guess wrong we know so little of each others inmost hearts that little kingdom your own heart is a thing that you must keep to yourself you cant let another into it you can bring him to the gate and let him peep in and show him a few of your treasures but you cannot give him the freedom of the city depend upon it you would think very differently of me from what you do and i should think differently of each of you if we could see each others inmost hearts better or worse mrs kezia said cecilia may be the one and may be the other my dear it would hang a little on the heart you looked at and a great deal on the one who looked at it i dare say we should all get one lesson we need badlywe might learn to bear with each other tis so easy to think oh she cannot understand me she never had this pain or that sorrow whereas if you could see her as she really is you would find she knew more about it than you did and understood some other things beside which were dark riddles to you that is often a mountain to one which is only a molehill to another and trouble is as it is taken if there were no more troubles in this world than what we give each other in pure kindness or in simple ignorance girls there would be plenty left then you think there were troubles in eden said cecilia mischievously i was not there said my aunt kezia after the old serpent came there were troubles enough ill warrant you if adam came off scotfree for saying the woman whom thou gavest to be with me eve must have been vastly unlike her daughters i was quite unable to keep from laughing but cecilia did not seem to see anything to laugh at she never does when people say funny things and she never says funny things herself i cannot understand her she only laughs when she does something and nine times out of ten it is something in which i cannot see anything to laugh atsomething which well if it were not cecilia i should say was rather silly and babyish i never did see any fun in playing foolish tricks on people and worrying them in all sorts of ways hatty just enjoys it but i dont however before anything else was said father came in and a young gentleman with him whom he introduced as mr anthony parmenter the vicars nephew he turned out to be the vicars grandnephew which i suppose is the same thing i am sure he must have come from the south he did not shake hands nor profess to do it he just touched the hand you gave him with the tips of his fingers and then with his lips as if you were a china teadish that he was terribly frightened of breaking cecilia seemed quite used to this sort of thing but i did not know what he was going to do and as for my aunt kezia she just seized his hand and gave it a good oldfashioned shake at which he looked very much put out then she asked him how the vicar was and he did not seem to know and how long he was going to stay and he did not know that and when he came to which he said thursday in a very hesitating way as if he were not at all sure that it was not wednesday or friday one thing he knewthat it was hawidly coldthere that is just how he said it i suppose he meant horribly my aunt kezia gave him up after a while and went on sewing in silence then cecilia took him up and they seemed to understand each other exactly they talked about all sorts of things and people that i never heard of before and i sat and listened and so did my aunt kezia only that she put in a word now and then and i did not before they had been long at it fanny and amelia came in from a walk in their bonnets and scarves and mr parmenter bowed over their hands in the same curious way that he did before amelia took it as she does everythingthat is in a languid limp sort of way as if she did not care about anything but fanny looked as if she did not know what he was going to do to her and i saw she was puzzled whether she ought to shake hands or not then fanny went away to take her things off but amelia sat down and pulled off her scarf and laid it beside her on the sofa not neatly folded but all huddled up in a heap and there it might have stayed till next week if my aunt kezia who hates amelias untidy ways had not said to her my dear had you not better take your things upstairs amelia rose with the air of a martyr threw the scarf on her arm and carrying her bonnet by one string went slowly upstairs when they came down together my aunt kezia said to fanny my dear you had better take a shorter walk another time we have not had a long one aunt said fanny looking surprised we only went up by the scar and back by ellen water i thought you had been much farther than that says my aunt kezia in her dry way poor emily note seemed so tired she could not get upstairs fanny stared and amelia gave a faint laugh my aunt kezia said no more but went on running tucks and amelia joined in the conversation between cecilia and mr parmenter i hardly listened for i was trying the new knitting stitch which flora taught me and it is rather a difficult one so that it took all my mind but all at once i heard amelia say the beauty of selfsacrifice my aunt kezia lapped up the petticoat in which she was running the tucks laid it on her knee folded her hands on it and looked full at amelia will you please miss emily bracewell to tell me what you mean mean aunt yes my dear mean how can the spirit of that sweet poetical creature murmured fanny behind me be made plain to such a mere thing of fact as my aunt kezia well said amelia in a rather puzzled tone i meani meanthe beauty of selfsacrifice i do not see how else to put it and what makes it beautiful think you said my aunt kezia it is beautiful in itself said amelia it is the fairest thing in the moral world we see it in all the analogies of creation my dear emily said my aunt kezia you may have learned latin and greek but i have not i will trouble you to speak plain if you please i am a plain english woman who knows more about making shirts and salting butter than about moral worlds and the analogies of creation please to explain yourselfif you understand what you are talking about if you dont of course i wouldnt wish it well a comparison then answered amelia in a slightly peevish tone that will do said my aunt kezia i know what a comparison is well let us hear it do we not see continued amelia with kindling eyes the beauty of selfsacrifice in all things in the patriot daring death for his country in the mother careless of herself that she may save her child in the physician braving all risks at the bedside of his patient nay even in the lower world when we mark how the insect dies in laying her eggs and see the fresh flowers of the spring arise from the ashes of the withered blossoms of autumn can we doubt the loveliness of selfsacrifice how beautiful murmured fanny do listen cary i am listening i said charming madam said mr parmenter stroking his mustachio undoubtedly all these are lessons to those who have eyes to see i did not quite like the glance which was shot at him just then out of cecilias eyes nor the look in his which replied it appeared to me as if those two were only making game of amelia and that they understood each other but almost before i had well seen it cecilias eyes were dropped and she looked as demure as possible some folks eyes dont see things that are there saith my aunt kezia and some folks eyes are apt to see things that arent my bible tells me that god hath made everything beautiful in its season not out of its season you see your beautiful selfsacrifice is a means to an end not the end itself and if you make the means into the end you waste your strength and turn your action into nonsense take the comparisons amelia has given us your patriot risks death in order to obtain some good for his country the mother that she may save the child the physician that he may cure his patient what would be the good of all these sacrifices if nothing were to be got by them my dears do let me beg of you not to be caught by claptrap theres a deal of it in the world just now and silly stuff it is i assure you selfsacrifice is as beautiful as you please when it is a mans duty and as a means of good but selfsacrifice for its own sake and without an object is not beautiful but just ridiculous nonsense then would you say aunt kezia asked amelia that all those grand acts of mortification of the early christians or of the old monks were worthless and ridiculous they were not designed to attain any object but just for discipline and obedience as for the early christians poor souls they had mortifications enough from the heathen around them without giving themselves trouble to make troubles said my aunt kezia and the old monks poor misguided dirty things i hope you dont admire them but what do you mean by saying they were not means to an end but only discipline if that were so discipline was the end of them but my dear discipline is a sharpedged tool which men do well to let alone except for children we are prone to make sad blunders when we discipline ourselves that tool is safer in gods hands than in ours but there is so much poetry in mortification sighed amelia i am glad if you can see it said my aunt kezia i cant poetry in cabbagestalks eaten with all the mud on and ditch water scooped up in a dirty pannikin there would be a deal more poetry in needles and thread and soap and water making verses is all very well in its place but you try to make a pudding of poetry and youll come badly off for dinner dinner said amelia contemptuously yes my dear dinner you dine once a day i believe dear i never care what i eat cried amelia the care of the body is entirely beneath those who have learned to prize the superlative value of the mind my aunt kezia laughed my dear said she if you were a little older i might reason with you but you are just at that age when girls take up with every silly notion they come across and carry it ever so much farther and just make regular geese of themselves tis a comfort to hope you will grow out of it ten years hence if we are both alive i shall find you making pies and cutting out bodices like other sensible women at least i hope so never cried amelia i never could demean myself to be just an everyday creature like that i am sorry for your husband said my aunt kezia bluntly and still more for yourself if you set up to be an uncommon woman the chances are that instead of rising above the common you will just sink below it into one of those silly things that spend their time sipping tea and flirting fans and making men think all women foolish and unstable and if you do thatwell all i have to say is may god forgive youcary i want some jumballs for tea just go and see to them so away i went to the kitchen and heard no more of the talk but what was i to do i knew how to eat jumballs very well indeed but how to make them i knew no more than mr parmenters eyeglass she forgets does my aunt kezia that i have lived all my life in carlisle where grandmamma would as soon have thought of my building a house as making jumballs maria said i my aunt kezia has sent me to make jumballs and i dont know how not one bit dont you miss cary said maria laughing well i reckon i do half a pound of butterwill you weigh it yourself missand the same of white sugar and a pound of flour and three ounces of almonds and three eggs and a little lemon peelthats what youll want note we were going about the buttery as she spoke gathering up and weighing these things and putting them together on the kitchen table then maria tied a big apron on me which she said was fannys and gave me a little pan in which she bade me melt the butter then i had to beat the sugar into it and then came the hard partbreaking the eggs for only the yolks were wanted i spoiled two and then i said maria do break them for me i shall never manage this business oh yes you will miss cary in time says she cheerily it comes hard at first till youre used to it most things does see now you pound them almondsi have blanched emand ill put the eggs in so we put in the yolks of eggs and the almonds and the flour and the lemon peel till it began to smell uncommon good and then maria showed me how to make coiledup snakes of it on the bakingtin as jumballs always are and i washed my hands and took off fannys apron and went back into the parlour i found there all whom i had left and hatty and flora as well when tea came and my jumballs with it my aunt kezia says very calmly pass me those jumballs my dear will you amelia wont want any she is an uncommon woman and does not care what she eats you may give me some because i am no better than other folks o aunt kezia but i like jumballs said amelia you do says my aunt kezia well but my dear they dont grow on trees somebody has to make them if they are to be eaten and tis quite as well we are not all uncommon women or i fear there would be none to eatcary you deserve a compliment if you made these all by yourself i hastened to explain that i deserved none at all for maria had helped me all through but my aunt kezia did not seem at all vexed to hear it she only laughed and said good girl isnt it horrid work said cecilia who sat next me in a whisper oh no said i i rather like it she shrugged her shoulders in what hatty calls a frenchified way catch me at it she said you can come to the kitchen and catch me at it if you like said i laughing but it is all as new to me as to you till a few months ago i lived with my grandmother in carlisle and she never let me do anything of that sort what was her name said cecilia desborough said i mrs general desborough oh is mrs desborough your grandmother cried she i know mrs charles desborough so well that is my aunt dorothea said i grandmamma is gone to live with my uncle charles how pleasant said cecilia you are such a sweet little darling and she squeezed my hand under the table i began to wonder if she meant it o cary cried cecilia the next morning do come here and tell me who this is who what is said i for i looked out of the window and could see nobody but ephraim hebblethwaite oh that handsome young man coming up the drive returned she that i said is he handsome why tis but ephraim hebblethwaite whom cried cecilia with one of her little shrieking laughs you never mean to say that fine young man has such a horrid name as ephraim hebblethwaite hatty had come to look over my shoulder well i am afraid he has said i just that exactly my dear returned hatty in her teasing way poor creature he is sweet on fanny is he asked cecilia in an interested tone surely she will not marry a man with such a name as that well if you wish to have my private opinion about it said hatty in her coolest that is to say her most provoking manner i rather thinkshewill i wouldnt do such a thing disdainfully cried cecilia nobody asked you my dear was hattys answer i hope you would not unless you are prepared to provide another admirer for fanny they are scarce in these parts i cannot think how you can live up here in these uncivilised regions cried cecilia the country people are all just like bears do they hug you so very hard said hatty they are so rough and unpolished continued cecilia sosoreally i could not bear to live in cumberland or any of these northern counties it is just horrid then hadnt you better go back again said hatty coolly i am sure i shall be thankful when the time comes answered cecilia rather sharply except you in this family i do think oh pray dont except us laughed hatty turning round the next minute to speak to ephraim hebblethwaite mr ephraim hebblethwaite this is miss cecilia osborne a young lady from the south pole or somewhere on the way who does not admire us cumbrians in the smallest degree and will be absolutely delighted to turn her back upon the last of us you know i never said that said cecilia rather affectedly as she rose and courtesied to ephraim ephraim is the only person i know who can get along with hatty he always seems to see through what she says to what she means and he never answers any of her pert speeches nor tries to explain things nor smooth her down as many others do miss osborne must stay and learn to like us a little better said he goodhumouredly where is fanny looking in the glass i imagine said hatty calmly hatty said i she is in the garden with sophy you are the nymphs of the winds laughed ephraim and hatty is the north wind are you sure she is not the east said i for i was vexed and as i turned away i heard hatty say laughing i do enjoy teasing cary for shame hatty answered ephraim who speaks to us all as if we were his sisters i assure you i do pursued hatty in a voice of great glee particularly when my lady puts on her grand carlisle air and sweeps out of the room as she did just now it is such fun i had slipped into the next window where they could not see me and i suppose hatty thought i had gone out of the door beyond i had not the least idea of eavesdropping and what i might hear when they fancied me gone never came into my head till i heard it you see hatty went on there is no fun in teasing sophy for she just laughs with you and gives you as good as you bring and fanny melts into tears as if she were a lump of sugar and father wants to know why she has been crying and my aunt kezia sends you to bed before darkso teasing her comes too expensive but cary is just the one to tease she gets into a tantrum and that is rich was it really cecilias voice which said she is rather vain certainly poor thing she is just as stuckup as a peacock replied hatty and tis all from living with grandmamma at carlisleshe fancies herself ever so much better than we are just because she learned french and dancing well if i had a sister i would not say things of that sort about her said ephraim bluntly hatty you ought to be ashamed thank you mr hebblethwaite i dont feel so at all answered laughing hatty and she really has no true polishonly a little outside varnish said cecilia if she were to be introduced at an assembly in town she would be set down directly as a little country girl who did not know anything it is a pity she cannot see herself better there are some woods that dont take polish nearly so well as others said ephraim in a rather curious tone i felt hurt was he turning against me too so there are said cecilia i see mr hebblethwaite you understand the matter pardon me miss osborne was ephraims dry answer i am one of those that do not polish well compliments are wasted on meparticularly when the shaft is pointed with poison for my friends and as to seeing ones self betteri wish madam we could all do that as ephraim walked away which he did at once i am sure he caught sight of me his eyes gave a little flash and the blood mounted in his cheek but he kept on his way to the other end of the room where fanny and amelia sat talking together i slipped out of the door as soon as i could that wicked deceitful cecilia how many times had she told me that i was a sweet little creaturethat my life at carlisle had given me such a polish that i should not disgrace the princesss drawingroom note and now i went into my garret and told my book about it and if i must confess the truth i am afraid i cried a little but my eyes do not show tears like fannys for ever so long after and when i had bathed them and become a little calmer i went down again into the parlour i found my aunt kezia there now and i was glad for i knew that both cecilia and hatty would be on their best behaviour in her presence ephraim was talking with fanny as he generally does and there was that hawid creature mr parmenter with his drawl and his eyeglass and all the rest of it indeed it is very trying he was saying as i came in but he never sounds an r so that he said vewy twying i dont know whether it is that he cant or that he wont very trying truly madam to see men give their lives for a falling cause distressingquite so i dont know that it hurts me to see a man give his life for a falling cause saith my aunt kezia sometimes that is one of the grandest things a man can do but to see a man give his life up for a false causea young man especially full of hope and fervency whose life might have been made a blessing to his friends and the worldthat is trying mr parmenter if you like are we not bound to give our lives for the cause of truth and beauty asked amelia in that low voice which sounds like an aeolian harp truthyes saith my aunt kezia i do not know what you mean by beauty and i am not sure you do but my dear we do give our lives always for some cause unfortunately it is very often a false one what do you mean aunt said amelia why when you give your life to a cause is it not the same thing in the end as giving it for one answered my aunt kezia i do not see that it matters really whether you give it in twenty minutes or through twenty years the twenty years are the harder thing to dothat is all duncan keith says flora began and stopped let us hear it my dear if it be anything good quoth my aunt kezia i cannot tell if you will think it good or not aunt said flora he says that very few give their lives to or for any cause they nearly always give them for a person mr keith must be a hero of chivalry drawled mr parmenter showing his white teeth in a lazy laugh why do people always simper when they have fine teeth chivalry ought to be another name for christian courage and charity saith my aunt kezia ay childmr keith is right it is a pity it isnt always the right person how are you to know you have found the right person aunt said hatty in her pert way my aunt kezia looked round at her in her awful fashion then she said gravely you will find hatty you have always got the wrong one unless you aim at the highest person of all i heard cecilia whisper to mr parmenter oh dear is she going to preach a sermon and he hid a laugh under a yawn somebody else heard it too mrs kezias sermons are as short as some parsons texts said ephraim quietly and not in a whisper but you would not say observed mr parmenter without indicating to whom he addressed himself that this cause nowhaof which we were speakingthat the lives i meanhawere sacrificed to any particular person i never saw one plainer if you mean me said my aunt kezia bluntly what do ninetenths of the men care about monarchy or commonwealth absolute kings or limited onesstuart or hanoverian they just care for prince charles and his fine person and ringing voice and his handsome dress what else and the women are worse than the men some men will give their lives for a cause but you dont often see a woman do it mostly with women it is father or brother lover or husband that carries the day at least if you have seen women of another sort they havent come my way but aunt that is so ignoble a way of acting cried amelia as though she wanted to show that she was one of the other sort love and devotion to a holy or chivalrous cause should be free from all petty personal considerations you can get yours free my dear if you likeand find you can manage it said my aunt kezia i couldnt as to ignoble that hangs much on the person when queen margaret of scotland was drowning in yonder border river and the good knight rode into the water and held forth his hand to her and said grip fast was that a petty ignoble consideration it was a purely personal matter oh of course if you said amelia and did not go on things look very different sometimes according to the side on which you see them saith my aunt kezia i could not help thinking that people did so note emily was used during the last century as a diminutive for amelia there is really no etymological connection between the two names note in and about london the name of jumbles is given to a common kind of gingerbread to be obtained at the small sweetshops but these are not the old english jumball of the text note there was no queen at this time augusta of saxe gotha was princess of wales and the king had three grownup unmarried daughters note this provincialism is correct for lancashire and as far as i know for cumberland chapter three the huntsupper alas what haste they make to be undone george herbert before he went away ephraim came up into the window where i sat with my knitting mr parmenter was gone then and cecilia was upstairs with fanny and amelia cary said he may i ask you a question why ephraim i thought you did that every day i said feeling rather diverted at his saying such a thing ah common questions that do not signify said he with a smile but this is not an insignificant question cary and it is one that i have no right to ask unless you choose to give it me go on ephraim said i wondering what he meant are you very fond of miss osborne i never was particularly fond of her i said rather hotly and i felt my cheeks flush and if i had been i think this morning would have put an end to it she is not true he said she rings like false metal those who trust in her professions will find the earth open and let them in and i should not like you to be one cary thank you ephraim said i i think there is no fear your cousin amelia is foolish he went on but i do not think she is false she will grow out of most of her nonsense but cecilia osborne never will it is ingrain she is an older woman at this moment than mrs kezia older than my aunt kezia i am afraid i stared i do not mean by the parish register cary said ephraim with a smile but she is old in satans ways and wiles in the hard artificial fashions of the world in everything which if i had a sister i should pray god she might never know anything about such women are dangerous i speak seriously caroline i thought it had come to a serious pass when ephraim called me caroline it is not altogether a bad thing to know people for what they are he continued it may hurt you at the time to have the veil taken off and that veil whether by the people themselves or by somebody else is often pulled off very roughly but it is better than to have it on cary or to see the ugly thing through beautiful coloured glass which makes it look all kinds of lovely hues that it is not the plain white glass is the best when you do come to something beautiful then you see how beautiful it is then changing his tone he went onesther langridge sent you her love cary and told me to say she was coming up here this afternoon i did not quite wish that esther would keep away and yet i came very near doing it she is not a beautiful thingi mean in her ways and manners she speaks more broadly than sophy and much worse than the rest of us and she eats her peas with a knife which grandmamma used to say was the sure sign of a vulgar creature esther is as kindhearted a girl as breathes butoh dear what will cecilia say to her i felt quite uncomfortable and yet why should i care what cecilia says she has shown me plainly enough that she does not care for me but somehow she seemed so above us with those dainty ways and that soft southern accent and all she knew about etiquette and the mode and the stories she was constantly telling about great people sir george blank had said such a fine thing to her when she was at my lady dashs assembly and my lady camilla suchanone was her dearest friend and the honourable annabella this carried her to drive and my lord herbert that held her cloak at the opera it was so grand to hear her somehow cecilia never said things of that kind when my aunt kezia was in the room and i noted that her grand stories were always much tamer in floras or sophys presence she did not seem to care about hatty much either way but when there were only amelia fanny charlotte and me then i could not help seeing she laid the gilt on much thicker charlotte used to sit and stare and then laugh in a way that i thought very rude but cecilia did not appear to mind it when father came into the parlour she did so change oh then she was so sweet and amiableso delicately attentiveso anxious that he should be made comfortable and have everything just as he liked it i did think considering that he had four daughters she might have left that to us to ephraim hebblethwaite she was very attentive and charming too but in quite a different way but she wasted no attention at all on mr parmenter except for those sideglances now and then out of the tawny eyes which seemed to say that they perfectly understood one another and that no explanations of any sort were necessary between them i cannot make out what mr parmenter does for his living he is not a man of property for the vicar told father that his nephew mr parmenters father left nothing at all for his children yet mr anthony never seems to do anything but look through his eyeglass and twirl his mustachios and talk i asked amelia if she knew for one of the miss parmenters who is married now lives not far from bracewell hall amelia however applied to cecilia saying she would be more likely to know oh he does nothing said cecilia he is a beau now what does that mean put in hatty ill tell you what it means said charlotte emily you be quiet it means that his income is twenty pence a year and he spends two thousand pounds that he is always dressed to perfection that he is ready to make love to anybody at two minutes noticethat is if her fortune is worth it that he is never at home in an evening nor out of bed before noon that he spends four hours a day in dressing and would rather ten times lose his wife when he has one than break his clouded cane or damage his gold snuffbox isnt that it cicely you are so absurd said amelia languidly i told you to keep quiet was charlottes answer never mind whether it is absurd is it true well partly but i dont understand i said how can a man spend two thousand pounds if he have but twenty pence know ignorant creature replied charlotte with mock solemnity that lansquenet can be played and that tradesmens bills can be put behind the fire then you mean i suppose that he games and does not pay his debts that is about the etiquette note my charmer well i dont know what you call that down in the south said i but up here in cumberland we do not call it honesty the south oh hear the child screamed charlotte she thinks derbyshire is in the south they teach the children so my dear in the carlisle schools suggested hatty i dont know what they teach in the carlisle schools i said for i did not go there but if derbyshire be not south of cumberland i havent learned much geography oh dear how you girls do chatter cried sophy coming up to us i wish one or two of you would think a little more about what wants doing cary you might have made the turnovers for supper i am sure i have enough on my hands but sophy i do not know how said i then you ought by this time she answered do not know how to make an apple turnover why it is as easy as shutting your eyes when you know how to do it put in hatty that is more than you do returned sophy for you are safe to leave something out hatty made her a low courtesy and danced away humming cease your funning just as we heard the sound of horses feet on the drive outside there were all sorts of guesses as to who was coming and none of them the right one for when the door opened at last in walked angus drummond and mr keith well you did not expect us i suppose said angus certainly not tonight was sophys answer we finished our business sooner than we expected and now we are ready to begin our holiday said he father came in then and there was a great deal of kissing and handshaking all round but my aunt kezia and flora were not in the room they came in together nearly half an hour later but i think i never saw such a change in any girls face as in floras when she saw what had happened she must be very fond of angus i am sure her cheeks grew quite rosyshe is generally paleand her eyes were like stars i did not think angus seemed nearly so glad to see her essie langridge was very quiet all the evening i fancy she was rather frightened of cecilia she said very little father had a long days hunting yesterday and angus drummond went with him mr keith would not go though father laughed about it and asked if he were afraid of the hares eating him up neither would he go to the huntsupper afterwards there were fourteen gentlemen at it and a pretty racket they made my aunt kezia does not like these huntsuppers a bit she would be glad if they were anywhere else than here but father being the squire of course they cannot be she always packs us girls out of the way and will not allow us to show our heads so we sat upstairs in sophys chamber which is the largest and most out of the way and we had some good fun first in finding seats for there were only two chairs in the room and then in playing hunt the slipper and all sorts of games i am afraid we got rather too noisy at last for my aunt kezia looked in with girls are you daft i protest you make nigh as much racket as the gentlemen themselves what mr keith did with himself i do not know i think he went off for a walk somewhere i know he tried to persuade angus to go with him but angus said he wanted his share of the fun i heard mr keith say in a low voice what would your father say angus oh my fathers a minister and they are bound to be particular said angus carelessly i cant pretend to make such a fash as he would i did not hear what mr keith answered but i believe he went on talking about it when i got upstairs with the rest however i missed flora and going to our room to look for her i found her crying i never saw flora weep before why flora said i what is the matter with you nothing with me cary she said but a great deal with angus you do not like his being at the supper i said i hardly knew what to say and i felt afraid of saying either too much or too little it seems so difficult to talk without hurting people not only that she said i do not like the way he is going on altogether i know my father would be in a sad way if he knew it i told flora what i had heard angus say to mr keith ah she said with another sob angus would not have said that three months ago i was sure it must have been going on for some time he has been in bad company i feel certain and angus always was one to take the colour of his company just as a glass takes the colour of anything you pour in what can i do oh what can i do if he will not listen to duncan ambrose catterall says that young men must always sow their wild oats i said when she stopped thus that is one of the devils maxims exclaimed flora earnestly god calls it sowing to the flesh and he says the harvest of it is corruption some flowers seed themselves thistles do did you ever know roses grow from thistle seed no whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap ah me for anguss harvest well i dont see what you can do said i there is the sting she replied it would be silly to weep if i did no in such cases i think there is only one thing a woman can doand that is to cry mightily unto god to loose the bonds of the oppressor and let the oppressed go free i dont knowi may be mistakenbut i hardly think it is of much use for women to talk to such a man it is not talking that he needs he knows his own folly very often at least as well as you can tell him and would be glad enough to be loosed from his bonds if only somebody would come and tear them asunder he cannot and you cannot only god can some evil spirits can be cast out by nothing but prayer cary flora broke off suddenly and looked up earnestly in my face dont mention this will you dear i should not have said a word to you nor any one if you had not surprised me i promised her i would not unless somebody first spoke to me she would not come to sophys room tell the girls she said that i want to write home for i shall do it presently when i feel a little calmer something struck me as i was turning away flora i said why do you not tell my aunt kezia all about it i am sure she would help you if any one could yes dear i think she would said flora gently but you see no one could and remember cary she called me back as i was leaving the chamber and came to me and took both my hands and her great sorrowful eyes which looked just like brown velvet gazed into mine like the eyes of a dog which is afraid of a scolding remember cary that angus is not wicked he is only weak but how weak he is she broke down with another sob but men should be stronger than women said i not weaker they are in body and mind replied flora but sex i suppose does not extend to soul there some men are far weaker than some women look at peter i dare say the maid who kept the door would have been less frightened of the two if he had taunted her with being one of this mans disciples well i should feel ashamed i said i am not sure if women do not feel moral weakness a greater shame than men do replied flora men seem to think so much more of want of physical bravery many a soldier will not stand an illnatured laugh who would want to fight you in a minute if you hinted that he was afraid of being hurt things seem to look so different to men from what they do to women and i think to the angels and to god i did not like to leave her alone in her trouble but she said she wanted nothing and was going to write to her father so i went back to sophys room and gave floras message to the girls dear i am sure we dont want her said hatty and charlotte added she is more of a spoilsport than anything else so we played at hunt the slipper and questions and commands and the parson has lost his cloak and blind mans buff and then when we got tired we sat downon the beds or anywherehatty took off the mirror and perched herself on the dressingtable and charlotte wanted to climb up and sit on the mantelshelf but sophy would not let her and then we had a round of how do you like it and then we went to bed in the middle of the night i awoke with a start and heard a great noise and sams voice and old wills and a lot of queer talking as if something were being carried upstairs that was hard to pull along and there were a good many words that i am sure my aunt kezia would not let me write andwell if he do look at what i am writing i should not like god to see them neither i felt sure that the gentlemen were being carried up to bedsuch of them as could not walkand such as could were being helped along i rather wonder that gentlemen like to drink so much and get themselves into such a queer condition i do not think they would like it if the ladies began to do such things i could not help wondering if angus were among them flora who had lain awake for a long while and had only dropped asleep as she told me afterwards about half an hour before for she heard the clock strike one slept on at first and i hoped she would not awake but as the last lot were being dragged past our door flora woke up with a start and cried what is that o cary what can be the matter i wanted to make as light of it as i could oh go to sleep i said there is nothing wrong but what is that dreadful noise she persisted well it is only the gentlemen going to bed said i just then sounds came through the door which showed that they were close outside somebodyso far as i could guess from what we heard was determined to sit down on the stairs and sam was trying to prevail upon him to go quietly to bed all sorts of queer things were mixed up with ithunting cries bits of songs invectives against hanoverians and dissenters and i scarcely know what else who is that wretched creature whispered flora to me i had recognised the voice and was able to answer it is mr bagnall said i the vicar of dornthwaite a minister was floras answer in an indescribable tone oh that does not make any difference i replied with the clergy about here mr digby is too old for it now but i have heard say that when he was a younger man he used to be as uproarious as anybody at last sams patience seemed to be exhausted and he and will between them lifted the reverend gentleman off his feet and carried him to bed despite his struggles at least i supposed so from what i heard about ten minutes later sam and will passed our door on their way back yons a bonnie loon to ca a minister i heard sam say as he went past but what could ye look for in a prelatist he gets up i t pupit and tells us our dooty of a sunda but who does hisn of a monda think ye was old wills response the footsteps passed on and i was just going to relieve my feelings by a good laugh when i was stopped and astonished by floras voice o cary how dreadful dreadful said i what is dreadful that wretched man she said in a tone which matched her words he does not think himself a wretched man by any means i said his living is worth quite two hundred a year and he has a little private property beside they say he does not stand at all a bad chance for a deanery his wife is not a pleasant woman i believe she has a temper but his son is carrying all before him at college and his daughters are thought to be among the prettiest girls in the county has he children poor things sighed flora why flora i cannot make you out said i i could understand your being uncomfortable about angus but what is mr bagnall to you cary i cannot describe the tone well said i is the lord nothing to me she said almost passionately nor the poor misguided souls committed to that mans charge for which he will have to give account at the last day my dear flora you do take things so seriously i said trying to laugh but her tone and words had startled me for all that it is well to take sin seriously said she men are serious enough in hell and sin is its antechamber you dont suppose poor mr bagnall will be sent there for a little too much champagne at a huntsupper said i i did not like it for i thought of father i have heard him singing old king cole and half a dozen more songs all mixed up in a heap after a huntsupper men always do it there and i can assure you mr bagnall is thought a firstclass preacher people go to hear him even from cockermouth that is worse than ever said flora a man who preaches the truth and serves the devilthat must be awful flora you do say the queerest things said i does your father never do so my father she answered in an astonished indignant voice my father cary butwith a change in the toneyou do not know him of course why cary if he knew that angus had been for once in the midst of such a scene as that i think it would break my fathers heart i wondered how angus had fared and if he were singing snatches of scotch songs in some bedchamber at the other end of the long gallery but i had not the cruelty to say it to flora when we came down the next morning i was curious to peep into the diningroom just to see what it was like the wreck of a ship is the only thing i can think of which might look like it half the chairs were flung over in all directions and two broken to pieces a quantity of broken glass was heaped both on the floor and the table dark wine stains on the carpet and pools upon the table not yet dry were sufficient signs of what the night had been bessy stood in the window duster in hand picking up the chairs and setting them in their places didnt the gentlemen enjoy theirselves miss cary said she my word but they made a night ont id like to ha been wi em just for to see i made no answer beyond nodding my head floras words came back to meit is well to take sin seriously i could not laugh and jest as i dare say i should have done but for them when i came into the parlour i only found three of all the gentlemen in the housefather mr keith and ambrose catterall i thought father seemed rather cross and he was finding fault with everybody for something sophys hair was rough and hatty had put on a gown he did not like and fannys ruffle had a hole in it and then he turned round and scolded my aunt kezia for not having us in better order my aunt kezia said never a word but i felt sure from her drawn brow and set lips as she stood making tea that she could have said a great many mr keith was silent and grave ambrose catterall seemed to think it his duty to make fun for everybody and he laughed and joked and chattered away finely i asked where old mr catterall was oh in bed with a headache laughed ambrose like everybody else this morning speak for yourself said mr keith i have not one well mines going returned ambrose gaily a cup of mrs kezias capital tea will finish it off finish what off asked my aunt kezia my last nights headache said he that tea must have come from heaven then instead of china replied she nay ambrose catterall it will take blood to finish off the consequence of your doings last night why mrs kezia are you going to fight me asked he laughing young man why dont you fight the devil answered my aunt kezia looking him full in the face he does not pay good wages ambrose never saw the colour of his money yet said ambrose who seemed extremely amused i wish you never may quoth my aunt but i sadly fear you are going the way to do it the more ambrose laughed the graver my aunt kezia seemed to grow before we had finished breakfast angus came languidly into the room what ails you old comrade said ambrose and floras eyes looked up with the same question but i think there were tears on the brown velvet oh my head aches confi meanabominably said angus flushing take a hair of the dog that bit you suggested ambrose unless you think humble pie will agree with you better i fancy miss drummond would rather help you to that last i saw a flash in mr keiths eyes which gave me the idea that he might not be a pleasant person to meet alone in a glen at midnight if he had no scruples as to what he did you hold your tongue growled angus by all means if you prefer it said ambrose lightly one after another the gentlemen strolled inall but two who stayed in bed till afternoon and of these mr catterall was one among the last to appear was mr bagnall but he looked quite fresh and gay when he came like ambrose we had to say grace for ourselves mr bagnall said father sit down and let me help you to some of this turkey pie thanksif you please what a lovely morning was mr bagnalls answer the young ladies look like fresh rosebuds with the dew on them we have not you gentlemen to thank for it if we do broke in hatty our slumbers were all the less profound for your kind assistance oh yes you can look mr bagnall i mean you i heard sally in our alley about one oclock this morning no was i singing that now said mr bagnall laughing i did not know i got quite so far but at a huntsupper you know everything is excusable would you give me a reference to the passage which says so mr bagnall came from behind the teapot i should like to note it in my bible mr bagnall laughed again but rather uncomfortably my dear mrs kezia you do not imagine the bible has anything to do with a huntsupper it is to be hoped i dont or i should be woefully disappointed she answered but i always thought mr bagnall that the word of god and the ministers of god should have something to do with one another kezia keep your puritan notions to yourself roared father from the other end of the table and he put some words before it which i would rather not write i cant think he went on looking round wherever kezia can have picked up such mad whims as she has for a sister of mine to say such a thing to a clergymani declare it makes my hair stand on end your hair may lie down again brother ive done said my aunt kezia coolly as to where i got it i should think you might know it runs in the blood and i suppose deborah hunter was your grandmother as well as mine fathers reply was full of the words i do not want to write but it was not a compliment to his grandmother come mrs kezia said mr bagnall let us make it up by glasses all round and a toast to the sweet puritan memory of mrs deborah hunter no thank you said my aunt kezia as to deborah hunter she has been a saint in heaven these thirty years and finely shed like it if she knew it to have you drinking yourselves drunk in her honour but let me tell youand you can say what you like after itshe taught me that the chief end of man was to glorify god and to enjoy him for ever your notion seems to be that the chief end of man is to glorify himself and to enjoy him for ever i think mines the better of the two and as to yours the worst thing i wish any of you is that you may get mine instead of it now then brother ive had my say and you can have yours and not another word did my aunt kezia say though father stormed and the other gentlemen laughed and joked and paid her sarcastic compliments all the while breakfast lasted there were two who were silent and those were angus and mr keith angus seemed too poorly and unhappy to take any interest in the matter and as to mr keith i believe in his heart if i read it right in his eyes that he was perfectly delighted with my aunt kezia the young ladies did not honour us by riding to the meet said mr bagnall at last looking at that one of us who sat nearest himwhich by ill luck happened to be flora no sir i do not think my aunt would have allowed it but flora stopped and cast her eyes on her plate but if she had you would have been pleased to come suggested mr bagnall rubbing his hands he spoke in that disagreeable way in which some men do speak to girlsi do not know what to call it it is a condescending patronising kind of manner as ifyes that is itas if they wanted to amuse themselves by hearing the opinion of something so totally incapable of forming one i wish they knew how the girls long to shake the nonsense out of them but flora did not lose her temper as i should have done she held her own with a quiet dignity which i envied but could never have imitated pardon me sir i was about to say the direct contrarythat if my aunt had allowed it i for one would rather not have gone afraid of a fall eh laughed mr bagnall well ladies are not expected to be as venturesome as men now why do men always fancy that it is a womans duty to do what men expect her i cannot see it one bit i was not afraid of that sir said flora father with whom flora is a favourite was listening with a smile i believe aunt drummond was his pet sister no why what then said mr bagnall shaking the pepper over his turkey pie until i wondered what sort of a throat he would have when he had finished it i am afraid of hardening my heart sir said flora in her calm decisive way hardening your heart girl what do you mean said father hardening your heart by riding to hounds a little puzzling certainly said sir robert dacre who sat opposite we must ask miss drummond to explain he did not speak in that disagreeable way that mr bagnall did but flora flushed up when she found three gentlemen looking at her and asking her for an explanation i mean she answered that one hardens ones heart by taking pleasure in anything which gives another creature pain but i beg your pardon indeed i did not mean to put myself forward no no child we drew you forward said father kindly he gets over his tempers in a moment and he seemed to have quite forgotten the passage at arms with my aunt kezia still i do not quite understand said sir robert not at all unkindly who is the injured creature in this case miss drummond floras colour rose again the hare sir she said the hare cried mr bagnall leaning back in his chair to laugh well miss flora you are quixotic may i quote my father sir was her reply he says that don quixote supposing him a real person which i take it he was not was one of the noblest men the world ever saw only the world was not ready for him the world not ready for him no i should think not laughed father not just yet my little ladyerrant flora smiled quietly perhaps it will be some day uncle courtenay she said when the larks fall from the skyeh miss flora said mr bagnall rubbing his hands again in that odious way he has when they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain was floras soft answer surely you dont suppose that literal replied mr bagnall laughing why you must be as badi had nearly said as madas my next neighbour everard murthwaite of holme cultram you know he explained aside to father why he has actually got a notion that the jews are to be restored to palestine whoever heard of such a mad idea only thinkthe jews ridiculous nonsense said father is it not usually the case asked mr keith who till then had hardly spoken that the world counts as mad the wisest men in it why mr keith you must be one of them cried mr bagnall of the wise men thank you said mr keith drily there was a laugh at this but i can tell you of something queerer still mr bagnall went on old cis crosthwaite in my parish says she knows her sins are forgiven such exclamations came from most of the gentlemen at that preposterous said one ridiculous said another insufferable presumption cried a third cis crosthwaite said sir robert dacre more quietly yes cis crosthwaite repeated mr bagnall an old wretch of a woman who has never been any better than she should be and whom i met sticking hedges only last winter her son joe is the worst poacher in the parish all the gentlemen seemed to think that most dreadful i do not know why it is they always appear to reckon snaring wild game which belongs nobody a more wicked thing than breaking all the ten commandments would it not have been in them if it were only sir robert dacre said poor old creature dont let us saddle her with joes sins i dare say she has plenty of her own plenty i should think so she is a horrid old wretch answered mr bagnall and do but think if this miserable creature has not the arrogance and presumption to say that her sins are forgiven i suppose christ died that somebodys sins might be forgiven said mr keith in his quiet way of course but those are respectable people mr bagnall said rather indignantly before or after the forgiveness asked mr keith sir said mr bagnall rather stiffly i am not accustomed to discuss such matters as these at table are you not i am said mr keith quite simply but continued mr bagnall i thought every one understood the orthodox viewnamely that a man must do his best and practise virtue and lead a proper sort of life and then when god almighty sees you a decent and fit person and endeavouring to be good he helps you with his grace note of course said the vicar of seberghami suppose by way of amen men are to do their best then and practise these virtues in the first instance without any assistance from gods grace that gospel sounds rather ill tidings was mr keiths answer everybody was listening by this time sir robert dacre i thought seemed secretly diverted and hattys eyes were gleaming with fun father looked uncomfortable and as if he did not know what mr keith would be at from my aunt kezia little nods of satisfaction kept coming to what he said sir demanded mr bagnall looking his adversary straight in the face are you not orthodox he spoke rather in the tone in which he might have asked are you not honest may i ask you to explain the word before i answer was mr keiths response i mean are you one of these methodists certainly not i belong to the kirk of scotland mr bagnalls oh seemed to say that some at any rate of mr keiths queer notions might be accounted for if he were so unfortunate as to have been born in a different church but pursued mr keith seeing that the church of england and the kirk of scotland and the methodists all accept the word of god as the rule of faith they should all methinks be sound in the faith if that be what you mean by orthodox by orthodox said the vicar of sebergham after a sonorous clearing of his throat i understand a man who keeps to the articles of the church and does not run into any extravagances and enthusiasm hear him cried mr bagnall as if he were at a tory meeting hatty burst out laughing but immediately smothered it in her handkerchief i do hear him and with pleasure said mr keith i am no friend to extravagance i assure you let a churchman keep to the bible and the articles and i ask no more of him but excuse me if i say that we are departing from the question before us which was the propriety or impropriety of one saying that his sins were forgiven may i ask why you object to thatand is the objection to the forgiveness or to the proclamation of it sir said mr bagnall warmly i think it presumptionarrogance horrible selfconceit to have forgivenessor to say so i cannot answer such a question sir said mr bagnall getting red in the face and seizing the pepperbox once more with which he dusted his pie recklessly when a man sets himself up to be better than his neighbours in that way it is scandalousperfectly scandalous sir better than his neighbours repeated mr keith as if he were considering the question if a pardoned criminal be better than his neighbours i suppose the neighbours are worse criminals sir you misunderstand me they fancy themselves better than others mr bagnall was getting angry but seeing all are criminals alike and they own it every sunday was mr keiths answer does it not look rather odd that an objection should be made to one of them stating that he has been pardoned is it because the rest are unpardoned and are conscious of it come friends said sir robert before mr bagnall could reply let us not lose our tempers i beg mr keith is a scotsman and such are commonly good reasoners and love a tilt and tis but well in a young man to keep his wits in practice but we must not get too far you know just so just so saith father who i think was glad to have a stop put to this sort of converse mr bagnall i am sure bears no malice sir robert when do the holme cultram hounds meet next mr bagnall growled something i know not what and gave himself up to his pie for the rest of the time mr keith smiled and said no more but i know in whose hands i thought the victory rested note the word ticket was still spelt etiquette note these exact expressions are quoted in whitefields sermons chapter four things begin to happen the untrue liveth only in the heart of vain humanity which fain would be its own poor centre and circumference rev horatius bonar dd this afternoon i went up the scar by myself first i climbed right to the top and after looking round a little as i always like to do on the top of a mountain i went down a few yards to the flat bit where the old roman wall runs and sat down on the grass just above it was a lovely day i had not an idea that any one was near the place but myself and i was just going to sing when to my surprise i heard a voice on the other side of the roman wall it was angus drummonds duncan keith why dont you say something he broke out suddenly in a petulant tonerather the tone of a child who knows it has been naughty and wants to get the scolding over which it feels sure is coming some time what do you wish me to say mr keiths tone was cold and constrained i thought why dont you tell me i am an unhanged reprobate and that you are ashamed to be seen walking with me you know you are thinking it no angus i was thinking something very different what then asked angus sulkily doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it there was no coldness in mr keiths tone now what has that got to do with it growled angus in his throat angus was the soft answer the sheep sometimes makes it a very hard journey for him i know i ought to have risen and crept away long before this but i did not it was not right of me but i sat on i knew they could not see me through the wall nor could they get across it at any place so near that i could not be gone far enough before they could catch sight of me i suppose said angus in the same sort of sulky murmur that is your way of telling me mr keith that i am a miserable sinner are you not miserable enough heaven knows but duncan i dont see why you and flora and mrs kezia and all the good folks or the folks who think themselves extra good which comes to the same thing does it i was not aware of that said mr keith i cant see angus went on why you must all turn up the whites of your eyes like a duck in thunder and hold up your hands in pious horror at me because i have done just once what every gentleman in the land does every week and thinks nothing of it if you had not been brought up in a hencoop and ruled like a copybook you would not be so con so hideously strict and particular just ask ambrose catterall whether there is any weight on his conscience or ask that jolly parson who tackled you and flora at breakfast what he has to say to it ill be bound he will read prayers next sabbath with as much grace and unction as if he had never been drunk in his life and because i get let in just once why angus paused as if to consider how to finish his sentence and mr keith answered one point of his long speech letting all the rest go is it just this once angus i suppose you mean that night at york when i got let in with those fellows of greensmiths growled angus more grumpily than ever now duncan thats not generous of you i did the humble and penitent for that and you should not cast it up to me just that time and this and no more angus angus muttered something which did not reach me angus you know why i came with you yes i know well enough why you came with me said angus bitterly just because that stupid old meddler helen raeburn took it into her wooden head that i could not take care of myself and talked my father into sending me with you now instead of letting me go the other way round by myself could not take care of myself forsooth have you done it i hadnt it to do mr duncan keith was to take care of me just as if i had been a babystuff there is no end to the folly of old women i think young men might sometimes match them well angus i have taken as much care as you let me but you deceived me boy i know more about it than you think it was not one or two transgressions that let you down to this pitch i know you had a private key from rob greensmith and let yourself in and out when i believed you asleep angus sputtered out some angry words which i did not catch no you are mistaken leigh did not tell of you or his brother your friend robert told me himself he wanted to get out of the scrape and he did not care about leaving you in it the friendship of the wicked is not worth much angus but if i had not known it i should still have felt perfectly sure that there had been more going on than you ever confessed to me three months since angus you would not have used words which you have used this day you would not have spoken so lightly of being let inlet into what just stop and think and twice todayonce in floras presenceyou have only just stopped your tongue from a worse word than that would you have said such a thing to your father before we left abbotscliff uncle courtenay was as drunk as any of them last night angus blurted out i did not like to hear that of father till now i never thought much about such things except that they were imperfections which men had and women had not and the women must put up with them sinswell yes i suppose getting drunk is a sin if you come to think about it but so is getting into a passion and telling falsehoods and plenty more things which one thinks little or nothing about because one sees everybody do them every day it is only the extra good people like my aunt kezia and flora and mr keith that put on grave faces about things of that kind but stay god must be better than the extra good people then will he not think even worse of such things than they do it was just because those three seemed to think it so awful and to be inclined to make a fuss over it that i did not like to hear what angus said about father grandmamma never thought anything about it she always said drinking and gaming were gentlemanly vices which the king himselfi mean of course the elector but grandmamma said the kingneed not be ashamed of practising i listened rather uneasily for mr keiths answer i am beginning to feel a good deal of respect for his opinion and himself and i did not want to hear him say anything about father that was not agreeable but he put it quietly aside if you please angus we will let other people alone both you and i shall find our own sins quite enough to repent of i expect you have not answered my question angus what question grumbled angus i fancy he did not want to answer it would you three months since have let your father see and hear what you have let me do within even the last week angus growled something in the bottom of his throat which i could not make out mr keiths tone changed suddenly angus dear old fellow are you happier now than you were then duncan i am the most miserable wretch that ever lived i want no preaching to i can tell you that last text my father preached from keeps tolling in my ear like a funeral belland it is all the worse because it comes in his voice remember from whence thou art fallen dont i remember it do i want telling whence i have fallen havent i made a thousand resolves never never to fail again and the next time i get into company all my resolves melt away and my hard knots come undone and i feel as strong as a spoonful of water and any of them can lead me that tries like an animal with a ring through his nose water is not a bad comparison angus if you look at both sides of it what is stronger than water when the wind blows it with power and you know who is compared to the wind awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out it is the wind of gods spirit that we want to blow the waterpowerless of itselfin the right direction it will carry all before it then oh yes all that sounds very well said angus but in a pleasanter tone than beforenot so much like a big growling dog but you dont know duncanyou dont know you have no temptations what can you know about it i tell you i cant keep out of it it is no good talking no temptations i wish that were true but you are quite right as to yourself you cannot keep out of it do you mean to add that god cannot keep you i did not hear anguss reply and i fancy it came in a gesture and not in words but mr keith said very softly angus will you let him keep you instead of the answer for which i was eagerly listening another sound came to my ear which made me jump up in a hurry almost without caring whether i was heard or not that was the clock of brocklebank church striking twelve i should be ever so much too late for dinner and what would my aunt kezia say i got away as quietly as i could for a few yards and then ran down the scar as fast as i dared for fear of falling and came into the diningroom feeling hot and breathless just as cecilia looking fresh and bright as a white lily was entering it from the other end the rest were seated at the table of course mr keith and angus were not there caroline where have you been saith my aunt kezia i trembled for i knew what i had to expect when my aunt kezia said caroline in full i am very sorry aunt said i i went up the scar andwell i am afraid i forgot all about the time my aunt kezia nodded as if my frank confession satisfied her and father said good maid as i slipped into the chair where i always sit on his left hand but cecilia who was arranging her skirts just opposite said in that way which men seem to call charming and women always see through and despise at least my aunt kezia says so am i a little late dont name it said father dear no my charmer cried hatty carys shockingly late of course but you are notquite impossible cecilia gave one of her soft smiles and said no more i really am beginning to wish the bracewells gone yet it is not so much on their own account amelia is vain and silly and charlotte rude and romping but i do not think either of them is a hypocrite charlotte is not i am sure she lets you see the very worst side of her and amelias affectation is so plain and unmistakable that it cannot be called insincerity it is on account of that horrid cecilia that i want them to go because i suppose she will go with them yes truth is truth and cecilia is horrid i am getting quite frightened of her i do not know what she means to do next but she seems to me to be always laying traps of some sort and for somebody i wonder if people ever do what you expect of them if somebody had asked me to make a list of things that could not happen i expect that i should have put on it one thing that has just happened sophy and i went up this morning to goody branscombes cot to take her some wine and eggs from my aunt kezia anne branscombe thinks she is failing poor old woman and my aunt kezia told her to beat up an egg with a little wine and sugar and give it to her fasting of a morning she thinks it a fine thing for keeping up strength we came round by the vicarage on our way back and stepped in to see old elspie we found her ironing the vicars shirts and ruffles and she put us in rockingchairs while we sat and talked old elspie wanted to know all we could tell her about flora and angus and i promised i would bring flora to see her some day she says mr keithmr duncan keiths father that isis the squire of abbotscliff a very rich man and a tremendous tory youre vara nigh strangers young leddies said elspie as she ironed away miss fanny she came to see me a twathree days back and miss bracewell wi her and there was anither young leddy but i disremember her name was it charlotte bracewell said sophy na na i ken miss charlotte ower weel to forget her though she has grown a deal sin i saw her afore this was a lassie wi black hair and een like the new wood the minister has his dinnertable wi the fine namewhat ca ye that now mahogany said i ay it has some sic fremit soun said old elspie rather scornfully i ken it was no sae

the coppercolourit een cecilia osborne said i what did you think of her elspie the iron went up and down the vicars shirtfront and i saw a curious gathering together of old elspies lipsstill she did not speak at last sophy said couldnt you make up your mind about her elspie i had nae mickle fash about that mrs sophy said elspeth setting down her iron on the stand with something like a bang and gin i can see through a millstane a wee bittie shell gie ye the chance to make up yourn afore lang nay mines made up long since answered sophy i shall see the back of her with a deal more pleasure than i did her face a month ago wont you cary i dont like her the least bit said i yell be wiser lassies young leddies gin yere no ower ready to say it said elspie coolly it was no ane o your white days when she came to brocklebank fells ay weel weel the lords ower a as we went down the road i said to sophy what did old elspie mean do you suppose i am afraid i can guess what she meant cary sophys tone was so strange that i looked up at her and i saw her eyes flashing and her lips set and white sophy what is the matter i cried dont trouble your little head cary she said kindly enough it will be trouble in plenty when it comes i could not get her to say more as we reached the door hatty came dancing out to meet us the rose is white the rose is red the sun gives light queen anne is dead ladies with white and rosy hues what will you give me for my news hatty you must have made that yourself said sophy i have just this minute laughed hatty now then wholl bid for my news i dare say it isnt worth a farthing said sophy well to you perhaps not it may be rather mortifying my sweet sophia you are the eldest of us but your younger sister has stolen a march on you you have played your cards ill miss courtenay fanny is going to be the first of us married unless i contrive to run away with somebody in the interval i dont know whomtheres the difficulty well i always thought she would be said sophy quite goodhumouredly she is the prettiest of us is fanny so much obliged for the compliment gleefully cried hatty cary dont you feel delighted is ephraim here now i said for of course i never thought of anybody else ephraim hatty whirled round laughing heartily ephraim my dear will have to break his heart at leisure ambrose catterall has stolen a march on him you dont mean that fanny and ambrose are to be married cried sophy with wideopen eyes i do madam and my aunt kezia is as mad as a hatter about it she would have liked ephraim for her nephew ever so much better than ambrose well i do think exclaimed sophy if ephraim did really care for fanny she has used him shamefully so i think said hatty i mean to present him on his next birthday with a dozen pockethandkerchiefs embroidered in the corner with an urn and a willowtree an urn you ridiculous child returned sophy that means that somebody is dead dont throw cold water on my charming conceits pleaded hatty now go in and face my aunt keziaif you dare we found her cutting out flannel petticoats in the parlour my aunt kezias brows were drawn together and my aunt kezias lips were thin and i trembled however she took no note of us but went on tearing up flannel and making little piles of it upon the table end sophy with heroic bravery attacked the citadel at once well aunt this is pretty news what is said my aunt kezia standing up straight and stiff why this about fanny and ambrose catterall oh that i wish there were nothing worse than that in this world my aunt kezia spoke as if she would have preferred some other world where things went straighter than they do in this hatty said you were put out about it aunt thats all hatty knows i think tis a blunder and fanny will find it out likely enough but if that were allgirls tis nigh dinnertime you had better take your bonnets off what is the matter with my aunt kezia said i to sophy as we went upstairs dont ask me said that young lady halfway upstairs we met charlotte oh what fun you have missed you two cried she why didnt you come home a little sooner i would not have lost it for a hundred pounds lost what charlotte lost what ask my aunt kezianow just you do my aunt kezia seems unapproachable said sophy charlotte went off into a fit of laughter and then slid down the banister to the halla feat which my aunt kezia has forbidden her to perform a dozen times at least we went forward made ourselves ready for dinner and came down to the diningparlour in the diningroom we found a curious group my aunt kezia looked as stiff as whalebone father pleased and radiant flora and mr keith both seemed rather puzzled angus was in a better temper than usual charlotte was evidently full of something very funny which she did not want to let out cecilia soft serene and velvety fanny looked nervous and uncomfortable hatty scornful while amelia was her usual self when dinner was over we went back to the parlour my aunt kezia gathered up her heaps of flannel gave one to flora and another to me and began to stitch away at a third herself amelia threw herself on the sofa saying she was tired to death and i was surprised to see that my aunt kezia took no notice fanny sat down to draw hatty went on with her knitting charlotte strolled out into the garden and cecilia disappeared i know not whither for an hour or more we worked away in solemn silence hatty tried to whisper once or twice to fanny making her blush and look uncomfortable but fanny did not speak and i fancy hatty got tired amelia went to sleep at last and all at once florahonest straightforward floralaid her work on her knee and looked up at my aunt kezias grim set face aunt kezia will you tell me is something the matter yes my dear my aunt kezia seemed to snap out satans the matter i dont know what you mean aunt said flora tis a mercy if you dont no child there is not much the matter for you the matters for me and these girls here well to be sure theres no fool like an old fcaroline i fairly jumped cant you look what you are doing you are herringboning that seam on the wrong side alas the charge was true i cannot tell how or why it is but if there are two seams to anything i am sure to do one of them on the wrong side it is very queer i suppose there is something wanting in my brains hatty saysat least she did once when i said thatthe brains are wanting however we sat on and sewed away till at last amelia woke up and went upstairs flora finished her petticoat and my aunt kezia told her to go into the garden only we four sisters were left then my aunt kezia put down her flannel wiped her spectacles and looked round at us i knew something was coming and i felt quite sure that it was something disagreeable but i could not form an idea what it was girls said my aunt kezia i think you may as well hear at once that i am going to leave brocklebank i fairly gasped in astonishment brocklebank without my aunt kezia it sounded like hearing that the sun was going out of the sky i could not imagine such a state of things is sophy to be mistress then said fanny blankly aunt kezia are you going to be married our impertinent hatty wanted to know no hester said my aunt kezia shortly at my time of life a woman has a little sense left or if she have not she is only fit for bedlam i do not think sophy will be mistress fanny somebody else is going to take that place otherwise i should have stayed in it what do you mean aunt kezia said fanny speaking very slowly and in a bewildered sort of way sophy said nothing i think she knew and all at once it seemed to come over meas if somebody had shut me up inside a lump of icewhat it was that was going to happen i mean my dear my aunt kezia replied quietly that your father intends to marry again sophys face and tongue gave no sign that she had heard anything which was news to her fanny cried never surely hatty said how jolly and then in a whisper to me wont i lead her a life i believe i said nothing i felt shut up in that lump of ice but aunt kezia what is to become of us all are we to stay here or go with you asked fanny your father desires me to tell you my dears said my aunt kezia that he wishes to leave you quite free to please yourselves if you choose to remain here he will be glad to have you and if any of you like to come with me to fir vale you will be welcome and you know what to expect what are we to expect if we stop here asked sophy in a hard dry voice that is more than i can say was my aunt kezias answer but who is it said fanny in the same bewildered way o fanny what a bat you are cried hatty i wonder you ask answered sophy i have seen her fishingrod for ever so long cecilia of course cecilia screamed fanny i thought it was some middleaged respectable gentlewoman hatty burst out laughing i never felt less inclined to laugh my aunt kezia had taken off her spectacles and was going on with her tucks as if nothing had happened well i will think about it said sophy i am not sure i shall stay i shall stay announced hatty i expect it will be grand fun she will fill the house with companythat will suit me and i shall just look sharp after her and keep her in order hatty cried fanny in a shocked tone i hope you will keep yourself in order said my aunt kezia drily little cary you have not spoken yet what do you want to do her voice softened as i had never heard it do before when she spoke to me it touched me very much yet i think i should have said the same without it o aunt kezia please let me go with you thank you cary said my aunt kezia in the same tone the old woman is not to be left quite alone then but it will be dull child for a young thing like you i would rather have it dull than lively the wrong way about said i and hatty broke out again would you said she when she had done laughing i wouldnt i promise you sophy dont you know a curate you could marry you had better if you can find one not one that has asked me was sophys dry answer you dont want me then miss hatty you would be rather meddlesome i am afraid said hatty with charming frankness you would always be doing conscience dont you intend to keep one returned sophy i mean to lay it up in lavender said hatty and take it out on sundays hatty if you havent a care please go on aunt kezia unfinished sentences are always awful things because you dont know how they are going to end youll end in the lockup if you dont mind said my aunt kezia and if i were you i wouldnt ill try to keep on this side the door said hatty as lightly as ever and when is it to be aunt kezia the month after next i believe isnt cecilia going home first to see what her friends say about it she has none belonging to her except an uncle and his family and she says they will be delighted to hear it hatty you had better get out of the way of calling her cecilia it wont do now you know but you dont mean aunt kezia that we are to call her mother cried fanny in a most beseeching tone my dear that must be as your father wishes he may allow you to call her mrs courtenay that is what i shall call her isnt it dreadful said poor fanny one thing more i have to say continued my aunt kezia laying down her flannel again and putting on her spectacles your father does not wish you to be present at his marriage aunt kezia came i think from us allindignantly from sophy sorrowfully from fanny petulantly from hatty and from me in sheer astonishment i suppose he has his reasons said my aunt kezia but that being so i think sophy had better go home for a while with the bracewells and hatty too you cary may go with flora instead if you like fanny of course is arranged for already as she will be married by then and will only have to stop at home i thought i would very much rather go with flora i have had a letter from your aunt dorothea lately my aunt kezia went on in which she asks for cary to pay her a visit next june but now we are only in march so as cary must be somewhere between times and i think she would be better out of the way she will go to abbotscliff with floraunless my dear she added turning to me you would rather be at bracewell hall you may if you like i would rather be at abbotscliff very much aunt kezia said i and i think aunt kezia was pleased aunt kezia dont send me away pleaded sophy do let me stay and help you to settle at fir vale i should hate to stay at bracewell and i should just like bustling about and helping you in that way wont you let me well my dear we will see said my aunt kezia and i think she was pleased with sophy too hatty declared that bracewell would just suit her and she would not stay at any price if she had leave to choose so it seems to be settled in that way fanny will be married on the ththat is three weeks hence and the week after hatty goes with the bracewells and i with flora to their own homes and my aunt kezia and sophy will remain here and only leave the house on the evening before the marriage it seems very odd that father should have wished not to have us at his wedding was it cecilia who did not wish it but i am not to call her cecilia any more when my cousins came in for tea they were told too charlotte cried well i never for which piece of vulgarity she was sharply pulled up by my aunt kezia amelia fanned herselfshe always does whatever time of year it may beand languidly remarked dear angus said castor and pollux for which he also got rebuked and after a sort of oh flora said nothing but looked very sorrowfully at us ceci mean miss osbornedid not appear at all until tea was nearly over and then she came in from the garden and mr parmenter with her that everlasting eyeglass stuck in his eye i do so dislike the man father never comes to tea he says it is only womens rubbish and laughs at ephraim hebblethwaite because he says he likes it i fancy few men drink tea my uncle charles never does i know but my aunt dorothea says she could not exist a day without tea and cards i wonder if it will be pleasant to stay with my aunt dorothea i believe she and my uncle charles are living in london now i should like dearly to see london and the fine shops and the lions in the tower and ranelagh and all the grand people and yet somehow i feel just a little bit uneasy about it as if i were going into some place where i did not know what i should find and it might be something that would hurt me i do not feel that about abbotscliff i expect it will be pleasant there only perhaps rather dull and i want to see my uncle drummond and floras friend annas keith i wonder if she is like her brother and i never saw a presbyterian minister nor indeed a minister of any sort i do hope my uncle drummond will not be like mr bagnall and i hope all the gentlemen in the south are not like that odious mr parmenter flora seems very much pleased about my going back with her i do not know why but i fancied angus did not quite like it can he be afraid of my telling his father the story of the huntsupper he knows nothing of what i heard up on the scar i do hope ephraim hebblethwaite is not very unhappy about fanny i should think it must be dreadful when you love any one very much to see her go and give herself quite away to somebody else and ambrose thinks of going to live in cheshire where his uncle has a large farm and he has no children so the farm will come to ambrose some day and his uncle mr minshull would like him to come and live there now of course if that be settled so we shall lose fanny altogether must there always be changes and breakups in this world i do not mean the change of death that we know must come but why must there be all these other changes why could we not go on quietly as we were it seems now as if we should never be the same any more if that uncle of cecilias would only have tied her to the leg of a table or locked her up in her bedchamber or done something to keep her down there in the south so that she had never come to torment us i suppose i ought not to wish that if she makes father happier ay but will she make him happy that is just what i am uncomfortable about i dont believe she cares a pin for him though i dare say she likes well enough to be the squires lady and queen it at brocklebank somehow i cannot trust those tawny eyes with their sidelong glances am i very wicked or is she will things never give over happening this morning just after i came downthere were only my aunt kezia mr keith flora and me in the diningparlourwe suddenly heard the great bell of brocklebank church begin to toll my aunt kezia set down the chocolatepot it must be somebody who has died suddenly poor soul cried she maybe ellen armathwaites baby it looked very bad when i saw it last on thursday hark the bell stopped tolling and we listened for the sound which would tell us the sex and age of the departed one then silence that meant a man ellen armathwaites baby girl it could not be then the bell began again and we counted it tolled on up to twenty thirtyforty we could not think who it could be surely not farmer catterall said my aunt kezia i have often felt afraid of an apoplexy for him but the bell went on past sixty and we knew it was not farmer catterall is it never going to stop said flora when it had passed eighty my aunt kezia went to the door and calling sam bade him go out and inquire still the bell tolled on it stopped just as sam came in at ninetysix who is it samone of the old bedesmen nay mrs kezia puir soul tis just the auld vicar mr digby we all cried together ay my mither found him deid i his bed early this morrow shes come up to tell ye an to ask gin ye can spare me to go and gie a haun for that puir witless body mr anthony parmenter seems all but daft miss osborne and amelia came in together and i saw cecilia turn very white oh dear how shall i give over calling her cecilia my aunt kezia told them what had happened and i thought she looked relieved what ails mr parmenter asked my aunt kezia deed and what ails a fule onie day said sam always more honest than softspoken hes just as ill as a bit lassiefair frichtened o his auld uncle now he is deid that neer did him a bawbees worth o harm while he was alive my mither says shes vara sure hell be here the morn begging and praying ye to tak him in and keep him safe frae his puir auld uncles ghaist hech sirs ill ghaist him gin he comes my way now sam keep a civil tongue in your head quoth my aunt kezia and dont let me hear of your playing tricks on mr parmenter or any one else you should be old enough to have some sense by this time i will come out and speak to your mother in a moment yes i suppose we must let you go what cuckoos there are in this world to be sure but mr parmenter did not wait till tomorrowhe came up this afternoon just as sam said he would father was not at home and to my surprise my aunt kezia would not take him in but sent him on to farmer catteralls i do not think the tawny eyes liked it for though they were mostly bent on the ground i saw them give one sidelong flash at my aunt kezia which did not look to me like lovingkindness i feel tonight what i think angus means when he says that he is flat everything feels flat fanny is goneshe was married on saturday amelia charlotte and hatty set forth on tuesday and they are gone i thought that cemiss osborne would have gone with them and have returned byandby but she stays on and will do so i hear almost till my aunt kezia goes when mrs hebblethwaite has asked her to stay at the fells farm for the last few days before the wedding it is settled now that my aunt kezia and sophy stay here till the day before it it does seem so queer for sophy to be here till then and not be at the wedding i dont believe it is fathers doing it is not like him flora angus mr keith and i are to start tomorrow but mr keith only goes with us as far as carlislethat is the first days journey then he leaves us for newcastle where he has some sort of business that horrid word and i go on with my cousins to abbotscliff we shall be met at carlisle by a scots gentleman who is travelling thence to selkirk and is a friend of my uncle drummond he goes in his own chaise with two mounted servants and both he and they are armed so i hope we shall get clear of freebooters on the border he has nobody with him and says he shall have plenty of room in the chaise it is very lucky that this mr cameron should just be going at the same time as we are i dont think angus would be much protection though i should not wish him to know i said so if ephraim hebblethwaite have broken his heart he behaves very funnily he was not only at fannys wedding but was best man and he looks quite well and happy i begin to think that we must have been mistaken in guessing that he cared for fanny perhaps it only amused him to talk to her fannys wedding was very smart and gay and everybody came to it the bridesmaids were we three esther langridge and two cousins of ambroses whose names are annabel catterall and priscilla minshull i rather liked annabel but priscilla was horrid sophy says i say horrid too often and about all sorts of things but if people and things are horrid how am i to help saying it i am sure priscilla minshull was horrid she reminded me of anguss saying about turning up ones eyes like a duck in thunder i never watched a duck in thunder and i dont know whether it turns up its eyes or it does not only priscilla did she seemed to think us all my aunt kezia said no better than the dirt she walked on and i am sure she need not be so stuckup for mr james minshull her father is only a parson and not only that but a chaplain too so priscilla is not anybody of any consequence i said so to flora and she replied that priscilla would be much less likely to be proud if she were i was dreadfully tired on sunday we had been so hard at work all the fortnight before first making the wedding dress and then dressing the weddingdinner and when i went to bed on saturday night i thought i never wanted to see another another wedding of course i mean however everything went off very well and fanny looked charming in her pink silk brocaded with flowers with white stripes down it here and there and a pink quilted slip beneath she had pink rosettes too in her shoes and a white hood lined with pink and trimmed with pink bows her hoop came from carlisle and was the biggest i have seen yet the mantuamaker from carlisle who was five days in the house said that hoops were getting very much larger this year and she thought they would soon be as big as they were in queen annes time we had much smaller hoopsof course it would not have been seemly to have the bridesmaids as smart as the brideand we were dressed alike in white french cambric with light green trimmings of course we all wore white ribbons i think father would have stormed at us if we had put on any other colour i should not like to be the one to wear a red ribbon when he was by note we wore straw milkmaid hats with green ribbon mixed with the white and just a sprinkle of grey powder in our hair cecilia would not be a bridesmaid though she was asked i dont think she liked the dress chosen and indeed it would not have suited her but wasnt she dressed up she worei really must set it downa purple lutestring note over such a hoop that she had to lift it on one side when she went in at the church door this was guarded with gold lace and yellow feathers she had a white laced apron purple velvet slippers with red heels and her lace ruffles were something to look at and wasnt she patched and hadnt she powdered her hair and made it as stiff with pomatum as if it had been starched then on the top of this head went a lace capit was not a hoodjust a little light flyaway cap with purple ribbons and gold embroidery and in the middle of the front a big gold pompoon what a contrast there was between her and my aunt kezia she wore a silk dress too only it was a dark stonecolour as quiet as a quakeress just trimmed with two rows of braid the same colour round the bottom and a white silk scarf with a dark blue hood and just a little rosette of white lace at the top of it aunt kezias hood was a hood too and was tied under her chin as if she meant it to be some good and her elbowruffles were plain nett with long dark doeskin gloves drawn up to meet them cecilia wore white silk mittens i hate mittens they are horrid things if you want to make your hands look as ugly as you can you have only to put on a pair of mittens the weddingdinner which was at noon was a very grand one it should have been for didnt my arms ache with beating eggs and keeping pans stirred hatty said we were martyrs in a good cause but i do think fanny might have taken a little more trouble herself seeing it was her wedding now let us see what had we there was a turkey pie and a boars head chickens in different ways and a great baron of roast beef cream beaten to snow sophy did that i am glad to say candied fruits and ices and several sorts of pudding for dessert then for drink there were wine and mead purl and burton ale well it is all over now and fanny is gone there will never be four of us any more there seems to me something very sad about it poor dear fanny i hope she will be happy i dare guess she will in her way says my aunt kezia she does not keep a large cup for her happiness

none but god can be our stay tis only by our hold on him we keep a hold on those who pass out of our sight across the seas or underneath the churchyard grass isabella fyvie mayo carlisle april the th or i really feel that i must put a date to my writing now when this is the first time of my going out into the great world i have never been beyond carlisle before and now i am going first into a new country and then to london itself if all go well news came last night just before we started that my lord orford is deadhe that was sir robert walpole and the electors prime minister father says his death is a good thing for the country for it gives more hope that the king may come by his own i dont know what would happen if he did i suppose it would not make much difference to us indeed i rather wish things would not happen for the things that happen are so often disagreeable ones i said so this evening and mr keith smiled and answered you are young to have reached that conviction miss caroline oh rubbish said angus only old women talk so angus will you please tell me said i whether young men have generally more sense than old women of course they have replied he the young men are apt to think so added flora but have young women more sense than old ones said i because i see whenever people mean to speak of anything as particularly silly they always say it is worthy of an old woman now why an old woman have i more commonsense now than i shall have fifty years hence and if so at what age may i expect it to take leave of me you are not talking sense now at any rate replied anguswho might be my brother instead of my cousin for the way in which he takes me up whatever i say pardon me said mr keith i think miss caroline is talking very good sense then you may answer her said angus nay returned mr keith the question was addressed to you oh all women are sillies was anguss flattering answer theyre just a pack of ninnies the whole lot of them it seems to me angus observed mr keith quite gravely that you must have paid twopence extra for manners flora and i laughed i was not rich enough to go in for any growled angus im not a lairds son mr duncan keith so you dont need to throw stones at me did i angus i beg your pardon angus muttered something which i did not hear and was silent i thought i had better let the subject drop but before we went to bed something happened which i never saw before mr keith took a book from his pocket and sat down at the table flora rose and went to the sofa motioning to me to come beside her even angus twisted himself round and sat in a more decorous way what are we going to do i asked of flora the exercise dear said she exercise cried i what are we to exercise a curious sort of gurgle came from anguss part of the room as if a laugh had made its way into his throat and he had smothered it in its cradle the word is strange to miss caroline said mr keith looking round with a smile we scots people madam speak of exercising our souls in prayer we are about to read in gods word and pray if you please it is our custom morning and evening but how can we pray said i there is no clergyman though i am not a minister replied mr keith yet i trust i have learned to pray it seemed to me so strange that anybody not a clergyman should think of praying before other people however i sat down of course on the sofa by flora and listened while mr keith read something out of the gospel of saint john about the woman of samaria and what our lord said to her but i never heard such reading in my life i thought i could have gone on listening to him all night the only clergymen that i ever heard read were mr bagnall and poor old mr digby and the one always read in a high singsong tone which gave me the idea that it was nothing i need listen to and the other mumbled indistinctly so that i never heard what he said but mr keith read as if the converse were really going on and you actually heard our lord and the woman talking to one another at the well he made it seem so real that i almost fancied i could hear the water trickling and see the cool wet green mosses round the old well oh if clergymen would always read and preach as if the things were real how different going to church would be then we knelt down and mr keith prayed it was not out of the prayerbook and i dare say if i were to hear nothing but such prayers i might miss the dear old prayers that have been like sweet sounds floating around me ever since i knew anything but this evening when it was all new it came to me as so solemn and so real this was not saying ones prayers it was talking to ones friend and it seemed as if god really were mr keiths friendas if they knew each other and were not strangers at all but each understood what the other would like or dislike and they wanted to please one another i hope i am not irreverent in writing so but really it did seem like that and i never saw anything like it before i suppose to the others it was an old wornout storyall this which came so new and fresh to me when we rose up angus said without any pause well i am off to bed goodnight all of you flora went up to him and offered him a kiss which he took as if it were a condescension to an inferior creature and then without saying anything more to mr keith or me lighted his candle and went away flora sighed as she looked after him and mr keith looked at her as if he felt for her i shall be glad to get him home said flora answering mr keiths look i think if he can only get back to father then perhaps aye said mr keith meaningly it is all well when we do get back to the father flora shook her head sorrowfully not that she answered o duncan i am afraid not that yet i feel such terrible fear sometimes lest he should never come back at all or if he do should have to come over sharp stones and through thorny paths so he bringeth them unto their desired haven was mr keiths gentle answer i know she said with a sigh i suppose i ought to pray and wait father does i am sure but it is hard work mr keith did not answer for a moment and when he did it was by another bit of the bible at least i think it was the bible for it sounded like it but i should not know where to find it wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord castleton april the sixth mr keith left us so early this morning that there was not time for anything except breakfast and goodbye i feel quite sorry to lose him and wish i had a brother like him not like angusdear me no why could we four girls not have had one brother about half an hour after mr keith was gone the scots gentleman with whom we were to travelmr cameroncame in he is a man of about fifty baldheaded and rosyfaced pleasant and chatty enough only i do not quite always understand him by six oclock we were all packed into his chaise and a few minutes later we set forth from the inn door the streets of carlisle felt like home but as we left them behind and came gradually out into the open country it dawned upon me that now indeed i was going out into the great world we sleep here tonight where flora and i have a little bit of a bedchamber next door to a larger one where mr cameron and angus are on monday we expect to reach abbotscliff i am too tired to write more abbotscliff manse april the ninth i really could not go on any sooner we reached the mansewhat an odd name for a vicarageabout four oclock yesterday afternoon the church which flora calls the kirk and the manse with a few other houses stand on a little rising ground and the rest of the village lies below but before i begin to talk about the manse i want to write down a conversation which took place on monday morning as we journeyed in which mr cameron told us some curious things that i do not wish to forget we were driving through such a pretty little village and in one of the doorways an old woman sat with her knitting oh look at that dear old woman cries flora how pleasant she looks with her clean white apron and mutch much flora said i what do you mean i thought it such an odd word to use what was she much flora looked puzzled and mr cameron answered for her with amusement in his eyes a mutch young lady said he is what you in the south call a cap the south cried i why mr cameron you do not think we live in the south i felt almost vexed that he should fancy such a thing for all that grandmamma and my aunt dorothea used to say i always look down upon the south all the people i have seen who came from the south seemed to me to have a great deal of wiliness and foolishness and no commonsense i suppose the truth is that there are agreeable people and good people in the south only they have not come my way when i cried out like that mr cameron laughed well said he north and south are comparative terms we in scotland think all england the southand so it is if you will think a moment you in cumberland i suppose draw the line at the trent or the humber lower down they employ the thames and a surrey man thinks sussex is the south tis all a matter of comparison what does a sussex man call the south said angus spain and portugal i should think said mr cameron but mr cameron said i asking your pardon is there not some difference of character or disposition between those in the north and in the southi mean of england quite right young lady said he they are different tribes and the lowland scots among whom you are now coming have the same original as yourself there were two tribes amongst those whom we call anglosaxons that peopled england after the britons were driven into walesnamely as you might guess the angles and the saxons the angles ran from the frith of forth to the trent the saxons from the thames southward the midland counties were in all likelihood a mixture of the two there are moreover several foreign elements beyond this in various counties for instance there is a large influx of danish blood on the eastern coast in parts of lancashire in yorkshire and lincolnshire and in the weald of sussex there was a flemish settlement in lancashire and norfolk of considerable extent the britons were left in great numbers in cumberland and cornwall the jutesa variety of danepeopled kent entirely nor must we forget the romans who left a deep impress upon us especially amongst welsh families tis not easy for any of our mixed race to say i am this or that why if most of us spoke the truth supposing we might know it we should say i am onequarter saxon oneeighth british onesixteenth iberian oneeighth danish onesixteenth flemish onethirtysecondth part romanand so forth now miss caroline how much of that can you remember all of it i hope sir said i i shall try to do so i like to hear of those old times but would you please to tell me what is an iberian my dear said mr cameron smiling i would gladly give you fifty pounds in gold if you could tell me sir cried i in great surprise he went on more as if he were talking to himself or to some very learned man than to me what is an iberian ah for the man who could tell us what is a basquewhat is an etruscanwhat is a magyarabove all what is a cagot miss caroline my dear there are deep questions in all arts and sciences and without knowing it you have lighted on one of the deepest and most interesting the most learned man that breathes can only answer you as i do now though i am far from being a learned mani do not know i will nevertheless willingly tell you what little i do know and the rather if you take an interest in such matters all that we really know of the iberii is that they came from spain and that they had reached that country from the east that they were a narrowheaded people the celts or later britons were roundheaded that they dwelt in rude houses in the interior of the country first digging a pit in the ground and building over it a kind of hut sometimes of turf and sometimes of stone that they wore very rude clothing and were generally much less civilised than the celts who lived mainly on the coast that they loved to dwell and especially to worship on a mountain top that they followed certain eastern observances such as running or leaping through the fire to belwhich savours of a phoenician or assyrian origin and that it is more than likely that we owe to them those stupendous monuments yet standing stonehenge avebury the white horse of berkshire and the white man of wilmington but what sort of a religion had they if you please sir said i for i wanted to get to know all i could about these strange fathers of ours idolatry my dear as you might suppose answered mr cameron they worshipped the sun which they identified with the serpent and they had moreover a sacred treeall doubtless relics of eden they would appear also to have had some sort of womanworship for they held women in high honour loved female sovereignty and practised polyandrythat is each woman had several husbands i never heard of such queer folks said i and what became of them sir the iberians and celts together he answered made up the people we call britons when the saxons invaded the country they were driven into the remote fastnesses of wales cumberland and cornwall some antiquaries think the picts had the same original but this is one of the unsettled points of history i wish it were possible to settle all such questions said flora so do the antiquaries i can assure you returned mr cameron with a smile but it is scarce possible to come to a conclusion with any certainty as to the origin of a people of whom we cannot recover the language if you please sir said i what has the language to do with it it has everything to do with it miss caroline you did not know that languages grew like plants and could be classified in groups after the same manner please explain to us mr cameron said flora it all sounds so strange but it is very interesting i said i want to know all about it if you want to know all about it answered our friend you must consult some one else than me for i do not know nearly all about it in truth no one does for myself i have only arrived at the stage of knowing that i know next to nothing thats easy enough to know surely said angus not at all angus it is one of the most difficult things to ascertain in this world no man is so ready to give an offhand opinion on any and every subject as the man who knows absolutely nothing but we must not start another hare while the young ladies question remains unanswered languages my dears are not made they grow the first languagethat spoken in edenmay have been given to man readymade by god but i rather imagine from the expressions of holy writ that what was granted to adam was the inward power of forming a tongue which should be rational and consistent with itself and if so no doubt it was granted to eve that she should understand himperhaps that she should possess a similar power the woman made the language sir you may be sure said angus they are shocking chatterers unfortunately my boy scripture is against you whatsoever adam not evecalled the name of every living creature that was the name thereof to proceedthe confusion of tongues at babel seems from what we can gather to have called into being a number of languages quite separate from each other yet all having a certain affinity the structure differs but some of the words are alike or at least so nearly alike that the resemblance can be traced take the word for father in all languages cut down to its root there is the same root found in all ab in hebrew abba in syriac pater in greek and latin vater in low dutch pere in french padre in spanish and italian father in englishay even the childs papa and the infants daddyall come from one root but this cutting away of superfluities to get at the root is precisely what a prentice hand should not attempt like an unskilled gardener he will prune away the wrong branches then sir i asked what are the languages which belong to the same class as ours ours young lady is a composite language it may almost be said to be made up of bits of other languages german or low dutch is its mother and the scandinavian groupswedish danish and so forthmay be termed its aunts it belongs mostly to what is called the teutonic group but there are in it traces of celtic and though more dimly perceptible even of latin and oriental tongues we are altogether a madeup nationto which fact some say that we owe those excellences on which we are so fond of priding ourselves please sir what are they i asked mr cameron seemed much amused at the question what are the excellences we have said he or what are those on which we pride ourselves they are often not the same andnotice it young ladies as you go through lifethe virtue on which a man plumes himself the most highly is very frequently one which he possesses in small measure i do not say in no measure well i suppose the qualities on which we english we are not english cried angus hotly for this purpose we are was mr camerons answer as i observed before the lowland scots and the northern english are one tribe but i was going to say when you were so rude as to interrupt me english and scots young gentleman angus growled out beg your pardon take it said mr cameron pleasantly now for the question on what good qualities do we plume ourselves well i think on steadiness independence loyalty truthfulness firmness honesty and love of fair play how far we are justified in doing so perhaps other nations are the better judges they i believe generally regard us as a proud and surly racequalities on which there is no occasion to plume ourselves much loyalty we have got to glory in said angus we have always tried replied mr cameron to run loyalty and liberty together and when the two pull smoothly undoubtedly the national chaise gets along the best unhappily when harnessed to the same chariot one of those steeds is very apt to kick over the traces but we will not venture on such delicate ground seeing that our political colours differ nor is this the time to do it for here is the inn where we are to dine when we drove up to the manse on wednesday the floor stood open and in the doorway was helen raeburn who had evidently seen our chaise and was waiting for us flora was out the first and she and helen flew into one anothers arms and hugged and kissed each other as if they could never leave off i was surprised to find helen so old i thought elspies niece would have been between thirty and forty and she looks more like sixty then flora flew into the house to find her father and helen turned to me youre vara welcome young leddy said she and the lord make ye a blessin amang us will ye come ben the now miss flora shes aff to find the minister bless her bonnie facebut if yell please to come awa wi me ill show ye the waymaister angus my laddie welcome hameare ye grown too grand to kiss your auld nursie my callant angus gave her a kiss but not at all like flora rather as if he had it to do and wanted to get it over well helen said mr cameron as he came down from the chaise and how goes the world with you my woman i wish ye a gude evening mr alexander said she the warld gaes vara weel wi me thanks to ye for speirin no that the warlds onie better but the lord turns all to gude for his ain the ministers in his study and hell be blithe to see ye now my lassiei ask your pardon but ye see im used to miss flora please call me just what you like i said and i followed helen up a little passage paved with stone and into a room on the right hand where i found flora standing by a tall finelooking man who had his arm round her shoulders and who was so like her that he could only be her father floras face was lighted up as i had seen it but once before so bright and happy she looked and here is our young guest your cousin said my uncle drummond turning to me with a very kind smile my dear may your stay be profitable and pleasant among usay and mayest thou find favour in the eyes of the god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust it sounded very strange to me did these people pray about everything i had heard father speak contemptuously of praying presbyters and i thought uncle drummond must be one of that sort but i could not see that a minister looked at all different from a clergyman they seemed to me very much the same sort of creature mr cameron was to stay the night at the manse and to go on in the morning to his own home which is about fourteen miles further flora carried me off to her chamber where she and i were to sleep and we changed our travelling dresses and had a good wash and then came down to supper during the evening mr cameron said laughingly well my fair maid who objects to the south have you digested the iberii i think i have remembered all you told us sir said i but if you please i am very sorry but i am afraid we do come from the south our family i mean my fathers father i believe belonged wiltshire and his father who was a captain in the navy was a courtenay of powderham whatever that means my sister fanny knows all about it but i dont understand itonly i am afraid we must have come from the south mr cameron laughed and so did my uncle drummond and flora dont you indeed young lady said the first well it only means that you have half the kings of england and france and a number of emperors of the east among your forefathers very blue blood indeed miss caroline i do not see how with that pedigree you could be anything but a tory mr courtenay is rather warm that way i understand oh father is as strong as he can be said i i should not dare to talk of the elector of hanover by any other name if he heard me well you may call that gentleman what you please here said mr cameron but i usually style him king george nay sandy do not teach the child to disobey her father said my uncle drummond the fifth command is somewhat older than the brunswick succession and the act of settlement a little said mr cameron drily little cary said my uncle softly turning to me do you know that you are very like somebody like whom uncle said i somebody i loved very much my child he answered rather sadly from whom angus has his blue eyes and flora her smile you mean aunt jane said i speaking as softly as he had done for i felt that she had been very dear to him yes my dear he replied i mean my jeannie you are very like her i think we shall love each other cary i thought so too mr cameron left us this morning today i have been exploring with flora who wants to go all over the house and garden and villagespeaks of her pet plants as if they were old friends and shakes hands with everyone she meets and pats every dog and cat in the place and they all seem so glad to see herthe dogs included i do not know about the cats as we went down the village street it was quite amusing to hear the greetings from every doorway atweel miss flora yeve won hame said one hows a wi ye my bairn said another a blessing on your bonnie een my lassie said a third and flora had the same sort of thing for all of them it was well jeannie is your maggie still in her place or i hope sandys better now or have you lost your pains isabel she seemed to know all about each one i was quite diverted to hear it all they all appeared rather shy with me only very kindly and when flora introduced me as her cousin from england which she did in every cottage they had all something kind to say that they hoped i was well after my journey or they trusted i should like scotland or something of that sort two told me i was a bonnie lassie but at last we came to a shut doormost were openand flora knocked and waited for an answer she said gravely to me a kings daughter lies here cary waiting for her fathers chariot to take her home a freshcoloured middleaged woman came to the door and i was surprised to hear flora say how is your grandmother elsie shes mickle as ye laft her miss flora only weaker im thinkin shell no be lang the now but come ben my bonnie lassie youre as welcome as flowers in may and hows a wi ye flora answered as we were following elsie down the chamber and round a screen which boxed off the end of it behind the screen was a bed and on it lay as i thought the oldest woman on whom i ever set my eyes her face was all wrinkled up yet there was a fresh colour in her cheeks and her eyes though much sunk seemed piercingly bright yere come at last she said in a low clear voice as flora sat down on the bed and took the wrinkled brown hand in hers yes dear mirren come at last said she im very glad to get home ay and thats what ill be the morn so soon mirren ay just sae soon i askit him to let me bide while ye came hame i ay thocht i wad fain see ye ance mairmy miss floras lads lassie hes gien me a that ever i askit himbut ane thing an that was the vara desire o my heart you mean said flora gently you wanted ronald to come home ay i wanted him to come hame frae the far country said old mirren with a sigh id hae likit weel to see him come hame to abbotscliff vara weel but i longed mickle mair to see him come hame to the fathers house its no for his auld minnie to see that but if its for the lord to see some ither day im content and he has gien me sae monie things that i neer askit him wi ane half the longing that i did for that i dinna think hell say me nay the now is he with you mirren dear i could not imagine how flora thought mirren was to know that but she answered with a light in those bright eyes ay my doo his left haun is under my heid and his richt haun doth embrace me i sat and listened in wonder it all sounded so strange yet flora seemed to understand and i had such an unpleasant sense of being outside and not understanding as i never felt before and i did not like it a bit i knew quite well that if father had been there he would have said it was all stuff and cant but i did not feel so sure of my aunt kezia and suppose it were not cant but was something unutterably realsomething that i ought to know and must know some day if i were ever to get to heaven i did not like it i felt that i was among a new sort of peoplepeople who lived as it were in a different place from mea sort of whom i had never seen one before that did not come from abbotscliff except my aunt kezia and there were differences between her and them my uncle drummond and flora and mr keith and this old mirren and i thought helen raeburn and mr cameron all belonged this new sort of people the one who did not seem to belong them was angus yet i did not like angus nearly so well as the rest and yet he belonged my sort of people it was a puzzle altogether and not a pleasant puzzle and how anybody was to get out of the one set into the other set i could not tell at all stop i did know one other person at brocklebank who belonged this new sort of people it was ephraim hebblethwaite he was not i thought well i dont know how to put ithe did not seem so far on the road as the others only he was on that road and not on this road and then it struck me too whether old elspie and perhaps sam were not on the road as well i ran over in my mind as i was walking back to the manse with flora who was very silent all the people i knew and i could not think of one other who might be on floras road father and my sisters esther langridge the catteralls the bracewells ceciliaoh dear nomr digby mr bagnall yet they were parsons mr parmenterno not one at all the four i named last my mind gave a sort of jump as if it were quite astonished to be asked the question but where did the roads lead flora and her sort i felt quite sure were going to heaven then where were angus and i and all the rest going and i did not like the answer at all but i felt that the two roads led in opposite ways and they could not both go to one place as we walked up the path to the manse helen came out to meet us my lassie she said to flora theres miss annas i the garden and leddy monksburn wad hae ye gang till monksburn for a dish o tea and miss cary wi ye floras face lighted up oh how delightful she said come carycome and see annas keith i was very curious to see annas and i followed willingly under the old beech at the bottom of the garden sat a girlwomanshe was not either but bothin a gown of soft camlet which seemed as if it were part of her i do not mean so much in the fit of it as in the complete suitableness of it and her her head was bent down over a book and i could not see her face at firstonly her hair which was neither light nor dark but had a kind of golden shimmer her hat lay beside her on the seat flora ran down the walk with a glad cry of annas and then she stood up and i saw annas keith a princess was my first thought i saw a tall slight figure a slender white throat a pure pale face dark grey eyes with black lashes and a soul in them some people have no souls in their eyes annas keith has yet i could not have said then and i cannot say now when i try to recall her picture in my minds eye whether annas keith is beautiful it does not seem the right word to describe her and yet ugly would be much further off she is one of those women about whose beauty or want of beauty you never think unless you are trying to describe them and then you cannot tell what to say about it she takes you captive there is a charm about her that i cannot put into words only it is as different from the spell that cecilia osborne threw over me at first as light differs from darkness the charm about annas feels as if it lifted me higher into a purer air whenever i had been long with cecilia my mind felt soiled as if i had been breathing bad air when flora introduced me miss keith turned and kissed me and i felt as if i had been presented to a queen we want to know you she said all floras friends are our friends you will come both of you i thank you miss keith said i i should like to come very much annas please she said quietly with that sweet smile of hers it is only when she smiles that she reminds me of her brother and how are the laird and lady monksburn said flora i did not know that the laird as they always seem to call the squires here had been a titled gentleman and i said so annas smiled our titles will seem odd to you said she we call a scots gentleman by the name of his estate and every lairds wife is ladyonly by custom and courtesy you understand my mother really is only mrs keith but you will hear everybody call her lady monksburn then if my father were here they would call him i hesitated and flora ended the sentence for me the laird of brocklebank and if you had a mother she would be lady brocklebank i thought it sounded rather pleasant and when is duncan coming home asked flora tomorrow or the day after we hope said annas i noticed that she had less of the scots accent than flora and mr keith has it scarcely at all i found after a while that lady monksburn is english and that annas has spent much of her life in england i wanted to know what part of england it was and she said the isle of wight why then you do really come from the south cried i do tell me something about it are there any agreeable people therei mean except you annas laughed i hope you have seen few people from the south said she if that be your impression of them only two said i and i did not like either of them one bit well two is no large acquaintance said annas let me assure you that there are plenty of agreeable people in the south and good people also though i will not say that they are not different from us in the north they speak differently and their manners are more polished but it is just that polish i feel afraid of i replied it looks to me so like a mask if we are bears in the north at least we mean what we say i do not think you need fear a polished christian said annas a worldly man polished or unpolished may do you hurt but are we not all christians said i and the words were scarcely out of my lips when the thoughts came back to me which had been tormenting me as we walked up from old mirrens cottage those two roads did annas mean that only those were christians who took the higher one only what was there in the air of abbotscliff which seemed to make people christians or in that of brocklebank which seemed unfavourable to it those are christians who follow christ said annas do you think they who do not have a right to the name i should like to think more about it i answered it all looks strange to me do think about it replied annas when we came to monksburn which is about a mile from the manse i found it was a most charming place on the banks of the tweed the lawn ran sloping down to the river and the house was a lovely old building of grey stone in some places almost lost in ivy annas said it had been the abbots grange belonging to the old abbey which gives its name to abbotscliff and monksburn and several other estates and villages in the neighbourhood here we found lady monksburn in the drawingroom busied with some soft kind of embroidered work and i thought i could have guessed her to be the mother of mr keith then when the laird came in i saw that his grey eyes were annass though i should not call them alike in other respects lady monksburn is a dear old lady and as she comes from the south i must never say a word against southerners again she took both my hands in her soft white ones and spoke to me so kindly that before i had known her ten minutes i was almost surprised to find myself chattering away to her as if she were quite an old friendtelling her all about brocklebank and my sisters and father and my aunt kezia i could not tell how it wasi felt so completely at home in that monksburn drawingroom everybody was so kind and seemed to want me to enjoy myself and yet there was no fuss about it if those be southern manners i wish i could catch them like smallpox but perhaps they are christian manners that may be it and i dont suppose you can catch that like the smallpox however i certainly did enjoy myself this afternoon mr keith i find can draw beautifully and they let me look through some of his portfolios which was delightful and when annas at her mothers desire at down to the harpsichord and sang us some old scots songs i thought i never heard anything so charming until flora joined in and then it was more delicious still i think it would be easy to be good if one lived at monksburn those grey eyes of annass seem to see everything i am sure she saw that flora would like a quiet talk with lady monksburn and she carried me to see her peacocks and silver pheasants which are great pets she says and they are so tame that they will come and eat out of her hand of course they were shy with me then we had a charming little walk on the path which ran along by the side of the river and annas pointed out some lovely peeps through the trees at the scenery beyond when we came in i saw that flora had been crying but she seemed so much calmer and comforted that i am sure her talk had done her good then came supper and then angus who had cleared up wonderfully and was more what he used to be as a boy instead of the cross gloomy young man he has seemed of late lady monksburn offered to send a servant with arms to accompany us home but angus appeared to think it quite unnecessary he had his dirk and a pistol he said and surely he could take care of two girls i am not sure that flora would not rather have had the servant and i know i would however we came safe to the manse meeting nothing more terrific than a white cow which wicked angus tried to persuade us was a lady without a head chapter six new ideas for cary o jesu thou art pleading in accents meek and low i died for you my children and will ye treat me so o lord with shame and sorrow we open now the door dear saviour enter enter and leave us never more bishop walsham how as we drank our tea this evening i said uncle will you please tell me something surely my dear if i can answered my uncle drummond kindly laying down his book are all the people at abbotscliff going to heaven i really meant it but my uncle drummond put on such a droll expression and angus laughed so much that i woke up to see that they thought i had said something very queer when my uncle spoke it was not at first to me flora said he where have you taken your cousin only into the cottages father and to monksburn said flora in a diverted tone as if she were trying not to laugh either they must all have had their sabbath manners on said my uncle drummond or else there are strange folks at brocklebank no my dear i fear not by any means i am afraid said i we must be worse folks at brocklebank than i thought we were but these seem to me uncle such a different kind of peopleas if they were travelling on another road and had a different end in view nearly all the people i see here seem to think more of what they ought to do and at brocklebank we think of what we like to do i did not somehow like to say right out what i really meantto the one set god seemed a friend to the other he was a stranger do you hear angus what a good character we have said my uncle drummond smiling we must try to keep it my boy of course i could not say that i did not think angus was included in the we but the momentary trouble in floras eyes as she glanced at him made me feel that she saw it as indeed i could have guessed from what i had heard her say to mr keith well my lassie my uncle drummond went on while i fear we do not all deserve the compliment you pay us yet have you ever thought what those two roads are and what end they have in view yes uncle i can see that said i heaven is at the end of one i am sure and of the other cary i felt the tears come into my eyes uncle i dont like to think about that but do tell me for that is what i want to know what is the difference i do not see how people get from the one road to the other i did not saybut i feel sure that my uncle drummond did not need it that i felt i was on the wrong one lassie if you had fallen into a deep tank of water where the walls were so high that it was not possible you could climb out by yourself for what would you hope that somebody should come and help me i suppose true and who is the somebody that can help you in this matter i thought and thought and could not tell it seems strange that i did not think what he meant but i had been so used to think of our lord jesus christ as a person who had a great deal to do with going to church and the prayerbook but nothing at all to do with me that really i did not think what my uncle meant me to say there is but one man my child who can give you any help and he longed to help you so much that he came down from heaven to do it you know who i mean now cary you mean our lord jesus christ i said but uncle you say he longed to help i never knew that i always thought you thought he did not wish to help you at all and that you would have very hard work to persuade him wellsomething like it i said hesitatingly flora had left the room a moment before and now she put her head in at the door and called angus my uncle drummond and i were left alone my dear lassie said he as tenderly as if i had been his own child you would never have wished to be helped if he had not first wished to help you but remember cary help is not the right word the true word is save you are not a few yards out of the path and able to turn back at any moment you are lost dear cary will you let the lord find you can i hinder him i said yes my dear was the solemn answer he allows himself to be hindered if you choose the way of death he will not save you against your will he demands your joining in that work take again the emblem of the tank the man holds out his hands to you you cannot help yourself out but you can choose whether you will put your hands in his or not it will not be his fault if you are drowned it will be your own uncle how am i to put my hands in his hold them out to him cary ask him with all your heart to take you and make you his own and if he refuse let me know i will try uncle i answered but you saiddoes god never save anybody against his will my uncle drummond was silent for a moment well cary perhaps at times he does but it is not his usual way of working and no man has any right to expect it in his own case though we may be allowed to hope for it in that of another i wonder very much now as i write it all down how i ever came to say all this to my uncle drummond i never meant it at all when i began i suppose i got led on from one thing to another when i came to think of it i was very grateful to flora for going away and calling angus after her but uncle i said recollecting myself suddenly how does anybody know when the lord has heard him he smiled if you were lifted out of the tank and set on dry ground cary do you think you would have much doubt about it but i could see that uncle take another emblem then you love some people very dearly and there are others whom you do not like at all you cannot see love and hate but have you any doubt whom you love or whom you dislike no said iat least not when i really love or dislike them very much but there are people whom i cannot make up my mind about i neither like nor dislike them exactly those are generally people of whom you have not seen much i think said my uncle drummond or else they are those colourless men and women of whom you say that they have nothing in them you could not feel so towards a person of decided character and one whom you knew well no uncle i do not think i could you may rest assured my dear that unless he be an utter stranger you will never feel so towards the lord when you come to know him you must either love or hate him you cannot help yourself it almost frightened me to hear my uncle drummond say that it must be such a dreadful thing to go wrong on that road cary he added suddenly but very softly would you find it difficult to love a man who was going to die voluntarily instead of you i do not see how i could help it uncle cried i then how is it he asked in the same tone that you have any difficulty in loving the man who has died in your stead i thought a minute uncle i said it does not seem real the other would in other words caryyou do not believe it do not believe it cried i surely uncle i believe in our lord dont i say the creed every sunday probably you do my dear but i do believe it cried i again you do believewhat said my uncle drummond why i believe that christ came down from heaven and was crucified dead and buried and rose again and ascended into heaven of course i believe it uncleevery bit of it and what has it to do with you my dear it all took place a good while ago did it not i thought again i suppose i said slowly that christ died to save sinners and i must be a sinner but somehow i dont quite see how it is to be put together uncle it seems like a chinese puzzle of which i have lost a piece and none of the others will fit properly i cannot explain it and yet i do not quite know why listen cary and i will tell you why i did with both my ears and all my mind your mistake is a very common one little lassie you are trying to believe what and you have got to believe whom if you had to cross a raging torrent and i offered to carry you over it would signify nothing whether you knew where i was born or if i were able to speak latin but it would signify a great deal to you whether you knew me whether you believed that i would carry you safe over or that i would take the opportunity to drop you into the water and run away would it not of course it would i said the whole thing would depend on whether i trusted you my uncle drummond rose and laid his hand on my headnot as mr digby used to do as though he were condescending to a little child but as if he were blessing me in gods name then he said in that low soft solemn tone which sounds to me so very high and holy as if an angel spoke to mecary dear child the whole thing dependsyour soul and your eternity dependon whether you trust the lord jesus then he went out of the room and left me alone as if he wanted me to think well about that before he said anything more i think something is coming to help me my uncle drummond was late for supper last nighta thing which i could see was very unusual and when he did come he was particularly silent and meditative at length when supper was over as we turned our chairs round from the table and were sitting down again to our work my uncle drummond who generally goes to his study after supper sat down among us young people said he with a look on his face which it seemed to me was partly grave and partly diverted considering that you are more travelled persons than i i come to you for information have youany of youwhile in england either seen or heard anything of one mr george whitefield a clergyman of the church of england who is commonly reckoned a methodist angus made a grimace and said plenty flora was doubtful she thought she had heard his name i said i have heard his name too uncle but i do not know much about him only father seemed to think it a good joke that anybody should fancy him a wise man angus appears to be the best informed of you said my uncle speak out my boy and tell us what you know well he is a queer sort of fellow i fancy said angus he was one of the methodists but they say those folks have had a split and whitefield has broken with them he travels about preaching though as they do and they say that the reason why he took to fieldpreaching was because no church would hold the enormous congregations which gathered to hear him he has been several times to the american colonies where they say he draws larger crowds than john wesley himself a good deal of they say observed uncle drummond with a smile do they say that the bishops and clergy are friendly to this remarkable preacher or not well i should rather think not answered angus there is one bishop who has stuck to him through thick and thinthe bishop of gloucester who gave him his orders to begin with but the rest of them look askance at him over their shoulders i believe it is irregular you know to preach in fieldswholly improper to save anybodys soul out of church and these english folks take the horrors at anything irregular the women like him because he makes them cry so much angus cried flora and i together thats what i was told i assure you young ladies returned angus i am only repeating what i have heard well that you may shortly have an opportunity of judging said my uncle drummond for this gentleman has come to selkirk and has asked leave of the presbytery to preach in certain kirks of this neighbourhood there was some demur at first to the admission of a prelatist but after some converse with him this was withdrawn and he will preach next sabbath morning at selkirk and in the afternoon at monks brae you can go to monks brae to hear him if you will i of course shall not be able to accompany you but i trust to find an opportunity when he preaches in the fields if there be one i should like to hear this great english preacher i confess what say you theyll go you may be sure sir said angus before we could answer trust a lassie to gad about if she has the chance mind you take all the pockethandkerchiefs you have with you they say tis dreadful the way this man gars you greet tis true you english are more given that way than we scots but folks say you cannot help yourselfyou must cry whether you will or no i should like to go i think uncle said i onlyi suppose he is a real clergyman there goes a genuine englishwoman said angus if paul himself were to preach she would not go to hear him till she knew what bishop had ordained him yes cary answered my uncle drummond smiling he is a real clergyman more real than you think me i fear oh you are different uncle said i but i am sure father would not like me to hear any preacher who was notat leasti dont knowhe did not seem to think this mr whitefield all right somehow perhaps he did not know he was a proper person a proper person sighed angus casting up his eyes my dear said my uncle drummond kindly you are a good lassie to think of your fathers wishes never mind angus he is only making fun and is a foolish young fellow yet of course not having spoken with your father i cannot tell so well as yourself what his wishes are and tis quite possible he may think for i hear many do that this gentleman is a schismatic and may disapprove of him on that account only if so i can tell you for certain tis a mistake but as to anything else you must judge for yourself and do what you think right you see no objection to our going father asked flora who had not spoken hitherto not at all my dear said my uncle go by all means if you like it you may never have another opportunity and tis very natural you should wish it thank you answered flora then if angus will take me i will go well i dont know said angus i am afraid some of my handkerchiefs are at the wash i should not like to be quite drowned in my tears i might wash you away too and that would be a national calamity dont jest on serious subjects my boy said uncle and angus grew grave directly i am no enemy to honest rational fun tis human and natural more especially to the young but never never let us make a jest of the things that pertain to god i beg your pardon father said angus in a low voice ill take you flora what say you cary yes i should like to go i said and i wondered directly whether i had said right or wrong but i do so want to hear something that would help me i found that monks brae was on the monksburn road but nearly two miles further on tis the high road from selkirk to galashiels after you leave monksburn and pretty well frequented so that angus was deemed guard enough but last night the whole road was so full of people going to hear mr whitefield that it was like walking in a crowd all the way the kirk was crammed to the very doors and outside people stood looking in and listening through the doors and the open windows mr lundie the minister of monks brae led the worship as they say here and when the sermon came i looked with some curiosity at the great preacher who did such unusual things and whom some people seemed to think it so wrong to like mr whitefield is not anything particular to look at just a young man in a fair wig with a round face and rosy cheeks he has a most musical voice and he knows how to put it to the best advantage every word is as distinct as can be and his voice rings out clear and strong like a welltoned bell but he had not preached ten minutes before i forgot his voice and himself altogether and could think of nothing but what he was preaching about and i never heard such a sermon in my life my uncle drummonds are the only ones i have heard which even approach it and he does not lift you up and carry you away as mr whitefield does all the other preachers i ever heard except those two are always telling you to do something come to church and say your prayers and take the sacrament but particularly do your duty now it always seems to me that there are two grand difficulties in the way of doing ones duty the first is to find out what is ones duty of course there is the bible but if i may say it with reverence the bible has never seemed to have much to do with me it is all about people who lived ever so long ago and what they did and what has that to do with me cary courtenay and what i am doing then suppose i do know what my duty isand certainly i do in some respectsi am not sure that i can express it properly but i feel as if i wanted something to come and make me do it i am like a watch with all the wheels and springs there ready to go but i want somebody to come and wind me up and i do not know how that is to be done but mr whitefield made me wish oh so much that that unknown somebody would come and do it i never thought much about it before until that talk with my uncle drummond and now it feels to be what i want more than anything else i cannot write the sermon down not a page of it i think you never can write down on paper the things that stir your very soul it is the things which just tickle your brains that you can put down in elegant language on paper when a thing comes close to you into your real self and grapples with you and leaves a mark on you for ever hereafter whether for good or evil you cannot write or talk about thatyou can only feel it the text was what think ye of christ mr whitefield saith any man that will may have his sins forgiven and may know it i have heard mr bagnall speak of this doctrine which he said was shocking and wicked for it gave men licence to live in sin mr whitefield named this very thing whereby i saw it had been brought as a charge against him and showed plainly that it did not tend to destroy good works but only built them up on a safer and surer foundation we work saith he not for that we would be saved by our works but out of gratitude that we have been saved by christ who commands these works to such as would follow him and he quoted an article of the church note saying that he desired men to see that he was no schismatic preaching his own fancies but that the church whereof he was a minister held the same doctrine i wonder if mr bagnall knows that and if he ever reads the articles he spoke much also of the new birth or conversion i never heard any other preacher except uncle mention that at all i know mr digby thought it a fanatical notion only fit for enthusiasts but certainly there are texts in the bible that speak plainly of it and mr whitefield saith that we do not truly believe in christ unless we so believe as to have him dwelling in us and to receive life and nourishment from him as the branch does from the vine and saint john says the same thing how can it be enthusiasm to say what the bible says people seem so dreadfully frightened of what they call enthusiasm note grandmamma used to say there was nothing more vulgar but the queer thing is that many of these very people will let you get as enthusiastic as ever you like about a game of cards or one horse coming in before another in a race or about politics or poaching and things of that sort that have to do with this world it is about the things of real consequencethings which have to do with your soul and the next worldthat you must not get enthusiastic may one not have too little enthusiasm i wonder as well as too much would it not be reasonable to be enthusiastic about things that really signify and cool about the things that do not i want to write down a few sentences which mr whitefield said that i may not forget them i do not know how they came in among the rest they stuck to me just as they are note he says our senses are the landingports of our spiritual enemies we must take care of healing before we see sinners wounded the king of the church has all its adversaries in a chain if other sins have slain their thousands of professing christians worldlymindedness has slain its ten thousands how can any say lead us not into temptation in the morning when they are resolved to run into it at night how many are kept from seeing christ in glory by reason of the press that is he explained that people are ashamed of being singularly good note unless their acquaintances are on the same side christ will thank you for coming to his feast when mr whitefield came near the end of his sermon i thought i could see why people said he made them cry so much his voice sank into a soft pleading tender accent as if he yearned over the souls before him his hands were held out as if he were just holding out jesus christ to us and we must take him or turn away and be lost and he begged us all so pitifully not to turn away i saw tears running down the cheeks of many hardlooking men and women flora cried and so did i but angus did not he did not look as though he felt at all inclined to do it this is one of the last sermons we hear that mr whitefield will preach on this side the sea he sails for the american colonies next month he is said to be very fond of his american friends and very much liked by them note as we were coming away we came upon our friends from monksburn whom we had not seen before this is preaching said annas as she clasped our hands eh puir laddie hell just wear himself out said the laird i hope he has a gude wife for sic men are rare and they should be well taken care of while they are here he has a wife sir observed angus and the men of his own kidney think he would be rather better off if he had none hoots but im sorry to hear it said the laird what ails her ken ye laddie as i understood sir she had three grave drawbacks in the first place she is a widow with a rich jointure thats a queer thing to call a drawback said the laird in the second place she is a widow with a temper and a good deal of it dinna name it cried the laird lifting up his hands dinna name it eh puir laddie but im wae for him gin hes fashed wi ane o that sort and in the third place continued angus i have been told that he may well preach against worldlymindedness for he gets enough of it at home mrs whitefield knows what are trumps considerably better than she knows where to look in the bible for her husbands text dear dear cried lady monksburn in her soft voice what could the good man be thinking of to bind such a burden as that upon his life he thought he had converted her i believe said angus but she came undone i should think remarked mr keith that he acted as joshua did with the gibeonites how was that said angus it wont hurt you to look for it was the answer i dont know whether angus looked for it but i did as soon as i got in and i saw that mr keith thought there had been too much hastiness and perhaps a little worldlymindedness in mr whitefield himself that may be why he preaches so earnestly against it we know so well where the slippery places are when we have been down ourselves and when we have been down once we are generally very very careful to keep off that slide for the future mr whitefield said last night that it was not true to say as some do that a man may be in christ today and go to the devil tomorrow then if anybody is converted how can he as angus said come undone i only see one explanation and it is rather a terrible one namely that the conversion was not real but only looked like it and i am afraid that must be the truth but what a pity it is that mr whitefield did not find it out sooner well helen and how did you like the great english preacher i said to floras nurse atweel miss cary the discourse was no that ill for a prelatist was the answer and that was as much admiration as i could get from helen there was more talk about mr whitefield this morning at breakfast i cannot tell what has come to angus going to hear mr whitefield preach at monks brae seems to have made him worse instead of better flora and i both liked it so much but angus talks of it with a kind of bitter hardness in his voice and as if it pleased him to let us know all the bad things which had been said about the preacher he told us that they saidi wish they would give over sayingthat mr whitefield had got his money matters into some tangle in the business of building his orphan house in georgia and they said he had acted fraudulently in the matter my uncle drummond put this down at once with my son never repeat a calumny against a good man you may not know it but you do satans very work for him angus made a grimace behind his hand which i fancy he did not mean his father to see then he went on they say that mr whitefield is so fanatical and extravagant in preaching against worldliness that he counts it sinful to smell to a rose or to eat anything relishing did he say so asked my uncle or did they say it for him well sir answered angus with a laugh i heard mr whitefield had said that he would give his people leave to smell to a rose and a pink also so long as they would avoid the appearance of sin and quoth he if you can find any diversion which you would be willing to be found at by our lord in his coming i give you free licence to go to it and welcome then we have disposed of that charge saith my uncle what next well they say he hath given infinite displeasure to the english gentry by one of his favourite sayingsthat man is half a beast and half a devil he will not allow them to talk of passing the timehow dare they waste the time saith he when they have the devil and the beast to get out of their souls folks dont like you see to be painted in those colours no we rarely admire a portrait that is exactly like us saith my uncle drummond pray sir think you that is a likeness said angus more like my son than you and i think some of us have more of the one and some of the other but in truth i cannot contradict mr whitefield tis a just portrait of what man is by nature but sir cried angus do you allow nothing for a mans natural virtues what are they asked my uncle i allow that there is none that doeth good no not one you were not taught angus that a man had virtues natural to him except as the spirit of god implanted them in him no sir but when i go forth into the world i cannot help seeing that it is so i wish i could see it said my uncle it would be a much more agreeable sight than many things i do see well sir take generosity and good temper urged angus do you not see much of these in men who as mr whitefield would say are worldly and ungodly i often see the lords restraining grace answered my uncle quietly but am i to give the credit of it to those whom he restrains but think you sir that it is wise angus paused go on my boy said my uncle i like you to speak out like an honest man by all means have courage to own your convictions if they be right ones you may so have them confirmed and if they be wrong you stand in better case to have them put right i did not think angus looked quite comfortable he hesitated a moment and then i suppose came out with what he had meant to say think you not sir that it is wise to leave unsaid such things as offend people and make them turn away from preaching should we not be careful to avoid offence unnecessary offence saith my uncle but the offence of the cross is precisely that which we are warned not to avoid not with wisdom of words saith the apostle lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect in his eyes then is the offence of the cross ceased was sufficient to condemn the preaching whereof he spoke and that policy of keeping back truth is the devils policy tis jesuitical will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee never angus never but our lord himself seems to have kept things back from his disciples pleaded angus uneasily yes what they were not ready for and could not yet understand but never that which offended them he offended them terribly when he told them that the son of man was about to be crucified so did the jesuits to the chinese and when they found the offence they altered their policy and said the story of the crucifixion was an invention of christs enemies did he angus made no answer and breakfast being over we separated to our several work note enthusiasm was the term then usually applied to the doctrines of grace when the word was used in a religious sense note these sentences are not taken from any one of whitefields sermons exclusively but are gathered from the gems of thought scattered through his works note singular still meant alone in whitefields day note articles twelve and thirteen all the members of the church of england ought to be perfectly familiar with the articles and homilies as the reformers intended them to be how else can they know what they profess to hold when they call themselves members of the church if they do not share her opinions they have no right to use her name note he died at newbury port in new england in september america has no nobler possession than the grave of george whitefield chapter seven rumours of war theyve left their bonnie highland hills their wives and bairnies dear to draw the sword for scotlands lord the young chevalier caroline lady nairn yesterday when flora and i sat at our sewing in the manse parlour something happened which has set everything in a turmoil we had been talking but we were silent just then and i was thinking over what my uncle drummond and mr whitefield had said when all at once we heard the gate dashed open and angus came rushing up the path with his plaid flying behind him flora sprang up and ran to meet him what is the matter she said tis so unlike angus to come dashing up in that way i do hope nothing is wrong with father i dropped my sewing and ran after her angus what is wrong she cried why should anything be wrong cant something be right cried angus as he came up and i saw that his cheeks were flushed and his eyes flashing the prince has landed and the old flag is flying at glenfinnan hurrah and angus snatched off his cap and flung it up so high that i wondered if it would come down again the prince cried flora and looking at her i saw that she had caught the infection too o angus what news who told you is it true are you quite sure sure as the hills duncan told me i have been over to monksburn and he has just come home all the clans in scotland will be up tomorrow that was the one thing we wantedour prince himself among us you will hear of no faint hearts now what will the elector do said flora he cannot surely make head against our troops make head we shall be in london in a month sir john cope has gone to meet tullibardine at glenfinnan i expect he will come back a trifle faster than he went long live the king and may god defend the right all at once anguss tone changed as his eyes fell upon me cary i hope you are not a traitor in the camp you look as if you cared nothing about it and you rather wondered we did i know next to nothing about it angus i answered father would care a great deal and if i understood it i dare say i might but i dont you see what do i hear cried angus in mock horror clasping his hands and casting up his eyes the daughter of squire courtenay of brocklebank knows next to nothing about toryism hear it o hills and dales about politics of any sort said i dont you know i was brought up with grandmamma desborough who is a whig so far as she is anythingbut she always said it was vulgar to get warm over politics so i never had the chance of hearing much about it poor old tabby said irreverent angus but have you heard nothing since you came to brocklebank asked flora with a surprised look oh i have heard father toast the king over the water and rail at the elector and i have heard fanny chant that britons never shall be slaves till i never wanted to hear the tune again and i have heard ambrose catterall sing whig songs to put father in a pet and heard lots of people talk about lots of things which are to be done when the king has his own again that is about all i know of course i know how the revolution came about and all that and i have heard of the war thirty years ago and the dreadful executions after it executions massacres cried angus hotly well massacres if you like said i i am sure they were shocking enough to be called any ugly name angus seemed altogether changed he could not keep to one subject nor stand still for one minute i was not much surprised so long as it was only he but i was astonished when i saw the change which came over my uncle drummond i never supposed he could get so excited about anything which had to do with earth and yet his first thought was to connect it with heaven note i shall never forget the ring of his prayer that night an exile within sight of home a prisoner to whom the gates had just been opened might have spoken in the words and tones that he did lord thou hast been gracious unto thy land let them give thanks whom the lord hath redeemed and delivered from the hand of the enemy that was the keynote of every sentence i found before long that i had caught the complaint myself i went about singing the king shall hae his ain again and got as hot and eager for fresh news as anybody oh dear i hope the prince will conquer the elector before i go to london i said to flora for i do not know whatever grandmamma will say if i go to her in this mood she always says there is nothing so vulgar as to get enthusiastic over anything you ought to be calm composed collected and everything else which is cold and begins with c flora laughed but was grave again directly i expect cary your journey to london is a long way off said she how are you to travel if all the country be up and troops going to and fro everywhere i am sure i dont care if it be said i i would rather stay here a great deal i thought we were tolerably warm about the princes landing at abbotscliff but when i got to monksburn i found the weather still hotter the laird is almost beside himself mr keith as i never saw him before annas has the air of an inspired prophetess and even lady monksburn is moved out of her usual quietude though she makes the least ado of any news came while we were there that sir john cope had been so hard pressed by the kings army that he was forced to fall back on inverness and nothing would suit the laird but to go out and make a bonfire on the first hill he came to so as to let people see that something had happened the elector we hear has come back from hanover and his followers are in a panic i hope they will stay there everybody agrees that the army will march southwards at once after this victory and that unless my journey could take place directly i shall have to stay where i am at least over the winter the laird wishes he could get annas out of the way if i were going i believe he would send her with me to those friends of lady monksburn in the isle of wight i thought lady monksburn looked rather anxious and wistful too when he spoke about it annas herself did not seem to care the lord will not go to the isle of wight she said quietly oh if i could feel as they dothat god is everywhere and that everywhere he is my friend and then my uncle drummonds words come back upon me but how do you trust christ what have you to do if people would make things plain well it looks as if i should have plenty of time for learning for it seems pretty certain whatever else is doubtful that i am a fixture at abbotscliff i wonder if things always happen just when one has made up ones mind that they are not going to happen about ten oclock this morning flora and i were sewing in the parlour just as we have been doing every day since i came here my uncle drummond was out and angus was fixing a white cockade in his bonnet helen raeburn put in her head at the door if you please miss cary said she my cousin samuel wad be fain to speak wi ye for one moment i could not think who she meant what had i to do with her cousin samuel and then all at once it flashed upon me that helens cousin samuel was our own old sam sam i almost screamed has he come from brocklebank oh is anything wrong at home theres naething wrang ava miss cary but a hantle thats richtonly ane thing belikeand

opportunity to send annas southwards and when my uncle drummond came in though his lip trembled and her eyes pleaded earnestly he said flora must go too and tonight mr keith brought news that men were up all over the highlands and that the prince was marching on perth my uncle drummond says we must go at oncethere is not to be a days delay that can be helped mr keith and angus are both to join the prince as soon as they can be ready my uncle will go with us himself to hawick and then sam will go on with us to carlisle where we are to wait one day while sam rides over to brocklebank to fetch and exchange such things as we may need and if we can hear of any friend of fathers or my uncles who is going south we are to join their convoy the laird of monksburn sends one of his men with us and both he and sam will be well armed i am sure i hope there will be no occasion for the arms angus is in a mental fever and dashes about here there and everywhere without apparent reason and also without much consideration i mean consideration in both sensesreflection and forbearance flora is grave and anxiousi think a little frightened both for herself and angus mr keith takes the affair very seriously that i can see though he does not say much annas seems now that the first excitement is over as calm as a summer eve we are to start if possible on friday and sleep at hawick the first night hech sirs was helens comment when she heard it my puir bairns may the lord be wi ye its ill setting forth of a friday clashes and clavers cries sam turning on her helen raeburn yere just daft is the lord no sae strang o friday as ither days what will fules say neist atweel ye may lauch sam an ye will answered helen but i tell ye i neer brake my collarbone of a journey but ance and that was when id set forth of a friday and i neer brake mine ava and ive set forth monie a time of a friday returned sam will ye talk sense woman dear gin women maun talk i do feel so sorry to leave abbotscliff i wish i were not going to london and i do not quite like to ask myself why i should not mind going at all if it were only a change of place abbotscliff is very lovely but there is a great deal in london that i should like to see if i were to lead the same sort of life as here and with the same sort of people i should be quite satisfied to go but i know it will be very different everything will be changed not only the people but the ways of the people instead of breezy weather there will be hot crowded rooms and instead of the tweed rippling over the pebbles there will be noisy music and empty chatter and it is not so much that i am afraid it will be what i shall not like it will at first i dare say but i am afraid that in time i shall get to like it and it will drive all the better things out of my head and i shall just become one of those empty chatterers i am sure there is danger of it and i do not know how to help it it is pleasant to please people and to make them laugh and to have them say how pretty or how clever you are and then one gets carried away and one says things one never meant to say and the things go and do something which one never meant to do and i should not like to be another of my aunt dorothea i do not think there is half the fear for flora that there is for me she does not seem to get carried off her minds feet as it were there is something solid underneath her and it is not at all certain that flora will be there if she be asked to stay uncle says she may please herself for he knows she can be trusted but if grandmamma or my aunt dorothea do not ask her then she goes on with annas to her friends who annas says will be quite delighted to see her i do so wish that flora might stay with me this afternoon we went over to monksburn to say farewell flora and annas had a good deal to settle about our journey and all the people and things we were leaving behind they went into the garden but i asked leave to stay i did so want a talk with lady monksburn on two points i thought i hardly know why that she would understand me i sat for a few minutes watching her bright needles glance in and out among the soft wools and at last i brought out the less important of my two questions if she answered that kindly patiently and as if she understood the other was to come after if not i would keep it to myself will you tell me madamis it wrong to pray about anything i mean is there anything one ought not to pray about lady monksburn looked up but only for a moment dear child she said with a gentle smile is it wrong to tell your father of something you want but may one pray about things that do not belong to church and sunday and the bible said i everything belongs to the bible said she it is the chart for the voyage of life you mean dear heart is it right to pray about earthly things which have to do with the body no doubt it is give us this day our daily bread but does that mean real common bread i asked i thought people said it meant food for the soul people say very foolish things sometimes my dear it may include food for the soul and very likely does but i think it means food for the body first your father knoweth that ye have need of all these things that surely was said of meat and drink and clothing i thought a minute but i mean more than that i said things that one wishes for which are not necessaries for the body and yet are not things for the soul necessaries for the mind suggested lady monksburn my dear your mind is a part of you as much as your body and spirit and he careth for you body soul and spiritnot the spirit only and not the spirit and body only for instance i said suppose i wanted very much to go somewhere or not to go somewherefor reasons which seemed good ones to mewould it be wicked to ask god to arrange it so lady monksburn looked up at me with her gentle motherly eyes dear child she said you may ask god for anything in all the world if only you will bear in mind that he loves you and is wiser than you father if it be possiblenevertheless not my will but thine be done you cannot ask a more impossible thing than that which lay between those words if the world were to be saved if god were to be glorified it was not possible did he not know that who asked it with strong crying and tears was not the asking done to teach us two thingsthat he was very man like ourselves shrinking from pain and death as much as the very weakest of us can shrink and also that we may ask anything and everything if only we desire beyond it that gods will be done thank you i said drawing a long breath yes i might ask my second question lady monksburn what is it to trust the lord jesus do you want to know what trust is caryor what he is my child i think i can tell you the first but i can never attempt to paint the glory of the second i want to know what people mean by trusting him how are you to trust somebody whom you do not know it is hard i think you must know a little before you can trust and by the process of trusting you learn to know trust and love are very near akin you must talk with him cary if you want to know him you mean pray i suppose that is talking to him it is a poor converse where all the talk is on one side but what is the other sidereading the bible that is part of it what is the other part of it lady monksburn looked up at me again with a smile which i do not know how to describe i can only say that it filled me with a sudden yearning for my dead mother she might have smiled on me like that my darling she answered there are things which can be described and there are things which can but be felt no man can utter the secret of the lordonly the lord himself ask him to whisper it to you you will care little for the smiles or the frowns of the world when he has done so is not that just what i want but will he tell it to any one i said he tells it to those who long for it she replied his smile may be had by any who will have it it costs a great deal sometimes but it is worth the cost what does it cost madam it costs what most men think very precious and yet is really worth nothing at all it costs the worlds flatteries which are as a net for the feet and the worlds pleasures which are as the crackling of thorns under the pot and the worlds honours which are empty air it often costs these there are few men who can be trusted with both there was a minutes silence and then she said the scottish catechism my dear saith that mans chief end is to glorify god and to enjoy him for ever grander words were never penned out of gods own word and among the most striking words in it are those of david which may be called the response theretowhen i awake up after thy likeness i shall be satisfied with it then annas and flora came in but i had got what i wanted bloomsbury square london september rd while we were travelling i could not get at my book to write anything and had i been able i doubt whether i should have found time we journeyed from early morning till late at night really almost as though we were flying from a foe though of course we should have had nothing to fear had the royal army overtaken us it was only the electors troops who would have meddled with us and they were in scotland somewhere there is indeed a rumour flying abroad tonight saith my uncle charles that the prince has entered edinburgh but we know not if it be true or no if so he will surely push on straight for london since the rebellious troops must have been driven quite away before he could do that so my uncle charles says and he saith too that they are a mere handful of raw german mercenaries who would never stand a moment against the courage the discipline and the sense of right which must animate the kings army oh dear where shall i begin if i am to write down all about the journey and if i do not it will look like a great gap in my tale well my uncle drummond took us to hawickbut stop i have not left abbotscliff yet and here i am coming to hawick that wont do i must begin again mr keith and angus marched on thursday night with a handful of volunteers from tweedside it was hard work parting even i felt it and of course angus is much less to me than the others mr keith said farewell to my uncle and me and he came last to flora she lifted her eyes to him full of tears as she put her hand in his duncan she said will you make me a promise certainly flora if it be anything that will ease your mind indeed it will she said with trembling lips never lose sight of angus and try to keep him safe and true true to the cause or true to god true to both i cannot separate between right and right i thought there was just one seconds hesitationno morebefore mr keith gave his solemn answer i will so help me god flora thanked him amidst her sobs he held her hand a moment longer and i almost thought that he was going to ask her for something but suddenly there came a setting of stern purpose into his lips and eyes and he kissed her hand and let it go with no more thangod bless you dear flora farewell then angus came up and gave us a much warmer and rougher goodbye but i felt there was something behind mr keiths which he had not spoken and i wondered what it was we left abbotscliff ourselves at six oclock next morning flora and i were in the chaise my uncle drummond sam and wedderburn the lairds servant on horseback at the gates at monksburn we took up annas and wedderburn joined us there too the laird came to see us off and nearly wrung my hand off as he said to flora and me take care of my bairn the lords taking them both from their auld father if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved the lord will keep them himself dear friend said my uncle drummond surely you see the need to part with them oh ay i see the need clear enough and an auld noodle i am to be lamenting to you who are suffering the very same loss then he turned to annas god be with thee my bonnie birdie he said the auld grange will be lone without thy song but thou wilt let us hear a word of thy welfare as oft as thou canst as often as ever i can dear father said annas and as he turned back and we drove away she broke down as i had never imagined annas would do we slept that night at the inn at hawick on the saturday morning my uncle drummond left us and we went on to carlisle which we reached late at night here we were to stay with dr and mrs benn friends of fathers who made much of us and seemed to think themselves quite honoured in having us and sam went off at once on a fresh horse to brocklebank which he hoped to reach by midnight they would be looking for him i charged him with all sorts of messages which he said grimly that he would deliver if he recollected them when he got there and i gave him a paper for my aunt kezia with a list of things i would have sent on sunday we went to the cathedral with our hosts and spent the day quietly but on monday morning what was my astonishment as i was just going into the parlour to hear a familiar voice say did you leave your eyes at abbotscliff my dear aunt kezia i cried yes there stood my aunt kezia in her hood and scarf looking as if only an hour had passed since i saw her before i was glad to see her and i ventured to say so why child did you think i was going to send my lamb out into the wilderness with never a farewell but how early you must have had to rise aunt kezia mrs kezia this is an unlookedfor pleasure said the doctor coming forward i could never have hoped to see you at this hour this hour why tis but eight oclock cries my aunt kezia what sort of a ligabed do you think me doctor madam i think you the flower of creation cries he bowing over her hand you must have been reading the poets saith she and not to much good purposeflora child you look but white and is this miss annas keith your friend i am glad to see you my dear dont mind an old womans freedom i call all girls my dear annas smiled and said she was very pleased to feel as though my aunt kezia reckoned her among her friends my friends friends are mine saith my aunt kezia well cary i have brought you all the things in your minute save your purple lutestring scarf which i could not find it was not in the bottom shelf as you set down why where could i have put it said i i always keep it on that shelf i was sorry to miss it because it is my best scarf and i thought i should want it in london where i suppose everybody goes very fine however there was no more to be saidon my side i found there was on my aunt kezias here hold your hand child saith she your father sends you ten guineas to spend and here are five more from me and this pocketpiece from sophy you can get a new scarf in london if you need it or anything else you like better oh thank you aunt kezia i cried why how rich i shall be dont waste your money cary lay it out wisely and then we shall be pleased i will give you a good rule never buy anything without sleeping on it dont rush off and get it the first minute it comes into your head you will see the bottom of your purse in a veek if you do but it might be gone aunt kezia then it is something you can do without is hatty come home aunt said flora not she saith my aunt kezia miss hattys gone careering off the deer know where i dare be bound youll fall in with her she is gone with charlotte and emily up to town i was sorry to hear that i dont much want to meet hattyabove all if grandmamma be there note the great majority of scottish jacobites were episcopalians and moderates a term equivalent to the english high and dry there were however a very few presbyterians among them chapter eight rules and ribbons no fond belief can day and night from light and darkness sever and wrong is wrong and right is right for ever and for ever last evening as we were drawing our chairs up for a chat round the fire in our chamber who should walk in but my aunt kezia nay ill not hold you long saith she as i arose and offered my seat i come but to give a bit of good counsel to my nieces here miss annas my dear it will very like not hurt you too i shall be very glad of it mrs kezia said annas wellsaith my aunt and broke off all at once eh girls girls poor unfledged birds fluttering your wings on the brim of the nest and poohpoohing the old bird behind you that says take care my dears or you will fall she never flew out of the nest did sheshe never preened her wings and thought all the world lay before her and she could fly as straight as any lark of them all and catch as many flies as any swallow ay nor she never tumbled off into the mire and found she could not fly a bit and all the insects went darting past her as safe as if she were a dead leaf eh my lassies this would be a poor world if it were all i have seen something of it though you thought not likely enough but flowers are flowers and dirt is dirt whether you find them on the banks of the thames or of ellen water and i have not dwelt all my life at brocklebank though if i had i should have seen men and women and they are much alike all the world over i could not keep it in and out it came please aunt kezia dont be angry but what is become of cecilia osborne i dare say you will know cary before i do she went to london i believe oh i dont want to see her aunt kezia then you are pretty sure to do it but why did she not i was afraid to go on why did she not keep her word you can ask her if you want to know dont say i wanted to know thats all i dont but how was it aunt kezia said i for i was on fire with curiosity flora made an attempt to check me you are both welcome to know all i know said my aunt and that is that she spent one evening at the fells with us and the hebblethwaites and mr parmenter were there the next day we saw nothing of her and on the evening of the third there came a little note to mea dainty little pink threecornered note all over perfumein which miss cecilia osborne presented her compliments to mrs kezia courtenay and begged to say that she found herself obliged to go to london and would have set out before the note should reach me that is as much as i know and more than i want to know and she did not say when she was coming back not in any hurry i fancy said my aunt kezia grimly going to stop away altogether shes welcome answered my aunt in the same tone then who will live at fir vale asked flora dont know the first of you may that gets married dont go and do it on purpose annas seemed much diverted i wanted very much to know how father had taken cecilias flight but i did not feel i could ask that any more questions young ladies saith my aunt kezia quizzically we will get them done first if you please i beg your pardon aunt said i only i did want to know so much my aunt kezia gave a little laugh my dear curiosity is eves legacy to her daughters you might reasonably feel it in this instance i should almost have thought you unfeeling if you had not however that business is all over and well over to my mind i am thankful it is no worse now for what i want to say to you i have been turning over in my mind how i might say to you what would be likely to do you good in such a way that you could easily bear it in mind and i have settled to give you a few plain rules which you will find of service if you follow them now dont you go saying to yourselves that aunt kezia is an old country woman who knows nothing of grand town folks as i was beginning to say when you interrupted me carythere dont look abashed child i am not angry with youmanners change but natures dont dress men and women how you will and let them talk what language you please and have what outside ways you like they are men and women still wherever you go you will find human nature is unchanged and the devil that tempts men is unchanged and the god that saves them is unchanged there are more senses than one lassies in which the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal my aunt kezia began to feel in her bagthat great print bag with the red poppies and blue cornflowers and the big brass top by which i should know my aunt kezia was near if i saw it in the american plantations or in the moon for that matterand out came three little books bound in red sheepskin such pretty little books scarcely the size of my hand and with gilded leaves now girls she said i brought you these for keepsakes they are only blank paper as you see and you can put down in them what you spend or what you see or any good sayings you meet with or the like just what you please but you will find my rules written on the first leaf so you cant say you had not a chance to bear them in mind miss annas my dear i hope i dont make too free but you see i did not like to leave you out in the cold as it were will you accept one of them they are good rules for any young maid though i say it how kind of you mrs kezia said annas indeed i will and value it very much i turned at onceindeed i think we all didto my aunt kezias rules they were written as she said on the first page in her neat clear handwriting which one could read almost in the dark this is what she had written put the lord first in everything let the approval of those who love you best come second judge none by the outside till you have seen what is within never take compliment for earnest never put off doing a right or kind thing if you doubt a thing being right it is safe not to do it if you know a thing to be right go on with it though the world stand in your way if sinners entice thee consent thou not if any man sin we have an advocate with the father never wait to confess sin and be forgiven in all that is not wrong put the comfort of others before your own think it possible you may be mistaken test everything by the word of god remember that the world passeth away flora was the first of us to speak thank you indeed aunt kezia for taking so much trouble for us if we govern ourselves by your rules we can hardly go far wrong i tried to say something of the same sort but i am afraid i bungled it i cannot tell when we shall meet again my lassies saith my aunt kezia only it seems likely to be some time first of course if things fall out ill and mrs desborough counts it best to remove from london or to send you elsewhere you must be ruled by her as you cannot refer to your father remember caryyour grandmother and uncle will stand to you in place of father and mother while you are with them your father sends you to them and puts his authority into their hands dont go to think you know bettergirls so often do a little humility and obedience wont hurt you and you need not be afraid there will ever be too much of them in this world but aunt said i in some alarm suppose grandmamma tells me to do something which i know you would not allow follow your rule cary set the lord always before you if it is anything which he would not allow then you are justified in standing out not otherwise but how am i to know aunt it was a foolish question of mine for i might have known what my aunt kezia would say what do you think the bible was made for cary but aunt i cant go and read through the bible every time grandmamma gives me an order you must do that first my dear the bible wont jump down your throat that is certain you must be ready beforehand you will learn experience children as the time goes onay whether you choose or no but there are two sorts of experiencesweet and bitter and they that will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock be ruled by the rudder lassies it is the wisest plan my aunt kezia said more but it does not come back to me as that does and the next morning we said goodbye and went out into the wide world i cannot profess to tell the whole of our journey we slept the first night at kendaland a cold bleak journey it was by shap fellsthe second at bolton the third at bakewell the fourth at leicester the fifth at bedford and on the saturday evening we reached london i believe annas was very much diverted at some of my speeches during the journey when i cried after we had passed bolton and were going over a moor that i did not know there was heather in the south she said you have been a very short time in coming to the south cary what do you mean annas said i only that a midland man would think we were still in the north said she what is this not the south said i i thought everything was south after we passed lancaster england is a little longer than that said annas laughing no cary we do not get into the midlands on this side of derby nor into the south on this side of bedford so i had to wait until friday before i saw the south when i did i thought it very flat and very woody i could scarcely see anything for trees only note there were no hills to see and how strange the talk sounded they seemed to speak all their us as if they were es and their as the same annas laughed when i said that take up the mat sounded in the south like teek ep the met it really did to me i suppose said flora our words sound just as queer to these people o flora they cant i cried because we say the words right and how can that sound queer it was nearly six oclock when the chaise drew up before the door of my uncle charless house in bloomsbury square these poor southerners think i hear that bloomsbury square is one of the wonders of the world the world must be very short of wonders and so i said o cary you are a bundle of prejudices laughed annas florawho never can bear a word of disagreementturned the discourse by saying that mr cameron had told her bloomsbury came from blumonds bury the town of some man called blumond and just then the door opened and i felt almost terrified of the big grandlooking man who stood behind it however as it was i who was the particularly invited guest i had to jump down from the chaise after a boy had let down the steps and to tell the big man who i was and whence i came when he said in that mincing way they have in the south as if they must cut their words small before they could get them into their mouths that madam expected me and i was to walk upstairs my heart went pitapat but up i marched annas and flora following and if the big man did not call out my name to another big man just the copy of him who stood at the top of the stairs so loud that i should think it must have been heard over half the house i felt quite ashamed but i walked straight on into a grand room all over lookingglasses and crimson where a circle of ladies and gentlemen were sitting round the fire we have not begun fires in the north i do think they are a nesh note lot of folks who live in the south grandmamma was at one end of the circle and my aunt dorothea at the other i went straight up to grandmamma how do you grandmamma said i this is my cousin flora drummond and this is our friend annas keith fapapa i mean and aunt kezia sent their respectful compliments and begged that you would kindly allow them to tarry here for a night on their way to the isle of wight grandmamma looked at me then at flora then at annas and took a pinch of snuff how dusty you are my dear said she pray go and shift your gown perkins will show you the way she just gave a nod to the other two and then went back to her discourse with the gentleman next her those are what grandmamma calls easy manners i know but i think i like the other sort better my aunt kezia would have given the girls a warm grasp of the hand and a kiss and told them they were heartily welcome and begged them to make themselves at home grandmamma thinks that rough and coarse and countrybred but i am sure it makes me feel more as if people really were pleased to see me i felt that i must just speak first to my aunt dorothea and she did shake hands with flora and me and courtesied to annas then we courtesied to the company and left the room i telling the big man that grandmamma wished perkins to attend us the big man looked over the banisters and said harry call perkins when perkins came she proved as i expected to be grandmammas waitingmaid and she carried us off to a little chamber on the upper floor where was hardly room for anything but two beds flora i saw seemed to feel strange and uncomfortable as if she were somewhere where she had no business to be but annas behaved like one to the manner born and handed her gloves to perkins with the air of a princessi do not mean proudly but easily as if she knew just what to do and did it without any feeling of awkwardness we had to wait till the trunks were carried up and perkins had unpacked our teagowns then we shifted ourselves and had our hair dressed and went back to the withdrawing room perkins is a stranger to me and i was sorry not to see willet grandmammas old maid but grandmamma never keeps servants long so i was not surprised i dont believe willet had been with her above six years when i left carlisle annas sat down on an empty chair in the circle and began to talk with the lady nearest to her flora apparently in much hesitation took a chair but did not venture to talk i knew what i had to do and i felt as if my old ways would come back if i called them i sat down near my aunt dorothea that friend of yours cary is quite a distinguishedlooking girl said my aunt dorothea in a low voice really presentable for the country you know i said annas came of a high scots family and was related to sir james de lannoy of the isle of wight i saw that annas went up directly in my aunt dorotheas thermometer de lannoy said she a fine old norman line very well connected then i am glad to hear it flora i saw was getting over her shynessindeed i never knew her seem shy beforeand beginning to talk a little with her next neighbour i looked round but could not see any one i knew i took refuge in an inquiry after my uncle charles he is very well said my aunt dorothea he is away somewheremen always are at the court i dare say how strange it did sound i felt as if i had come into a new world i hope that is not your best gown child said my aunt dorothea but it is auntmy best teagown i answered then you must have a better replied she it is easy to see that was made in the country certainly it was aunt fanny and i made it my aunt dorothea shrugged her shoulders gave me a glance which said plainly dont tell tales out of school and turned to another lady in the group at brocklebank we never thought of not saying such things but i see i have forgotten many of my carlisle habits and i shall have to pick them up again by degrees when we went up to bed i found that grandmamma had asked annas to stay in london annas replied that her father had given her leave to stay a month if she wished it and were offered the chance and she would be very pleased but that as flora was her guest the invitation would have to include both grandmamma glanced again at flora and took another pinch of snuff i suppose she has some courtenay blood in her said she and drummond is not a bad namefor a scotswoman she can stay if she be not a covenanter and wont want to pray and preach she must have a new gown and then she will do if she keep her mouth shut she has a fine pair of shoulders if she were only dressed decently i am glad said i for i know what that means grandmamma likes annas and will like flora in time dont be any shyer than you can help flora that will not please her i do not think i am shy said flora at least i never felt so before but tonightcary i dont know what it looked like i could only think of a great spiders web and we three poor little flies had to walk straight into it i wonder where duncan and angus are tonight said annas i hope no one is playing spider there flora sighed but made no answer our new gowns had to be made in a great hurry for grandmamma had invited an assembly for the thursday night and she wished flora and me to be decently dressed she said i am sure i dont know how the mantuamaker managed it for the cloth was only bought on monday morning i suppose she must have had plenty of apprentices the gowns were sacques of cherry damask with quilted silk petticoats of black trimmed with silver lace i find hoops are all the mode again and very large indeedso big that when you enter a door you have to double your hoop round in front or lift it on one side out of the way the cap is a little scrap of a thing scarce bigger than a crownpiece and a flower or pompoon is stuck at the side stomachers are worn and very full elbowruffles velvet slippers with high heels grandmamma put a little grey powder in my hair but when flora said she was sure that her father would disapprove she did not urge her to wear it but she did want us both to wear red ribbons mixed with our white ones i did not know what to do i did not know mrs desborough was a trimmer said annas in the severest tone i ever heard from her lips what shall we do said i i shall not wear them said flora mrs desborough is not my grandmother nor has my father put me in her care i do not see therefore that i am at all bound to obey her for you cary it is different i think you will have to submit but only think what it means cried i it means said annas that you are indifferent in the matter of politics if it meant only that i said i should not think much about it but surely it means more much more it means that i am disloyal that i do not care whether the king or the elector wins the day or even that i do care and am willing to hide my belief for fashions or moneys sake this red ribbon on me is a lie and an acted lie is no better than a spoken one my aunt dorothea came in so immediately after i had spoken that i felt sure she must have heard me dear me what a fuss about a bit of ribbon said she cary dont be a little goose aunt i only want to be true cried i it is my truth i make a fuss about not my ribbons i will wear a ribbon of every colour in the rainbow if grandmamma wish it except just this one which tells falsehoods about me my dear it is so unbecoming in you to be thus warm said my aunt dorothea enthusiasm is always in bad taste no matter what it is about you will not see halfadozen ladies in the room in white ribbons nobody expects the prince to come south but aunt please give me leave to say that it will not alter my truthfulness whether the prince comes to london or goes to the north pole cried i if the elector himself shsh said my aunt dorothea my dear that sort of thing may be very well at brocklebank but it really will not do in bloomsbury square you must not bring your wild antiquated tory notions here tories are among the extinct animals not while my father is alive please aunt my dear we are not at brocklebank as i told you just now answered my aunt dorothea it may be all very well to toast the chevalier and pray for him and so forthi am sure i dont know whether it do him any good but when you come to living in the world with other people you must do as they doyes perkins certainly put miss courtenay a red ribbon and miss drummond alsomy dear girls you must not for me mrs charles if you please said flora very quietly i should prefer if you will allow it to remain in this room my aunt dorothea looked at her and seemed puzzled what to do with her miss keith said she do you wear the red certainly not madam replied annas well said my aunt dorothea shrugging her shoulders i suppose we must say you are scots girls and have not learnt english customsyou can let it alone for miss drummond perkinsbut that wont do for you cary you must have one aunt dorothea i will wear it if you bid me said i but i shall tell everybody who speaks to me that my red ribbon is a lie then you had better have none cried my aunt dorothea petulantly that would be worse than wearing all white cary i never knew you were so horribly obstinate i suppose i am older aunt and understand things better now said i dear i wish girls would stay girls said my aunt dorothea well perkins let it alone just do up that lace a little to the left that the white ribbon may not show so much there that will docary if your grandmamma notices this i must tell her it is all your fault well downstairs we went and found the company beginning to come my aunt dorothea i knew never cares much about anything to last but i was in some fear of grandmamma by the way i find this house is grandmammas not my uncle charless as i thought there was one lady there a mrs francis who was here the other evening when we came and she spoke kindly to us and began to talk with annas and flora i rather shrank into a corner by the window for i did not want grandmamma to see me people were chattering away on all sides of me and very droll it was to listen first to one and then to another i was amusing myself in this way and laughing to myself under a grave face when all at once i heard three words from the next window who said by no means in that soft velvet voice through which ran a ripple of silvery laughter i should have known that voice in the desert of arabia and the next moment she moved away from the window and i saw her face we stood fronting each other cecilia and i that she knew me as well as i knew her i could not doubt for an instant for one moment she hesitated whether to speak to me and i took advantage of it dropping the lowest courtesy i could make i turned my back upon her and walked straight away to the other end of the room but not before i had seen that she was superbly dressed and was leaning on the arm of mr parmenter not also before i caught a fiery flash gleaming at me out of the tawny eyes and knew that i had made an enemy of the most dangerous woman in my world but what could i have done else if i had accepted cecilias hand and treated her as a friend i should have felt as though i were conniving at an insult to my father at the other end of the room i nearly ran against a handsome darkhaired girl in a yellow satin slip who to my great astonishment said to me well played miss caroline courtenay i have been watching the little drama and i really compliment you on your readiness and spirit you have taken the wind out of her ladyships sails hatty i cried in much amazement is it you well i fancy so said she in her usual mocking way my beloved cary do tell me have you brought that delicious journal do let me read tonights entry hatty i cried all at once you yes madam if she had not on my best purple scarfmy lost scarf that my aunt kezia could not find but i did not go on i felt it was of no earthly use to talk to hatty seen it before havent you said hatty in her odious teasing way yes i thought i had better have it mine is so shabby and you are only a little missit does not matter for you beside you have grandmamma to look after you you shall have it again when i have done with it i had to bite my tongue terribly hard but i did manage to hold it i only said where are you staying hatty at mrs crosslands in charles street where i shall be perfectly delighted to see my youngest sister oh not with the bracewells with the bracewells certainly did you suppose they had pitchforked me through the window into mrs crosslands drawingroom but who is mrs crossland a friend of the bracewells said hatty with an air of such studied carelessness that i began to wonder what was behind it has mrs crossland daughters i asked onea little chit scarce in her teens is there a mr crossland there isnt a papa crossland if you mean that there is a young mr crossland oh said i pray miss caroline what do you mean by oh asked hatty whose eyes laughed with fun oh nothing i replied oh replied hatty so exactly in my tone that i could not help laughing take care her ladyship may see you hatty why do you call cecilia her ladyship well it doesnt know anything does it replied hatty in her teasing way only just up from the country isnt it madam mr anthony parmenter as was as old will says is sir anthony parmenter and miss cecilia osborne as was is her ladyship do you mean to say cecilia has married mr parmenter oh dear no she has married sir anthony then she jilted our father for a title the snake dont use such charming language my sweetest her ladyship might not admire it and if i were you i would make myself scarce she is coming this way then i will go the other said i and i did to my astonishment as soon as i had left her what should hatty do but walk up and shake hands with cecilia and in a few minutes they and mr parmenter were all laughing about something i was amazed beyond words i had always thought hatty pert teasing disagreeable but never underhand or mean but just then i saw a goodlooking young man join them and offer his arm to hatty for a walk round the room and it flashed on me directly that this was young mr crossland and that he was a friend of mri mean sir anthonyparmenter when we were undressing that night i said annas can a person do anything to make the world better what person asked she and smiled well say me can i do anything certainly you can be as good as you know how to be but that wont make other people better i do not know that some other people it may but that will be the people who are good already i want to mend the people who are bad then pray for them said annas gravely pray for cecilia osborne it came upon me with a feeling of intense aversion i could not pray for her nor did i think there would be a bit of good in praying for hatty and yetif she were getting drawn into cecilias toilsif that young mr crossland were not a good mani might pray for her to be kept safe i thought i would try it but when i began to pray for hatty it seemed unkind to leave out fanny and sophy and then i got to father and my aunt kezia and then to maria and bessy and then to sam and will and then to old elspie and then to helen raeburn and my uncle drummond and angus and mr keith and the laird and lady monksburnand so on and on till the whole world seemed full of people to be prayed for i suppose it is so alwaysif we only thought of it grandmamma never noticed my ribbonsor rather my want of them it really is of no use my trying to keep to dates i have begun several times and i cannot get on with it that last piece dated the rd took me nearly a week to write so that what was tomorrow when i began was behind yesterday before i had finished i shall just go right on without any more pother and put a date now and then when it is very particular grandmamma has an assembly every weektuesday is her day note and now and then an extra one on thursday or saturday i do not think anything would persuade her to have an assembly or play cards on a friday but on a sunday evening she always has her rubber to floras horror it does not startle me because i remember it always was so when i lived with her at carlisle nor annas because she knew people did such things in the south i find grandmamma usually spends the winter at the bath but she has not quite made up her mind whether to go this year or not on account of all the tumults in the north if the royal army should march on london and annas says of course they will we may be shut up here for a long while but annas says if we heard anything certain of it she and flora would set off at once to the island as she always calls the isle of wight last tuesday i was sitting by a young lady whom i have talked with more than once her name is newton i do not quite know how we got on to the subject but we began to talk politics i said i could not understand why it was but people in the south did not seem to care for politics nearly so much as i was accustomed to see done half the ladies in the room appeared to be trimmers and many more wore the red ribbon alone such people with us would never be received into a tory family we do not take things so seriously as you said she with a diverted look that with us is an opinion which with you is an enthusiasm i suppose up there where the sun never shines you have to make some sort of noise and fuss to keep yourselves alive the sun never shines cried i now really miss newton you dont mean to say you believe that story i am only repeating what i have been told said she i never was north of barnet we are alive enough said i i wonder if you are it looks to me much more like living to make beds and boil puddings and stitch shirts than to sit on a sofa in a satin gown flickering a fan and talking rubbish oh fie said miss newton laughing and tapping me on the arm with her fan that really will not do miss courtenay you will shock everybody in the room i can tell you most whom i see here shock me said i they seem to have no honour and no honesty they think white and they wear red or the other way about just as it happens if the prince were to enter london on monday what colour would all these ribbons be next tuesday night the colour of yours undoubtedly she said laughing and do you call that honesty said i these people could not change their opinions and feelings between monday and tuesday and to change their ribbons without them would be simply falsehood i told you you take things so seriously she answered but is it not a serious thing i continued and ought we to take serious things any way but seriously miss newton do you not see that it is a question of rightnot a question of taste or convenience your allegiance is not a piece of jewellery that you can give to the person you like best it is a debt which you can only pay to the person to whom you owe it do you not see that my dear miss courtenay said miss newton in a low voice excuse me but you are a little too warm it is not thought good taste you know to take up any subject so very decidedly as that and is right only to be thought a matter of taste cried i quite disregarding her caution am i to rule my life as i do my trimmings by the fashionbook we have not come to that yet in the north i can assure you we are a sturdy race there madam and dont swallow our opinions as we do pills of whatever the apothecary likes to put into them we prefer to know what we are taking do excuse me said miss newton with laughter in her eyes and laying her hand upon my arm but dont you see people are looking round let them look round cried i i am not ashamed of one word that i have spoken dear miss courtenay i am not objecting to your words every one of course has his opinions yours i suppose are your fathers not a bit of it cried i they are my own but young ladies of your age should not have strong opinions said she she is about five years older than i am will you tell me how to help it said i i must go through the world with my eyes shut if i am not to form opinions oh yes moderately she replied shut my eyes moderately i asked or form opinions moderately both answered miss newton laughing your advice is worse than wasted my dear miss newton said a voice behind us that young person will never do anything in moderation you know better hatty said i and as your elder sister my darling let me give you a scrap of advice men never like contentious arguing women dont be a little goose i dont know whether i am a goose or a duck but i am afraid i could have done something to hatty just then which i should have found agreeable and she would not that eldersister air of hers is so absurd for she is not eighteen months older than i am i can stand it well enough from sophy but from hatty it really is too ridiculous but that was nothing compared with the insult she had offered not so much to me as through me to all womanhood men dont like does it signify three halfpence what they like are women to make slaves of themselves considering what men fancy or dont fancy men mark you not your father or brother or husband that would be right and reasonable enough but men hatty i said after doing battle with myself for a moment i think i had better give you no answer if i did and if my words and tones suited my feelings i should scream the house down she burst out laughing behind her fan i walked away at once lest i should be tempted to reply further i am afraid i almost ran for i came bolt against a gentleman in the corner and had to stop and make my apologies dont run quite over me cary if it suit you said somebody who i thought was in cumberland note the assemblies on a ladys visiting day required no invitations the rooms were open to any person acquainted with members of the family note southerners are respectfully informed that the use of only for but is a northern peculiarity note sensitive delicate chapter nine difficulties and t was na for a popish yoke that bravest men came forth to part wi life and dearest ties and a that life was worth jacobite ballad ephraim hebblethwaite i cried out i believe so he said laughing where did you come from from a certain place in the north called brocklebank but what brought you to london i cried what brought me to london he repeated in quite a different toneso much softer well cary i wanted to see something have you been to see it i asked more to give myself time to cool down than because i cared to know yes i have been to see it he said and smiled and did you find it as agreeable as you expected quite i had seen it before and i wanted to know if it were spoiled oh i hope it is not spoiled said i not at all said he his voice growing softer and softer no it is not spoiled yet cary do you expect it will be i was getting cooler now i dont know he answered very gravely for him for ephraim is not at all given to moroseness and long faces god grant it never may i could not think what he meant and i did not like to ask him indeed i had not much opportunity for he began talking about our journey and brocklebank and all the people there and i was so interested that we did not get back to what ephraim came to see there is a new vicar he says whose name is mr liversedge and he has quite changed things in the parish the people are divided about him some like him and some do not he does not read his sermons which is very strange but speaks them out just as if he were talking to you and he has begun to catechise the children in an afternoon and to visit everybody in the parish and he neither shoots hunts nor fishes his sermons have a ring in them says ephraim they wake you up old john oakley complains that he cant nap nigh so comfortable as when th old vicar were there and mally crosthwaite says she never heard such goings onwhy th parson asked her if she were a christianshe that had always kept to her church rain and shine and never missed once and it was hard if she were to miss the christmas dole this year along o not being a christian shed always thought being church was plenty good enoughnone o your low dissenting work but mercy on us she didnt know what to say to this here parson that she didnt a christian indeed the parson was a christian was he well if so she didnt make much count o christians for all he was a parson didnt he tell old john he couldnt recommend him for the dole just by reason he rapped out an oath or two when his granddaughter let the milkjug falland if old bet donnerthwaite had had a sup too much one night at the alehouse was it for a gentleman born like the parson to take note of that but he has done worse things than that cary said ephraim with grave mouth and laughing eyes what go on said i for i saw something funny was coming why would you believe it said ephraim he called on mr bagnall and asked him if he felt satisfied with the pattern he was setting his flock i am very glad he did said i what did mr bagnall say got into an awful rage and told it to all the neighbourhoodas bearing against mr liversedge you understand well then he is a greater simpleton than i took him for said i i am rather afraid said ephraim in a hesitating tone that he will call at the fells and if he say anything that the squire thinks impertinent or interfering he will make an enemy of him oh father would just show him the door said i without more ado yes i fear so replied ephraim and i am sure he is a good man cary a little rash and incautious perhaps does not take time to study character and so forth but i am sure he means to do right it will be a pity said i ephraim do you think the prince will march on london i have not a doubt of it cary oh said i i dont quite know whether i felt more glad or sorry but you will not stay here if he do yes i think i shall said he you will join the army no not unless i am pressed i suppose my face asked another question for he added with a smile i came to keep watch ofthat i must see that it is not spoiled i wonder what that is if ephraim would tell me i might take some care of it too i should not like anything he cared for to be spoiled as i sat in a corner afterwards i was looking at him and comparing him in my own mind with all the fine gentlemen in the chamber ephraim was quite as handsome as any of them but his clothes certainly had a country cut and he did not show as easy manners as they i am afraid grandmamma would say he had no manners he actually put his hand out to save a tray when grandmammas black boy caesar stumbled at the tigerskin mat and i am sure no other gentleman in the room would have condescended to see it there are many little things by which it is easy to tell that ephraim has not been used to the best society and yet i could not help feeling that if i were ill and wanted to be helped upstairs or if i were wretched and wanted comforting it would be ephraim to whom i should appeal and not one of these fine gentlemen they seemed only to be made for sunshine he would wear and stand rain if hattys men were all ephraims there might be some sense in caring for their opinions but these fellowsi really cant afford a better wordthese chiels with glasses in their een as sam says who seem to have no opinions beyond the colour of their coats and paying compliments to everything they see with a petticoat ondo they expect sensible women to care what they think let them have a little more sense themselves firstthats what i say i said so one morning as we were dressing and to my surprise annas replied i fancy they have sense enough cary when there are no women in the room they think we only care for nonsense yes i expect that is it added flora i flew out i could not stand that what sort of women must their mothers and sisters be cardplaying snufftakers and giddy flirts said annas be just to them cary if they never see women of any other sort how are they to know that such are poor wretches do you think that possible annas said i miserably possible she said very seriously in every human heart cary there is a place where the man or the woman dwells inside all the frippery and mannerism the real creature itself stripped of all disguises dig down to that place if you want to see it i should think it takes a vast deal of digging yes in some people but that is the thing god looks at that is it for which christ died and for which christs servants ought to feel love and pity i thought it would be terribly difficult to feel love or pity for some people my uncle charles has just come in and he says a rumour is flying that there has been a great battle near edinburgh and that the prince who was victorious is marching on carlisle flora went very white and even annas set her lips but i do not see what we have to fearat least if angus and mr keith are safe charles said grandmamma where are those white cockades we used to have i havent a notion mother nor had my aunt dorothea but when perkins was asked she said isnt it them madam as you pinned in a parcel and laid away in the garret oh i dare say said grandmamma fetch them down and let us see if they are worth anything so perkins fetched the parcel and the cockades were looked over and pronounced useable by torchlight though too bad a colour for the daytime keep the packet handy perkins said grandmamma shall i give them out now madam asked perkins oh not yet said grandmamma wait till we see how things turn out white soils so soon too we had much better go on with the black ones at any rate till the prince has passed bedford it is wicked i suppose to despise ones elders but is it not sometimes very difficult to help doing it i have been reading over the last page or two that i writ and i came on a line that set me thinking things do set me thinking of late in a way they never used to do it was that about ephraims not being used to the best society what is the best society god and the angels i suppose nobody could question that yet if an angel had been in grandmammas rooms just then would he not have cared more that caesar should not fall and hurt himself and most likely be scolded as well than that he should be thought to have fine easy manners himself and i suppose the lord jesus died even for caesar black though he be well then the next best society must be those who are going to heaven and ephraim is one of them i believe and those who are not going must be bad society even if they are dressed up to the latest fashionbook and have the newest and finest breeding at the tips of their fingers the world seems to be turned round ah but what was that text mr whitefield quoted love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life are not of the father but are of the world then must we turn the world round before we get things put straight it looks like it i have just been looking at another text where saint paul gives a list of the works of the flesh note galatians five to and i find along with some things which everybody calls wicked a lot of others which everybody in the world does and never seems to think of as wrong hatred variance emulations envyings drunkenness revellings and such like and he says they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god that is dreadful i am afraid the world must be worse than i thought i must take heed to my aunt kezias rulesset the lord always before me and remember that this world passeth away i suppose the world will laugh at me if i be not one of its people what will that matter if it passeth away the angels will like me all the better and they are the best society and i was thinking the other night as i lay awake what an awful thing it would be to hear the lord jesus the very man who died for me say depart from me i think i could stand the worlds laughter but i am sure i could never bear that christ could help and comfort me if the world used me ill but who could help me or comfort me when he had cast me out there would be nothing to take refuge innot even the world for it would be done with then oh i do hope our saviour will never say that to me i seem bound to get into fights with miss newton i do not mean quarrels but arguments she is a pleasant goodhumoured girl but she has such queer ideas i dare say she thinks i have i do not know what my aunt kezia would say to her she does not appear to see the right and wrong of things at all it is only what people will think and what one likes if everybody did only what they likedis that proper grammar i wonder oh well never mindi think it would make the world a very disagreeable place to live in and it is not too pleasant now and as to people thinking what on earth does it signify what they think if they dont think right if one person thinking that two and two make three does not alter the fact why should ten thousand people thinking so be held to make any difference how many simpletons does it take to be equal to a wise man i wonder people do not see how ridiculous such notions are we hear nothing at all from the norththe seat of war as they begin to call it now everybody supposes that the prince is marching southwards and will be here some day before long it diverts me exceedingly to sit every tuesday in a corner of the room and watch the red ribbons disappearing and the white ones coming instead grandmammas two footmen morris and dobson have orders to take the black cockade out of their hats and clap on a white one the minute they hear that the royal army enters middlesex november nd the prince has taken carlisle it is said that he is marching on derby as fast as his troops can come everybody is in a flutter i can guess where father is and how excited he will be i know he would go to wait on his royal highness directly and i should not wonder if a number of the officers are quartered at brocklebankwere i should say i almost wish we were there but when i said so to ephraim who comes every tuesday such a strange look of pain came into his eyes and he said dont cary so sadly i wonder what the next thing will be after i had written this came one of grandmammas extra assembliesoh i should have altered my date it is so troublesomeon thursday evening and i looked round and could not see one red ribbon that was not mixed with white a great many wore plain white and among them miss newton i sat down by her how do you this evening miss newton i mischievously asked i am so delighted to see you become a tory since i saw you last tuesday how do you know i was not one before asked she laughing your ribbons were not said i they were red on tuesday well you ought to compliment me on the suddenness of my conversion said she for i never was a trimmer oh how absurd it is to make ribbons and patches mean things why should one not wear red and white just as one does green and blue it would be a boon to some people i am sure said i perhaps we shall some day when the world has become sensible said miss newton can you give me the date madam it was a strange voice which asked this question i looked up over my shoulder and saw a man of no particular age dressed in gown and cassock note miss newton looked up too laughing indeed i cannot mr raymond said she can you only by events he answered i should expect it to be after the king has entered his capital i felt rather than saw what he meant i am a poor hand at riddles said miss newton shaking her head i did not expect to see you here mr raymond nor would you have seen me here was the answer had i not been charged to deliver a message of grave import to one who is here not me i hope said miss newton looking graver not you i trust you will thank god for it and now can you kindly direct me to the young lady for whom i am to look is there here a miss flora drummond i sprang up with a smothered cry of angus are you miss drummond he asked very kindly flora drummond is my cousin i answered i will take you to her but is it about angus it is about her brother lieutenant drummond he is not killedlet me say so at once we were pressing through the superb crowd and the moment afterwards we reached flora she was standing by a little table talking with ephraim hebblethwaite who spoke to mr raymond in a way which showed that they knew each other flora just looked at him and then said quietly enough to all appearance though she went very white you have bad news for some one and i think for me lieutenant drummond was severely wounded at prestonpans and has fallen into the hands of the kings troops said mr raymond gently as if he wished her to know the worst at once he is a prisoner now flora clasped her hands with a long breath of pain and apprehension you are sure sir there is no mistake i think none he replied i have the news from colonel keith if you heard it from him it must be true she said but is he in london yes and he ran some risk as you may guess to send that message to you duncan is always good said flora with tears in her eyes he was not hurt i hope will you see him again he said he was not hurt worth mention i began to wonder what size of a hurt mr keith would think worth mention yes i shall see him again this evening or tomorrow oh do give him the kindest words and thanks from me said flora commanding her voice with some difficulty i wish i could have seen him let me tell annasshe may wish and away she went to fetch annas while mr raymond looked after her with a look which i thought half sad and half diverted will you tell me i said how mr keith ran any risk why you do not suppose young lady that london is in the hands of the rebels the rebelsoh you are a whig i see but the prince is coming and fast is he not not just yet i think said mr raymond with an odd look in his eyes why we hear it from all quarters said i and the red ribbons are all getting white mr raymond smiled rather a singular transformation truly but i think the ribbons will be well worn before the young chevalier reviews his army in hyde park i will not believe it cried i the prince must be victorious god defends the right god defends his own said mr raymond do you see in history that he always defends the cause which you account to be right no i could not say that how can you be an opponent of the cause i criedi am afraid shifting my ground he smiled again i can well understand the attraction of the cause said he to a young and enthusiastic nature there is something very enticing in the son of an exiled prince come to win back what he conceives to be the inheritance of his fathers and in truth if the old pretender were really the son of king jameswell it might be more difficult to say what a mans duty would be in that case but that as you know is thought by many to be at best very doubtful you do not believe he is cried i i do not believe it said mr raymond i wondered how he could possibly doubt it nor is that all that is to be considered he went on i can tell you young lady if he were to succeed we should all rue it bitterly before long his triumph is the triumph of romethe triumph of persecution and martyrdom and agony for gods people i know that said i but right is right for all that the crown is his not the electors on that principle any man might steal money if he meant to do good with it the crown is neither georges nor jamess as some think said mr raymond but belongs to the people who could have stood such a speech as that the people i cried the mobthe rabblethe crown is theirs how can any man imagine such a thing you forget methinks young lady said mr raymond as quietly as before that you are one of those of whom you speak i forget nothing of the kind cried i too angry to be civil of course i know i am one of the people what do you mean am i to maintain that black beetles are cherubim because i am a black beetle truth is truth the crown is gods not the peoples when he chose to make the present kingking james of course not that wretched elector the son of his father he distinctly told the people whom he wished them to have for their king what right have they to dispute his ordinance i was quite beyond myself i had forgotten where i was and to whom i was talkingforgotten mr raymond and angus and flora and even grandmamma it seemed to me as if there were only two parties in the world and on the one hand were god and the king and on the other a miserable mass of silly nobodies called the people how could such contemptible insects presume to judge for themselves or to set their wills up in opposition to the will of him whom god had commanded them to obey the softest lightest of touches fell on my shoulder i looked up into the grave grey eyes of annas keith and feeling myself excessively rude and utterly extinguishedand yet after all righti slipped out of the group and made my way into the farthest corner mr raymond of course would think me no gentlewoman well it did not much matter what he thought he was only a whig and when the prince were actually come which would be in a very few days at the furthestthen he would see which of us was right meantime i could wait and the next minute i felt as if i could not waitno not another instant sit down cary you look tired said ephraim beside me i am not a bit tired thank you said i but i am abominably angry nothing more tiring said he what about oh dont make me go over it i have been talking to a whig that means i suppose that the whig has been talking to you which beat i beg pardonyou did of course i was right and he was wrong if you mean that said i but whether he thinks he is beaten if he be an englishman he does not said ephraim particularly if he be a north country man i dont know what country he comes from cried i i should like to make mincemeat of him indigestible suggested ephraim quite gravely ephraim what are we to do for angus said i as it came back to me and i told him the news which mr raymond had brought ephraim gave a soft whispered whistle you may well ask said he i am afraid cary nothing can be done what will they do to him his face grew graver still you know he said in a low voice what they did to lord derwentwater colonel keith had better lie close but that whig knows where he is cried i heephraim do you know him know whom cary mr raymond is he your whig asked ephraim laughing pray dont make him into mincemeat he is one of the best men in england he need be said i he is a horrid whig what do you being friends with such a man he is a very good man cary he was one of my tutors at school i never knew what his politics were before tonight we were silent for a while and then grandmamma sent for me not as i feared to scold me for being loudspoken and warm but to tell me that one of my lappets hung below the other and i must make perkins alter it before tuesday i do not know how i bore the rest of the evening when i went up at last to our chamber i found it empty lucette grandmammas french woman who waits on her while perkins is rather my aunt dorotheas and ours came in to tell me that perkins was gone to bed with a headache and hoped that we would allow her to wait on us tonight when she was dismissed by the elder ladies oh i want no waiting at all said i if somebody will just take the pins out of my headdress carefully do that lucette and then i shall need nothing else i cannot speak for the other young ladies lucette threw a wrappingcape over my shoulders and began to remove the pins with deft fingers grandmamma had not yet come upstairs mademoiselle agnes looks charmante tonight said she but then she is always charmante but what has mademoiselle flore so white so white she is i saw her through the door i told her that floras brother had been taken prisoner ah this horrible war cried she can the grands seigneurs not leave alone the wars or else fight out their quarrels their own selves oh the prince will soon be here said i and then it will all be over all be over ah sapristi mademoiselle does not know the prince means the priests and the priests meanbon have i not heard my grandmother tell tell what lucette i thought you were a papist like all frenchwomen a catholici why then came my grandfather to this country and my father and all does mademoiselle suppose they loved better spitalfields than blois should they then leave a country where the sun is glorious and the vines ravissantes for this black cold place where the sun shine once a year vraiment seraitil possible i laughed the sun shines oftener in cumberland lucette i wont defend spitalfields but i want to know what your grandmother told you about the priests the priests have two sides mademoiselle on the one is the confessional you must goyou shall not choose you kneel you speak out allevery thought in your heart every secret of your dearest friend you may not hide one little thought the priest hears you hesitate the questions comemademoiselle terrible questions questions i could not ask nor you understand you learn to understand them they burn up your heart they drag down to hell your soul that is one side would they see me there twice said i then if not so there is the other side the chains the tortureirons the fire you can choose so you tell or you die there is no more choice does mademoiselle wonder that we came no indeed lucette how could i but that was in france this is england we are a different sort of people here youyes but the church and the priests are the same everywhere everywhere may the good god keep them from us why lucette you are praying against the prince if it be as you say ah would i then do harm to monseigneur le prince let him leave there the priests and none shall be more glad to see him come than i i love the right always but the priests no no but if it be right lucette the good god knows what is right but mademoiselle can it be right to bring in the priests and the confessions is it not god who brings them lucette we only bring the king if the king choose to bring the priests ah then the lord will bring the fires but the lord bring the priests the lord shut up the preches and set up the mass the lord burn his poor servants and clothe the servants of satan in gold and scarlet the lord forbid his word and set up images comment mademoiselle it would not be possible but lucette the king has the right the lord christ has the right said lucette solemnly is it not he whose right it is mademoiselle he stands before the king we heard grandmamma saying goodnight to my uncle charles at the foot of the stairs and lucette ran off to her chamber i felt more plagued than ever what is right just then annas and flora came up annas grave but composed flora with a white face and red eyes o cary cary she came and put her arms round me pray for angus we shall never see him again and he is not readyhe is not ready my poor flora i said and i did my best to soothe her but annas did better the lord can make him ready she said he healed the paralytic man dear as some have it entirely for the faith of them that bore him and surely the daughter of the canaanitish woman could have no faith herself pray for him annas sobbed flora you have more faith than i i am not so hard triedyet was the grave reply you do not think mr keith in danger said i i think the lord sitteth above the waterfloods cary and i would rather not look lower not till i must and that may be very soon annas said i i wish you would tell me what right is i do get so puzzled what puzzles you cary right is what god wills but would the prince not have the right if god did not will him to succeed the lawgiver can always repeal his own laws we in the crowd cary can only judge when they be repealed by hearing him decree something contrary to them and there are no precedents in that court whatsoever the lord pleased that did he we can only wait and see until we do see it we must follow our last orders my father says added flora that this question was made harder than it need have been by the throwing out of the exclusion bill the house of commons passed it but the bishops and lord halifax threw it out if that had been passed making it impossible for a papist to be king then king james would never have come to the throne at all and all the troubles and persecutions of his reign would not have happened that my father says was where they went wrong well said i it does look like it but how queer that the bishops should be the people to go wrong annas laughed you will find that nothing new cary if you search said she they that lead thee cause thee to err is as old a calamity as the prophets and where priests or wouldbe priests are the leaders they very generally do go wrong i wish said i there were a few more thou shalt nots in the bible have you finished obeying all there are i considered that question with one sleeve off well no i suppose not i said at length pulling off the other annas smiled gravely and said no more glorious news the prince is at derby i am sure there is no more need to fear for angus his royal highness will be here in a very few days now and then let the whigs look to themselves grandmamma has bought some more white cockades she says hatty has improved wonderfully her cheeks are not so shockingly red and she speaks better and has more decent manners she thinks the crosslands have done her a great deal of good i thought hatty looking not at all well the last time she was here and so grave for heralmost sad and i am afraid the crosslands or somebody have done her a great deal of bad but somehow hatty is one of those people whom you cannot question unless she likes something inside me will not put the questions i dont know what it is i wish i knew everything if i could only understand myself i should get on better and how am i going to understand other people note a clergyman always wore his cassock at this time whitefield was very severe on those worldly clergy who laid it aside and went disguisednamely in the ordinary coatto entertainments of various kinds chapter ten spiders webs why does he find so many tangled threads so many dislocated purposes so many failures in the race of life rev horatius bonar dd we had a grand time of it last night to celebrate the princes entry into derby i did not see one red ribbon grandmamma is very much put out at the forbidding of french cambrics she says nobody will be able to have a decent ruffle or a respectable handkerchief now but what can you expect of these hanoverians and i am sure she looked smart enough last night we had dancingfirst the minuet and then a roundpeppers black and then dull sir john and a country dance smiling polly flora would not dance and grandmamma excused her because she was a ministers daughter grandmamma always says a clergyman when she tells people she says minister is a low word only used by dissenters and she does not want people to know that any guest of hers has any connection with those creatures however thank heaven says she the girl is not my granddaughter i dont know what she would say if i were to turn dissenter i suppose she would cut me off with a shilling ephraim said so and i asked him what it meant shillings are not very sharp and what was i to be cut off ephraim seemed excessively amused you are too good cary said he did you think the shilling was a knife to cut you off something it means she will only leave you a shilling in her will well that will be a shilling more than i expect said i and ephraim went off laughing i asked miss newton as she seemed to know him who mr raymond was she says he is the lecturer at saint helens and might have been a decent man if that horrid creature mr wesley had not got hold of him oh do you know anything about mr wesley or mr whitefield cried i are they in london now if i could hear them again i am sure i cannot tell you said miss newton laughing i have heard my father speak of them with some very strong language after it that i know my dear miss courtenay does everything rouse your enthusiasm for how you can bring that brilliant light into your eyes for the prince and for mr wesley is quite beyond me i should have thought they were the two opposite ends of a pole i dont know anything about mr wesley i said and i have only heard mr whitefield preach once in scotland you have heard him she asked yes and liked him very much said i miss newton shrugged her shoulders in that little french way she has why some people think him the worse of the two she said i dont know anything about them i can tell youonly that mr wesley makes dissenters faster than you could make tattingstitches what does he do to them said i i dont know and i dont want to know said she if he had lived in former times i am sure he would have been taken up for witchcraft he is a clergyman or they say so but i really wonder the bishops have not turned him out of the church long ago a clergyman and makes people dissenters cried i why mr whitefield quoted the articles in his sermon they said so she replied i know nothing about it i never heard the man thank heaven but they say he goes about preaching to all sorts of dreadful creaturesthose wild miners down in cornwall and coalheavers and any sort of mobs he can get to listen only fancy a clergymana gentlemandoing any such thing i thought a moment and some words came to my mind do you think mr wesley was wrong i said the common people heard him gladly and i suppose you would not say that our lord was not a gentleman dear miss courtenay forgive me but what very odd things you say andexcuse medont you know it is not thought at all good taste to quote the bible in polite society is the bible worse off for that said i or is it the polite society the best society i suppose ought to be in heaven and i fancy they do not shut out the bible there what think you are you very innocent she answered laughing or are you only making believe you must know surely that religion is not talked about except from the pulpit and on sundays but can we all be sure of dying on a sunday i answered we shall want religion then shall we not hush we dont talk of dying eitherit is too shocking but dont we do it sometimes i said miss newton looked as if she did not know whether to laugh or be angry certainly very much disturbed let us talk of something more agreeable i beg said she see miss bracewell is going to sing oh she will sing nothing worth listening to said i i suppose you think only methodist hymns worth listening to responded miss newton rather sneeringly i dont like to be sneered at i suppose nobody does but it does not make me feel timid and yield as it seems to do many it only makes me angry well said i listen how much this is worth amelia drew off her gloves with a listless air which i believe she thought exceedingly genteel i cannot undertake to describe her song it was one of those queer lackadaisical ditties which always remind me of those tunes which go just where you dont expect them to go and end nowhere i hate them and i dont like the songs much better of course there was a lady wringing her handswhy do people in ballads wring their hands so much i never saw anybody do it in my lifeand a cavalier on a coalblack steed and a silvery moon what would become of the songwriters if there were no moon and no seaand she sat and wailed and he did something or other i could not exactly hear what and at last he or she or both of them only that would not suit the grammar was at rest and i was thankful to hear it for amelia stopped singing how sweet and sad said miss newton do you like that kind of song i think it is rubbish she laughed with that little deprecating air which she often uses to me i looked up to see who was going to sing next and to my extreme surprise and almost equal pleasure i saw annas sit down to the harp oh miss keith is going to sing cried i i should like to hear hers a scottish ballad no doubt replied miss newton there was a soft low weirdlike prelude and then came a voice like that of a thrush at which every other in the room seemed to hush instinctively each word was clear this was annass song she saidwe parted for a while but we shall meet again ere long i work in lowly lonely room and he amid the foreign throng but here i willingly abide here where i see the other side look to those hills which reach away beyond the sea that rolls between here from my casement day by day their happy summits can be seen happy although they us divide i know he sees the other side the days go on to make the year a year we must be parted yet i sing amid my crosses light for on those hills mine eyes are set you say those hills our eyes divide ay but he sees the other side so these dividing hills become our point of meeting every eve up to the hills we look and pray and loveour work so soon we leave and then no more shall aught divide we dwell upon the other side pretty said miss newton in the tone which people use when they do not think a thing pretty but fancy that you expect them to say so but not so charming as miss bracewells song wait said i she has not finished yet the harp was speaking nowin a sad low voice rising gradually to a note of triumph then it sank low again and annass voice continued the song she saidwe parted for a while but we shall meet again ere long i dwell in lonely lowly room and he hath joined the heavenly throng yet here i willingly abide for yet i see the other side i look unto the hills of god beyond the life that rolls between here from my work by faith each day their blessed summits can be seen blessed although they us divide i know he sees the other side the days go on the days go on through earthly life we meet not yet i sing amid my crosses light for on those hills mine eyes are set tis true those hills our eyes divide ay but he sees the other side so the eternal hills become our point of meeting every eve up to the hills i look and pray and lovesoon all my work i leave and then no more shall aught divide we dwell upon the other side i turned to miss newton with my eyes full as annas rose from the harp the expression of her face was a curious mixture of feelings was ever such a song sung in mrs desboroughs drawingroom she cried she will think it no better than a methodist hymn i am afraid miss keith has done herself no good with her hostess but grandmamma would never i said hesitatingly annas keiths connections are i advise you not to be too sure what she could never answered miss newton with a little capable nod mrs desborough would scarce be civil to the princess herself if she sang a pious song in her drawingroom on a reception evening but it was charming i said miss newton shrugged her shoulders the same things do not charm everybody said she it seemed to me no better than that methodist doggerel the latter half at least the beginning promised better when we went up to bed annas came to me as i stood folding my shoulderknots and laid a hand on each of my shoulders from behind cary we must say goodbye i think i scarce expected it but mrs desboroughs face when my song was ended had goodbye in it o annas said i surely she would never be angry with you for a mere song your connections are so good and grandmamma thinks so much of connections if my song had only had a few wicked words in it replied annas with that slight curl of her lip which i was learning to understand i dare say she would have recovered it by tomorrow and if my connections had been poor peopleor better whigsor better still disreputable rakesshe might have got over that but a pious song and a sisterly connection of spirit with mr whitefield and the scottish covenanters no cary she will not survive that i never yet knew a worldly woman forgive that one crime of crimescalvinism anything else dont you see why my dear it sets her outside and she knows that i know she is outside therefore i am unforgivable however absurd the idea may be in reality it is to her mind equivalent to my setting her outside she is unable to recognise that she has chosen to stay without and i am guilty of nothing worse than unavoidably seeing that she is there that i should be able to see it is unpardonable i am sorry it should have happened just now but i suppose it was to be are you going to tell her so i asked wondering what annas meant i expect she will tell me before tomorrow is over said annas with a peculiar smile but what made you choose that song then i thought it so pretty i chose the one i knew to which i supposed she would object the least replied annas she asked me to sing when we came down to breakfast the next morning i felt that something was in the air grandmamma sat so particularly straight up and my aunt dorothea looked so prim and my uncle charles fidgetted about between the fire and the window like a man who knew of something coming which he wanted to have over my aunt dorothea poured the chocolate in silence when all were served grandmamma took a pinch of snuff miss keith madam do you think the air of the isle of wight wholesome at this season of the year so much so madam that i am inclined to propose we should resume our journey thither grandmamma took another pinch i will beg you then to make my compliments to sir james and tell him how much entertained i have been by your visit and especially by your performance on the harp you have a fine finger miss keith and your choice of a song is unexceptionable i thank you for the compliment madam which i shall be happy to make to sir james there was nothing but dead silence after that until breakfast was over when we were back in our room i broke down to lose both annas and flora was too much o annas why did you take the bull by the horns i cried she laughed it is always the best way cary when you see him put his head down annas and flora are gone and i feel like one shipwrecked i wander about the house and do not know what to do i might read but grandmamma has no books except dreary romances in huge volumes which date i suppose from the time when she was a girl at school and my uncle charles has none but books about farming and etiquette i have looked up and mended all my clothes and cannot find any sewing to do i wrote to sophy only last week and they will not expect another letter for a while i wish something pleasant would happen the only thing i can think of to do is to go in a chair to visit hatty and the bracewells and i am afraid that would be something unpleasant i have not spoken to mr crossland but i do not like the look of him and mrs crossland is a stranger and i am tired of strangers they so seldom seem to turn out pleasant people just as i had written that as if to complete my vexation my aunt dorothea looked in and told me to put on my cherry satin this evening for sir anthony and my lady parmenter were expected if there be a creature i particularly wish not to see he is sure to come i wish i knew why things are always going wrong in this world there are two or three people that i would give a good deal for and i am quite sure they will not be here and i should think cecilia dear at threefarthings with sir anthony thrown in for the penny i wish i were making jumballs in the kitchen at brocklebank and could have a good talk with my aunt kezia afterwards somehow i never cared much about it when i could and now that i cannot i feel as if i would give anything for it are things always like that does nothing in this world ever happen just as one would like it in every point in my cherrycoloured satin with white shoulderknots a blue pompoon in my hair and my new hoop i detest these hoops they are horrid i came down to the withdrawing room and cast my eye round the chamber grandmamma in brocaded black silk sat where she always does at the side of the fire and my uncle charleswho for a wonder was at home and my aunt dorothea were receiving the people as they came in the bracewells were there already and hatty and mr crossland and a middleaged lady who i suppose was his mother and miss newton and a few more whose faces and names i know sir anthony and my lady parmenter came in just after i got there what has come over hatty she does not look like the same girl grandmamma can never talk of her glazed red cheeks now she is whiter almost than i am and so thin i am quite sure she is either ill or unhappy or both but i cannot ask her for somehow we never meet each other except for a minute several times i have thought and the thought grows upon me that somebody does not want hatty and me to have a quiet talk with each other at first i thought it was hatty who kept away from me herself but i am beginning to think now that somebody else is doing it i do not trust that young mr crossland not one bit yet why he should wish to keep us apart i cannot even imagine i made up my mind to get hold of hatty and ask her when she were going home i think she would be safer there than here but it was a long long while before i could reach her so many people seemed to be hemming her in i sat on an ottoman in the corner watching my opportunity when all at once a voice called me back to something else dear little cary i have been so wishing for a chat with you hatty used to say that you may always know something funny is coming when you see a cat wag her tail i had come to the conclusion that whenever one person addressed me with endearing phrases something sinister was coming i looked up this time i did not courtesy and walk away as i did on the last occasion i wanted to avoid an open quarrel if she had sought me out after that i could not avoid it but to speak to me as if nothing had happenedhow could the woman be so brazen as that i looked up and saw a large goldcoloured fan most beautifully painted with birds of all the hues of the rainbow from over which those tawny eyes were glancing at me and for one moment i wished that hating people were not wicked for what purpose madam i replied dear child you are angry with me she said and the soft warm gloved hand pressed mine before i could draw it away it is so natural for of course you do not understand but it makes me very sorry for i loved you so much o serpent how beautiful you are but you are a serpent still did you i said and my voice sounded hard and cold to my own ears i take the liberty of doubting whether you and i give that name to the same thing the light gleamed and flashed softened and darkened then shot out again from those wonderful beautiful eyes and you wont forgive me she said in a soft sad voice how she can govern that voice to be sure forgive you yes i answered but trust you no i think never again my lady parmenter you will be sorry some day that you did not was it a regret was it a threat the voice conveyed neither and might have stood for both i looked up again but she had vanished and where she had been the moment before stood mr raymond a penny for your thoughts miss courtenay you shall have my past thoughts if you please said i trying to speak lightly i would rather not sell my present ones at the price he smiled and drew out a new penny then let me make the less valuable purchase even mr raymond was a welcome change from her then tell me mr raymond said i do things ever happen exactly as one wishes them to do once in a thousand times perhaps said he i should imagine though that the occasion usually comes after long waiting and bitter pain generally there is something to remind us that this is not our rest why i said and i heard my soul go into the word why not answered he pithily is the servant so much greater than his lord that he may reasonably look for things to be otherwise cast your minds eye over the life of christ our master and see on how many occasions matters happened in a way which you would suppose entirely to his liking can you name one i thought and could not see anything except when he did a miracle or when he spent a night in prayer to god i give you those nights of prayer said mr raymond but i think you must yield me the miracles unquestionably it must have given him pleasure to relieve pain but see how much pain to himself was often mixed in itlooking up to heaven he sighed ere he did one he wept just before performing another he cried how long shall i be with you and suffer you ere he worked a third no miss courtenay the miracles of our divine master were not all pleasure to himself indeed i should be inclined to venture further and ask if we have no hint that they were wrought at a considerable cost to himself he took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses he knew when virtue had gone out of him that may mean only that his divine knowledge was conscious of it but taking both passages together is it not possible that his wonderful works were wrought at personal expensethat his human body suffered weakness faintness perhaps acute pain as the natural consequence of doing them you will understand that i merely throw out the hint scripture does not speak decisively and where god does not decide it is well for men to be cautious mr raymond i exclaimed how can you be a whig pardon me but what is the connection asked he looking both astonished and diverted dont you see it you are much too good for one mr raymond laughed thank you i fear i did not detect the compliment may i put the counter question and ask how you came to be a tory why i was born so said i and so was i a whig replied he excuse me came laughingly from my other hand in miss newtons voice the waters are not quite so smooth as they were and i thought i had better be at hand to pour a little oil if necessary mr raymond i am afraid you are getting worldly is that not the proper word it is the proper word for an improper thing said mr raymond on what evidence do you rest your accusation miss theresa on the fact that you have twice in one week made your appearance in mrs desboroughs rooms which are the very pink of worldliness have i come without reason you have not given it me said the young lady laughing you cannot always come to tell one of the guests that his or her relations have been taken prisoner i looked up so suddenly that mr raymond answered my eyes before he replied to miss newtons words no miss courtenay i did not come with ill news i suppose a man may have two reasons at different times for the same action where is our handsome friend of the dreadful name asked miss newton mr hebblethwaite he told me he could not be here this evening that man will have to change his name before anybody will marry him said miss newton then if he takes my advice he will continue in single blessedness was mr raymonds answer now why do you not think it would be preferable to marrying a woman whose regard for you was limited by the alphabet mr raymond you and miss courtenay do say such odd things is that because you are religious people oh what a strange feeling came over me when miss newton said that what made her count me a religious person am i one i should not have dared to say it i should like to be so i am afraid to go further to reckon myself one would be to sign my name as a queen and i am not sufficiently sure of my royal blood to do it but what had i ever said to miss newton that she should entertain such an idea mr raymond glanced at me with a brotherly sort of smile which i wished from my heart that i deserved for all he is a whig and was afraid i did not then he said religious people i believe are often very odd things in the eyes of irreligious people do you count yourself among the latter class miss theresa oh i dont make any profession said she i have but one life and i want to enjoy it that is exactly my position said mr raymond smiling now what do you mean demanded she dont the methodists label everything wicked that one wants to do one sometimes means another replied mr raymond with a funny look in his eyes they do not put that label on anything i want to do i cannot answer for other people i am sure they would put it on a thousand things that i should said miss newton am i to understand that speaks badly for themor for you mr raymond you know i make no profession of religion i think it is much better to be free the look in mr raymonds eyes seemed to me very like divine compassion miss theresa your remark makes me ask two questions do you suppose that making no profession will excuse you to the lord does your bible read he that maketh no profession shall be saved and also are you free am i free why of course i am she cried i can do what i like without asking leave of priest or minister god forbid that you should ask leave of priest or minister but i can do what i like also what the lord likes i like no priest on earth shall come between him and me that sounds very grand mr raymond but just listen to me i know a young gentlewoman who says the same thing she is dead against everything which she thinks to be popery submit to the popeno not for a moment but this dear creature has a pet minister who is to her exactly what the pope is to his subjects she wont dance because mr gardiner disapproves of it she cant sing a song of the most innocent sort because mr gardiner thinks songs naughty she wont do this and she cant go there because mr gardiner says this and that now what do you call that human nature miss theresa depend upon it popery would never have the hold it has if there were not in it something very palatable to human nature human nature is of two varieties and satans two grand masterpieces appeal to both to the proud man who is a law unto himself he brings infidelity as the grand temptation ye shall be as godsyea hath god saidand lastly there is no god to the weaker nature which demands authority to lean on he brings popery offering to decide for you all the difficult questions of heart and life with authorityoffering you the romantic fancy of a semigoddess in its worship of the virgin in whose gentle bosom you may repose every trouble and an infallible church which can set everything right for you now just notice how far gods religion is from both it does not say ye shall be as gods but this man receiveth sinners not hath god said but thus saith the lord turn to the other side and instead of your compassionate goddess it offers you jesus the godman able to succour them that are tempted in that he himself hath suffered being tempted infallibility too it offers you but not resident in a man nor in a body of men it resides in a book which is not the word of man but the word of god and effective only when it is interpreted and applied by the living spirit whose guidance may be had by the weakest and poorest child that will ask god for him we are not in church my dear mr raymond said miss newton shrugging her shoulders if you preach over the hour mrs desborough will be sending caesar to show you the clock i have not exceeded it yet i think said mr raymond well i wish you would talk to eliza wilkinson instead of me she says she has beenis converted the word i am ill up in methodist terms and ever since she is converted or was converted she does not commit sin i wish you would talk to her i am not fit to talk to such a seraph i am a sinner oh but i think there is some distinction which i do not properly understand she does not wilfully sin and as to those little things which everybody does that are not quite right you knowwell they dont count for anything she is a child of god she says and therefore he will not be hard upon her for little nothings is that your creed mr raymond do you know the true name of that creed miss theresa dear no i understand nothing about it mr raymonds voice was very solemn so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness antinomianism is the name of it it has existed in the church of god from a date you see earlier than the close of the inspired canon essentially the same thing survives in the popish church under the name of mortal and venial sins and it creeps sooner or later into every denomination in its robes of an angel of light but it belongs to the darkness sin do we know the meaning of that awful word i believe none but god knows rightly what sin is but he who does not know something of what sin is can have very poor ideas of the christ who saves from sin he does not save men in sin but from sin not only from penaltyfrom sin christ is not dead but alive and sin is not a painted plaything but a deadly poison god forgive them who speak lightly of it i do not know what miss newton said to this for at that minute i caught sight of hatty in a corner alone and seized my opportunity at once threading my way with some difficulty among bewigged and belaced gentlemen and ladies with long trains and fluttering fans i reached my sister and sat down by her hatty said i i hardly ever get a word with you how long do you stay with the crosslands i do not know cary she answered looking down and playing with her fan do you know that you look very far from well there are mirrors in charles street she replied with a slight curl of her lip hatty are those people kind to you i said thinking i had better like annas take the bull by the horns i suppose so they mean to be let it alone cary you are not old enough to interferehardly to understand i am only eighteen months younger than you said i i do not wish to interfere hatty but i do want to understand surely your own sister may be concerned if she see you looking ill and unhappy do i look so cary i thought from the tone that hatty was giving way a little you look both i said i wish you would come here do you wish it cary the tone now was very unlike hatty indeed i do hatty said i warmly i dont half believe in those people in charles street and as to amelia and charlotte i doubt if either of them would see anything look how you might oh charlotte is not to blame thoughtlessness is her worst fault said hatty still playing with her fan and somebody is to blame is it amelia i did not say so was the answer no i said feeling disappointed i cannot get you to say anything hatty i do wish you would trust me nobody here loves you except me you did not love me much once cary oh i get vexed when you tease me that is all said i but i want you to look happier hatty dear i should not tease you much now cary i looked up and saw that hattys eyes were full of tears do come here hatty i said earnestly grandmamma has not asked me she replied then i will beg her to ask you i think she will she said the other day that you were very much improved at all events my red cheeks and my ploughboy appetite would scarcely distress her now returned hatty rather bitterly mr crossland is coming for mei must go and while she held my hand i was amazed to hear a low whisper in a voice of unutterable longingcary pray for me that horrid mr crossland came up and carried her off poor dear hatty i am sure something is wrong and somehow i think i love her better since i began to pray for her only that was not last night as she seemed to think this morning at breakfast i asked grandmamma if she would do me a favour yes child if it be reasonable said she what would you have please grandmamma will you ask hatty to come for a little while i should so like to have her and i cannot talk to her comfortably in a room full of people grandmamma took a pinch of snuff as she generally does when she wants to consider a minute she is very much improved said she she really is almost presentable i should not feel ashamed i think of introducing her as my granddaughter well cary if you wish it i do not mind you are a tolerably good girl and i do not object to give you a pleasure but it must be after she has finished her visit to the crosslands i could not entice her away i asked her how long she was going to stay there grandmamma and she said she did not know then my dear you must wait till she do note but what may happen before then i knew it would be of no use to say any more to grandmamma she is a perfect mede and persian when she have once declared her royal pleasure and my aunt dorothea will never interfere my uncle charles is the only one who dare say another word and it was a question if he would he is goodnatured enough but so careless that i could not feel at all certain of enlisting him oh dear i do feel to be growing so old with all my cares it seems as if hatty and annas and flora and angus and colonel keith and the princei beg his pardon he should have come firstwere all on my shoulders at once and i dont feel strong enough to carry such a lot of people i wish my aunt kezia was here i have wished it so many times lately when i had written so far i turned back to look at my aunt kezias rules and then i saw how foolish i am why instead of putting the lord first i had been leaving him out of the whole thing could he not carry all these cares for me did he not know what ailed hatty and how to deliver angus and all about it i knelt down there and then i always write in my own chamber and asked him to send hatty to me and better still to bring her to him and to show me whether i had better speak to my uncle charles or try to get things out of amelia as to charlotte i would not ask her about anything which i did not care to tell the town crier the next morningthere my dates are getting all wrong again it is no use trying to keep them straightas my uncle charles was putting on his gloves to go out he said well cary shall i bring you a fairing of any sort uncle charles i said leaping to a decision at once do bring me hatty i am sure she is not happy do get grandmamma to let her come now not happy cried my uncle charles lifting his eyebrows why what is the matter with the girl cant she get married time enough surely oh dear how can men be so silly but i let it pass for i wanted hatty to come much more than to make my uncle charles sensible in fact i am afraid the last would take too much time and labour there now i should not have said that wont you try uncle charles i do want her so much child i cannot interfere with my mother ask hatty to spend the day then you can have a talk with her uncle please will you ask grandmamma if you like said he with a laugh i heard no more about it till suppertime when my uncle charles said as if it had just occurred to him which i dare say it hadmadam i think this little puss is disappointed that hatty cannot come at once might she not spend the day here it would be a treat for both girls grandmammas snuffbox came out as usual i sat on thorns while she rapped her box opened it took a pinch shut the box with a snap and consigned it to her pocket yes she said at last dorothea you can send caesar with a note oh thank you grandmamma cried i grandmamma looked at me and gave an odd little laugh these fresh girls she said how they do care about things to be sure grandmamma is it pleasanter not to care about things said i it is better my dear to be at all warm or enthusiastic betrays underbreeding butplease grandmammado not wellbred people get very warm over politics sometimes wellbred people forget themselves said grandmamma but it is more allowable to be warm over some matters than others politics are to some degree an exception we do not make exhibitions of our personal affections caroline and above all things we avoid showing warmth on religious questions we do not talk of such things at all in good society nowi say this to my book of course not to grandmammais not that very strange we are not to be warm over the most important things matters of life and death things we really care about in our inmost hearts but over all the little affairs that we do not care about we may lose our tempers a little in an elegant and reasonable way if we choose to do so would it not be better the other way about note the use of the subjunctive with when and until now obsolete was correct english until the present century was some thirty years old chapter eleven cary in a new character god has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear browning i feel more and more certain that something is wrong in charles street the invitation is declined not by hatty herself but in a note from mrs crossland miss hester courtenay has so sad a catarrh that it will not be safe for her to venture out for some days to come note why cary that is a disappointment for you said my uncle charles kindly i think madam as hester cannot come mrs crossland might have offered a counterinvitation to caroline it would have been wellbred said grandmamma mrs crossland is not very well connected she was the daughter or niece of an archdeacon i believe rather raised by her marriage i am sorry you are disappointed child this was a good deal for grandmamma to say and i thanked her well one thing had failed me i must try another at the next evening assembly i watched my chance and caught charlotte in a corner i asked how hatty was hatty said charlotte looking surprised she is well enough for aught i know i thought she had a bad catarrh said i didnt know she had one she is going to my lady milworths assembly with mrs crossland i felt more sure of illplay than ever but to charlotte i said no more the next person whom i pinned to the wall was amelia with her i felt more need of caution in one sense for i did not know how far she might be in the plot whatever it was that no living mortal with any shadow of brains would have trusted charlotte with a secret i felt as sure as i did that my ribbons were white and not red emily i said why did not hatty come with you tonight i did not ask was amelias languid answer i do think she gets more and more limp and unstarched as time goes on is she better what is the matter with her amelias eyes betrayed no artifice a catarrh i understand oh you heard that from miss newton the newtons asked her for an assembly and mrs crossland did not want to give up my lady milworth so she sent word hatty had a catarrh i believe it is all nonsense and it is not telling falsehoods said i my dear i have nothing to do with it said amelia fanning herself mrs crossland may carry her own shortcomings i felt pretty sure now that amelia was not in the plot will you give a message to hatty i said if it be not too long to remember tell her i wanted her to spend the day and my aunt dorothea writ to ask her to come and mrs crossland returned answer that she had too bad a catarrh and must keep indoors for some days did sheto mrs desborough said amelia with a surprised look i rather wonder at that too emily help me i said these crosslands want to keep hatty and me apart there is something wrong going on do help us if you ever cared for either of us amelia looked quite astonished and nuzzled really i knew nothing about it of course i care for you cary but what can i do give that message to hatty bid her from me break through the snares and come then we can see what must be done next i will give her the message said amelia with what was energy for her cary i have had nothing to do with it if something be wrong i never even guessed it i dont believe you have said i but tell me one thing emily are they scheming to make hatty marry mr crossland most certainly not cried amelia with more warmth than i had thought was in her impossible why mr crossland is engaged to marianne newton is miss marianne newton a friend of yours yes the dearest friend i have then you will be on my side keep your eyes and ears open and find out what it is i tell you something is wrong put yourself in the breach help miss marianne if you like but for pitys sake save hatty but what makes you suppose that what is wrong has anything to do with mr crossland i do not know why i fancy it but i do i cannot let the idea go i do not like the look of him he does not look like a true man cary you have grown up since you came to london i feel like somebodys grandmother said i but i think i have been growing to it amelia since i left brocklebank well you certainly are much less of a child than you were i will do my best cary and amelia looked as if she meant it but take no one into your confidence said ileast of all charlotte thank you i dont need that warning said amelia with her languid laugh as she furled her fan and turned away and as i passed on the other side i came upon ephraim hebblethwaite all at once my resolution was taken come this way ephraim said i i want to show you my uncle charless new engravings i lifted down the large portfolio with ephraims helpi dont think ephraim would let a cat jump down by itself if he thought the jump too farset it on a little table and under cover of the engravings i told him the whole story and all my uneasiness about hatty he listened very attentively but without showing either the surprise or the perplexity which amelia had done if you suspect rightly said he when i had finished my tale the first thing to be done is to get her out of charles street do you think me too ready to suspect i replied no was his answer i am afraid you are right but what do they want to do with her or to her cried i under my breath cary said ephraim gravely i am very glad you have told me this i will go so far as to tell you in return that i too have my suspicions of young crossland though they are of rather a different kind from yours you suspect him so far as i understand you of matrimonial designs on hatty real or feigned i am afraid rather that these appearances are a blind to hide something deeper and worse i know something of this man not enough to let me speak with certainty but just sufficient to make me doubt him and to guide me in what direction to look we must walk carefully on this path for if i mistake not the ground is strewn with snares what do you mean i cried feeling terrified i would rather not tell you till i know more i will try to do that as soon as possible i never thought of anything worse said i than that knowing as he is likely to do that hatty will some day have a few hundreds a year of her own he is trying to inveigle her to marry him and is not a man likely to be kind to her and make her happy he is certainly likely to make her very unhappy replied ephraim but i do not believe that he has any intentions of marriage towards hatty or anybody else but dont you think he may make her think so amelia told me he was engaged in marriage with a gentlewoman she knows i am sorry for the gentlewoman make her think so yes and under cover of that work out his plot i would advise miss bracewell to beware that she is not made a catspaw i told ephraim what i had said to amelia then she is put on her guard so far well ephraim have you heard anything more of angus nothing but what you know already nor i suppose of colonel keith i wish i knew what he is doing he has not had much chance of doing anything yet said ephraim rather drily a sickbed is not the most favourable place for helping ones friends out of prison has colonel keith been ill cried i mr raymond did not tell you he never told me a word i do not know what he may have said to annas a broken arm and a fever on the top of it said ephraim the doctor talks of letting him go out tomorrow if the weather suit o ephraim cried i but where is he dont tell any one if i tell you remember colonel keith is a proscribed man i will do no harm to annass brother trust me said i he is at raymonds house where he and i have been nursing him in a fever oh it is not a catching fever think you either of us would have come here if it were ephraim is mr raymond to be trusted said i i am sure he is a good man but he is a shocking whig and i do believe one of the queerest things in this queer world is the odd notions that men take of what it is their duty to do have you found that out said he looking much diverted i am always finding things out i answered i had no idea there was so much to be found but dont you see mr raymond might fancy it his duty to betray colonel keith is there no danger not the slightest said ephraim warmly mr raymond would be much more likely to give up his own life dont you know cary that scripture forbids us to betray a fugitive and all the noblest instincts of human nature forbid it too i know all ones feelings are against it said i but i did not know that there was anything about it in the bible look in the twentythird of deuteronomy replied ephraim the fifteenth verse the passage itself refers to a slave but it must be equally applicable to a political fugitive i will look i answered but tell me ephraim can nothing be done for angus if it can it will be done he made answer he said no more but from his manner i could not but fancy that somebody was trying to do something i never had two letters at once by the same post in my life but this morning two cameone from flora and one from my aunt kezia floras is not long it says that she and annas have reached the isle of wight in safety and were but three hours acrossing from portsmouth and she begs me if i can obtain it to send her some news of angus my lady de lannoy was extreme kind to them both and flora says she is very comfortable and would be quite happy but for her anxiety about my uncle drummond and angus my uncle drummond has not writ once and she is very fearful lest some ill have befallen him my aunt kezias letter is long and full of good counsel which i am glad to have for i do find the world a worse place than i thought it and yet not in the way i expected she warns me to have a care lest my tongue get me into trouble and that is one of the dangers i find and did not look for father is well and all other friends and i am not to be surprised if i should hear of sophys marriage fanny gets on very well and makes a better housekeeper than my aunt kezia expected but i have spent much thought over the last passage of her letter and i do not like it at all is hatty yet in charles street we have had but one letter from the child in all this time and that was short and told nothing i hope you see her often and can give us some tidings squire bracewell writ to your father a fortnight gone that he was weary of dwelling alone and as the princes army is in retreat he thinks it now safe to have the girls home if this be so we shall soon have hatty here i have writ to her by your fathers wish that she is not to tarry behind i cried aloud when i came to this the prince in retreat from derby uncle charles do you know anything of it sure it can never be true nonsense he made answer some silly rumour no doubt but my uncle bracewell writ it to my aunt kezia and he dwells within fifteen miles i said my uncle charles looked much disturbed i must go forth and see about this answered he with your catarrh mr desborough cried my aunt dorothea for above a week my uncle charles has not ventured from the door having a bad catarrh my catarrh must take care of itself he made answer this is serious news dobson have you heard aught about the prince being in retreat dobson who was setting down the chocolatepot looked up and smiled yes sir we heard that yesterday you idiot why did you not tell me cried my uncle charles in retreat i cannot believe it run to the coffeehouse dobson said grandmamma and ask what news they have this morning so dobson went off and has not yet returned my aunt dorothea laughs all to scorn but my uncle charles is uneasy and i am sure grandmamma believes the report it is dreadful if it is true are we to sit down under another thirty years of foreign oppression before dobson could get back mrs newton came in her chair she is a very stout old lady and she puffed and panted as she came up the stairs leaning on her black footman with her little dutch pug after which is as fat as its mistress and it panted and puffed too her two daughters came in behind her oh my dearmrs desborough mydear creature this isthe horridest news we mustgo back to ourred ribbons andblack cockades could i ever havethought it arent youperfectly miserable dear dear me ma is miserable because red does not suit her said miss marianne i can wear it quite well so i dont need to be marianne said her sister laughing well you know theresa you dont care two pins whether the prince wins or loses who does the prince and my lord tullibardine said miss newton oh of course those who looked to the prince to make their fortunes are disappointed enough i dont i rather thought mr crossland did said miss newton with a mischievous air well i hope there are other people in the world beside mr crossland said miss marianne all right my dear replied her sister if you dont care i am sure i need not i am not in love with mr crosslandnot by any means i never did admire the way in which his nose droops over his mouth he has fine teeththat is a redeeming point is it i dont want him to bite me observed miss marianne miss newton went off into a little subdued burst of silvery laughter and i sat astonished was this the sort of thing which girls called loveand was this the way in which fashionable women spoke of the men whom they had pledged themselves to marry i am sure i like mr crossland little enough but i felt almost sorry for him as i listened to the girl who professed to love him meanwhile grandmamma and mrs newton were lamenting over the newsas i supposed but when i began to listen i found all that was over and done with first the merits of puck the fat pug were being discussed and then the wretchedness of being unable to buy or wear french cambrics and the whole history of mrs newtons last cambric gown they washed it and mended it and ripped it and made it up again and then grandmammas brocaded silk came on and how much worse it wore than the last and when i was just wondering how many more gowns would have to be taken to pieces mrs newton rose to go really mrs desborough i ought to make my apologies for coming so early but this sad news you knowthe poor prince i could not bear another minute i knew you would feel it so much i felt as if i must come now my dear girls ma you havent asked mrs desborough what you came for said miss marianne what ioh and mrs newton turned back this absurd child would you believe it she gave me no peace till i had asked if you would be so good as to allow your cook to give mine her receipt for paradise pudding marianne dotes on your paradise puddings do you mind i should be so infinitely obliged to you dear no said grandmamma taking a pinch of snuff just as dobson tapped at the door dobson run down and tell cook to send somebody over to mrs newtons with her receipt for paradise pudding be sure it is not forgotten yes madam said dobson if you please madam the army is agoing back all the coffeehouses have the news this morning dear it must be true then said grandmamma taking another pinch what a pitybe sure you do not forget the paradise pudding yes madam they say madam the prince was nigh heartbroke that he couldnt come on ah i dare say poor young gentleman said mrs newton dear mrs desborough do excuse me but where did you meet with that lovely crewel fringe on your curtains it is so exactly what i wanted and could not get anywhere i got it at cooper and smithsonsholborn bars you know said grandmamma this is sad news indeed but your curtains my dear have an extreme pretty trimming oh tolerable said mrs newton gathering up her hoop away they went with another lament over the prince and the news and i sat wondering whether everybody in this world were as hollow as a tobaccopipe i do think in london they must be then my thoughts went back to my aunt kezias letter grandmamma i said after a few minutes reflection may i have a chair this afternoon i want to go and see hatty grandmamma nodded she had come i think to an awkward place in her tatting take caesar with you was all she said so after dinner i sent caesar for the chair and dressed in my best went over to charles street to see hatty i sent in my name and waited an infinite time in a cold room before any one appeared at last charlotte bounced ini cannot use another word for it was just what she didsaying o cary you here emily is coming as soon as she can settle her ribbons isnt it fun they are all coming out in red now i dont think it is fun at all said i it is very sad oh potherwhat do you and i care cried she you do not care much it seems said i but charlotte was off again before i had finished a minute later the door opened much more gently and amelia entered in her calm languid way but as soon as she saw me her eyes lighted up and she closed the door and sat down amelia spoke in a hurried whisper as she kissed me one word before any one comes she said insist on seeing hatty dont go without it will they try to prevent me i replied before she could answer mrs crossland sailed in all over rosecoloured ribbons why miss caroline what an unexpected pleasure said she and if she had added an unwelcome one i fancy she would have spoken the truth dear what was cicely thinking of to put you in this cold room pray come upstairs to the fire thank you said i and rose to follow her the room upstairs was warm and comfortable but hatty was not there a girl of about fourteen in a loose blue sacque which looked very cold for the weather came forward and shook hands with me my daughter said mrs crossland annabella my dear run up and ask miss hester if she feels well enough to come down tell her that her sister is here allow me to go up with miss annabella and perhaps save her a journey said i messages are apt to be returned and to make further errands oh butpray do not give yourself that trouble said miss annabella glancing at her mother certainly not i cannot think of it answered mrs crossland hastily poor miss hester has been suffering so much from toothachei beg you will not disturb her miss caroline i suppose i was rude but how could i help it why should i disturb her more than miss crossland i replied sisters do not make strangers of each other oh she does not expect you and indeed miss carolinedo let me beg of youdr summerfield did just hint yesterdayjust a hint you understandabout smallpox i could not on any account let you go up for your own sake is my sister so ill as that i replied i think we might have expected to be told it sooner then madam i shall certainly go up miss crossland will you show me the way i do not know whether mrs crossland thought me bold and unladylike but if she had known how every bit of me was trembling she might perhaps have changed that view o miss caroline how can you i could not allow annabella to do such a thing think of the clangerannabella come back you shall not go into an infected air pardon me madam but i thought you proposed yourself to send miss annabella then i will not trouble any one i can find the way myself and resolutely closing the door behind me upstairs i walked i did not believe a word about hatty having the smallpox but if i had done i should have done the same i heard behind me exclamations ofthat bold brazen thing she will find out all annabella call godfrey call him that hussy must not i was upstairs by this time i rapped at the first door and had no answer the second was the same from the third i heard the sound of weeping and a mans voice which i thought i recognised as that of mr crossland i shall not allow of any more hesitation he was saying you must make your choice today you have given me trouble enough and have made far too many excuses i shall wait no longer oh once moreonly once more was the answer interrupted by heartrending sobsin whose voice i rather guessed than heard neither would i wait any longer i never thought about ceremony and gentility any more than about the possible dangers known and unknown which i might be running i opened the door and walked straight in mr crossland stood on the hearth clad in a queer long black gown and a black cap upon his head on a chair near him sat a girl her head bowed down in her hands upon the table weeping bitterly her long dark hair was partly unfastened and falling over her shoulder what i could see of her face was white as death was this white cowed creature our once pert bright hatty what do you want said mr crossland angrily as he caught sight of me oh i beg pardon miss caroline your poor sister is suffering so much today i have been trying to divert her a little but her pain is so great how very good of you to come was no one here to show you anywhere that you had to come by yourself the bowed head had been lifted up and the face that met my eyes was one of the extremest misery she held out her arms to me with a low sad wailing cry o cary cary save me cannot you save me i walked past that blackrobed wretch and took poor hatty in my arms drawing her head to lie on my bosom yes my dear you shall be saved i saidi hope god said through me mr crossland will you have the goodness to leave my sister to me if looks had power to kill i think i should never have spoken again in this world mr crossland turned on his heel and walked out of the room without another word the moment he was gone i made a rush at the door drew out the key which was on the outside locked it and put the key on the table then i went back to hatty my poor darling what have they done to you somehow i felt as if i were older than she that day but she could not tell me at first o cary cary seemed to be all that she could say i rang the bell and when somebody tried the door i asked the unknown helper to send miss amelia bracewell i beg your pardon madam i dare not answered a girls voice nobody is allowed to enter this chamber but my mistress and faand my master it seemed as if an angel must be helping me and whispering what to do perhaps it was so will you be so good as to take a message to the black servant who came with me i said certainly madam then please to tell him that i wish to speak with him at the door of this room madam forgive me but i dare not bring any one here i tore a blank leaf out of a book on the table i had a pencil in my pocket give him this then and let no one take it from you you shall have a guinea to do it gemini i heard the girl whisper to herself in amazement i wrote hastilybeg my uncle charles to come this moment and bring dobson tell him if he ever loved either me or miss hester he will do this it is a matter of life and death promise me i said unlocking the door to give it to her that this piece of paper shall be in my black servants hands directly and that no one else shall see it i spoke to a young girl apparently one of the lower servants of the house her round eyes opened wide please do it betty sobbed poor hatty do it for pitys sake ill do it for yours miss hester said the girl and her kindly honestlooking face reassured me she hid the paper in her bosom and ran down i locked the door again and went back to hatty o cary dear god sent you she sobbed i thought i must give in what are they trying to make you do hatty to my amazement she repliedto be a nun to be what i shrieked are these people papists then not to acknowledge it i had not an idea when we camenor the bracewells i am sure and did they want all three of you to be nuns noonly me i believe i heard father godfrey saying to the mother that neither charlotte nor amelia would answer the purpose but what the purpose was i dont know who are you talking about who is father godfreymr crossland yes he is a jesuit priest you mean his mother then by the mother oh she is not his mother i dont think they are related what is she the abbess of a convent of english nuns at bruges and is that poor little girl miss annabella one of the conspirators she is the decoy i think her wits have been terrified out of her she only does as she is told hatty i said you do not believe the doctrines of popery i dont know what i believe or dont believe she sobbed if you can get me out of here and back home i shall think there is a god again i was beginning to doubt that and everything else a voice came up the stairs raised rather loudly you must pardon me madam but i am quite sure both my nieces are here said my uncle charless welcome tones i rushed to the door again this way uncle charles i cried hatty where is your bonnet i dont know they took all my outdoor things away tie my scarf over your head and get into the chair as my uncle charles is here i can walk very well he had come up now and stood looking at hattys white miserable face if he had seen it a few minutes earlier he would have thought the misery far greater well this is a pretty todo cried my uncle hatty child these wretches have used you ill why on earth did you stay with them at first i did not want to get away uncle she said and afterwards i could not we went downstairs mrs crossland was standing in the door of the drawingroom with thin shutup lips and a red angry spot on either cheek inside the room i caught a glimpse of annabella looking woefully white and frightened mr crossland i could nowhere see madam said my uncle charles sarcastically i will thank you to give up those other young ladies my nieces cousins if they wish to remain in london they can do so but it will not be in charles street did you not tell me cary that their father wished them to come home my aunt kezia said that he intended to write to them to say so i answered feeling as though it were about a year since i had received my aunt kezias letter really sir mrs crossland began the father of these gentlewomen consigned them to my care and i take them out of your care returned my uncle charles i will take the responsibility to mr bracewell ill take all the responsiwhatsitsname said charlotte suddenly appearing among us thank you mr desborough id rather not stop here when hatty is gone emily she shouted amelia came downstairs with her bonnet on and charlottes in her hand you cant go without a bonnet my dear child oh pother cried charlotte seizing her bonnet by the strings and sticking it on the top of her head anyhow it liked one word before we leave mr desborough if you please said amelia with more dignity than i had thought she possessed i have strong reason to believe these persons to be popish recusants and the last to whom my father would have confided us had he known their real character they have not used any of us so kindly that i need spare them out of any tenderness i thank you miss bracewell said my uncle charles who also i thought was showing qualities that i had not known to be in him how scenes like these do bring ones faculties out i rather thought there was some sort of jesuitry at work madam he turned to mrs crossland i am sure there is no necessity for me to recall the penal laws to your mind so long as these young ladies are left undisturbed in my care in any wayso long madamthey will not be put in force against you you understand me i feel sure now girls let us go so we three girls walking and hatty in the chair with dobson and caesar as a guard behind we reached bloomsbury square charles what is it all about said grandmamma taking a bigger pinch than usual and spilling some of it on her lace stomacher a spiders web madam from which i have been freeing four flies but one was a bluebottle and broke some of the threads said my uncle charles laughing and patting my shoulder really said grandmamma i am pleased to see you young ladies hester my dear are you sure you are quite well i shall be better now hatty tried to say in a trembling voiceand fainted away there was a great commotion then four or five talking at once making impossible recommendations and getting in each others way but at the end of it all we got poor hatty into bed in my chamber and even grandmamma said that rest was the best thing for her my aunt dorothea mixed a cordial draught which she gave her to take and as hattys head sank on the pillow she said to my surprise oh the rest of being free again cary i never expected you to be the heroine of the family i think you are the heroine hatty most people would have thought i should be but i have proved weak as wateryet not till after long suffering and hard pressure you will never see the old hatty again cary oh yes dear said i wait a few days till you have had a good rest and we have fed you up you will feel quite different a week hence my body will i dare say but methat inside feeling and thinking machinethat will never be the same again i want to tell you everything and i want to hear it i replied but dont talk now hatty go to sleep like a good girl you will be much better for a long rest i drew the curtains and asked amelia to stay until hatty was asleep i knew she would not talk much and hatty would not care to tell her things as she would me going downstairs my uncle charles greeted me laughing with here she comes the good queen bess cary you deserve a gold medal grandmamma bade me come to her and tell her all i knew she exclaimed several times and took ever so many pinches of snuff till she had to call on my aunt dorothea to refill the box at the end of it she called me a good child and the jesuits traitors and scoundrels to which my uncle charles added some rather stronger language charlotte seems to have known nothing of what was going on or i should rather say to have noticed nothing she is such a careless girl in every way that i am scarce surprised amelia did notice things but she had a mistaken notion of what they meant she fancied that hatty was in love with mr crossland and that she not knowing of his engagement in marriage with miss marianne newton was very jealous of what she thought his doubledealing until after i spoke to her she had no notion that there might be any sort of popish treachery something which happened soon after that helped to turn her mind in that direction but hatty says she knew next to nothing but says my uncle charles how could a jesuit priest marry anybody it seems to be all in a muddle that i cannot answer hatty is better today after a quiet nights rest she still looks woefully ill and grandmamma will not let her speak yet now that grandmamma is roused about it she is very kind to hatty and me also i do hope now that things have done happening the poor prince is a fugitive somewhere in scotland and everybody says the rebellion is quashed they did not call it a rebellion until he turned back from derby my uncle bracewell has writ to my uncle charles again with news and has asked him to see amelia and charlotte sent off homeward hatty will tarry here till we can return together at last our poor hatty has told her story and a sad sad story it is it seems that mr crossland was pretending to make court to her at first and she believed in him and loved him at that time she says she would not have brooked a word against him and as to believing him to be the wretch he has turned out she would as soon have thought the sun created darkness there was no show of popery at all in the family they went to church like other people and talked just like others from a word dropped by miss theresa newton hatty began to think that mr crosslands heart was not so undividedly her own as she had hoped and she presently discovered that he was not to be trusted on that point they had a quarrel and he professed penitence and promised to give up miss marianne and for a while hatty thought all was right again then little by little mrs crossland whose right name seems to be mother mary benedicta of the annunciationwhat queer names they do use to be surewell mrs crossland began to tell hatty all kinds of strange stories about the saints and miracles and so forth which she said she had heard from the irish peasantry at first she told them as things to laugh at then she began to wonder if there might be some truth in one or two of them there were strange things in this world and so she went on from little to little always drawing back and keeping silence for a while if she found that she was going too fast for hatty to follow i can see it all now looking back said hatty it was all one great whole but at the time i did not see it at all they seemed mere passing remarks bits of conversation that came in anyhow hatty felt sure that mrs crossland was a concealed papist long before she suspected the young man and when at last both threw the mask off they had her fast in their toils she was strictly warned never to talk with me except on mere trifling subjects and she had to give an account of every word that had been said when she returned if she hid the least thing from them she was assured it would be a terrible sin but you dont mean to say you believed all that rubbish cried i it was not a question of belief she answered i loved him i would have done anything in all the world to win a smile from him and he knew it as to beliefi do not know what i believed my brain felt like a chaos and my heart in a whirl and now hatty said i i meant to ask what she believed now but she answered me differently now she said in a low hopeless voice the shrine is deserted and the idol is broken and the world feels a great wide empty place where there is no room for mea cold hard place that i must toil through and the only hope left is to get to the end as soon as possible oh i wish flora or annas were here i do not know how to deal with my poor hatty thoughts which would comfort me seem to fall powerless with her and i have nobody to counsel me i suppose my aunt kezia would say i must set the lord before me but i do not see how to do it in this case i am sure i have prayed enough what i want is an angel to whisper to me what to do again and my angel has gone back into heaven i suppose for i feel completely puzzled now at any rate i do hope things have done happening note our forefathers thought colds a much more serious affair than we do they probably knew much less about them chapter twelve bought with a price host trust me i think tis almost day julia not so but it hath been the longest night that eer i watched and the most heaviest shakespeare i am writing four days later than my last sentence and i wonder whether things have finished beginning to happen grandmammas tuesday was the day after i writ the newtons were thereat least mrs newton and miss theresaand ever so many people whom i knew and cared nothing about my lady parmenter came early but did not stay long and very late long after every one else ephraim hebblethwaite mr raymond i did not see and have not done so for several times i was not much inclined to talk and i got into a corner with some pictures which i had seen twenty times and turned them over just as an excuse for keeping quiet all at once i heard ephraims voice at my side cary i want to speak to you go on looking at those pictures other ears are best away how is hatty she is better i said but she is not the old hatty i dont think the old hatty will come back he said perhaps the new one may be better are the miss bracewells gone home they start tomorrow said i cary i am going to ask you something dont show any surprise are you a brave girl i hardly know said i resisting the temptation to look up and see what he meant why because a woman is wanted for a piece of work and we think you would answer what piece of workand who are we i asked turning over some views of rome with very little notion what they were we are colonel keith raymond and myself and what piece of work i asked again to attempt the rescue of angus howwhat am i to do did you ever try to personate anybody well we used to act little pieces sometimes at carlisle i and the grandison girls and lucretia carnwath there has never been anything of the sort here did they think you did it well lucretia carnwath and diana grandison were thought the best performers but once they said i made a capital housemaid were you ever a laundress no but i dare say i could have managed it are you willing to try i am ready to do anything if it will help angus i dont see at present how my playing the laundress is to do that you will not play it on a mock stage in a drawingroom but in reality neither you nor i are to do the hardest part of the work colonel keith takes that what have i to do to carry a basket of clothes into the prison and bring it out again i hope angus will not be in the basket said i trying to smother my laughter i could not carry him oh no replied ephraim laughing too now listen i am all attention said i next tuesday evening about nine oclock slip out of this room and throw a large cloak over your dressone that will quite hide you you will find me at the foot of the backstairs we shall go out of the backdoor and get to raymonds house a lady whom you will find there will help you to put on the dress which is prepared then you and i who are brother and sister if you please will carry the basket to the prison just before reaching it i shall pretend to hear something and run off to see what is the matter you will be left alone in appearance and will call after me in vain and abuse me roundly when i do not return declaring that you cannot possibly carry that heavy basket in alone then but not before you will descry a certain william standing close bywho will be colonel keithand showing surprise at seeing him there will ask him to help you with the basket he and you will carry the basket into the prison and you will stand waiting a little while during which time he will with the connivance of a warder in our pay visit anguss cell presently william will return to you but it will be angus and not keith you are to scold him for having kept you such an unconscionable time and declaring that you will have no more to do with him to take up the empty basket and walk off our warder will then declare that he cannot do with all this rowyou must make as much noise as you canand push you both out of the prison door angus will follow you expressing penitence and begging to be allowed to carry the basket but you are not to let him a few yards from the prison i shall come running out of a sidestreet seize the basket give angus a thump or two with it and bid him be off for i am not going to have such goodfornoughts loitering about and making up to my sister he will pretend to be cowed and run away and you will then abuse me in no measured terms for having left you without protector in the first place and for having behaved so badly to your dear will in the second when we are out of sight we may gradually drop our pretended quarrel and when we reach mr raymonds house you will return to caroline courtenay and i shall be ephraim hebblethwaite there is the programme can you carry out your part and are you willing my heart stood still a moment and then came up and throbbed violently in my throat could i yes i think i could but i want to know something first how far i am willing will depend on circumstances what is going to become of colonel keith in this business he takes anguss placedont you see yes but when angus has got away how is he to escape god knoweth it is not likely that he can and do you mean to say that colonel keith is to be sacrificed to save angus the sacrifice is his own the proposal comes from himself and you mean to let him not if i could do it myself was the quiet answer i dont want you to do it is there nobody else no one except keith raymond and myself raymond is too tall and i am not tall enough keith and angus are just of a height and if colonel keith cannot escape what will become of him silence answered mea silence which said far more than words ephraim colonel keith is worth fifty of angus i have not spent these weeks at his bedside cary without finding that out and is the worse to be bought with the better it was done once upon the hill of calvary and this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you i was silent i did not like the idea at all you must talk to keith about it before we leave the house said ephraim but i am afraid it will be of no use we have all tried in vain i said no more well carywill you undertake it ephraim i said looking up at last i cannot bear to think of sacrificing colonel keith i could do it i think for anything but that it would be hard work no doubt at the best but i would go through with it to save angus but cannot it be done in some other way ephraim shook his head we can see no other way at all there are only three men who could do itcolonel keith mr raymond and myself and keith is far the best for personal reasons beside the matter of height he has or at any rate could easily put on a slight scots accent which we should find difficult and might very likely do it wrong he is acquainted with all the places and people that angus is we are not and remember it is not only the getting angus out of the place that is of consequence whoever takes his place must personate angus for some hours till he can get safely away note only keith can do this with any chance of success as to sacrifice why soldiers sacrifice themselves every day and he is a soldier i can assure you it seems to him a natural commonplace affair he is very anxious to do it he must be fonder of angus i stopped than we are answered ephraim with a smile perhaps he is but i think he has other reasons cary what made you think of me well we must have a girl in the affair and we were very much puzzled whom to ask if miss keith had been here we should certainly have asked her annas oh how could she i cried she has pluck enough said ephraim of course miss drummond would have been the most natural person to play the part but keith would not hear of that and raymond doubted if she were a suitable person with her the scots accent would be in the way and rouse suspicion and i am not sure whether she could manage such a thing in other respects then we thought of hatty and you but hatty i suppose is out of the question at present oh yes quite said i she would have been the very one if she had been well and strong she has plenty of go and dash in her but raymond and keith both wanted you and you did not said i feeling rather mortified that ephraim should seem to think more of hatty than of me no i did not cary he said in a changed voice you think i am paying you a poor compliment perhaps some day you will know better does anyone in this house know of the rescue plot mr desborough knows that an attempt may be made but not that you are in it lucette is engaged to keep the coast clear while we get away and now cary what say you yes ephraim i will do it though i almost wish it were anything else may god help colonel keith amen with all my heart we had no opportunity to say more so now i wait for next tuesday not knowing what it may bring forth it was about a quarter of an hour before the fated moment when miss theresa newton sat down by me very serious tonight miss caroline said she jestingly i thought i had good cause considering what was about to happen but i turned it off as best i could where is our handsome friend this evening said she have we only one replied i miss newton laughed that musical laugh of hers i should hope we are rather happier i meant mr hebblethwaite horrible name i saw him a little while ago said i wondering if he were then at the foot of the backstairs what has become of the crosslands have you any idea i have not seen them here now forever so long nor have i i do not know at all said i devoutly hoping that i never should see them again my sister is perfectly in despair her intended never comes to see her now i tell her she had better find somebody else it is too tiresome to keep on and off with a man in that way oh you dont know anything about it your time has not come yet when it do said i i will either be on or off if you please i should not like to be on and off by any means miss newton hid her laughing face behind her fan my dear child you are so refreshing dont change i beg of you it is charming to meet any one like you i thank you for your good opinion i replied and my aunt dorothea just then coming up i resigned my seat to her and dropped the conversation for a minute or two i wandered aboutasked hatty if she were tired this was her first evening in the drawingroom with company and when she said not yet i inquired after pucks health from mrs newton told miss emma page that grandmamma had been admiring her sisters dress and slipped out of the door when i arrived at it in my room lucette was standing with the cloak ready to throw over me monsieur ebate is at the escalier derobe said she poor lucette could get no nearer hebblethwaite he tell me this night mademoiselle goes on an errand for the good lord may the lord keep safe his messenger mr hebblethwaite goes with me said i he will take all the care of me he can i will trust him for that said lucette with a little nod he is good man celuila but mademoiselle except the lord keep the city you know the watchman waketh but in vain yes lucette i know in every sense but how do you know that mr hebblethwaite is a good man ah i know i and i know what makes him stay in london all same now mademoiselle is ready and caesar is at the door labas downstairs i ran joined ephraim who also wore a large cloak over his evening dress and we went out of the backdoor which was guarded by caesar whose white teeth and gleaming eyes were all i could see of him in the dusk lucette asked leave to take caesar into the affair said ephraim she promised to answer for him as for herself now cary we must step out there is no time to lose as fast as you please said i in a few minutes we came to mr raymonds house i never knew before where he lived it is in a small house in endell street an elderly woman opened the door who evidently expected us and ushered us at once into a livingroom on the right hand here i saw mr raymond and a ladya lady past her youth who had as i could not help seeing been extreme beautiful i thought there was no one else till i heard a voice beside me i fear i am almost a stranger miss cary mr keith i did not feel him a stranger but a very old friend indeed but how ill he looked i told him so and he said he was wonderfully betterquite well againwith that old sweet smile that he always had my heart came up into my throat mr keith must you go into this danger if i fail to go where my master calls me how can i look for his presence and blessing to go with me they who go with god are they with whom god goes are you quite sure he has called you quite sure his fine eyes lighted up have you thought forgive my interruption i have thought of everything miss cary you heard the vow which i took to god and flora drummondnever to lose sight of angus and to keep him true and safe i have kept it so far as it lay in me and i will keep it to the end come what may i will be true to god and her and looking up into his eyes i sawrevealed to me as by a flash of lightningwhat was duncan keiths most precious thing now miss caroline said mr raymond will you kindly go up with this ladyi fancied i heard the shortest possible sign of hesitation before the last two wordsand she will be so good as to help you to assume the dress you are to wear i went upstairs with the beautiful woman who gave a little laugh as she shut the door poor mr raymond said she i feel so sorry for the man nature meant him to be a tory and education has turned him into a whig he has the kindest of hearts and the most unmanageable of consciences he will help us to free a prisoner but he would not call me anything but mistress to save his life and your ladyship said i guessing in an instant what she ought to be called and that she was the wife of a peernot a hanoverian peer oh my ladyship can put up with it very well said she laughing as she helped me off with my evening dress i wish i may never have anything worse the man would not pain me for the world it is only his awful puritan conscience methodist perhaps puritan was the word in my day when one lives in exile one almost loses ones native tongue and i thought i heard a light sigh her ladyship however said no more except what had reference to our business when the process was over i found myself in a printed linen gown with a linen hood on my head a long white apron made quite plain and stout clumsy shoes now be as vulgar as you possibly can said her ladyship try to forget all your proprieties and do everything th wrong way you are betty walkden if you please and mr hebblethwaite is joel walkden and your brother you are a washerwoman and your mistress mrs richardson lives in chelsea dont forget your history oh i am forgetting one thing myself colonel keith and therefore lieutenant drummond as they are the same person for this evening is will clowes a young gardener at wandsworth who is your lover of whom your brother joel does not particularly approve now then keep up your character and rememberher ladyship was very grave nowto call any of them by his real name may be death to all of you i turned round and faced her madam what will become of colonel keith i thought her ladyship looked rather keenly at me the sword devoureth one as well as another was her reply you know whence that comes miss courtenay is that all i answered if any act of mine lead to his death how shall i answer it to his father and mother and to annas they gave him up to the cause my dear when they sent him forth to join the prince a soldier must always do his duty forgive me madam i was not questioning his duty but my own too late for that miss courtenay my dear he is ready for death i would more of us were i read in the superb eyes above me that she was not forward she said as if giving a word of command somehow i felt as if i must go her ladyship was right it was too late to draw back so ephraim and i set forth on our dangerous errand i cannot undertake to say how we went or where it all comes back to me as if i had walked it in a dream and i felt as if i were dreaming all the while at last as we went along carrying the basket ephraim suddenly set it down with hallo whats that i knew then that we must be close to the prison and that he was about to leave me i say i must see after that you go on bet cried ephraim and he was off in a minutein what direction i could not even see gemini cried i catching up the word i had heard from mrs croplands betty joel i say joel you bad fellow cant you come back how am i to lift this great thing i should like to know a dark shadow close to the wall moved a little come now cant one of you lads help a poor maid said i its a shame of joel to leave me in the lurch like this come give us a hand i was trembling like an aspen leaf suppose the wrong man offered to help me what could i do then want a hand my pretty maid said a voice which certainly was not colonel keiths im your man give us hold oh what was i to do this horrid man would carry the basket and how could i explain to the warder how could i know which warder was the right one now then hold hard mate said a second voice which i greeted with delight just you let this here young woman be how do betty why wherevers joel hes no call to let the likes o you carry things o thisns what had the colonel done with his scots accent i did not hear a trace of it oh will clowes is that you said i giving a little toss of my head which i thought would be in character well i dont know whether i shall let you carry it the next minute i felt how wrong i was to say so yes you will said colonel keith and took the basket out of my hands i should never have known him dressed in corduroy and with a rake over his shoulder he shouted something and the great prison door opened slowly and a warder put his head out who goes there washing for cartwrights ward ay all right come within cartwright shouted the porter we went in and stood waiting a moment just inside the door till a warder appeared who desired colonel keith to bring that ere basket up now you can wait a bit betty said the colonel turning to me dont be afraid my girl nobody ll touch you and will ll soon be back they say it is unlucky to watch people out of sight i hope it is not true true or untrue i watched him yes will clowes might be back soon but would duncan keith ever return any more and then a feeling came as if a tide of fear swept over mewas it right of flora to ask him to make that promise i have wondered vaguely many a time but in that minute with all my senses sharpened i seemed to see what a blunder it was is it ever right to ask people for such unconditional pledges to a distinct course of action when we cannot know what is going to happen to what agonynay even to what wrongdoingmay we pledge them without knowing it it seems to me that influence is a very awful thing for it reaches so much farther than you can see may it not be said sometimes of us all they know not what they do and then to think that when we come out of that valley of the shadow into the clear light of the judgment bar all our unknown sins may burst upon us like a great army more than we can count or imagine it is terrible o my god save me from unknown sins o christ be my help and advocate when i come to know them how i lived through the next quarter of an hour i can never say to anybody i sat upon a settle near the door of the prison prayinghow earnestlyfor both of those in danger but more especially for colonel keith at last i saw a man coming towards me with the empty basket in which he had inserted his head like a bonnet so that it rather veiled his face i remembered then that i was to make as much noise as i could and quarrel with my supposed lover well you are a proper young man said i standing up how long do you mean to keep me waiting i should like to know you think ive nothing in the world to do dont you now and missis ll say nought to me will she for coming home late just you give me that basket men be such dolts come my girlin a deprecating tonesaid a voice which i recognised as that of angus i hoped nobody else would im not your girl and ill not come unless ive a mind neither cried i loudly trying to put in practice her ladyships advice to be as vulgar as i could im not agoing to have fellows dangling at my heels as keeps me awaiting come young woman you just clear out said the warder cartwright my word lad but shes a spitfire you be wise and think better of it now then be off both of you and he laid his hand on my shoulder as if to push me through the door which i pretended to resent very angrily and angus flung down the basket and began to strip up his sleeves as if he meant to fight the warder now we cant do with that kind of thing here cried another man coming forward whom i took to be somewhat above the rest be off at onceyou must not offer to fight the kings warders turn them out cartwright and shut the door on them angus caught up the basket and dashed through the door and i followed making all the noise i could and scolding everybody we had only just got outside the gate when ephraim came running up and snatched the basket from angus there was a few minutes pretended struggle between them and then ephraim chased angus into a sidestreet and came back to me whom he began to scold emphatically for encouraging such idle neerdowells as that rascal clowes i tried to give him as good as he brought and so we went on jangling as we walked until nearly within sight of mr raymonds door then declaring that i would not speak to him if he could not behave better and that i was not going to walk in his leadingstrings i marched on with my head held very high and ephraim trudged after me looking as sulky as he knew how we rapped on the backdoor and mr raymonds servant let us in in the parlour we found mr raymond and her ladyship i am thankful to see you safe back cried the former and his manner suggested to me the idea that he had not felt at all sure of doing so is all well accomplished angus drummond is out and keith is in replied ephraim as to the rest we must leave it for time to reveal i am frightfully tired of quarrelling i never did so much in my life before has miss courtenay done her part well asked her ladyship too well if anything said ephraim i was sadly afraid of a slip once if that fellow had insisted on carrying in the basket cary we should have had a complete smash of the whole thing why did you see that said i of course i did he answered i was never many yards from you i lay hidden in a doorway close to cary you make a deplorably good scold i never guessed you would do that part of the business so well i am glad to hear it for i found it the hardest part said i her ladyship came up and helped me to change my dress the cause owes something to you tonight miss courtenay said she at least if colonel keith can escape and if not madam if not my dear we shall but have done our duty goodnight will you accept a little reminder of this eveningand of lady inverness i looked up in astonishment was this beautiful woman with her tinge of sadness in face and voice the woman who had so long stood first at the court of montefiasconethe mistress of the robes to queen clementina and as some said of the heart of king james my lady inverness drew from her finger a small ring of chased gold it will fit you i think my dear you are a brave maid and i like you farewell i am not at all sure that my aunt kezia would have allowed me to accept it some even among the tories thought my lady inverness a wicked woman others reckoned her an injured and a slandered one i gave her what father calls the benefit of the doubt thanked her and accepted the ring i do not know whether i did right or wrong to run downstairs say goodbye to mr raymondby the way would mr raymond have allowed my lady to enter his house if he had believed the tales against herand hasten back with ephraim to bloomsbury square took but few minutes lucette let us in i think she had been watching the good lord has watched over mademoiselle said she as she took my cloak from me ephraim had gone back to the drawingroom and i followed i glanced at the french clock on the mantelpiece where a gold cupid in a robe of blue enamel was mowing down an array of hearts with a scythe and saw that we had been away a little over an hour could that be all how strange it seemed people were chattering and flirting fans and playing cards as if nothing at all had happened miss newton was sitting where i had left her talking to mr robert page grandmamma sat in her chair just as usual nobody seemed to have missed us except hatty who said with a smilei had lost you cary for the last halfhour yes said i something detained me out of the room i only exchanged one other sentence in the course of the evening with ephraim you will let me know how things go on i shall be very anxious of course yes i will take care of that and then the company broke up and i helped hatty to bed and prayed from my heart for colonel keith and angus and did not fall asleep till i had heard saint olaves clock strike two when i woke i had been making jumballs in the drawingroom with somebody who was both my lady inverness and my aunt kezia and who told me that colonel keith had been appointed governor of the american plantations and that he would have to be dressed in corduroy when i arose in the morning i couldand willingly wouldhave thought the whole a dream but there on my finger a solid contradiction was my lady invernesss ring for four days i heard nothing more on the friday my uncle charles told us that rumours were abroad of the escape of a prisoner and he hoped it might be angus my aunt dorothea wanted to hear all the particulars i sat and listened looking as grave as i could why it seems they must have bribed some fellow to carry in a basket of foul clothes and then to change clothes with the prisoner and so let him get out there appears to have been a girl in it as wella girl and a man i suppose they were both bribed very likely anyhow the prisoner is set free i only hope it is young drummond cary i said i hoped so too but dear me what will become of the man that went in asked my aunt dorothea oh hell be hanged sure enough said my uncle charles only some low fellow i suppose that was willing to sell himself a man does not sell his life in a hurry said my aunt dorothea my dear replied my uncle charles there are men who would sell their own mothers and children oh i dare say but not themselves said she i suppose somebody cared for him observed hatty i found it hard work to keep silence only low people like himself said grandmamma those creatures will do anything for money and then caesar bringing in a note with mrs newtons compliments the talk went off to something else on the saturday evening there was an extra assembly and i caught ephraim as soon as ever i could ephraim they have found it out i said in a whisper turn your back on the room said he quietly yes cary they have there goes keiths first chance of safetyyet it was a poor one from the beginning can nobody intercede for him with whom the electress is dead and they say she was the only one who had much influence with the elector he has daughters i suggested ephraim shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that was a very poor hope your friend mr raymond being a whig i urged might be able to do something i will see said he do you know that miss keith is to be in london this evening annas no i have never heard a word about it i was told so said ephraim looking hard at an engraving which he had taken up i wondered very much who told him she might possibly go to the princess caroline people say she is the best of the family bad is the best i am afraid note how did mr raymond come to know my lady inverness oh you discovered who she was did you she told me herself ahi cannot say i am not sure that he knew anything of her before tuesday night she was our superior officer and gave orders which we obeyedthat was all i cannot understand how mr raymond could have anything to do with it cried i nor i precisely i believe there are wheels within wheels is he not a friend of your uncle mr drummondan old friend i mean when they were young men possibly said i i do not know somebody came up now and drew ephraim away i had no more private talk with him but how could he come to know anything about annas and where is she going to be the next morning caesar brought me a little threecornered note i guessed at once from whom it came and eagerly tore it open we arrived in london last night my dear caroline and are very desirous of seeing you could you meet me at mr raymonds house this afternoon mr hebblethwaite will be so good as to call for you if you can come love from both to you and hester your affectionate friend a k come i should think i would come i only hoped annas already knew of my share in the plot to rescue angus if not what would she say to me i read the note again wewho were weand love from both surely flora must be with her i kept wishingand i could not tell myself whythat ephraim had less to do with it i did not like his seeming to be thus at the beck and call of annas and i did not know why it vexed me i must be growing selfish that would never do why should ephraim not do things for annas i was an older friend it is true but that was all i had no more claim on him than any one else i recognised that clearly enough yet i could not banish the feeling that i was sorry for it when ephraim came i thought he looked exceeding grave i had told grandmamma beforehand that annas and i thought flora also had returned to london and asked me to go and see them which i begged her leave to do grandmamma took a pinch of snuff over it and then said that caesar might call me a chair could i not walk grandmamma it is very near walk cried grandmamma and looked at me much as if i had asked if i might not lie or steal my dear you must not bring country ways to town like that walk indeedand you a courtenay of powderham why people would take you for a mantuamaker but grandmamma pleaseif i am a courtenay does it signify what people take me for i should like to know caroline said grandmamma with severity where you picked up such levelling ideas why they are whiggery and worse i cannot bear these dreadful mob notions that creep about now o days we shall soon be told that a king may as well sell his crown and sceptre because he would be a king without them he would not madam i am afraid i spoke mischievously my dear of course he would once a king always a king but the common people need to have symbols before their eyes they cannot take in any but common notions of what they see a monarch without a crown or a judge without robes or a bishop without lawn sleeves would never do for them why they would begin to think they were just men like themselves they do think so a great deal too much and grandmamma took two pinches in rapid succession which proceeding with her always betrays uneasiness of mind dear dear she muttered as she snapped her box again and dropped it into her pocket it must be that lamentable mixture in your blood whatever a courtenay could be thinking of to marry a dissentera puritan ministers daughter toohe must have been mad yet she was of good blood on the mothers side i believe grandmamma knows the pedigree of every creature in this mortal world up to the seventh generation was that deborah hunter grandmamma what do you know about deborah hunter returned grandmamma pulling out her snuffbox and taking a third pinch in a hurry as if the mere mention of a dissenter made her feel faint who has been talking to you about such a creature the less you hear of her the better oh we always knew her name madam said hatty and that she was a presbyters daughter well that is as much as you will know of her with my leave said grandmamma i do not know what more she might have said if my uncle charles had not come in but he brought news that the princes army had been victorious at falkirk and the cause is looking up again they say the folks at saint jamess are very uneasy said my uncle charles and the electors son is to be sent against the prince with a larger army i hear he set forth for edinburgh last night what fred said grandmamma fred nowill note answered my uncle charles that is the lad who was wounded at dettingen replied she the same he made answer oh they are not without pluck this family foreigners though they be the old blood is in them though theres not much of it they are a pack of rascals said grandmamma with another pinch i thought the box would soon be empty if she were much more provoked nay madam under your pleasure the lad is greatgrandson to the queen of bohemia and she was without reproach i would rather have fred or will than oliver grandmamma sat extreme upright and spoke in those measured tones and with that nice politeness which showed that she was excessively put out may i trouble you charles if you please never to name thatperson in my hearing again certainly madam said my uncle charles with a naughty look at me which nearly upset my gravity if i had dared to laugh i do not know what would have happened to me the age is quite levelling enough and the scoundrels quite numerous enough without your joining them mr charles carlingford desborough saying which grandmamma arose and as hatty said afterwards swept from the roommy uncle charles offering her his arm and assuring her with a most disconcerting look over his shoulder at us that he would do his very best to mend his manners your manners are good enough sir said grandmamma severely tis your morals i wish to mend when we thought grandmamma out of hearing we did laugh and my uncle charles coming down joined uswhich i am afraid neither he nor we ought to have done my mothers infinitely put out said he her snuffbox is empty and she never gave me my full name but twice before that i remember when i am charles desborough she is not pleased when i am mr charles desborough she is gravely annoyed but when i become mr charles carlingford desborough matters are desperate indeed i shall have to go to the cost of a new snuffbox i expect before i get forgiven yet i have no doubt oliver was a pretty decent fellowputting his politics on one side i am afraid uncle charles said hatty a snuffbox would hardly make your peace for that oh thats for you maids not for her she is not a good forgiver said my uncle charles more gravely she takes after her mother my lady sophia dont i remember my lady sophia and i should say from the expression of my uncle charless face that his recollections of my lady sophia carlingford were not among the pleasantest he had hatty is growing much more like herself with the pertness left out she looks a great deal better and can smile and laugh now but her old sharp bright ways are gone and only show now and then in a little flash what she was once the crosslands have disappearednobody knows where but i do not think miss marianne newton has broken her heart indeed i am not quite sure that she has one in the afternoon ephraim came and i went in a chair under his escort to mr raymonds house hatty declined to come she seemed to have a dislike to go out of doors further than just to take the air in the square with dobson behind her i should not like that at all it would make me feel as if the constable had me in custody but grandmamma insists on it and hatty does not seem to feel safe without somebody in mr raymonds parlour i found annas and flora alone i do not know what to say they looked like both are white and worn as if a great strain had been on their hearts but flora is much the more brokendown of the two annas is more queenly than ever with a strange faraway look in the dear grey eyes that i can hardly bear to see i ran up to her first thing o annas tell me i cried amidst my kisses tell me did i do right or wrong i felt sure she would need no explanation you did right caryand the dark grey eyes looked full into mine who are we to refuse our best to the master when he calls but it is hard hard to bear it is there any hope of escape i asked there is always hope where god is said annas but it is not always hope for earth flora kissed me and whispered thank you for angus but then she broke down and cried like a child have you heard anything of angus i asked yes said annas who shed no tears he is safe in france with friends of the cause in france cried i yes did you think he could stay in england impossible except now and then in disguise for a stolen visit perhaps when some years are gone then if colonel keith could escape that would be his lot of course unless the prince were entirely successful i felt quite dismayed i had never thought of this and how long do you stay here said i only till i can obtain a hearing of the princess caroline that is arranged by mr raymond through some friends of his he and mr hebblethwaite have been very very good to us i do not know what we should have done without them said flora wiping her eyes and is the day fixed for you to see the princess not quite but i expect it will be thursday next pray for us cary for that seems the last hope and you have heard nothing i suppose from the colonel yes i have annas put her hand into her bosom and drew forth a scrap of paper you may read it cary it will very likely be the last my own eyes were dim as i carried the paper to the window i could have read it where i was but i wanted an excuse to turn my back on every one my own dear sisterif it make you feel happier do what you will for my release but beyond that do nothing i have ceased even to wish it i am so near the gates of pearl that i do not want to turn back unless i hear my master call me and i think he is calling from the other side that does not mean that i love you less rather if it be possible the more tell our father and mother that we shall soon meet again and in the meantime they know how safe their boy must be say to angus if you have the opportunity that so far as in him lies i charge him to be to god and man all that i hoped to have been thank miss c courtenay and mr hebblethwaite for their brave help they both played their part well and tell flora that i kept my vow and that she shall hear the rest when we meet again god bless you every one farewell darling annas your loving brother not till but beyond death duncan keith note the prince of wales and the duke of cumberland the former distinguished himself by little beyond opposition to his father and an extremely profligate life the jacobite epitaph written on his death five years later will show the light in which he and his relatives were regarded by that half of the nation here lies fred who was alive and is dead had it been his father i had much rather had it been his sister no one would have missed her had it been his brother still better than another but since tis only fred who was alive and is dead why theres no more to be said note ephraim does the princess caroline an injustice she was a lily among the thorns note how far such a personation is consistent with truth and righteousness may be reasonably questioned but very few persons would have thought of raising the question in chapter thirteen stepping northwards it were to be wished the flaws were fewer in the earthen vessels holding treasure which lies as safe in a golden ewer but the main thing is does it hold good measure browning i turned back to the table and dropping the letter on it i laid my head down upon my arms and wept bitterly he who wrote it had done with the world and the worlds things for ever words such as these were not of earth they had come from the other side of the worldstorm and the lifes fever and he was nearly there i wondered how much flora understood did she guess anything of that unwhispered secret which he promised to tell her in the courts of heaven had she ever given to duncan keith what he had given her i rose at last and returned the letter to annas thank you i said you will be glad some day to have had that letter i am glad now said annas quietly as she restored it to its place and ere long we shall be glad together the tears help the journey not hinder it how calm you are annas i said wondering at her the time for miss keith to be otherwise has not come yet said mr raymonds voice behind me i think miss courtenay you have not seen much sorrow i have not sir said i turning to him i think i have seenand feltmore in the last six months than ever before and i dare say you have grown more in that period he made answer than in all the years before you know in what sort of stature i mean he left us and went upstairs and ephraim came in soon after i had no words with flora alone and only a moment with annas she came with us to the door does flora understand i whispered as i kissed annas for goodbye i think not cary i hope not it would be far better you do said i i knew it long ago she answered it is no new thing we went back to bloomsbury square where i found in the drawingroom a whole parcel of visitorsmrs newton and her daughters and a lot of the pages there are twelve of them sir anthony parmenter and a young gentleman and gentlewoman who were strangers to me grandmamma called me up at once here child said she come and speak to your cousins these are my brothers grandchildrenyour second cousins my dear and she introduced themmr roland and miss hilary carlingford what contrasts there are in this world to be sure as my cousin hilary sat by me and asked me if i went often to the play and if i had seen mrs bellamy a noted actress of that day and whether i loved music and all those endless questions that people seem as if they must ask you when they first make acquaintance with youall at once there came up before me the white calm face of annas keith and the inner vision of colonel keith in his prison waiting so patiently and heroically for death and oh how small did the one seem and how grand the other could there be a doubt which was nearer god a lump came up in my throat which i had to swallow before i could tell hilary that i loved old ballads and such things better than what they call classical music much of which seems to me like running up and down without any aim or tune to itand she was giving me a tap with her fan and saying oh fie cousin caroline dont tell the world your taste is so bad as that suddenly a sound broke across it all that sent everything vanishing away present and future good and ill and carried me off to the old winter parlour at brocklebank bless me man dont you know how to carry a basket said a voice which i felt as ready and as glad to welcome as if it had been that of an angel well you londoners have not much pith we cumberland folks dont carry our baskets with the tips of our fingerscant very often they are a good heft madam said dobson at the door looking more uncomfortable than i had ever seen him here is aa personwho woman man im a woman and not ashamed of it mrs desborough madam i hope you are well what grandmamma was going to do or say i cannot tell she sat looking at her visitor from head to foot as if she were some kind of curiosity i am afraid i spoilt the effect completely for with a cry of aunt kezia i rushed to her and threw my arms round her neck and got a warmer hug than i expected my aunt kezia to have given me oh dear what a comfort it was to see her she was what nobody else was in bloomsbury squaresomething to lean on and cling to and i did cling to her and if i went down in the esteem of all the big people round me i felt as if i did not care a straw about it now that i had got my own dear aunt kezia again heres one glad to see me at any rate said my aunt kezia and i fancy her eyes were not quite dry here are two aunt kezia said hatty coming up mrs kezia courtenay is it not said grandmamma so extra graciously that i felt sure she was vexed i am extreme glad to see you madam have you come from the north today hester my dear you will like to take your aunt to your chamber caroline you may go also if you desire it thus benignantly dismissed we carried off my aunt kezia as if she had been a casket of jewels and as to what the fine folks said behind our backs either of her or of us i do not believe either hatty or i cared a bit i can answer for one of us anyhow now sit down and rest yourself aunt kezia said i when we reached our chamber oh how delightful it is to have you is father well are we to go home and then it flashed upon meto go home leaving colonel keith in prison and annas and flora in such a position must we do that i listened somewhat anxiously for my aunt kezias answer it is pleasant to see you girls i can tell you and it is double pleasant to have such a hearty welcome to anybody your father and sophy are quite well and everybody else you are to go homeay but when well see byandby but now i want my questions answered if you please i shall be glad to know what has come to you both i sent off two throddy rosycheeked maids to london that did a bit of credit to cumberland air and country milk and here are two poor thin limp white creatures that look as if they had lost all the sunshine out of them what have you been doing to yourselvesor what has somebody else been doing to you which is it cary must speak for herself said hatty hatty must speak for herself said i hatty laughed it is somebody else with hatty i went on and i dont quite know how it is with me aunt kezia i have been feeling for some weeks past as if i had the world on my shoulders your shoulders are not strong enough for that child replied my aunt kezia there is but one shoulder which can carry the world the government shall be upon his shoulder you may well look poor if you have been at that work where are flora and miss keithand what has become of their brothers both annas and flora have just come back to london said hatty but angus is in dreadful trouble aunt and i do not know where colonel keith is with the prince i suppose no hatty said i aunt kezia angus is safe but an exile in france and colonel keith lies in newgate prison waiting for death what do you know about it asked hatty in an astonished tone my aunt kezia looked from one of us to the other you cannot both be right said she i hope you are mistaken cary i have no chance to be so i answered and i heard my voice tremble colonel keith bought anguss freedom with his own life at least there is every reason to fear that result and none to hope then that man who escaped was angus asked hatty i bowed my head i felt inclined to burst out crying if i spoke but who told you and how come you to be so sure it is true i was the girl who carried the basket into the prison i just managed to say so much without breaking down though that tiresome lump in my throat kept teasing me you cried hatty in more tones than the word has letters cary you must be dreaming when could you have done it in the evening on one of grandmammas tuesdays and i was back before any one missed me except you who went with youwho was in the plot do tell us cary yes i suppose you may know now i said for i could now speak more calmly ephraim took me to the place where i put on the disguise and forward to the prison then colonel keith and i carried in the basket and angus brought it out ephraim came to us after we left the prison and brought me back here ephraim hebblethwaite helped you to do that i did not understand hattys tone she was astonished undoubtedly so but she was something else too and what that was i could not tell my aunt kezia listened silently why cary you are a heroine i could not have believed that a timid little thing like you hatty stopped there was nobody else said i you were not well enough you know i had to do it but i can assure you hatty i felt like anything but a hero they are the heroes said my aunt kezia softly who feel unlike heroes but have to do it and go and do it therefore colonel keith and cary seem to be of that sort and there is only one other kind of heroesthose who stand by and see their best beloved do such things and knowing it to be gods will bid them godspeed with cheerful countenance and cry their own hearts out afterwards when no one sees them but himself that is annas sort said i yes and one other replied my aunt kezia but hatty did not know till afterwards said i child i did not mean hatty do flora and miss keith look as white as you poor thin things much worse i think said i annas keeps up and does not shed a tear and flora cries her eyes out but they are both white and sadly worn poor souls said my aunt kezia maybe they would like to go home with us do you know when they wish to go annas has been promised a hearing of princess caroline to intercede for her brother i made answer i think she will be ready to go as soon as that is over there would be no good in waiting and my voice choked a little as i remembered for what our poor annas would otherwise wait cary courtenay do you know you have got ten years on your head in six months i feel as if i were a good deal older i said smiling you are the elder of the two now said my aunt kezia drily not but what hatty has been through the kiln too but it has softened her and hardened you then hatty is gold and i am only clay i said and i could not help laughing a little though i have not laughed much lately there is some porcelain sells for its weight in gold said my aunt kezia thank you for the compliment aunt kezia nay lass im a poor hand at compliments but i know gold when i see itand brass too youll be home in good time for sophys wedding aunt kezia who does sophy marry mr liversedge the rector is not he rather rough rough not a bit of it he is a rough diamond if he be i fancied from what sam said when he came back to carlisle oh we had seen nought of him then he has done more good at brocklebank than mr digby did all the years he was there youll see fast enough when you get back tis the nature of the sun to shine what do you mean by that aunt kezia keep your eyes openthats what i mean girls your father bade me please myself about tarrying a bit before i turned homeward i doubt im not just as welcome to your grandmother as to you but i think we shall do best to bide till we see if the others can come with us maybe ephraim may be ready to go home by then too tis a bad thing for a young man to get into idle habits o aunt kezia ephraim is not idle i cried pray who asked you to stand up for him miss replied my aunt kezia a still tongue makes a wise head lass ill tell you what i rather fancy mrs desborough thinks me rough above a bit if im to be stroked alongside of these fine folks here i shall feel rough ive no doubt that smart plush fellow with his silver clocks to his silk stockings took up my basket as if he expected it to bite his fingers we dont take hold of baskets that road in our parts i havent seen a pair of decent clogs since i passed derby they are all slim french finnicking pattens down here how many of those fine lordsinwaiting have you in the house three and a black boy aunt and how many maids i must count lucette and perkins and the cookmaid and the kitchen girl four and two chambermaids six and a seamstress seven what have you a mantuamaker all to yourselves oh she does not make gowns she only does plain sewing and two cookmaids and two chambermaids and two beside why whatever in all the world can they find to do lucette is grandmammas woman and perkins is my aunt dorotheas said i but what have they got to do thats what i want to know said my aunt kezia well lucette gets up grandmammas laces and fine things said i and quills the nett for her ruffles and dresses her hair and alters her gowns whats that for said my aunt kezia when a gown has been worn two or three times said hatty they turn it upside down aunt and put some fresh trimming on it so that it looks like a new one but what for repeated my aunt kezia why then you see people dont remember that you had it on last week ill be bound i should we have very short memories in london said hatty laughing seems so but why should not folks remember i am fairly dumfoozled with it all how any mortal woman can get along with four men and seven maids to look after passes me i find maria and bessy and sam enough i can tell you too many sometimes mrs desborough must be up early and down late or does mrs charles see to things i began to laugh the idea of grandmamma seeing to anything except fancy work and whist was so extreme diverting why aunt kezia nobody ever sees to anything here said hatty and do things get done asked my aunt kezia with uplifted eyebrows sometimes said hatty again laughing they dont do much dusting i fancy i could write my name on the dust on the tables now and then and generally on the windows my aunt kezia glanced at the window and set her lips grimly if i were mistress in this house for a week said she i reckon those four men and seven maids would scarce send up a round robin begging me to stop another lucette does her work thoroughly said i and so does cicely the under chambermaid and caesar the black boy is an honest lad i am afraid i cannot say much for the rest but really aunt it seemed to me when i came that people hadnt a notion what work was in the south i guess itll seem so to me coming and going too said my aunt kezia in the same tone as before no wonder i couldnt work in silk stockings with silver clocks and sleeves with lace ruffles and ever so many yards of silk bundled up of a heap behind me i like gowns i can live in ive had this on a bit over three times hatty i should think so aunt said hatty laughing something like her old self why i remember your making it the winter before last did not i run the seams i dare say you did child when you see me bedecked in the pomps and vanities of this wicked world you may expect to catch larks by the sky falling at least i hope so mademoiselle said lucettes voice at the door madame bids me say the company comes from going and if madame and mesdemoiselles will descend she will be well at ease thats french lingo is it said my aunt kezia poor lass so down we went to the drawingroom where we found grandmamma my aunt dorothea and my uncle charles who came forward and led my aunt kezia to a chair miss newton told me that ceremony was growing out of date and was only practised now by nice oldfashioned people but grandmamma likes it and i fancy my uncle charles will keep it up while she lives madam said grandmamma i trust mr courtenay is well and that you had a prosperous journey he is better than ever he was i thank you madam answered my aunt kezia as for my journey i did not much enjoy it but here i am and that is well your other niece miss drummond is in town as i hear said grandmamma dorothea my dear it would doubtless be agreeable to mrs kezia if that young gentlewoman came here write a line and ask her to tarry with us while mrs kezia stays i thank you madam said my aunt kezia if miss keith be with her she may as well be asked too observed grandmamma after she had refreshed her faculties with a pinch of snuff my aunt dorothea sat down and writ the note and then bidding me ring the bell sent caesar with it he returned with a few lines from flora accepting the invitation for herself but declining it for annas i was less surprised than sorry certainly were i annas i should not care to come back to bloomsbury square poor white thing said my aunt kezia when she saw flora in the evening why you are worse to look at than these girls and they are ill enough flora brings news that annas is to see the princess next thursday but she has made up her mind to tarry longer in london and will not go back with us i asked where she was going to be and flora said at mr raymonds what all alone said hatty oh no answered flora mr raymonds mother is there i did not know that mr raymond had a mother annas had a letter this morning from lady monksburn the loveliest letter says flora that ever woman penned mr raymond said when he had read it which she let him do that it was worthy of a martyrs mother is mr raymond coming round said i what in politics replied flora with a smile i dont quite know cary i doubt if he will turn as quickly as you did as i did what can you mean flora did you not know you had become of a very cool politician a very warm one she said i remember when you first went with me to abbotscliff angus used to tease you about being a whig and you once told me you knew little about such matters and cared less i looked back at myself as it were and i think flora must be right i certainly thought much less of such things six months ago i suppose hearing them always talked of has made a change in me there is another thing that i have been thinking about tonight what is it in my aunt kezia that makes her feel so strong and safe to lean uponso different from other people i should never dream of feeling in that way to grandmamma and even fatherthough it is pleasant to rely on his strength and kindness when one wants something done beyond ones own strengthyet he is not restful to lean on in the same way that she is is she so safe to hold by because she holds by god this is grandmammas last tuesday as lent begins tomorrow and i believe she would as soon steal a diamond necklace as have an assembly in lent i had been walking a great deal as i have carried my aunt kezia these last few days to see all manner of sights and i was very tired so i crept into a little corner and there ephraim found me by the way it is most diverting to carry my aunt kezia to see things my uncle charles has gone with us sometimes and ephraim some other times but it is so curious to watch her she is the sight to me in the first place she does not care a bit about going to see a thing just because everybody goes to see it then she has very determined ideas of her own about everything she does see i believe she quite horrified my uncle charles one day when he carried us to see a collection of beautiful paintings we stopped before one which my uncle charles told us was thought a great deal of and had cost a mint of money whats it all about said my aunt kezia tis a picture of the holy family he answered by the great painter rubens now stop a bit whos what said my aunt kezia and set herself to study it who is that old man that hasnt shaved himself that madam is saint joseph never heard of him before oh do you mean joseph the carpenter i see well and who is that woman with the child on her knee why ever does not she put him some more clothes on hell get his death of cold my dear madam that is the blessed virgin i hope it isnt said my aunt kezia bluntly ill go bail she kept her linen better washed than that but whats that queer thing sprawling all over the sky the angel gabriel madam i hope he hasnt flown in here and seen this said my aunt kezia i should say if he have he didnt feel flattered by his portrait my aunt kezia did not seem to care for fine thingssmart clothes jewels and splendid coaches or anything like that she was interested in the lions at the tower and she liked to see any famous person of whom my uncle charles could tell her but for ranelagh she said she did not care twopence there were men and women plenty wherever you went and as to silks and laces she could see them any day over a mercers counter vauxhall was still worse and spring gardens did not please her any better but when in going through the tower we came to the axe which beheaded my lady jane grey she showed no lack of interest in that and the next day when my uncle charles said he would show us some of the fine things in the city and we were driving in grandmammas coach towards newgate my aunt kezia wanted to know what the open space was and my uncle charles told hersmithfield smithfield cried she pray you mr desborough bid your coachman stop i would liever see this than a lord mayors show my dear madam there is nothing to see answered my uncle charles who seemed rather perplexed this is not a marketday therell be plenty i can see was my aunt kezias reply and my uncle charles pulling the checkstring we alighted my aunt kezia stood a moment looking round you see there is nothing to see he observed nothing to see she made answer there are the fires to see and the martyrs and the angels around and the devils and the men wellnigh as ill as devils there is the land to see that they saved and the church that their blood watered and the greatness of england that they preserved ay and there is the day of judgment when martyrs and persecutors will have their rewardand you and i mr desborough shall meet with ours my word but there is enough to see for them that have eyes to see it ohah said my uncle charles my aunt kezia said no more except a few words which i heard her whisper softly to herselfthey shall reign for ever and ever the noble army of martyrs praise thee then as she turned back to the coach she added i thank you sir it was worth coming to london to look at that it makes one feel as if one got nearer to them and i thought but did not say that i should never be nearer to them than i had been that winter night when colonel keith helped me to carry the basket into the gates of that grim black pile beyond he was there yet if i had been a bird to have flown in and sung to himor better a giant to tear away locks and bars and let him out and i could do nothing but here i am running ever so far from grandmammas tuesday and the news ephraim brought annas has seen the princess caroline she liked her and thought her very gentle and good but she held out no hope at all and did not seem to think that anything which she could say would influence her father she would lay the matter before him but she could promise no more however she appointed another day about a month hence when annas may go to her again and hear the final answer so annas must wait for that ephraim and annas seem to be great friends is it not shockingly selfish of me to wish it otherwise i do not quite know why i wish it but sometimes i wonderno i wont wonder it will be all right of course however it be arranged why should i always want people to care for me and think of me and put me first cary courtenay you are growing horribly vain and selfish i wonder at you it is settled now that we go home the week after easter day we means my aunt kezia and flora and hatty and me i do not know how four women are to travel without a gentleman or even a servingman but i suppose we shall find out when the time comes i said to my aunt kezia that perhaps grandmamma would lend us dobson him cried she dear heart but id a vast deal liever be without him he would want all the coachpockets for his silk stockings and would take more waiting on than prince charlie himself i make no account of your grand gentlemen in plush that pick up baskets with the tips of their fingers my aunt kezia cannot get over that give me a man or a woman either with some brains in his head and some use in his hands these southern folks seem to have forgotten how to use theirs i watched that girl martha dusting the other day and if i did not long to snatch the duster out of her hands and whip her with it she just drew it lazily across the top of the tablenever troubled herself about the sidesand gave it one whisk across the legs and then she had done id rather do my work myself every bit of it than have such a pack of idle folks about meay ten times over i would they dont seem to have a bit of gumption they say lawyers go to heaven an inch every good friday but if those lazy creatures get there or anywhere else in double the time i wonder and just look at the way they dress a good linsey petticoat and a quilted linen bedgown was good enough for a woman that had her work to do when i was young but now dear me my ladies must have their gowns and their muslin aprons of an afternoon and knots of ribbon in their hair i do believe they will take to wearing white stockings next thing and gloves when they go to church eh dear girls i tell you what this world is coming to something later in the evening miss newton came up to me with her fan held before her laughing face my dear miss courtenay what curious things your worthy aunt does say she asked me just now why i came into the world i told her i did not know and the idea had never before occurred to me and she said well then it is high time it did and some to spare do all the people in cumberland ask you such droll questions i said i thought not but my aunt kezia did often enough well she is a real curiosity said miss newton and went away laughing brocklebank fells april the th at least i begin on the th but when i shall finish is more than i can tell things went on happening so fast after the last page i writ that i neither had time to set them down nor heart for doing it prince william of hanover whom the whigs call duke of cumberland left edinburgh with a great army not long after i writ but no news has yet reached us of any hostile meeting betwixt him and the prince mr raymond saith colonel keiths chances may depend somewhat upon the results of the battle which is daily expected nevertheless he adds there is no chance for the lord orders all things my aunt kezia and mr raymond have taken wonderfully to one another hatty said to her that she could not think how they got on when they chanced on politics bless you child we never do said my aunt kezia we have got something better to talk about and why should two brothers quarrel because one likes red heels to his shoes and the other admires black ones ah if that were all aunt said i but how can you leave it there it seems to me not a matter for opinion but a question of right we have to take sides and we may choose the wrong one i dont see that a woman need take any side unless she likes quoth my aunt kezia i can bake as tasty a pie and put on as neat a patch whether i talk of prince charles or the young pretender and patches and pies are my business the prince isnt i reckon the lord will manage to see that every one gets his rights without kezia courtenay running up to help him but somebody has it to do aunt let them do it then im glad im not somebody but aunt kezia dont you want people to have their rights depends on what their rights are child some of us would be very sadly off if we got them i should not like my rights i know ah you mean your deserts aunt said hatty but rights are not just the same thing are they let us look it in the face girls if you wish saith my aunt kezia i hate seeing folks by sideface if you want to see anybody or understand anything look right in its face what are rights they are not always desertsyou are right there hattyfor none of us hath any rights as regards god rights concern ourselves and our fellowmen i take it every man hath a right to what he earns and to what is given himwhether god or man gave it to himso long as he that gave had the right over what he gave now as to this question it seems to me all lies in a nutshell if king james be truly the son of the old king which i cannot doubt then god gave him the crown of england of which no man can possibly have any right to deprive him only god can do that then comes the next question has god done that time must answer without a revelation from heaven we cannot find it out any other way but until we do find it out where are we to stand keep to your last orders till you get fresh ones a servant will make sad blunders who goes contrary to orders just because he fancies that his master may have changed his mind i see that for all practical purposes my aunt kezia agrees with annas and indeed what they say sounds but reasonable it was the second of april when we left london it had been arranged that we should travel by the flying machine note stagecoaches originally bore this hyperbolical name which runs from london to gloucester setting forth from the saracens head on snow hill the last evening before we set out my aunt kezia hatty and i spent at mr raymonds with annas his mother is a very pleasant old silverhaired gentlewoman with a soft low voice and gentle manner that reminded me of lady monksburn i felt it very hard work to say farewell to annas what might not have happened before we met again ephraim was there for the last hour or so and was very attentive to her i do thinkand i am rather afraid the laird her father will not like it but ephraim is good enough for anybody and i hope when he marry annas which i think is coming that he will not quite give over being my friend he has been more like our brother than anybody else i should not like to lose him i have always wished we had a brother no not goodbye just yet cary said ephraim in answer to my farewell you will see me again in the morning oh are you coming to see us off he nodded and we only said goodnight grandmamma was very kind when we took leave of her she gave each of us a keepsakea beautiful garnet necklace to hatty and a handsome pearl pin to me and my dear said she to hatty i do hope you will try to keep as genteel as you are now dont for mercys sake go and get those blowzed red cheeks again they are so unbecoming a gentlewoman and garnets though they are the finest things in the world for a pale clear complexion look horrid worn with great red cheeks cary your manners had rather gone back when you came from what they used to be but you have improved again now mind you keep it up dont get warm and enthusiastic over thingsthat is your danger my dearespecially things of no consequence and which dont concern you a young gentlewoman should not be a politician and to be warm over anything which has to do with religion as i have many times told you is exceeding bad taste you should leave those matters to public men and the clergy it is their businessnot yours my dears and out came grandmammas snuffbox i wish you to understand once for all that if one of you ever joins those insufferable creatures the methodists i will cut her off with a shilling i shall wash my hands of her completely i would not even call her my granddaughter again but i am sure my dears you have too much sense i shall not insult you by supposing such a thing make my compliments to your father and tell him i think you both much improved by your winter in town goodbye my dears mrs kezia i wish you a safe and pleasant journey i thank you madam and wish you every blessing said my aunt kezia with a warm clasp of grandmammas hand which i am sure she would think sadly countrified but might i ask you madam to explain something which puzzled me above a bit in what you have just said certainly mrs kezia said grandmamma in her most gracious manner then madam as i suppose the clergy are going to heaven and i am sure you would be as sorry to think otherwise as i should if the way to get there is their business and not yours where are you going if you please grandmamma looked at my aunt kezia as if she thought that she must have taken leave of her wits madam ii do not understand my aunt kezia did not flinch in the least she stood quietly looking into grandmammas face with an air of perfect simplicity and waited for the answer of course wewe are all going to heaven said grandmamma in a hesitating way but it is the business of the clergy to see that we do excuse me madam i am not accustomed toto talk about such subjects and grandmamma took two pinches one after the other well you see i am coolly said my aunt kezia seems to me madam that going to heaven is every bit as much my business as going to gloucester and i have not left that for the clergy to see to nor do i see why i should the other folks dont always remember what you trust them with and sometimes they cant manage the affair and i take the liberty to think theyll find that matter rather hard to do without i see to it as well and without the lord sees to it beside farewell madam i shall be glad to meet you up there and i do hope youll make sure youve got on the right road for it would be uncommon awkward to find out at last that it was the wrong one goodmorrow and god bless you not a word came in answer but i just glanced back through the crack of the door and saw grandmamma sitting with the reddest face i ever did see to her and two big wrinkles in her forehead taking pinch after pinch in the most reckless manner my aunt dorothea who stood in the door said acidlyi think madam it would have been as well to keep such remarks till you were alone with my mother i do not know how it may be in cumberland but they are not thought becoming to a gentlewoman here believe me i am indeed sorry to be forced to the discourtesy of saying so but you were the first offender ay said my aunt kezia folks that tell the naked truth generally meet with more kicks than halfpence but i would have spoken out of these girls hearing only i got never a chance and you see i shall have to give in my account some day and i want it to be as free from blots as i can i suppose you thought you were doing a good work for your own soul said my aunt dorothea sneeringly eh no poor soul was my aunt kezias sorrowful reply my souls beyond my saving but christ has it safe and knowing that madam makes one very pitiful to unsaved souls upon my word madam cried my aunt dorothea you take enough upon you unsaved souls indeed well i am thankful i never had the presumption to say that my soul was safe i have a little more humility than that it would indeed be presumption in some cases said my aunt kezia solemnly but madam if you ask a princess whose daughter she is it is scarce presuming that she should answer you the kings what else can she answer we know that we have eternal life an apostle writ that i suppose said my aunt dorothea in a hard tone they were not apostles he writ to said my aunt kezia and he says he writ on purpose that they might know it now ladies tis high time to set forth called my uncle charless voice from the hall and i was glad to hear it i and hatty ran off at once but i could not but catch my aunt kezias parting words god bless you madam and i thank you for all your kindness and when i next see you i hope you will know it we drove to snow hill in grandmammas coach and took our seats bespoken some days back in the flying machine where our company was two countrywomen with baskets a youth that looked very pale and cadaverous and wore his hair uncommon long a lady in very smart clothes and a clergyman in his cassock my uncle charles bade us farewell very kindly and wished us a safe journey mr raymond was there also and he bade god bless us somehow in all the bustle i had not a right chance to take leave of ephraim the coach set forth rather sooner than i expected while flora and i were charging mr raymond with messages to annas and he had only time to step back with a bow and a smile i looked for ephraim but could not even see him i was so sorry and i thought of little else until we got to uxbridge at uxbridge we got out and went into the inn to dine at the ordinary which is always spread ready for the coming of the flying machine on a wednesday as i sat down beside my aunt kezia a man came and took the chair on the other side of me tired cary he said to my amazement ephraim i cried wherever have you come from did you think i had taken up my abode in london said he looking diverted but i thought you went after some business i said feeling very much puzzled that he should be going home just now and leaving poor annas in all her trouble i did he answered business gets done some time it would be a sad thing if it did not will you have some of this rabbit pie i accepted the pie for i did not care what i had then your business is done i said in some surprise his business could hardly have any connection with annas in that case it must be real businesssomething that concerned his father yes cary my business was finished last night so i was just in time to come with you and the look of fun came into his eyes again oh i am glad said i i wondered how my aunt kezia would manage all by herself had you three made up your minds to be particularly naughty asked he laughing now ephraim said i sounded like it he replied well cary are you glad to go home well yesi thinki am answered i then certainly i think you are not well i am glad for some reasons and not for others yes i understand that and i guess one of the reasonsyou are sorry to leave miss keith i wondered if he guessed that because he was sorry yes i am very sorry to leave her in this trouble do you think it likely that colonel keith can escape ephraim shook his head is it possible possible is a divine word not fit for the lips of men what god wills is possible and it is not often that he lets us see long beforehand what he means to do then you think all lies with god i saidi am afraid in a rather hopeless tone does not everything at all times lie with god that means hope cary not despair whatsoever the lord pleased that did he oh dear that sounds as ifephraim i dont mean to say anything wickedas if he did not care he cares for our sanctification that is in the long run for our happiness would you rather that he cared just to rid you of the pain of the moment and not for your eternal happiness oh no but could i not have both no cary i dont suppose you could but if god can do everything why can he not do that do you never want to know the answers to such questions or do they not trouble you they are always coming up with me far too often satan takes care of that you think it is wicked to want the answers it is rebellion cary the king is the best judge of what concerns his subjects welfare i felt in a corner so i ate my pie and was silent we slept at reading and the next day we dined at wallingford and slept at the angel at oxford next morning which was saturday we were up before the sun to see as much as we could of the city before the machine should set forth i cannot say that i got a very clear idea of the place for when i try to remember it my head seems a confused jumble of towers and gateways colleges and churches stained windows and comical gargoylesat least that is what ephraim called the funny faces which stuck out from some of the walls i dont know where he got the word this days stage was the longest we dined at lechlade and it had long been dark when we rattled into the courtyard of the bell inn at gloucester where we were to pass the sunday oh how tired i was almost too tired to sleep on sunday we went to church at the cathedral where we had a very dull sermon from a minor canon in the afternoon as we sat in the hosts parlour ephraim said to me cary did you ever hear of george whitefield oh yes ephraim i cried and i felt the blood rush to my cheeks and my eyes light up i heard him preach in scotland when i was there with flora have you heard him yes many times and mr wesley also i was pleased to hear that and what were you going to say about him that if you knew his name it would interest you to hear that he was born in this inn his parents kept it and he chose to be a fieldpreacher cried i why that was coming down in the world was it not note it was coming down in this world said he but there is another world cary and i fancy it was going up in that you must remember however that he did not choose to be a fieldpreacher nor a dissenter he was turned out of the church but why should he have been turned out i expect because he would not hold his tongue but why did anybody want him to hold his tongue well you see he let it run to awkward subjects ladies and gentlemen did not like him because he set his face against fashionable diversions and told them that they were miserable sinners and that there was only one way into heaven which they would have to take as well as the poor in the almshouses the neighbouring clergy did not like him because he was better than themselves and the bishops did not like him because he said they ought to do their duty better and look after their dioceses instead of setting bad examples to their clergy by hunting and cardplaying and so forth or at the best sitting quiet in their closets to write learned books which was not the duty they promised when they were ordained but as was the case with another preacher the common people heard him gladly and he was really turned out seven years ago i wonder if it were a wise thing said i thinking mr raymond says it was the most unwise thing they could have done and he says so of the turning forth under the act of uniformity eighty years ago he thinks the men who were the very salt of the church left her then and that now she is a saltless soulless thing that will die unless gods mercy put more salt in her but suppose it do and the bishops get them turned out again then says raymond let the bishops look to themselves there is such a thing as judicial blindness and there is such a thing as salt that has lost its savour and is trodden under foot of men if the church cast out the children of god god may cast out the church of england there are precedents for it in the books of heaven and in all those cases god let them go on for a while over and over again they grieved his spirit and persecuted his servants but at last there always came one time which was the last time and after that the spirit withdrew and that church or that nation was left to the lot which it had chosen oh ephraim that sounds dreadful it will be dreadful he answered if we provoke it at the lords hand one feels as if one would like to save such men i said do you i feel as if i should like to save such churches it is like a sons feeling who sees his own mother going down to the pit of destruction and is utterly powerless to hold out a hand to save her she will not be saved and i wonder sometimes whether any much sorer anguish can be on this side heaven i was silent it makes it all the harder he said in a troubled voice when the fathers other sons whose mother she is not jeer at the poor falling creature and at her own children for their very anguish in seeing it i do not think the father can like them to do that it is hard enough for the children without it and surely he loves her yet and would fain save her and bring her home and i felt he spoke in parables note at this date an innkeeper stood higher in the estimation of society than at present and a clergyman considerably lower unless the latter were a dignitary or a man whose birth and fortune were regarded as entitling him to respect apart from his profession chapter fourteen how things came round they say when cities grow too big their smoke may make the skies look dim and so may life hide god from us but still it cannot alter him and age and sorrow clear the soul as night and silence clear the sky and hopes steal out like silver stars and next day brightens by and by isabella fyvie mayo on the monday morning we left gloucester on horseback with two baggagehorses beside those we rode we dined at worcester and lay that night at bridgenorth on the tuesday we slept at macclesfield on the wednesday at colne on the thursday at appleby and on friday about four oclock in the afternoon we reached home on the steps waiting for us stood father and sophy i had not been many minutes in the house before i felt in some inward indescribable way that things were changed i wonder what that is by which we feel things that we cannot know it was not the house which was altered the old things which i had known from a child all seemed to bid me welcome home it was father and sophy in whom the change was it was not like sophy to kiss me so warmly and call me darling and i was not one bit like father to stroke my hair and say so solemnly god bless my lassie i have had many a kiss and a loving word from him but i never heard him speak of god except when he repeated the responses in church or when i wondered what had come to father and how i did wonder when after supper sam brought not a pack of cards but the big bible which used to lie in the hall window with such heaps of dust on it and he and maria and bessy sat down on the settle at the end of the hall and father in a voice which trembled a little read a psalm and then we knelt down and said the confession and the general thanksgiving and the lords prayer i looked at my aunt kezia and saw that this was nothing new to her and then i remembered all at once that she had hinted at something which we should see when we came home and had bidden us keep our eyes open the pack of cards did not come out at all the next morning i was the first to come down i found sam setting the table in the parlour we exchanged goodmorrows and sam hoped i was not very tired with the journey then he said without looking up as he went on with his work yell hae found some changes here im thinking miss i saw one last night sam said i smiling theres mair nor ane he replied theres three things i this warld that can neer lie hidden ye may try to cover them up but theyll ay out sooner or later and thats blood and truth and the grace o god i am not so sure the truth of things always comes out sam said i yeve no been sae lang i this warld as me miss cary said sam and deed sometimes tis a lang while first but the grace o god shows up quick mostly tis its nature to be hard at wark yell no put barm into a batch o flour and hae it lying idle and the kingdom o heaven is like unto leaven it maun wark ay who shall let it is mr liversedge well liked sam i asked when i had thought a little hes weel eneuch liked o them as is weel liking said sam setting his forks in their places the angels like him ive nae doubt and the lost sheep like him but he does nae gang doun sae weel wi the ninety and nine theyd hae him a bit harder on the sinners and a bit safter wi the saintsspecially wi theirsels wha are the vara crown and flower o a the saints and neer were sinnersno to speak o ye ken and outside the responses and he disna gang saft and slippy doun their throats as theyd hae him but he is just main hard on em he tells em gin theyre saints they suld live like saints and theyd like the repute o being saints without the fash o living he did himsel a main deal o harm wi siclike by a discourse some time ganeyell judge what like it was when i tell ye the scripture it was on he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked and theres a gey lot of folks i this warld d like vara weel to abide but theyre a hantle too lazy to walk and the minister he comes and stirs em up wi the staff o the word and bids em get up and gang their ways and no keep sat down o the promises divertin theirsels wi watching ither folk trip hes vara legal miss cary is the minister he reckons folk suld be washed all oer and no just dip their tongues in the fountain and keep their hearts out he disna make much count o giving the lord your tongue and ay hauding the deil by the hand ahint your back and the oer gude folks disna like that theyd liever keep friendly wi baith then you think the promises were not made to be sat on sam said i feeling much diverted with sams quaint way of putting things sam settled the creamjug and sugarbowl before he answered ill tell ye how it is miss the promises was made to be lain on by weary heavyladen sinners that come for rest and want to lay down both theirsels and their burden o sins on the lords heart o love but they were neer made for auld jeshurun to sit on and wax fat and kick the puir burdened creatures as they come toiling up the hill last time i was in carlisle i went to see a kinsman o mine there as has set up i the cabinetmaking trade and he showed me a balk o yon bonnie new wood as they hae getten oer o latethe auld vicar used to hae his diningtable ont it comes frae some outlandish pairts and they call it a queer name i canna just mind it the nooi reckon im getting too auld to tak in new notions mahogany ay maybe thats it i ken it minded me o mud and muggins atweel my cousin tauld me theyd a rare call for siccan wood and being vara costly theyd hit o late in the trade on a new way o making furniture as did nae come to sae micklethey ca it veneer oh yes i know said i ay yell hae seen it i london toun i daur say all thats bads safe to gang there i believe sam thinks all londoners a pack of thieves atweel miss cary theres a gran sicht o veneered christians i this country they look as spicspan and as glossy and just the richt shade o colour and bonnily grained and a thattill ye get ahint em and then ye see that saving a thin bit o facing theyre just common deal like ither folk ay and its maistly the warst bits o the deal as is used up ahint the veneer it is sae ye see tis no meant to last but only to sell and theres a monie folks ll gie the best price for siclike and fancy they hae getten the true thing but im thinkin the king ll no gie the price his eyes are as a flame o fire and theyll see richt through siccan rubbish and burn it up and mr liversedge i suppose is the real mahogany he is sae and hes a gey awkward way of seeing ahint thae bits o veneered stuff and finding out theyre no worth the money and they dinna like him onie better for t but i hope he does not make a mistake the other way sam and take the real thing for the veneer you trust him for that he was no born yestreen theres a hantle o folk makes that blunder though away went sam for the kettle when he brought it back he saidmiss cary yell mind annie crosthwaite as lives wi auld mally ah did i not remember annie crosthwaitepoor fragile pretty spring flower that some cruel hand plucked and threw away and men trod on the bemired blossom as it lay in the mire and women drew their skirts aside to keep from touching the torn soiled petals yes sam i said in a low voice ay the minister brought yon puir lassie a message frae the gude lordyet return again to meand she just took it as heartily as it was gien and went and fand restpuir straying lost sheepbut when she came to the table o the lord the ninety and nine wad hae nane o hershe was gude eneuch for him in the white robe o his richteousness but she was no near gude eneuch for them sin she had lost her ainand not ane soul i a the parish wad kneel down aside o her miss cary i neer saw the ministers een flash out sparks o fire as they did when he heard that and what think ye said he i should like to hear sam vara gude says he i beg he says that none o ye all will come to the table tomorrow annie crosthwaite and i will gang thither our lane but therell be three says he for the blessed lord himsel will come and eat wi us and we wi him for he receiveth sinners and eateth with them and he did it for a they tald him the bishop wad be doun on him let him says he and he shall hear the haill story and not ane o them a wad he let come that morn they were no worthy he said and did the bishop hear of it ay did he and sent doun a big chiel like an auld eagle wi a his feathers ruffled the wrang way but the minister he stood his ground there were three mr archdeacon says he as quiet as a milltarn and the lord himsel made the third and how am i to ken that says the big chiel ruffling up his feathers belike will ye be sae gude as to ask him says the minister i dinna ken what the big chiel made o the tale to the bishop but we heard nae mair ont maybe he did ask him and gat the auld answertouch not mine anointed and do my prophet no harm still rules ought to be kept sam rules ought to be kept in ordinar but this was byeordinar ye see if a big lad has been tauld no to gang frae the parlour till his faither comes back and he sees his little brither drooning in the pond just afore the window i reckon his faither ll no be mickle angered if he jumps out of the window and saves him any way i wad nae like to hae what hed get gin he saidfaither ye bade me tarry in this chalmer and sae i could nae do a hands turn for willie rules are mans miss cary but truth and souls belang to god my aunt kezia and sophy had come in while sam was talking and father and hatty followed now so we sat down to breakfast sam has told you one story girls said my aunt kezia and i will tell you another you will find the singers changed when you go to church dan oldfield and susan nixon are gone dan and susan cried hatty the two best voices in the gallery well you know under old mr digby there always used to be an anthem before the service began in which dan and susan did their best to show off the second week that mr liversedge was here he stopped the anthem up started the singers and told him they would not stand it it wasnt worth their while coming just for the psalms mr liversedge heard them out quietly and then saiddo you mean what you have just said yes to be sure they meant it then consider yourselves dismissed from the gallery without more words says he you are not worthy to sing the praises of him before whom multitudes of angels veil their faces not worth your while to praise godbut worth your while to show man what fine voices he gave you whom you think scorn to thank for it and he turned them off there and then the next time i was alone with sophy she said to me with tears in her eyescary i dont want you to reckon me worse than i am that is bad enough in all conscience i would have knelt down with annie crosthwaite and so i am sure would my aunt kezia but it was while she was up in london with you and father was so poorly with the gout i could not leave him you see there was nobody to take my place with all of you away please dont fancy i was one of those that refused for indeed it was not so i fancy you are a dear good sophy said i kissing her and i suppose if mr liversedge asked you to shake hands with a chimneysweep just come down the chimney you would be delighted to do it well perhaps i might said sophy laughing but that cary i should have done not for him but for our master i found that i liked mr liversedge very much as one would wish to like a brotherinlaw that was to be his whole heart seems to be in his lords work and if perhaps he is a little sharp and abrupt at times i think it is simply because he sees everything quickly and distinctly and speaks as he sees i was afraid he would have something of the pope about him but i find he is not like that at all he lets you alone for all mere differences of opinion though he will talk them over with you readily if he sees that you wish it but let those keen black eyes perceive something which he thinks sin and down he comes on you in the very manner of the old prophets yet show him that he has made a mistake and that your action was justified and he begs your forgiveness in a moment and i never saw a man who seemed more fitted to deal with brokenhearted sinners to them he is tenderness and comfort itself he just takes pattern frae his maister thats whaur it is said old elspie mind ye he was unco gentle wi the puir despised publicans and vara tender to the wife that had been a sinner it was the pharisees he was hard on and thats just what the minister is miss cary hes just the best blessing the lord ever sent till brocklebank i hardly thought elspie said i a little mischievously to hear you speak so well of a prelatist clergyman hoot awa we a hae our bees in our bonnets miss cary said the old woman a trifle testily the ministers no pairfect i daur say but hes as gran at praying as john knox himself and he gars ye feel the loue and loueliness o christ like maister rutherford did and sae lang s hell do that im no like to quarrel wi him if he do hae a fancy for lawn sleeves and siccan rubbish i wish him better sense thats a maybe hell hae it ane o thae days i cannot understand hatty as she is now for a while after that affair with the crosslands she was just like a drooping brokendown flower all her pertness and even her brightness completely gone now that is changed and she has become not pert again but hardhard and bitter nobody can do anything to suit her and she says things now and then which make me jump things i mean as if she believed nothing and cared for nobody when hatty speaks in that way i often see my aunt kezia looking at her with a strange light in her eyes which seems to be half pain and half hopefulness mr liversedge i fancy is studying her and i am not sure that he knows what to make of her yesterday evening fanny and ambrose came in and sat a while fanny is ever so much improved she has brightened up and lost much of that languid limp fanciful way she used to have and instead of writing odes to the stars she seems to take an interest in her poultryyard and dairy my aunt kezia says fanny wanted an object in life and i suppose she has it now when they had been there about an hour mr liversedge came in he does not visit sophy often i fancy he is too busy but tuesday evening is usually his leisure time so far as he can be said to have one and he generally spends it here when he can he and ambrose presently fell into discourse upon the parish and somehow they got to talking of what a clergymans duties were ambrose thought if he baptised and married and buried people and administered the sacrament four times a year and preached every month or so and went to see sick people when they sent for him he had done all that could be required and might quite reasonably spend the rest of his time in hunting either foxes or latin and greek according as his liking led him you think christ spent his life so asked mr liversedge in that very quiet tone in which he says his sharpest things and which reminds me so often of colonel keith ambrose looked as if he did not know what to say and before he had found out mr liversedge went on because you see he left me an example that i should follow his steps mr liversedge i thought you were orthodox i certainly should have thought so as long as i quoted scripture said the vicar but you know nobody does such a thing said ambrose then is it not high time somebody should mr liversedge you will never get promotion if that be the way you are going on in which world which world there is only one i thought there were two ambrose fidgetted uneasily on his chair i tell you what my good sir you are on the way to preach your church empty the pews have no souls to be saved i believeand ambrose chuckled over his little joke what of the souls of the absent congregation asked mr liversedge oh theyll have to get saved elsewhere answered ambrose then if they do get saved what reason shall i have to regret their absence but suppose they do not mr catterallis that my loss or theirs why couldnt you keep them said ambrose at what cost was the vicars answer a little more music and rather less thunder said ambrose laughing give us back the anthemyou have no idea how many have taken seats at all saints because of that and do you know your discarded singers are there all saints is heartily welcome to everybody that has gone there replied mr liversedge if i drive them away by preaching error i shall answer to god for their souls but if men choose to go because they find truth unpalatable i have no responsibility for them the lord has not given me those souls that is plain if he have given them to another sower of seed by all means let them go to him as fast as they can mr liversedge i do believeambrose drew his chair back an inchi do almost thinkyou must beaa calvinist it is not catching i assure you mr catterall but are you that depends on what you mean i certainly do not go blindly over hedge and ditch after the opinions of john calvin i am not sure that any one does no butyou believe that people areaare elect or nonelect and if they be elect they will be saved however they live and if they be not they must needs be lost however good they are excuse my speaking so freely i am very much obliged to you for it no mr catterall i do not believe anything of the sort if that be what you mean by calvinism i abhor it as heartily as you do why i thought all calvinists believed that i answer most emphatically no i believe that men are elect but that they are elected unto sanctification and a man who has not the sanctification shows plainlyunless he repent and amendthat he is not one of the elect now i know a man who says rolling the whites of his eyes and clasping his palms together as if he were always saying his prayers like the figures on that old fellows tomb in the chancelhe says he was elected to salvation from all eternity and cannot possibly be lost and he is the biggest swearer and drinker in the parish what say you to that am i to believe him can you manage it i cant that is exactly the thing dont then i could not but now do you believe mr liversedgei have picked up the words from this fellowthat god elected men because he foreknew them or that he foreknew because he had elected them ambrose gave a little wink at fanny and me sitting partly behind him as if he thought that he had driven the vicar completely into a corner when the angel gabriel is sent to tell me mr catterall i shall be most happy to let you know until then you must excuse my deciding a question on which i am entirely ignorant ambrose looked rather blank well then mr liversedge as to freewill do you think that every man can be saved if he likes or not let christ answer younot me no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him ah then man has no responsibility and ambrose gave another wink at us let christ answer you again ye will not come unto me that ye might have life if they had come you see they might have had it but how do you reconcile the two said ambrose knitting his brows when the lord commands me to reconcile them he will show me how but i do not expect him to do either in this world to what extent our knowledge on such subjects may be enlarged in heaven i cannot venture to say but surely you must reconcile them pardon me i must act on them can you act on principles you cannot reconcile certainlyif you can put full trust in their proposer every child does it every day you will be a long while in the dark mr catterall if you must know why a candle burns before you light it better be content to have the light and work by it there are more sorts of light than one said my aunt kezia that is the best light by which you see clearest was the vicars answer what have you got to see asked ambrose your sins and your saviour was the reply and till you have looked well at both those mr catterall and are sure that you have laid the sins upon the sacrifice it is as well not to look much at anything else i think ambrose found that he was in the corner this time and just the kind of corner that he did not care to get in at any rate he said no more sophys wedding which took place this evening was the quietest i ever saw she let mr liversedge say how everything should be and he seemed to like it as plain and simple as possible no bridesmaids no favours no dancing no throwing the stocking no fuss of any sort i asked him if he had any objection to a cake none at all said he so long as you dont want me to eat it and pray dont let us have any sugary cupids on the top nor any rubbish of that sort so the cake was quite plain but i took care it should be particularly good and hatty made a wreath of spring flowers to put round it the house feels so quiet and empty now when all is over and sophy gone of course she is not really gone because the vicarage is only across a couple of fields and ten minutes will take us there at any time but she is not one of us any longer and that always feels sad i do feel somehow very sorrowful tonightmore i think than i have any reason i cannot tell why sometimes a sort of tired sad feeling comes over one when there seems to be no cause for it i feel as if i had not something i wanted and yet if anybody asked me what i wanted i am not sure that i could tell or rather i am afraid i could tell but i dont want to say so there is something gone out of my life which i wanted more of and since we came home i have had none of it or next to none no little book i am not going to tell you what it is only there is a reason for my feeling sad and i must keep it to myself and never let anybody know it i suppose other women have had to do the same thing many a time and some of them perhaps grow hard and cold and say bitter things and people dislike and avoid them not knowing that if they lifted up the curtain of their hearts they would see a grave there in which all their hopes were buried long ago well god knows best and will do his best for us all how can i wish for anything more nd when we went up to bed last night to my surprise hatty came to me and put her arms round me there are only us two left now cary she said and i know i have been very bitter and unloving of late but i mean to try and do better dear will you love me as much as you can and help me i have been very unhappy i was afraid so and i was very sorry for you i answered kissing her must i not ask anything hatty you can ask what you like she replied i think cary that christ was knocking at my door and i did not want to open it and i could not be happy while i knew that i was keeping him outside and at lastit was last night in the sermonhe spoke to me as it were through that closed door and i could not bear it any longeri had to rise and open it and let him in and before that with him i kept everybody out and now i feel as if with him i wanted to take everybody in dear hatty she seems so changed and so happy and i am so thankful but my prospect looks very dark it ought not to do so for i let him in before hatty did and i suppose some day it will be clearer and i shall have nobody but him and shall be satisfied with it th you thought you knew a great deal of what was going to happen did you not cary courtenay such a wise girl you were and how little you did know this evening esther langridge came in and stayed to supper she said ephraim had gone to the parsonage on business and had promised to call for her on his way home he came rather later than esther expected we have only seen him twice since we returned from london except just meeting at church and so forth he seemed to be always busy he said he had had to see mr liversedge and had been detained later than he thought he sat and talked to all of us for a while but i thought his mind seemed somewhere else i guessed where and thought i found myself right whet after a time when father had come in and ambrose with him and they were all talking over the fire ephraim left them and coming across to my corner asked me first thing if i had heard anything from annas i have not had a line from her nor heard anything of her and he looked disappointed when i said so he was silent for a minute and then he said cary what do you think i have been making up my mind to do i do not know ephraim said i i did not see how that could have to do with annas for i believed he had made up his mind on that subject long ago would you be very much surprised if i told you that i mean to take holy orders ephraim i was very very much surprised how would annas like it yes i thought you would be said he it is no new idea to me but i had to get my fathers consent and smooth away two or three difficulties before i thought it well to mention it to any one but the vicar he will give me a title i am to be ordained cary next trinity sunday why that is almost here cried i yes it is almost here he replied with that faraway look in his eyes which i had seen now and then then annas had been satisfied for of course she was one of the difficulties which had to be smoothed away i shall hope to see more of my friends now he went on with a smile i know i have seemed rather a hermit of late while this matter has been trembling in the balance i hope the old friend will not be further off because he is the curate i should not like that i do not think you need fear said i trying to speak lightly but how far my heart went down the future master of the fells farm was a fixture at brocklebank but the future parson of some parish might be carried a hundred miles away from us a few months and we might see him no more just then father set his foot on one of the great logs and it blazed and crackled sending a shower of sparkles up the chimney and a ruddy glow all over the room but my fire was dying out and the sparkles were gone already perhaps it was as well that just at that moment a rather startling diversion occurred by the entrance of sam with a letter which he gave to flora heres ill tidings sir said sam to father miss floras letter was brought by ane horseman thats ridden fast and far the puir beasties a oer foam and himsels just wornout he brings news o a gran battle betwixt the prince and yon loon they ca cumberlandma certie but cumberlands no mickle beholden to emand the princes armys just smashed to bits and himsel a puir fugitive in the highlands ill luck tak emthough thats no just becoming to a christian man but theres times as a chiel disna stop to measure his words and cut em off even wi scissors twas at a place they ca culloden this last week gane and they say theres na mair chance for the prince the now than for last years christmas to come again father of course was extreme troubled by this news and went forth into the hall to speak with the horseman whom sam had served with a good supper ambrose followed and so did my aunt kezia for she said men knew nought about airing beds and it was as like as not bessy would take the blankets from the wrong chest if she were not after her hatty was not in the room and flora had carried off her letter which was from my uncle drummond so ephraim and i were left alone for somewhat to my surprise he made no motion to follow the rest cary he said in a low tone as he took the next chair i have had news also it was bad newsin a moment i knew that his tone said so i looked up fearfully i felt before i heard the terrible words that were coming duncan keith rests with god oh it was no wonder if i let my work drop and hid my face in my hands and wept as if my heart were breaking not for colonel keith he should never see evil any more for annas and for flora and for the stricken friends at monksburn and for my uncle drummond who loved him like another sonandyes let me confess it for cary courtenay who had just then so much to mourn over and must not mourn for it except with the outside pretence of something else did you care so much for him cary what meant that intense pain in ephraims voice did he fancyand what did it matter to him if he did i tried to wipe away my tears and speak did you care so little i said as well as i could utter think of annas and his parents andand ephraim we led him to his deathyou and i nay not so he answered you must not look at it in that light cary we did but our duty it is never well to measure duties by consequences yes of course i think of his parents and sister poor souls it will be hard for them to bear yet i almost think i would change with them rather than with angus when he comes to know cary somebody must write to miss keith and it ought to be either miss drummond or you i felt puzzled would he not break it best to her himself if all were settled betwixt them and it looked as if it were was he not the proper person to write you have not written to her i said why no he answered i scarce like to intrude myself on her she has not seen much of me you know besides i think a woman would know far better how to break such news men are apt to touch a wound roughly even when they wish to act as gently as possible no caryi am unwilling to place such a burden on you but i think it must be one of you could he speak of annas thus ifi felt bewildered unless he said thoughtfully looking out of the window where the moon was riding like a queen through the somewhat troubled sky unless you thinkfor you as a girl can judge better than ithat raymond would be the best breaker perhaps you do not know that raymond is not at home my lady inverness writ the news to him and said she had not spoken either to mrs raymond or miss keith she plainly shrank from doing it perhaps he would help her to bear it best how should he be the best i said mrs raymond might why cary is it possible you do not know that raymond and miss keith are trothplight trothplight mr raymond annas i started up in my astonishment here was a turning upside down of all my notions so that is news to you said ephraim evidently surprised himself why i thought you had known it long ago of course i must have puzzled you i see now i never heard a word about it i said feeling as though i must be dreaming and should awake byandby i always thought you always thought what i thought you cared for annas i forced my lips to say you thought i cared for miss keith ephraims tone was a stronger negative than any words could have been yes i cared for her as your friend and as a woman in trouble and a woman of fine character but if you fancied i wished to make her my wife you were never more mistaken no cary i fixed on somebody else for that a long while agobefore i ever saw miss keith may i tell you her name then we were right at first and it was fanny i said yes as well as i could cary i never loved and never shall love any one but you i cannot tell you little book either what i said or exactly what happened after that i only know that the moaning wind outside chanted a triumphal march and the dying embers on my hearthstone sprang up into a brilliant illumination and i did not care a straw for all the battles that ever were fought and envied neither annas keith nor anybody else well hatty i did not think you were going to be the old maid of the family said my aunt kezia i did not either once was hattys answer in a low tone but not a sad one perhaps i was the best one for it aunt at any rate you and father will always have one girl to care for you we did not see flora till the next morning i knew that my uncle drummonds letter must be that in which he answered the news of anguss escape and i did not wonder if it unnerved her she let me read it afterwards the laird and lady monksburn had plainly given up their son for ever when they heard what he had done and knowing what i knew i felt it was best so i had to tell flora my newsto see the light die suddenly out of her dear brown velvet eyeswill it ever come back again and i wondered watching her by the light of my own newborn happiness whether duncan keith were as little to her as i had supposed i knew somewhat later that i had misunderstood her that we had misinterpreted her her one wish seemed to be to get back home and father said he would take her himself as far as the border if my uncle drummond would come for her to the place chosen when the parting came as we took our last kiss i told her i prayed god bless her and that some day she might be as happy as i was there was a moments flash in the brown eyes take that wish back cary she said quietly happy as you are the woman whom duncan keith loved can never be until she meet him again at the gates of pearl that may be a long while dear it will be just so long as the lord hath need of me she answered and i hope for his sake that will be as long as my father needs me and thenoh but it will be a blithe day when the call comes to go home the fells farm september th five months since i writ a word and how much has happened in themso much that i could never find time to set it down and now i must do it just in a few lines i have been married six weeks father shook his head with a smile when ephraim first spoke to him and said his lass was only in the cradle yesterday but he soon came round it was as quiet a wedding as sophys and i am sure i liked it all the better whatever other people might think we are to live at the fells farm during the year of ephraims curacy and then father thinks he can easily get him a living through the interest of friends where it will be of course we cannot guess flora has writ thrice since she returned home she says my uncle drummond was very thankful to have her back again but she can see that lady monksburn is greatly changed and the laird has so failed that he scarce seems the same man of herself she said nothing but one sentence waiting dear caryalways waiting from angus we do not hear a word mr raymond and annas are to be married when their year of mourning is out i cannot imagine how they will get alonghe a whig clergyman and she a tory presbyterian however that is their affair i am rather thankful tis not mine my aunt dorothea has writ me one lettervery kind to meit was writ on the news of my marriage but very stiff toward my aunt kezia i see she cannot forgive her easily and i do not think grandmamma ever will grandmamma sent me a large chest from london full of handsome presentsa fine set of dresden tea china which travelled very well only one saucer broke a new hoop so wide round that methinks i shall never dare to wear it in the country a charming piece of dovecoloured damask and a petticoat to wear with it of blue quilted satin two calico gowns from india a beautiful worked scarf from the same country six pair pearlcoloured silk stockings a new fan painted with flowers most charmingly done a splendid piece of white and gold brocade and a superb set of turquoise and pearl jewellery i cannot think when or how i am to wear them they seem so unfit for the wife of a country curate oh wait till i am a bishop says ephraim laughingly then you can make the deans lady faint away for envy of all your smart things and as to the white and gold brocade keep it till the king comes to stay with us and it will be just the thing for a state bed for him i wonder what colour it will be said i which king ephraim makes me a low bowover the water bottle note i must lay down my pen for i hear a shocking smash in the kitchen that girl dolly is so careless i dont believe i shall ever have much time for writing now langbeck rectory under the cheviots august the th nearly a whole year since i writ one line our lot is settled now and we moved in here in may last i am very thankful that the lines have fallen to me still in my dear northi have not pleasant recollections of the south and i fancybut perhaps unjustlythat we northerners have a deeper more yearning love for our hills and dales than they have down there we are about midway between brocklebank and abbotscliff which is just where i would have chosen to be if i could have had the choice it is not often that god gives a man all the desires of his heart perhaps to a woman he gives it even less often how thankful i ought to be my aunt kezia was so good as to come with us to help me to settle down i should not have got things straight in twice the time if she had not been here sophy spent the days with father while my aunt kezia was here and just went back to the vicarage for the night father is very much delighted with sophys child and calls him a bouncing boy and a credit to the family and sophy thinks him the finest child that ever lived as my aunt kezia saith every mother hath done since eve the night before my aunt kezia went home as she and i sat togetherit was not yet time for ephraim to come in from his work in the parish for he is one of the few parsons who do work and do not pore over learned books or go ahunting and leave their parishes to take care of themselveswell as my aunt and i sat by the window she said something which rather astonished me cary i dont know what you and ephraim would say but i am beginning to think we made a mistake do you mean about the chinese screens aunt said i the gold lacquer would have gone very well with the damask but chinese screens saith my aunt with a hearty laugh why whatever is the girl thinking about no child i mean about the prince aunt kezia i cried you never mean to say we did wrong in fighting for our king wrong no child for we meant to do right i gather from scripture that the lord takes a deal more account of what a man means than of what he does thank god it is so for if a man means to come to christ he does come no matter how ay and if a man means to reject christ he does that too however fair and orthodox he may look in the eyes of the world therefore as to those matters that are in doubt and cannot be plainly judged by scripture but christian men may and do lawfully differ about them if a man honestly meant to do gods will so far as he knew it i dont believe he will be judged as if he had not cared to do it but what i intend to say is thisthat it is plain to me now that the lord hath repealed the decree whereby he gave england to the house of stuart there is no right against him cary he doeth as he will with all the kingdoms of the world maybe its not so plain to youif so dont you try to see through my eyes follow your own conscience until the lord teaches yourself if our fathers had been truer men and had passed the bill of exclusion in the troubles of would never have come nor those of neither they ate sour grapes and set our teeth on edgeay and their own too poor souls it was the bishops and lord halifax that did it and the bishops paid the wyte as sam says it must have been a bitter pill to those seven in the tower to think that all might have been prevented by lawful constitutional means and that theytheir order i meanhad just pulled their troubles on their own heads aunt kezia i cried in distress you never mean to say that colonel keith died for a wrongful cause god forbid she said gravely colonel keith did not die for that cause he died for right and righteousness for truth and honour for faithfulness for loyalty and loveno bad things to die for not for the princeonly for god and flora and a little perhaps for angus god forbid that i should judge any true and honourable manmost of all that man who gave his life for those we love only cary the cause is dead and gone the struggle is over for ever and we may thank god it is so on the wreck of the old england a new england may arisean england standing fast in the liberty wherewith christ hath made her free free from priestly yoke and priestridden rulers free not to revolt but to follow not to disobey but to obey if onlyah if only she resolve and stand to it never to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage never to forget the lessons which god has taught her never again to eat the sour grapes and set the childrens teeth on edge let her once begin to think of the tigers beauty and forget its deathly clawsonce lay aside her watchword of no peace with romeand she will find it means no peace with god for his scourge has always pursued her when she has truckled to his great enemy eh but men have short memories never name short sight like enough by a hundred years are over theyll be looking at roman sugarsticks as the scarlet woman holds them out and thinking that she is very fair and finespoken and why shouldnt they have a few sweets well it is well the government of the world isnt in old kezias hands for if it were some people would find themselves uncommonly uncomfortable before long you dont mean me i hope i said laughing nay child i dont mean you nor yet your husband very like youll not see it as i do but youll live to see itif only you live long enough well my aunt kezia may be right though i do not see it only that i do think it was a sad blunder to throw out the bill of exclusion it had passed the commons so they were not to blame but one thing i should like to set down for any who may read this book a hundred years hence if it hath not been tore up for wastepaper long ere thatthat we protestants who fought for the prince never fought nor meant to fight for popery we hated it every bit as much as any who stood against him we fought because the contrary seemed to us to be doing evil that good might come but i wont say we may not live to be thankful that we lost our cause it has been a warm afternoon and i sat with the window open in the parlour singing and sewing ephraim was out in the parish i was turning down a hem when a voice in the garden spoke to me ant like you madam to give a drink of whey to a poor soldier there was a slight scots accent with the words whence come you i said i fought at prestonpans he answered he looked a youngish man but very ragged and bemired on which side i said as i rose up of course i was not going to refuse him food and drink however that might be but i dare say i should have made it a little more dainty for one of prince charlies troops than for a hanoverian and i felt pretty sure he was the former from his accent i fancied i saw a twinkle in his eyes the side you are on madam said he how can you know which side i am on said i come round to the backdoor friend and i will find you a drink of whey i suppose said my beggar looking down at himself i dont look quite good enough for the front door but i am an officer for all that madam sir i beg your pardon i made answer i will let you in at the frontfor when he spoke more i heard the accent of a gentleman pray dont give yourself that trouble cousin cary and to my utter amazement the beggar jumped in at the window which was low and easily scaled angus i almost screamed at your service madam when did you leave france where are you come from have you been to abbotscliff are halt cant fight more than three men at once and i wont answer a question till i have had something to eat forgive me cary but i am very nearly starving i rushed into the kitchen and astonished caitlin by laying violent hands on a pan of broth which she was going to serve for supper i dont know what i said to her i hastily poured the broth into a basin and seizing a loaf of bread and a knife dashed back to angus eat that now angus you shall have something better byandby he ate like a man who was nearly starving as he had said when he had finished he said now i left france a fortnight since i have not been to abbotscliff i know nothing but the facts that you are married and where you live which i learned by accident and i instantly thought that your house if you would take me in would be a safer refuge than either brocklebank or abbotscliff now tell me some thing in turn are my father and flora well yes for anything i know and all at brocklebank quite and the keiths has annas bagged her pheasant what do you mean angus why is she mrs raymond i saw all that i suppose duncan got away without any difficulty annas is mr raymonds wife i said but angus i cannot think how it is buti am afraid you do not understand understand what is it possible you do not know what price was paid for your ransom angus rose hastily and laid his hand on my arm speak out cary what do i not know angus colonel keith bought your life with his own in all my life i never saw a mans face change as the face of angus drummond changed then it was plainly to be read there that he had never for a moment understood at what cost he had been purchased a low moan of intense sorrow broke from him and he hid his face upon the table i think he paid the price very willingly angus i said softly and he sent annas a last message for youhe bade you to the utmost of what your opportunities might be to be to god and man what he hoped to have been o duncan duncan came in anguish from the white lips and i never knewi never thought ah it was so like angus never to think he lifted his head at last with the light of a settled purpose shining in his eyes to man i can never be what he would have been i am a proscribed fugitive you harbour me at a risk even now but to god cary i have been a rebel but i never was a deserter from that service god helping me i will enlist now if my worthless life have cost the most precious life in scotland it shall not have been given in vain there was another who gave his life for you angus i could not help saying ay i have been bought twice over was the trembling answer god help me to live worthy of the cost we all keep the name of duncan keith in our inmost heartsunspoken but very dear but i think it is dearest of all in a little house in the outskirts of amsterdam where now that my uncle drummond has been called to his reward our flora keeps home bright for a protestant pastor who works all the day through in the prisons of amsterdam among the lowest of the vile who knows what exile and imprisonment are and who once in every year as the day of his substitutes death comes round pleads with these prisoners from words which are overwhelming to himselfye are not your own for ye are bought with a price many of those men and women sink back again into the mire but now and then the pastor knows that a soul has been granted to his pleadings that in one more instance as in his own case the price was not paid in vain
