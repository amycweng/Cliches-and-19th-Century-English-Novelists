it might have been by emily sarah holt this book is mainly about the treasonable plot to blow up parliament by mining through to its lowest floor or basement from an adjacent house this plot was hatched by a number of catholic gentlemen and was quite ingenious these people came from a wide area of england and numbered about thirty one point of interest to your reviewer is that one of the places where they met or retreated to when not personally involved in mining was a house called white webbs just on what is now the northern limit of london this house is now in use as a very nice and popular restaurant well known to me it was at the time a disused hunting lodge in enfield chase the discovery of the plot and the execution of its participants is celebrated every year in britain with great displays of fireworks on a day th november named after one of the plotters guy fawkes it is interesting to learn so much more about the background of this plot emily holt wrote a large number of books with a historical background this book is the third of a series involving a family from derwentwater in the north of england the link with the gunpowder plot is rather weak but worth reading if you enjoyed the first two books of the series on the other hand the majority of the book deals with the plot and is very well researched and told in a very plausible manner as usual with this author you will find that there are a good many footnotes which we have done our best to make available but not intrusive there is a great deal of conversation in elizabethan english but this will not bother you if you are used to reading the plays of shakespeare finally there are a few short extracts from contemporary letters in which the spelling would not pass muster these days but there were no real standards of spelling in those times in a very few cases in these letters we have adjusted the spelling to give you the reader greater ease in comprehending them you may care to make this book into an audiobook in which case it will take about hours to play we hope you will do this because it will make it much easier for you to enjoy the book it might have been by emily sarah holt preface there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death that is one of the main lessons to be learned from the strange story of the gunpowder plot the narrative here given so far as its historical portion is concerned is taken chiefly from original and contemporaneous documents it has been carefully kept to factsin themselves more interesting than any fictionand scarcely a speech or an incident has been admitted however small for which authority could not be adduced those of my readers who have made the acquaintance of lettice eden and joyce morrells harvest will meet some old friends in this tale chapter one the last night in the old home which speaks the truthfair hope or ghastly fear god knoweth and not i only oer both love holds her torch aloft and will until i die fiddlededee do give over snuffing and snivelling and sobbing and tell me if you want your warm petticoat in the saddlebag youd make a saint for to swear more sobs and one or two disjointed words were all that came in answer the sobbing sister who was the younger of the pair wore widows mourning and was seated in a rockingchair near the window of a small but very comfortable parlour her complexion was pale and sallow her person rather slightly formed and her whole appearance that of a frail weak little woman who required perpetual care and shielding the word require has two senses and it is here used in both she needed it and she exacted it the elder sister who stood at the parlour door was about as unlike the younger as could well be she was quite a head taller rosycheeked sturdilybuilt and very brisk in her motions disjointed though her sisters words were she took them up at once youll have your thrum hat did you say note wheres the good of crying over it youve got neer a thing to cry for another little rush of sobs replied amid which a quick ear could detect the words unfeeling and me a poor widow unfeeling marry said the elder sister im feeling a whole warm petticoat for you and tears wont ward off either cramp or rheumatism my deardont think it but a warm petticoat may will you have it or no oh as you please was the answer in a tone which might have suited arrangements for the speakers funeral then i please to put it in the saddlebag cheerily responded the elder lettice come with me maid i can find thee work above in the chamber a slight sound behind the screen at the farther end of the parlour which sheltered the widow from any draught proceeding from the window was followed by the appearance of a young girl not hitherto visible she was just eighteen years of age and resembled neither of the elder ladies being handsomer than either of them had ever been yet not sufficiently so to be termed beautiful a clear complexion rosy but not florid goldenbrown hair and plenty of it dark grey eyes shaded by dark lashes and a pleasing goodhumoured not selfconscious expressionthis was lettice who said in a clear musical voice yes aunt and stood ready for further orders as the door shut upon the aunt and niece the former said as if to the sister left behind in the parlour a poor widow ay forsooth poor soul that you are for you have made of your widowhood so black a pall that you cannot see gods blue sky through it dear heart but why ever they called her faith and me temperance ive wellnigh as little temperance as she has faith and neither of them would break a cats back by this time they were up in the bedchamber and lettice was kept busy folding pinning tying up and smoothing out one garment after another until at last her aunt said now lettice bring thine own gear such as thou wilt need till we light at minster lovel for there can we shift our baggage thy black beaver hat thou wert best to journey in for though it be good tis well worn and thy grey kirtle and red gown bring the blue gown and the tawny kirtle with the silver aglets tags spangles pendant and thy lawn rebatoes turnover collar and a couple of kerchiefs and thy satin hat thou wert best leave out a warm kerchief for the journey and my velvet hood aunt and the green kirtle nay i have packed them not to be fetched out till we reach london thou mayest have thy crimson sleeves withal an it list thee lettice fetched the things and her aunt packed them in one of the great leather trunks with beautiful neatness as she smoothed out the blue kirtle she askedlettice art thou sorry to be gone truly aunt i scarce know was the answer i am sorry to leave aunt milisent and my cousins and aunt francesbut aunt frances was an evident afterthoughtand i dare say i shall be sorry to leave all the places i know when the time comes but then so many of us are going you and grandmother and aunt edith and cousin aubrey and aunt faithand there are so many new places to see that on the whole i dont think i am very sorry no very like not child not now said a third voice softly and lettice looked up at another aunt whose presence she had not previously noticed this was certainly no sister of the two plain women whose acquaintance we have just made temperance murthwaite had outlived her small share of good looks and faiths had long since been washed away in tears but edith louvaine had been extremely beautiful and yet was so notwithstanding her forty years her hair was dark brown with a golden gleam when the sun caught it and her eyes a deep blue almost violet her voice was sweet and quietof that type of quietness which hides behind it a reserve of power and feeling at eighteen lettice we are not commonly sorry to leave home much sorrier at thirtyeight and at eighty i think there is little to leave but graves ay but theyre not all dug by the sexton remarked temperance patting the blue kirtle to make it lie in the hole she had left for it at any rate the sorest epitaphs are oft invisible save to them that have eyes to see them edith did not answer and the work went on at length suddenly the question was asked whence came you edith from mere lea whither i have been with mother and aubrey to say farewell and for why came you hither not to say farewell i reckon nay replied edith smiling i thought i might somewhat help you temperance we must all try to spare poor faith spare poor faith repeated temperance in a sarcastic tone tell you what edith louvaineif youd think a bit less of sparing her and shed think a bit more of sparing you it would be a sight better for poor faith and poor edith too i i dont want to be spared answered edith no you dont and thats just it and faith does and she oughtnt and you oughtnt nay temperance remember she is a widow small chance of my forgetting it doesnt she tell me so six dozen times a day ask faith to do any thing she loveth not and shes always a widow ive had my thoughts whether i could not be an orphan when im wanted to do something disagreeable what think you i think your bark is worse than your bite temperance said edith smiling im about weary of barking answered temperance laying smooth a piece of cobweb lawn i think ill bite one of these days deary me but there are widows of divers sorts if ever there were what paul calls a widow indeed it is my lady lettice and she doesnt make a screen of it as faith does against all the east winds that blow well well give me that pincase lettice and the black girdle yonder i lack somewhat to fill up this corner what hour must we be at selwick edith at five o the clock the horses are bidden very good youll bide to supper nay not without i can help you youll not help me without youll tell faith shes a snivelling lazybones and that youll not i know go and get your beautysleep and comfort lady lettice all you can when edith had departed and the packing was finished the aunt and niece went down to supper it consisted of polony sausages sweetmeats and an eggpiea lancashire dainty which rachel the cook occasionally sent up for she was a native of that county during the entire meal faith kept up a slow rain of lamentations for her widowhood the sad necessity of leaving her home and the entire absence of sympathy which she experienced in all around her till at last her sister inquired faith will you have any more pie no said faith with a sob having eaten nearly half of it nor any more sausage oh no she answered heaving a weary sigh nor sucketts sweetmeats subsequently spelt succadet neither faith shook her head dolefully then ill help you to a little of one other thing which you need sorely and thats a bit of advice faith moaned behind her handkerchief as to quitting home thats your own choice so dont go and pretend to fret over it and as to sparing you youve been spared a deal too much and ive been a fool to do it and just bethink you faith that if we are now to make one family with my lady lettice and edith youd best be thinking how you can spare them my lady lettice is a deal newer widow than you and shes over seventy years on her back and youve but forty thirtynine corrected faith in a choked voice and shes leaving her home not from choice but because she has no choice and she has spent over fifty years in it and is like an old oak which can ill bear uprooting i only trust those newcastle louvaines will get what they deserve i say its a burning shame never to come forward nor claim aught for fifty years until sir aubrey and both his sons were gone and then down they pounce like vultures on the widow and her orphan grandson and set up a claim forsooth to the estateafter all these years i dont believe they have any rightor at any rate theyve no business to have it and if my lady lettice had been of my mind shed have had a fight for it instead of giving in to them and if aubrey banaster had had a scrap of gumption hed have seen to it he is the eldest man of the family and theyre pretty nigh all lads but him howbeit let that pass only i want you faith to think of it and not go treating my lady lettice to a dish of tears every meal she sits down to or shell be sorry youre her daughterinlaw if she isnt now and if her name were temperance murthwaite its much if she wouldnt be oh you can say what you likeyou always do beg your pardon faith i very generally dont you havent a bit of feeling for a poor widow i hope you may never be a widow thank you ill have a care of that now lettice jump up maid and don your hat and mantle and i will run down with you to selwick while theres a bit of light my lady lettice thought youd best be there tonight so you could be up early and of some use to your aunt edith it was not temperance murthwaites custom to let the grass grow under her feet and the three miles which lay between the little house at keswick and selwick hall were put behind her and lettice when another hour was over selwick hall stood on the bank of derwentwater and was the residence of lettices grandmother the widowed lady louvaine her daughter edith her grandson aubrey and hans floriszoon the orphan nephew of an old friend mynheer stuyvesant who had been adopted into the family when a little child it was also theoretically the abode of lettices aunt faith who was aubreys mother and who practically flitted from the one house to the other at her rather capricious will it had become her habit to depart to keswick whenever her feelings were outraged at selwick and as faiths feelings were of that order which any thing might outrage and nobody knew of it till they were outraged her abode during the last six years had been mainly with the sister who never petted her but from whom she would stand ten times more than from the tenderer hearts at selwick lettices hand was on the door when it opened and there stood her cousin aubrey good even aunt temperance said he you are right in time for supper thank you master aubrey latehours replied she tis a bit too late for my supper and lettices likewise without she can eat two of a night how is it with my lady lettice i hope lad you help and comfort her all you can aubrey looked rather astonished comfort her he said shes all right how old are you aubrey why aunt temperance you know i was twenty last month one makes blunders betimes lad that speech of thine sounded about ten what mean you aunt temperance nay lad if god have not given thee eyes and brains i shall be illset to do itrun in lettice no im not comingnot while tomorrow morning remember to be up early and help all you canboth of you good even temperance shut the door and they heard her quick foot tread sharply down the gravel walk i say tis jolly moving house isnt it said aubrey i cant think why aunt temperance supposes that grandmother or any body should want comforting well we are young and she is old replied lettice i suppose old folks care more about those things perhaps oh tis but because they are lazy and have the rheumatism said aubrey laughing beside grandmother cares not about things like mother mothers for ever fretting but grandmothers always cheery the cousins left the deep whitewashed porch and the oakpanelled hall and went forward into the chief sittingroom of the house known as the great parlour the word withdrawingroom was still restricted to palaces and palatial mansions and had not descended so low as to a country gentlemans house like selwick hall the great parlour was a large room with a floor of polished oak hung with tapestry in which the prevailing colour was red and the chairs held cushions of red velvet on the tiled hearth a comfortable fire burned softly away and in a large chair of dark carved wood beside it propped up with cushions of red velvet sat an old lady of seventysix looking the very picture of comfort and sweetness and though her golden hairs time had to silver turned and she was now a widow indeed and desolate some of my readers may recognise their old friend lettice eden her eyes though a little sunken kept their clear blue and her complexion was still fair and peachlike with a soft faint rosecolour like a painting on china she had a loving smile for every one and a gentle soothing voice which the children said half cured the little troubles wherein they always ran to grandmother aunt faith was usually too deep in her own troubles and aunt edith though always kind was also invariably busy while there was considerable hesitation in making an appeal to aunt temperance who might answer it with a box on the ear instead of a comforting kiss or at best had an awkward way of turning the tables on the plaintiff by making him out to be the offender instead of the defendant but nobody ever hesitated to appeal to grandmother whose very rebukes fell as softly as roseleaves and were always so justly deserved that they had twice the effect of those which came from perpetual faultfinders aubrey had grown up in this atmosphere but it was much newer to his cousin lettice the daughter of dudley murthwaite and helen louvaine until she was twelve years old lettice had dwelt with her father at skiddaw force her aunt temperance having supplied the place of the dead mother who had faded from her childs memory for helen passed away when her daughter was only two years old it had not been exactly dudleys choice which had placed temperance in that position he would have preferred his wifes youngest sister edith to fill the vacant place of mother to his little girl but edith firmly though kindly declined to make her home away from selwick hall the natural explanation of course was that she being the only unmarried daughter of the house preferred to remain with her parents edith said so and all her friends repeated it and thought it very natural and proper and no one knew except god and edith that the reason given was only half the truth and that the last place in this world which edith louvaine could take was the place of that dead sister helen who had so unconsciously taken the one thing which edith coveted for herself thus thrown back on one of his own sisters dudley tried next to persuade faith to make her home with him it might have been better for faith if she had done so but she liked the more luxurious life of selwick hall where she had only to represent herself as tired or poorly to have any exertion taken for her by some one else and she was one of those unconscious impostors who begin by imposing on themselves whatever she wished to do she was always capable of persuading herself that she ought to do faith therefore declined to remove to her brothers house the last resource was temperance who when appealed to averred herself perfectly ready to go wherever she was most wanted one baggagehorse would be enough for her luggage she thanked goodness she had two gowns for winter and two for summer and no reasonable woman ought to have any more as to ruffs and puffs cuffs and muffs she troubled herself with none of those ridiculous vanities a plain laced bodice and skirt were good enough to work in and a pair of stout shoes to keep her out of the mire with a hat and kerchief for outdoor wear and a warm cloak for cold weather her miscellaneous possessions were limited to a big workbasket two silver spoons and a goblet and three booksnamely a copy of the four gospels a prayerbook and luther on the lords prayer packing and unpacking were small matters in these circumstances and temperances change of residence was the affair of an afternoon six years afterwards her brother dudley died and temperance taking into consideration the facts that skiddaw force was a very lonely place having no house within some miles save a few isolated cottages of charcoalburners and shepherds that a small house at keswick belonged to lettice and that the childs grandparents on the mothers side were desirous to have her near them let the house at skiddaw force and came to live at keswick the family at selwick hall had once been much larger than now all were gone but these fewmilisent to another home anstace walter and helen lay in the churchyard and ned the father of young aubrey under the waves of the north atlantic and then mynheer stuyvesant the old dutch gentleman who had been driven from his own land for the faiths sake and having been the boys tutor had stayed for love after necessity was over took his last journey to the better country and dear honest simple cousin bess wolvercot friend and helper of all went to receive her reward with nothing to leave but a wornout frame and a name without a stain nothing to leave but an empty place that nothing could fill again and after that lady lettice felt herself growing old the evening shadows crept further and her right hand in household affairs was gone but with the constant love and aid of edith she held on her way until the sorest blow of all fell on her and the husband who had been ever counsellor and comforter and stay left her side for the continuing city since then lettice louvaine had been simply waiting for the day when she should join him again and in the interim trying through growing infirmities to do the next thingremembering the words uttered so long ago by his beloved cousin anstace that some day the next step would be the last step when sir aubrey louvaine died at the age of seventynine two years before the story opens aubrey his grandson and namesake became the owner of selwick hall but being under age every thing was left in the hands of his grandmother the pang of lady louvaines bereavement was still fresh when another blow fell on her her husband had inherited selwick from a distant cousin known in the neighbourhood as the old squire the old squires two sons nicholas and hugh had predeceased him sir aubrey had taken peaceable possession of the estate and no one ever doubted his title for fifty years himself least of all three months after his death lady louvaine was astounded to receive a lawyers letter claiming the selwick lands on behalf of one oswald louvaine of newcastle a young man who asserted himself to be the grandson of the longdeceased hugh his documentary proofs were all in order his witnesses were numerous and positive and lady louvaine possessed no counterproof of any kind to rebut this unheardof claim after a vain search among her husbands papers and a consultation with such of her friends and relatives as she judged suitable she decided not to carry the matter into a court of law but to yield peaceable possession to young oswald on consideration of his giving her a writ of immunity from paying back dues of any kind which indeed it would have been quite out of her power to discharge sir aubreys income was comfortably sufficient for the family wants but there was little to spare when both ends had met mr oswald accepted the terms as an immense favour on his part and at the age of seventysix lady louvaine was deprived of the home wherein she had dwelt for fiftysix years and summoned like abraham to go forth into the land which god would show her where to go was the next question her daughter milisent with her husband robert lewthwaite would gladly have received her and implored her to come to them but nine children a full house and a small income barred the way in that direction no offer of a home came from red banks where the children of her eldest daughter anstace lived and where the income was twice as large as at mere lea while the family did not amount to half the number temperance murthwaite trudged up to selwick to offer the tiny house which was part of lettices little patrimony actually proposing herself to go to service and leave lettice in her grandmothers care this faith regarded as a cruel injury and lady louvaine would not hear of it from her daughterinlaw mrs walter louvaine at kendal came a sweetlyperfumed and sweetlyworded letter wherein the writer offered a thousand apologies and a dozen excuses for not receiving her dear and revered mother her grief in having so to write she assured them was incalculable and inconsolable she begged that it might be taken into consideration that diana was shortly to be married and would require a trousseauwhich she did not add comprised a pound of gold lace and six pairs of silk stockings at two guineas the pair that montague being in a noblemans household was an appalling expense to her that the younger boys were growing up and would require situations found for them while jane and frances would some day need portioning all which facts were so many heavy burdensand had not the apostle said that he who neglected to provide for his own was worse than an infidel lady louvaine received this letter with a slight sigh a gentle smile and poor frances but the usually calm sunny temper of edith was not proof against it she tore the letter in two and flung the fragments into the fire edith my dear daughter ejaculated her astonished mother mother i cant stand it was the response i must either do this or something worse and to drag in the apostle paul as a prop for such hypocill just go and churn and perhaps i can talk like a christian when i come back such things as these did not move lady louvaine but there were two things which did move her even to tears the first was when hans brought her a little box in which lay five silver pieces entreating her to accept them such as they wereand she found after close crossexamination that part of the money was the boys savings to buy cherished books and part the result of the sale of his solitary valuable possession a pair of silver buckles the other took place when notice was given to all the servants each received his or her wages and a little token of remembrance with bow or courtesy and an expression of regret on leaving so kind a mistress mingled with good wishes for her future welfare all but one that one was charity the underhousemaid from pendle charity rolled up her arms in her apron and said curtlynay but charity i owe you this responded her mistress in some surprise if youre bound to reckon up my lady betwixt you and me there mun be somewhat set down o tother side o th book announced charity sturdily yo mun mind you at yo took me baat without a commendation because nobry nobody d have me at after mistress watson charged me wi stealing her lace fall at she found at after amongst her kerchiefs thats a hundred pound to th good and yo nursed me through th feverthats another and yo held me back fro wedding wi yon wastrel scoundrel nym thistlethwaite till id seen a bit better what manner of lad he were and so saved me fro being a poor bruised heartbroke thing like their margery is now at

would you please to tell me when you look to be i london town and where youll light first my good charity they named thee not ill answered lady louvaine i trust to be in london the end of marchnigh on lady day and i light at the white bear in the kings street westminster pray you madam how many miles is it hence tis about two hundred miles charity for a moment charity was silent then she said ant like you madam id fain go the first o march lady louvaine was a little surprised for she had given her servants a months notice which would expire on the fifteenth of march however if charity preferred to be paid in time instead of money that was her own affair she assented and charity dropping another courtesy left the room lady louvaines house in london had been obtained through the earl of oxford a distant cousin of her husband in whose household her son walter had long before taken unwholesome lessons in fashion and extravagance the earl now in his grand climacteric had outlived his youthful frivolity and though he had become a hard and austere man was yet willing to do a kindness to his kinsmans widow by engaging a house for her and offering for her grandson a squires place which happened to be vacant in his household she would have preferred some less showy and more solid means of livelihood for aubrey whose character was yet unfixed and whose disposition was lighter than she liked to see it but no other offered and she accepted this a few days before the time for departure up trudged temperance murthwaite again madam said she im something feared im as welcome as water into a ship for i dare guess youve enough to do with the hours but truth to tell im driven to it heres faith set to go after you to london poor child let her come i can get as far as poor madam but i can go no further with you answered temperance grimly somebodys poor enough i cast no doubt but i dont think its faith but you have not yet beheld all your calamities if faith goes i must go tooand if i go and she then must lettice dear temperance i shall be verily glad lady lettice youre too good for this worldand there arent ten folks in it to whom i ever said that howbeit you shall not lose by me for i purpose to take rachel withal and she and i can do the housework betwixt us and so set edith free to wait on you were you thinking to carry servants or find them there i thought to find one there more than one methinks we can scarce afford well then for that shall rachel serve and ill work the cost of my keep and more you shall see i can spin with the best and weave too youll never come short of linen nor linsey while im with youand lettice can run about and save steps to us all what think yousaid i well very well indeed my dear i were fain to have you then youll look for us goodmorrow the last evening was a busy one for all parties and there was little time to spare for indulgence in remembrance or regret it was two hours later than usual when lettice at last lay down to sleep and even then sleep seemed long in coming she heard her aunt ediths soft movements in the neighbouring gallery where she was putting final touches to the packing and presently they slid unconsciously into the sound of the waterfall at skiddaw force by the side of which lettice was climbing up to the tower of london she knew nothing of the tender cheerful goodnight mother dear given to lady louvaineof the long pathetic gaze at the moonlit landscapeof the silentlysobbed prayer and the passionate rain of tearssuch different tears from those of faithwhich left a wet stain upon ediths coverlet it was hard to leave the old homehard to leave the new graves but the next thing the young niece heard was onlytime to rise lettice spoken in the usual bright mannerand looking up she saw aunt edith fully dressed lettice sprang up in a fright and scrambled into her clothes with all the haste possible she who was to have helped aunt edith to be fast asleep in bed when she was ready it was not many minutes before lettice was dressed but her morning prayer had in it sundry things which were not prayers breakfast was nearly over when a curious rolling sound was heard followed by the tramp of horses and aubrey jumped up to look for it was halfanhour too soon for the baggagehorses to be brought he had to run into the porchchamber to see what it was and before he returned came old roger the servingman with a letter in his hand which he gave to his mistress she opened the letter but finding it somewhat difficult for dim eyes to make out she gave it back to roger desiring him to read it note so roger read madamsince i need be in london this next weekend where i look to tarry some time and am offered a seat in my good lord of northumberlands caroche it were pity that my caroche should go thither empty in especial when so good and old a friend is likewise on her journey may i therefore beg that your ladyship will so far favour me as to use the caroche as your own from this day until friday week when if it serve your convenience it may return to me at radcliffe house my servants have orders to obey your ladyships directions and to serve you in all regards as myself i kiss the hands of fair mistress edith and beg my best compliments to your young gentlemen and am madam yours to my little power dilston aubrey had come back whilst roger was reading and scarcely gave him leave to make an end of the letter madam tis my lord dilstons caroche with six great flanders horses and three servingmen all as fine as fiddlers and never a soul in the caroche truly this is of the lords goodness said lady louvaine i did indeed fear the journey on horseback but there seemed none other means the like did i for you dear mother added edith i am most thankful for my lord dilstons kindly proffer it shall ease the journey to you more than all we could do lady louvaine bade edith write an answer and ordered roger to take back to mere lea the three saddlehorses lent her by mr lewthwaite explaining why they were no longer needed it was then settled that the four ladies and lettice should travel in the coach aubrey hans and rachel going on horseback hans had gone out and they saw him talking in the front with lord dilstons postillion now he came back well hans what wormed you out of the postillion inquired aubrey his masters goodness said hans have you a bit left for me or do you want it all for yourself it is all for my lady my lord dilston was meaning to have gone to town himself in his own caroche till he heard of your ladyships trouble and then he cast about to know of some friend that was going so he might leave it for you then he heard of my lord of northumberland and he begged a seat in his caroche and madam penelope stuffed the caroche with all the cushions that were in the house and a hamper of baked meats and wine and a great fur mantle to lap your ladyship in and my lord bade the postillion to drive very soft that you should not be shaken without you told him to go fast and the footmen were to have a care of you and save you all that they could said i not well his goodness truly hans you did so answered edith and right thankful should we all be first to the lord and then to my lord dilston that my dear mother can now journey in safety and comfort lady louvaine said softly bless the lord and may he bless this kind friend truly i marvel wherefore it is that every one is so good to me it must be surely for my dead aubreys sake oh of course said young aubrey laughing they all hate you madam you may be sure his grandmother smiled on him for she understood him now came the murthwaite sisters trudging up the path temperance carrying a heavy basket and faith bearing no greater weight than her handkerchief behind which as usual she was weeping goodmorrow madam said aunt temperance as she came in a fine day for our journey youre to ride in a caroche aunt temperance cried aubrey whome no i thank you my young master i never set foot in such a thing in my life nor never will by my good will i like the feel of a horse under me well enough but that finicky gingerbread thing all oer gildingid as soon go on a broomstick whose is it tis my lord dilstons that hath most kindly proffered it to mother for the journey replied edith we had settled that we four with lettice should journey therein but if you would rather be on horseback temperance that would i by ten mile said she i hate being cooped up in a fourpost bed with all the curtains drawn and that lumbering things no better faithll go i dont doubt any thing thats

temperance my dear taking your place madam instead of my own here am i deciding what lettice shall do or not do when you being in presence it belongs to you to judge lady louvaine gave her gentle smile nay if we must stand upon our rights you temperance as her fathers sister have the right to choose then i choose to obey you lady lettice said temperance with a courtesy madam now announced hans from the door the baggage is packed and the caroche awaiteth your ladyship edith helped her mother to rise from her chair she stood one moment her hand on ediths arm and a look came into her eyes such as a drowning man might give to the white cliffs whereon his home stood where his wife and his little children were waiting for him so she stood and looked slowly round the chamber her eyes travelling from one thing to another till she had gone all over it and then she said in a low pathetic voice get thee out of thy country and from thy fathers house unto the land that i will show thee once before i had that call and it led me to him who was the stay and blessing of my life yet again i go forth o my father let it lead to thee unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle remember thy word unto thy servant wherein thou hast caused me to hopecertainly i will be with theei will not fail thee nor forsake theefear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine lord keep thine ownnow my children let us go hence with god in something like a procession they went forth from selwick hall lady louvaine first leaning on edith and hans to whom aubrey was always ready to resign troublesome duties then faith temperance aubrey and lettice at the door stood the great coach painted in dark mulberrycolour and picked out with gilding the lining and cushions of blue and harnessed to it were the six great horses dark roan with creamcoloured manes knotted likewise in blue the servants wore mulberrycoloured livery corded with blue lady louvaine took her place on the right hand of the coach facing the horses faith being at her side opposite sat edith and lettice by the door aunt temperance called out aubrey from the doorstep you shall have my horse if you will i am going in the caroche you are what sirrah demanded aunt temperance with the severity of at least one lord chiefjustice i shall ride in the caroche repeated aubrey calmly northumberland cumberland westmoreland and durham was the awful answer the young people knew what that meant when temperance said dear heart she was just a little surprised or put out when it was lancaster and derby she was very much astonished or provoked but when she supplicated the help of northumberland cumberland westmoreland and durham it meant from aunt temperance what swearing would from any one else i should like to know if you please mr aubrey louvaine whether you are a king a sick woman or a baby well aunt i dont think i am any of them at present then you have no business to ride in a caroche till you are i never heard of such a thing in my life a man to ride in a caroche we shall have them hemming handkerchiefs tomorrow you wont have me said aubrey i wont have you in there retorted temperance bluntly without my lady lettice call you in and that she wont will you madam certainly not my dear after your decision she replied indeed i do think it too effeminate for men persons of high honour except or them that are sick and infirm that rascals not sick any more than hes a person of honourthee bestride thy horse ladwithout thou canst find an ass which would suit with thee betternow hans come and help me to mount when all were mounted the six great horses tugged and strained at the big coach and with a good push from the four farmservants it moved forwards at first slowly then faster the farmservants stood bareheaded to see the family depart crying god bless you my lady and bring you home in peace faith sank back sobbing into the corner and there were tears in ediths eyes which she would not let fall farewell said lady louvaine leaning forward farewell my good kind old friendsthomas william isaac and gideoni wish you gods blessing and a better head than i nay nay thatll neer be nor couldnt no wise cried old gideon and the rest all echoed his nay nay farewell said his mistress again somewhat faintly as she sank back into the corner friends god will bless me and he shall bring me home in peace note the thrum is the fringed end of a weavers web a thrum hat was made of very coarse tufted woollen cloth note this was quite a common occurrence at that time when menservants were usually better educated and ladies and gentlemen much less so than now chapter two the journey to london and yet i do remember some dim sense of vague presentiment swept oer me as beyond the gates we turned to make the long descent at the bridgeend as they came up were milisent and her husband with seven of their nine childreneven little fortune but five years old whom milisent lifted into the coach and set on her aunt ediths knee saying she should say all her life that she had sat in my lord dilstons earache then milisent came in herself and sat down for a moment between her mother and faith whilst her husband talked with aubrey and all the children crowded about hans always a favourite with children after a few minutes conversation robert came up to the coachdoor withtime to go milly we must not tarry mother on her journey for she is like to be weary enough ere she come to its end then milisent broke down and threw her arms around her mother and criedo mother mother how shall i do without you must i never see you again my milisent said lady louvaine i shall not carry god from thee and thou wilt surely see me again sweet heart where we shall part no more for ever for a few minutes milisent wept as if her heart would break then she wiped her eyes and kissed them all round only breaking down a little again when she came to her sister edith o edith darling sister i never loved thee half well enough edith was calm now send me the other half in thy letters milly she replied and i will return it to thee ay we can write betimes said milisent looking a little comforted then to her niecenow lettice i look to thee for all the news the first day of every month shall we begin to look out for a letter at mere lea and if my sister cannot write then must thou have a care so i will aunt said lettice milisent alighted with a rather brighter lookshe was not wont to look any thing but brightrobert took his leave and then came all the cousins pouring in to say goodbye so the farewells were spoken and they went on their journey but as far as they could see until hidden by the hill round which they drove milisents handkerchief was waving after them lady louvaine bore the journey better than her daughters had feared and our friends deemed themselves very happy that during the whole of it they were not once overturned and only four times stuck in the mud at the end of the fourth day which was friday they came up to the door of the hill house at minster lovel and as they lumbered round the sweep with their six horses edith cried joyouslyoh theres old rebecca to edith louvaine a visit to the hill house was in a sense coming home for its owner her fathers cousin joyce morrell had been to her almost a second mother when people paid distant visits in the sixteenth century it was not for a weeks stay but for half a year or at least a quarter during many years it had been the custom that visits of this length should be exchanged between selwick hall and the hill house at minster lovel alternately at the close of every two years but edith who was aunt joyces special favourite had paid now and then a visit betweentimes and when as years and infirmities increased the meetings were obliged to cease for the elders ediths yearly stay of three or four months with the old and lonely cousin had become an institution instead of them her feeling therefore was much like that of a daughter of the house introducing her relatives to her own home for lady louvaine was the only other of the party to whom the hill house had been familiar in old times its owner the once active and energetic old lady now confined to her couch by partial paralysis had been called aunt joyce by the louvaines of the second generation ever since their remembrance lasted to the younger ones however she was a stranger and they watched with curious eyes their aunt ediths affectionate greeting of the old servant rebecca who had guarded and amused her as a baby and loved her as a girl rebecca on her part was equally glad to see her run you in mrs edith my dear said she youll find the mistress in the credence chamber eh she has wearied for yougood evening madam and im fain to see your ladyship again would you please to allow of my help in lighting while rebecca and hans assisted her mother to descend edith ran into the house with as light and fleet a step as if she were fourteen instead of forty and entered a large low chamber hung with dark leather hangings stamped in gold where a bright lamp burned on a little table and on a low couch beside it lay an old lady covered over with a fur coverlet she had a pleasant kindly old face with fresh rosecolour in her cheeks and snowwhite hair and her face lighted up when she saw edith like a candle set in a dark window edith ran to her and cast her arms about her and she said my edith mine own dear child as tenderly as if she had been her own mother lady louvaine followed her daughter leaning on hans and rebecca who took her up to the couch and set her down in a large chair furnished with soft cushions which stood close beside as if it were there on purpose she laid her hand upon joyces who fondled it in both hers then joyce gave a little laugh lettice dost thou wonder to hear me laugh asked she i seemed like as if i saw all at once that sunshine afternoon when thou earnest first over from the manor house sent of my lady norris to make friends with us dost remember and thou earnest tripping lightly down the stairs clad of a russet gown and leddest me up to see anstace do i remember it ah joyce my sister there be sore changes since that day be there so said joyce and smiled brightly enough a good number of miles nearer home lettice and a good number of treasures laid up for both of us where neither moth nor rust shall hurt them my treasures are all there which are not likewise thine and now let me see the new gems in thy jewelbox who art thou my maid i am lettice murthwaite madam if you please my dear heart i do not please to be called madam i am thine aunt joyce come here and kiss me if thou wilt lettice knelt down by the couch and kissed the old lady there is not much of nell here lettice said joyce to lady louvaine tis her father the child is like now then which of these two lads is aubreyhe with the thinking brow or he with the restless eyes lady louvaine called aubrey and he came up why thou art like nobody said aunt joyce neither ned nor faith nor any of neds elders lettice where is faith hast not brought her withal faith was in the hall listening to a lecture from temperance embellished by such elegancies as stuff and nonsense and listen to reason which ended up at last with lancaster and derby and faith came slowly in with her everlasting handkerchief at her eyes nay faith sweet heart no tears cried the old lady sure theres nought to weep for this even without thou art so dogweary that thou canst not keep them back mistress morrell i wish you good even said temperance coming in after her sister if youll but learn faith to keep that handkerchief of hers in her pocket youll have done the best work ever you did since we saw you last in derwentdale shes for ever and the day after afretting and apetting for why shed better tell you for im a dutchman if i can make out aunt joyce looked from one to the other so unfeeling came faiths set form from behind the handkerchief and me a poor widow the old ladys face went very grave and all the cheeriness passed out of it faith you are not the only widow in the chamber she said gently temperance my dear she is weary maybe she hasnt got a bit of call rejoined temperance sat all day long in my lord dilstons smart caroche lolling back in the corner just like a featherbed mistress joyce tis half illtemper and half follythats what it is well well my dear we need not judge our neighboursedith my child thou knowest the house as well as i wilt thou carry thy friends above rebecca hath made ready my ladys chamber for my ladywith a smile at her old friendand the fetterlock chamber for faith and temperance the old wardrobe is for thee and lettice and the lads shall lie in the nursery names to every room after this fashion were customary in old houses the party were to stay at minster lovel for four days from friday to tuesday and then to pursue their journey to london in the old wardrobe a pleasant bedchamber on the upper floor lettice washed off the dust of the journey and changed her clothes when the little trunk came up which held the necessaries for the night then she tried to find her way to the credence chamber andas was not very surprisinglost it coming out into a long picturegallery where she was at once struck and entranced by a picture that hung there it represented a young girl about her own age laid on a white couch and dressed in white but with such a face as she had never seen on any woman in this life it was as white as the garments with large dark eyes wherein it seemed to lettice as if her very soul had been melted a soul that had gone down into some dreadful deep and having come up safe was ever afterwards anxiously ready to help other souls out of trouble she would have thought the painter meant it for an angel but that angels are not wont to be invalids and lie on couches beside this picture hung another which reminded her of her grandfather louvaine but this was of a young man not much older than aubrey yet it had her grandfathers eyes which she had seen in none else save her aunt edith now lettice began to wonder where she was and how she should find her way and hearing footsteps she waited till they came up when she saw old rebecca why my dear heart what do you here said she kindly truly i know not the youthful visitor answered i set forth to go down the stairs and missed the right turning as i guess but pray you rebecca ere you set me in the way tell me of whom are these two pictures why said she can you not guess the one is of your own grandfather sir aubrey louvaine oh then it is grandfather when he was young but who is this rebecca it looks like an angel but angels are never sick and she seems to be lying sick there be angels not yet in heaven mistress lettice softly answered the old servant and if you were to live to the age of methuselah youd never see a portrait of one nearer the angels than this tis a picture that old squiremistress joyces fatherwould have taken nigh sixty years since of our angel our mistress anstace when she was none so many weeks off the golden gate they set forth with her in a litter for london town and what came back was her coffin and that picture was she like that asked lettice scarcely above her breath for she felt as if she could not speak aloud any more than in church she was and she was not said old rebecca them that knew her might be minded of her she was like nothing in this world but my dear heart i hear mrs edith calling for you here be the stairs and the credence chamber where supper is laid is the first door on your left after you reach the foot on the saturday evening as they sat round the fire in the credence chamber edith asked aunt joyce if old dr cox were still parson of minster lovel nay said she i would he were we have a new lord and new laws the which do commonly go together what manner of lord inquired edith and what make of laws said temperance bad the pair of them said the old lady why is he a gamester or drunkard asked lady louvaine or a dumb dog that cannot bark suggested temperance well id fain have him a bit dumber was aunt joyces answer at least i wish hed dance a bit less dance cried edith well said aunt joyce what else can you call it when a man measures his steps goes two steps up and bows then two steps down and bows then up again one step with a great courtesy and holds up his hands as if he were astonishedwhen theres nothing in the world to astonish him except his own foolish antics but where doth he this said lady louvaine here in the chamber or out of door dear heart in the church but for why prithee ask at him for i can neer tell thee did you neer ask him aunt said edith for sure did i and gat no answer that i could make aught of only some folly touching catholic practice and the like and master twinham said i i know not well what you would be at but i can tell you i lived through the days of queen mary and if that be what you mean by catholic practices they are practices we dont want back again well he mumbled somewhat about being true to the church and such like but if he be an honest man my shoes be made of shrewsbury sweet bread we tumbled all such practices out of the church above forty years gone and whats more well not stand to have them brought in again though there be some may try they will not bring any such folly in while the queen liveth i guess answered edith amen but the queen god bless her is seventy this year would you have her live for ever aunt joyce asked aubrey would she could she answered as to this fellow i know not what hell be at next he told me to my face that a papist was better than a puritan well mr twinham said i you may be a papist but i am a puritan and there i tarry till i find somewhat better why joyce said lady louvaine smiling thou wert not wont to call thyself a puritan in the old days when thou and bess wolvercot used to pick a crow betwixt you over dr meades surplice at keswick no i wasnt said she but i tell you lettice there be things human nature cannot bear a clean white surplice and christs gospel is one thing and a purple vestment and an other gospel is another and if im to swallow the purple vestment along with the white surplice ill have neither as to old bess dear blessed soul shes in her right place where she belongs and if i may creep in at a corner of heavens door and clean her golden sandals i shall be thankful enough the lord knows but mrs morrell sure you never mean to say that surplices be giving place to purple vestments down this road cried temperance in much horror children said the old lady very solemnly we two in gods mercy shall not live to see what is coming but very like you will and i tell you all is coming back which our fathers cast forth into the valley of hinnom and afore youtemperance faith and edithbe old women it will be set up in the court of the temple ay much if it creep not into the holy of holies ere those three young folks have a silver hair the devil is coming children hes safe to be first and in his train are the priests and the pope they are all coming and youll have to turn them out again as your grandfathers did and dont you fancy that shall be an easy task itll be the hardest whereto you ever set your shoulders god grant you win through it there are two dangers afore you and when i say that i mean not the torturechamber and the stake nay i am thinking of worser dangers than thosesnares wherein feet are more easily trapped a deal list to me for ere many years be over you will find that i speak truth the lesser danger is if the devil come to you in his black robes and offer to buy you with that which he guesseth to be your priceand that shall not be the same for all a golden necklace may tempt one and a place at court another and a barbary mare a third but worse far worse is the danger when the devil comes in his robes of light when he gilds his lie with a cover of outside truth when he quotes scripture for his purpose twisting it so subtilely that if the spirit of god give you not the answer you know not how to answer him remember all you young ones and aubrey in especial that no man can touch pitch and not be denied evil communications corrupt good manners and they corrupt them worst and quickest when you see not that they be evil if you think the scales be falling from your eyes make very sure that they are not growing on them and you can do that only by keeping very close to gods footstool and to gods word be sure of this whatsoever leads you away from that book leads you wrong i care not what it beking or pope priest or layman blind faith or blind reasonhe that neglects and sets aside the word of god for whatever cause and whatever thing he would put in his placechildren his ways incline unto hell and his paths unto the dead go not after him nor follow him mark my words and see twenty and yet more forty years hence if they come not true aubrey whispered to lettice what made her pick out me in especial trow im not about to handle no pitch but hans said with his gravest face i thank you madam and seemed to be thinking hard about something all the rest of the evening on the sunday morning all went to church except the two old ladies who could honestly plead infirmity when they came out lettice who was burning to speak her mind exclaimedsaw you ever a parson so use himself aubrey truly i know not how to specify itturning and twisting and bowing and casting up of his hands and eyesit wellnigh made me for to laugh like a merry andrew or a cheap jack laughed aubrey i thought his sermon stranger yet said hans nor could i see what it had to do with his text what was his text inquired heedless aubrey thou shalt love the lord thy god repeated hans ay and all he did the hour through cried lettice was to bid us obey the church and hear the church and not run astray after no novelties in religion and the church is not the lord our god neither is religion so far as i see i mind sir aubrey once saying added hans that when a bride talked ever of herself and nothing of her bridegroom it was a very ill augury of the state of her heart but saw you those two great candlesticks on the holy tablewhat for be they said lettice oh they be but ornaments of the church answered aubrey carelessly but we have none such in keswick church and what is the good of candlesticks without candles the candles will come quietly replied hans ah youre thinking of what the old gentlewoman said last night confess master sobersides said aubrey i have thought much on it answered hans who walked along carrying the ladies prayerbooks for the road being dirty they had enough to do in holding up their gowns and i think she hath the right hans i marvel how old thou wert when thou wert born said aubrey i think very like about as old as you were said hans well mr louvaine you are a complete young gentleman cried his aunt temperance looking back at him to suffer three elder gentlewomen to trudge in the mire and never so much as offer to hand one of them those were not good manners my master when i was a young maidbut seeing how things be changed now o days maybe that has gone along with them come hither at once thou vagrant and give thine hand to thy mother like a dutiful son as thou shouldest be and art not oh never mind me sighed faith i have given over expecting such a thing i am only a poor widow madam apologised hans very red in the face i do truly feel ashamed that i have no better done my duty and i entreat you not i was not faulting thee lad said temperance we have already laden thee with books and it were too much to look for thee to do thine own duty and other folks too its this lazy lad i want i dare be bound he loveth better to crack jests with his cousins than to be dutiful to his old mother and aunts temperance i am only thirtynine said faith in an injured voice i am the youngest of us three oh deary me i ask your pardon cried temperance with a queer set of her lips yes madam you are edith is an old woman of forty and i a decrepit creature of fortyfive but you are a giddy young thing of thirtynine ill try to mind it at least till your next birthday lettice laughed and aunt temperance did not look angry though she pulled a face at her edith smiled and said pleasantly come aubrey hand thy mother on my side i will walk with lettice and hans aunt edith said lettice pray you why be those candlesticks on the holy table with never a candle in them i cannot tell lettice replied she i fear if the parson dared there would be candles in them and belike will ere long think you aunt joyce is right in what she said last night i fear so lettice she answered very gravely we have not yet seen the last i doubt of satan and his roman legion the same afternoon lettice had a talk with old rebecca which almost frightened her she went up to the gallery for another look at the two pictures and rebecca passing by lettice begged that if she were not very busy she would tell her something about them in reply she heard a long story which increased her reverential love for the dead grandfather and made her think that cousin anstace must have been an angel indeed rebecca had lived in the hill house for sixty years and she well remembered her mistresss sister mind you queen marys days rebecca asked lettice eh sweet heart said the old servant they could neer be forgot by any that lived in them saw you any of the dreadful burnings ay did i mrs lettice said sheeven the head and chief of them all of my lords grace of canterbury i saw him hold forth his right hand in the flame that had signed his recantation and after all was over and the fire out i drew nigh with the crowd and beheld his heart entire uncharred amongst the ashes ah my mistress if once you saw such a sight as that you could never forget it your whole life thereafter it must have been dreadful rebecca said lettice well it was in one way she answered and yet in another it was right strengthening i never felt so strong in the faith as that hour and for some while after it was like as if heaven had been opened to me and i had a glimpse of the pearly portals and the golden street and the white waving wings of the angels as he went in saw you the bishops burned rebeccadr ridley and dr latimer i did not mrs lettice yet have i seen them both prisoners led through oxford streets dr ridley was a man with a look so grave that it was wellnigh severe but dr latimer could break a jest with any man and did yea with his very judges were you ever in any danger rebeccaor mrs morrell i never was mrs lettice but my good mistress was once wellnigh taken of the catchpoll constable you ask her to tell you the story how she came at him with the redhot poker and after that full quickly she packed her male and away to selwick to sir aubrey and her ladyship where she tarried hid until queen elizabeth came in think you there shall ever be such doings in england again the lord knoweth and old rebecca shook her white head theres not a bit of trust to be put in them snakes of priests and jesuits and such like not a bit let them get the upper hand again and we shall have the like times good lord deliver us from them all lettice went down intending to ask aunt joyce to tell her the story of the redhot poker but she never thought of it again so absorbed was she with what the two old ladies were saying as she came in they did not hear her enter and the first word she heard made her so desirous of more that she crept as softly as she could to a seat curiosity was her besetting sin she used not to be thus said lady louvaine truly i know not what hath thus sorrowfully changed the poor child but i would some means might be found to undo the same even for some years after neds death i mind not this change it came on right slowly and by degrees lettice felt pretty sure that she was aunt faith tis weakness i suppose said lady louvaine in a questioning tone ay we are all weak some whither replied aunt joyce and faiths weakness is a sort to show she is somewhat too ready to nurse her weaknesses and make pets of them tis bad enough for a woman to pet her own virtues but when she pets her vices tis a hard thing to better her but lettice there is a strong soul among youa rare soul in good sooth and there is one other of whose weakness and what are like to be its consequences i am far more in fear than of faiths nay who mean you asked lady louvaine in a perplexed voice i mean the two ladshans and aubrey hans is a good lad truly hans has more goodness in him than you have seen the end of by many a mile but aubrey you reckon not aubrey an ill one i hope by which you mean one that purposes ill oh no by no means he is a far commoner characterone that hath no purpose and so being doth more real ill than he that sets forth to do it of malicious intent are you assured you wrong not the lad joyce in so saying if i do you shall full shortly know it i trust it may be so but he seems to me to have a deal more of walter in him than ned and to be right the opposite of our aubrey in all main conditions ah sighed the widow in a very tender tone there can be no two of him then after a little pause and what sayest thou to letticemy little lettice the concealed listener pricked up both her ears aunt joyce gave a little laugh not so very unlike an other lettice that once i knew said she something less like to fall in the same trap methinks and rather more like to fall in an other now tell me what other i mean dear heart less conceit of her favour beauty and more of her wisdom a little overcurious and ready to meddle in matters that concern her not a good temper methinks and more patience than either of her aunts on the fathers side as to humilitywell we have none of us too much of that joyce wouldst thou like to have us leave lettice a while with thee she could wait on thee and read to thee and be like a daughter to thee i will if thou wouldst wish it nay that would i not lettice for the childs own sake it were far better for her to go with you there is an offer thou couldst make me of that fashion that my selfdenial were not equal to refuse so see thou make it not what now not hans trow edith o joyce ay dear heart i know nay fear not ill not take the last bud off the old tree but thyself saved lettice there is none left in all the world that i love as i love her perchance she will find it out one day joyce my dear sister hold thy peace lettice ill not have her save now and again on a visit and not that now thou shouldst miss her sorely in settling down in thy new home where shall it be in the kings street of westminster my good lord oxford hath made earnest with a gentleman a friend of his that hath there an estate to let us on long lease an house and garden he hath that now be standing empty ay that is a pleasant airy place nigh the fields at what rent twentyfour shillings the quarter houses be dearer there than up in holborn yet not so costly as in the city and it shall not be far for aubrey being during the day in the court with his lord lettice you shall need to pray for that boy what shall i ask for him joyce that he may both perceive and know what things he ought to do and also may have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same dont let him rule you he is very like to try it the only man in a family of womenfor he shall make little account of hans moriszoon though there is more sense in hanss little finger than in all aubreys brains if i can see into the future aubrey is not unlike to push you oer and hans to pick you up again have a care lettice you remember when walter was in court with my lord oxford o joyce lettice wondered what they meant for she had never heard of her uncle walter being with lord oxford she had never much liked uncle walter he was always rather stiff and stern and he used to come down sharply on niece or nephew if they did any thing wrong yet not like her grandfather murthwaite who was slow and solemn and seemed to mourn over their evil deeds but uncle walter was quick and sharp and he snapped at them they were under the impression that he never could have done a naughty thing in the whole course of his life because he always seemed so angry and astonished to see the children do so lettice therefore was curious to hear about uncle walter well said aunt joyce not exactly the same yet too like hell take the colour of his company like walter and he shall be evenly freehanded with his money lettice stared though there was nothing to stare at but aunt joyces big grey cat curled up in the windowseat uncle walter a spendthrift she could not even imagine it did she not remember her cousin janes surprise when her father gave her a shilling for a birthday present when lettice listened again aunt joyce was saying hes no standingground whatso be the fantasy of the moment after it he goes and never stays him to think what is like to come thereof far less what might come but that which causes me fear more for him than walter is the matter of friends walter was not one to run after folks he was frighted of lowering himself in the eyes of them he knew but methinks he ran not after them as aubrey doth hast ever watched a dog make friends of other dogs for aubrey hath right the dogs way after every dog he goes and gives a sniff at him and if the savour suit hes hail fellow well met with him the next minute beware that aubrey makes no friend he bringeth not home so far as you can and yet beware whom he bringeth for lettice sake tis hard matter good for the head is evil for the neck and shoulders to govern that lad shall ask no little wisdom and if thou have it not thou knowest where to ask i would his mother had more or that his father had lived well thats evil wishing god wist better than i but the lad ll be a sore care to thee and an heavy i fear so much indeed said lady louvaine and she sighed then edith came in and exclaimed what all in the dark and aunt joyce bade her call rebecca to bring light so the naughty lettice slipped out and in five minutes more came boldly in and no one knew what she had heard as they sat round the fire that evening aunt joyce asked suddenly tell me you three young folks what be your ambitions what desire you most of all things to be do or havelettice why aunt i can scarce tell said lettice for i never thought thereupon she should choose to be beautiful of course suggested aubrey all women do marry come up my young master cried his aunt temperance oh let him be temperance answered aunt joyce he knows a deal more about women than thou and i tis so much shorter a time since he was one temperance laughed merrily and aubrey looked disconcerted i think i care not much to be beautiful aunt nor rich said lettice only sufficient to be not uncomely nor tried of poverty but so far as i myself can tell what i do most desire is to know thingsall things that ever there be to know i would like that i think above all to know god and all good things were a very good and wise wish lettice was aunt joyces answer but to know evil things this was the very blunder that our mother eve made in eden prithee repeat it not now aubrey what is thy wish i would like to be a rich king said he were i a fairy queen aubrey i would not give thee thy wish for thou couldst scarce make a worser they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and they that seek power be little behind them godliness is great riches lad if a man be content with that he hath methinks aunt that is one of your favourite texts remarked edith ay said she it is enough is as good as a feast hans tis thy turn hans had sat gravely looking into the fire while the others talked now he looked up and answered madam i am ambitious more than a little i desire to do gods will and to be content therewith angels could win no further answered aunt joyce with much feeling in her voice ay lad thou hast flown at highest game of all why aunt said aubrey never heard i a meaner wish any man could do that prithee do it then replied aunt joyce and i for one shall be full fain to see thee no man ever yet fulfilled that wish added edith save only christ our lord lady louvaine sighed somewhat heavily and joyce asked what is it dear heart ah said she thy question joyce and the childrens answers send me back a weary way nigh sixty years gone to the time when i dwelt bowerwoman with my lady of surrey when one even the lady of richmond willed us all to tell our desires after this manner i mind not well all the answers but i know one would see a coronation and an other fair sights in strange lands and i being then young and very foolish wished for a set of diamond and my lady of richmond herself to be a queen but my aubreys wish was something like hanss for he said he desired to be an angel ah me nigh sixty years he hath his wish responded aunt joyce softly and methinks hans is like to have his also so far as mortal man may compass it there be some wishes children that fulfil themselves and aspirations after god be of that sort he meeteth them that remember him lettice i trust thou mayest have thy wish to a reasonable length so far as is good for thee and aubrey i can but desire the disappointment of thine for it were very evil for thee but thou hans floriszoon go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him it was hard work for those two old friends to part each knowing that it was almost certain they would never again meet until they clasped hands in the paradise of god when it came to the farewell lady louvaine knelt down though with difficultyfor joyce could not raise herself and the adopted sisters exchanged one long fervent embrace o joyce my friend my sister my one treasure left to me from long ago we shall never kiss again till lettice louvaines voice was lost in sobs maybe dear heartmaybe not neither thou nor i can know the purposes of god if so farewell till the golden cityand if thou win in afore me at the pearly portals give them all my true love and say i shall soon be at home farewell love there is none to call me lettice but thee left now nay sweet heart not so i have called thee by thy name there will be one left to call thee lettice until he summon thee by that familiar name to enter the holy city so they journeyed on towards london it was on the afternoon of the twentyfourth of march that they sighted the metropolis at last from the summit of notting hill they drove down the oxford road bounded on either side by green hedges with here and there a housethe busy oxford street of our dayturned down the hay market to charing cross and passed by essex gate and its companion portal the court gate through the court now known as whitehall emerging upon the kings street there was no parliament street in those days as they turned into king street it struck the elders of the party that there seemed to be an unusual stir of some kind the streets were more crowded than usual men stood in little knots to converse and the talk was manifestly of a serious kind lady louvaine bade edith look out and call aubrey whom she desired to inquire of some responsible person the meaning of this apparent commotion aubrey reined in his horse accordingly as he passed a gentleman in clerical attire which at that date implied a cassock bands and black stockings had aubrey known it the narrowness of the bands the tall hat the pointed shoes and the short garters also indicated that the clergyman in question was a puritan pray you sir is there news of import come inquired the youth or what means this ado the clergyman stopped suddenly and looked up at his questioner what means it he said sadly friend the great bell of pauls was rung this morrow i cry you mercy sir being a countryman i take not your meaning the great bell of pauls explained the stranger tolls never but for one thing and hath been silent for over forty years good lack not the plague i trust cried aubrey would it were no worse nay this means that we are sheep without a shepherdthat she who hath led us for threeandforty years who under god saved us from pope and spaniard can lead us no more for ever lad no worser news could come to englishmen than this queen elizabeth hath passed away so under the shadow of that dread sorrow and that perilous uncertain future they entered their new home chapter three how it first began o conspiracy shamst thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free oh then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage shakespeare the new home was the midmost of three contiguous houses standing on the western side of king street and nearly opposite to what is now the entrance to new palace yard they were a little larger and more pretentious than most of the houses in this street and a goodsized garden ran backwards from each towards saint jamess park as every house had then its name and a signboard to exhibit itnumbers being not yet applied to housesthese were no exception to the rule that one of the trio nearest to the abbey displayed a golden fish upon its signboard the middle one hung out a white bear while from the northernmost swung a panel representing an extremely stiff and angular creature apparently intended to suggest an angel the young people made merry over their sign aubrey insisting that hans was the white bear and lettice retorting that it was aubrey himself hans and aubrey sprang from their horses at the door and while the latter rang the bell the former busied himself in helping the ladies to alight whether any one would be inside the house was a problem requiring solution and they thought it worth while to ascertain this before going further in a moment quick steps were heard approaching and the door was opened by a woman who hardly showed herself behind it lady louvaine came in first leaning on hans good evening she said to the portress it was good of my lord oxford to providenay charity ay madam its me said the familiar voice of the old servant whom her mistress believed she had left behind in cumberland why old friend when earnest thou hither youd best sit you down afore you hear folks their catechisms said charity coolly leading the way to a pleasant parlour hung and upholstered in green where a fire was burning on the hearth and a large cushioned chair stood beside it

how it were and dropping a quick courtesy charity departed with too much alacrity for thanks lady louvaines eyes followed her the lines are fallen unto us in pleasant places quoted edith softly ay answered her mother and the pillar of the cloud hath gone before charity found rachel in the kitchen carrying a carpetbag and a great bundle and gazing round her with a bewildered air well lass whats taen thee was her greeting eh charity ashworth is that thee where art thou fro where are we both come to thats more to th purpose im banished my country thats all i know said rachel blankly im glad to see thee schuzheaw note dost thou mean to carry yon for th rest o thy life demanded charity laying hands on the carpetbag come wake up lass and look sharp for therell be some supper wanted a very expressive shake of rachels head was the response but she set down the bundle and began to unfasten her sleeves for work sleeves were not then stitched to the gown but merely hooked or buttoned in and were therefore easily laid aside when needful whats the price o eggs this road on asked she nought we n getten th hens to lay em down i th market theyre four a penny eggsfour a penny ejaculated the horrified cook aytheyre a bonnie price arent they ten to a dozen the penny at keswick chickens be twopence and threepence apiece rachel turned and faced her colleague with a solemn air charity

garden and two cows i th shippen and three black pigs i th stymistress joyce ordered emand two pairs o hands and two brains and two hearts and the grace o god and if thou wants aught more thoult have to ask him for it so now lets be sharp and see to th supper as they sat at breakfast the next morning which was lady day and sunday lady louvaine said i would fain know what manner of neighbours we shall have here whether pleasant or displeasant for some of our comfort shall hang thereon oh theres a capital fellow at the golden fish cried aubrey his name is tom rookwood and his sister dorothy is the prettiest girl i have seen this month i know nought of the angel ah said hans and shook his head i have seen the angel and is he angelic responded aubrey there be angels good and ill hans made answer madam i were best forewarn youtheres a tongue dwelleth there what manner of tongue hans said lady louvaine smiling one that goes like a beggars clapdish said he leastwise it did all the while i was in the garden this morning she greeted me oer the wall and would know who we were and every one of our names and what kin we were one to the other and whence we came and wherefore and how long we looked to tarryshe should have asked me what we had to our breakfast if i had not come in and how much toldest her inquired temperance not a word that i could help answered hans indeed that is the only comfort of herthat she asks questions so fast you can scarce slide in an answer she was free enough with her information as well told me her name and how many children she had and that she paid threeandfourpence the yard for her perpetuance gown and what is her name asked faith silence abbott said he she scarce answers to it seemingly replied temperance where made you acquaintance with your tom rookwood aubrey said his grandmother at the door said he his father is a gentleman of suffolk a younger son of rookwood of coldham hall he has three sistersi saw not the other two but i say that dorothys a beauty well replied temperance folks say as mute as a fish but it seems to me the golden fish is wellnigh as talkative as the angel mind thy ways aubrey and get not thyself into no tanglements with no dorothys it shall be time enough for thee to wed ten years hence and have a care that mr rookwood be himself an upright and godfearing man added his aunt edith oh hes all right answered aubrey letting dorothy go by he saith he can hit a swallow flying at eighty paces more shame for him cried edith what for should he hit a swallow he has promised to show me all sorts of things added aubrey have a care said lady louvaine that he lead thee not into the briars my boy and there leave thee the monday morning brought a visitormrs abbott from the angel after whose stay edith declared that a days hard work would have fatigued her less of the two inflictions this ladys freedom in asking questions without the remotest sense of delicacy was only to be paralleled by her readiness to impart information the party at the white bear knew before she went home that she had recently had her parlour newly hung with arras representing the twelve labours of hercules that she intended to have roast veal to supper that her worsted understockings had cost her fourandsixpence the pair that her husband was a very trying man and her eldest son the cleverest youth in westminster worsted stockings fourandsixpence cried temperance what a sinful price to pay and i declare if they ask not three shillings and fourpence for a quarter of veal why i mind the time when in keswick it was but sixteen pence truly if things wax higher in price than now they are it shall be an hard matter to live this very morrow was i asked a shilling for a calfs head of the butcher and eightpence for a lemon of the costardmonger whereat i promise you i fumed a bit but when it came to threepence apiece for chickenslancaster and derby it shall cost us here ever so much more to live it shall not said hans there be five acres of garden and save for foreign fruits and spices you shall ask little of the costardmonger shortly but who is to dig and dress it moaned faith aubrey cannot all the day with his lord even if he were not away o nights and charity shall have too much to do i have two hands madam answered hans and will very quickly have a spade in them and ere i do aught else will i set the garden agoing that rachel and charity can keep it in good order with a little overlooking from you me cried faith with a gasp of horror right good for you said her sister ill not help at that work i shall leave it for you as to foreign fruits and spices well have none of them save now and then a lemon for the lady letticeshe loves the flavour and well not have her go short of comfortsbut for all else i make no count of your foreign spice rosemary thyme mint savoury fennel and carraway be spice enough for any man and a deal better than all your farfetched maces and nutmegs and peppers that be fetched over here but to fetch the money out of folks pockets and wormwood and currant wine are every bit as good and a deal wholesomer than all your sherrissack and portingale rubbish hans lad lets have a currantbush or two in that garden i can make currant wine with any though i say it and gooseberry too i make no count of your foreign frumps and fiddlements whats all your champagne but just gooseberry with a french name to it and how can that make it any sweeter ill be bounden half of it is made of gooseberries if folks might but know and as to your rhenish and claret and such stuff i would not give a penny for the lotid as soon have a quart of alegar nay nay we are honest english men and women and let us live like it but temperance my dear suggested lady louvaine with a smile if no foreign fruits had ever been brought to england nor planted here our table should be somewhat scanty in truth we should have but little i believe save acorns and beechnuts nay come responded temperance wouldnt you let us have a bit of parsley or a barberry or twain parsley said lady louvaine smiling again why temperance that came first into england from italy the year anstace was bornthe second of king edward note dear heart did it so quoth she and must not we have so much as a cabbage or a sprig of sweet marjoram sweet marjoram came in when thou wert a babe temperance and i have heard my mother say that cabbages were brought hither from flanders the year my sister edith was born she was five years elder than i and died in the cradle well concluded temperance then ill hold my peace and munch my acorns but i reckon i may have a little salt to them ay that mayest thou and honey too the next day the golden fish swam in at the door and it came in the form of mistress rookwood and her daughter gertrude who seemed pleasanter people than mrs abbott a few days afterwards came the rector mr marshall with his wife and daughter and thoughor perhaps becauseagnes marshall was very quiet they liked her best of any woman they had yet seen before they had stayed long the rector asked if lady louvaine had made acquaintance with any of her neighbours she answered only with two houses the one on either side mr marshall smiled well mistress abbott means no ill methinks though her tongue goeth too fast to say she doth none yet is her talk the worst thing about her tell her no secrets i pray you but i would warn you somewhat to have a care of the rookwoods pray you sir after what fashion asked lady louvaine if i know from what quarter the arrow is like to come it shall be easier to hold up the shield against it well said he they come to church and communicate and pay all their dues they may be honest folks but this can i tell you mr rookwood is brother to a papist and is hand in glove with divers popish perverts wherefore my lady louvaine i would not have you suffer your young folks to be too intimate with theire for though these rookwoods may be safe and truei trust they areyet have they near kinsmen which assuredly are not who should very like be met at their house so let me advise you to have a care that will i most surely said she and i thank you sir for putting me on my guard in may the king arrived from scotland and in june the queen with the prince prince charles and the lady elizabeth princess at this time indicated the princess of wales alone and the first of our kings daughters to whom the term was applied except as heiress of england were the daughters of charles the first henry prince of wales was a boy of nine years old his sister a child of seven and the little charles only three the youthful princess was placed in the charge of lord harrington at combe abbey near coventrya fact to which there will be occasion to refer again the princes remained with their parents to the great satisfaction of the queen who had struggled as ceaselessly as vainly against the rigid scottish custom of educating the heirapparent away from court queen anne of denmark was a graceful elegant woman with extremely fair complexion and abundant fair hair the king was plain even to ungainlinessa strange thing for the son of one of the most beautiful women that ever lived the wisdom of james the first has been by different writers highly extolled and contemptuously derided it seems to me to have partaken like everything else of the uncertainty of its author he did give utterance to some apothegms of unquestionable wisdom and also to some speeches of egregious folly his subjects did not err far when they nicknamed their scottish master and their dear dead queen his predecessor king elizabeth and queen james yet justice requires the admission that the chief root of jamess many failings was his intense unreasoning constitutional timidity which would have been ludicrous if it had been less pitiful he could not see a drawn sword without shuddering even if drawn for his own defence and when knighting a man it was necessary for the lord chamberlain to come to his majestys help and guide the blade lest the recipient of the honour should be wounded by the unsteadiness of the kings hand under the strong shuddering which seized him so afraid was he of possible assassins that he always wore a thicklypadded cotton garment under his clothes to turn aside bullet or dagger lord oxford came to town in may and aubrey at once began his duties as a squire in his household during june and july he ran into the white bear some halfdozen times in an evening he said to assure them that he was still alive in august and september he was more remiss and after october had set in they scarcely saw him once a month it was noticeable when he did come that the young gentleman was becoming more fashionable and courtly than of old lettice asked him once if he had bidden the tailor to make his garments of snips since the brown suit which had been his sunday best was breaking out all over into slashes whence puffs of pink were visible aubrey drew himself up with a laugh and told his cousin that she knew nothing of the fashions lettice fancied she caught the gleam of a gold chain beneath his doublet but it was carefully buttoned inside so as not to show meanwhile hanswhose brown suit did not break out like aubreyswas very busy in the garden which he diligently dug and stocked when this was done he applied to a neighbouring notary and brought home bundles of copying at which he worked industriously in an evening in the afternoon he was generally from home what he did with himself on these occasions he did not say and he was so commonly and thoroughly trusted that no one thought it necessary to ask him edith and temperance coming in together one evening were informed that mrs rookwood had called during their absence bringing with her dorothy aubreys beauty and didst thou think her beauteous lettice asked her aunt edith with an amused smile truly aunt edith i marvel what aubrey would be at his fancies must be very diverse from mine i would liever a deal have our rachel temperance laughed for rachel had few claims of this nature what like is she lettice she hath jetblack hair aunt and thick black brows with great shining eyesblack likewise and a big noseend and pouting big red lips humph i reckon folks see beauty with differing eyes said temperance the coronation did not take place before july it was followed by severe pestilence supposed to arise from the numbers who crowded into town to witness the ceremony temperance kept fires of sweet herbs burning in the garden and insisted on every body swallowing liberal doses of brick and wormwood fasting in the morningher sovereign remedy against infection mrs abbott said that her doctor ordered her powder of bezoar stone for the same purpose while the rookwoods held firmly by a mixture of unicorns horn and salt of gold in consequence or in spite of these invaluable applications no one suffered in the three houses in king street his majesty was terribly afraid of the pestilence all officials not on duty were ordered home and all suitorsnamely petitionerswere commanded to avoid the court till winter a solemn fast for this visitation was held in august the statutes against vagabonds and masterless men were confirmed whereat temperance greatly rejoiced and dangerous rogues were to be banished this last item was variously understood some supposing it aimed at the jesuits and some at the puritans it was popularly reported that the king loved no puritans as it was now usual to term those churchmen who declined to walk in the ritualistic ways of the high church party to restrict the term puritan to nonconformists is a modern mistake when therefore james began his reign by large remittances of fines to his romish subjects issued a declaration against toleration revived the star chamber and appointed lord henry howard a roman catholic to the privy council the papists were encouraged and the puritans took alarm the latter prepared to emigrate on a large scale to the american plantations where no man could control them in religious matters the former raised their heads and ventured on greater liberties than they had dared to take during the reign of the dead queen the french ambassador however curled his lip contemptuously and informed his master that james was a hypocrite the position of the english roman catholics at this time was peculiar and not agreeable but in order to understand it we must go back for thirtyfive yearsto the close of that halcyon period the earliest ten years of elizabeth when the few romanists then left in england generally came to church like other good citizens and if they chose to practise the rites of their own faith in private no notice was taken of it it was not the protestant government but the papal see which was responsible for the violent ending of this satisfactory state of things when it was perceived at rome that the reformation was so thoroughly settled and the nation so completely severed from latin control that in the words of one of those who attempted the queens life unless mistress elizabeth were suddenly taken away all the devils in hell should not be able to shake it in therefore pope pius the fifth put forth a bull which excommunicated queen elizabeth deposed her absolved her subjects from their allegiance and solemnly cursed them if they continued to obey her to her protestant subjects of course this act of usurpation was mere waste paperthe private spleen of an italian priest who had no jurisdiction in this realm of england but to the romanists it was the solemn decree of christ by his appointed vicar to be obeyed at the peril of their salvation the first visible effect of the bull was that they all did forthwith refrain the church and joined no more with their fellowsubjects in public prayer the queen contented herself in answer with forbidding the bringing in of bullswhich was no more than edward the first had done before her had the pope and the jesuits been then content to let matters rest no difficulty might have arisen but they would not first mayne then campion the first jesuit who entered england were sent to move sedition and to make a party in execution of the former bull to this followed an influx of treasonable books it had now become evident that the papal bull was to be no mere brutum fulmen which might be safely left alone to die out but a deliberate attempt to stir up rebellion against the queen for the government to have kept silence would have been practically to throw their influence into the scale against the reign and the life of their sovereign lady it is now fashionable with a certain section to stigmatise elizabeth as a persecutor and to represent the penal laws against the papists enacted in her reign as cruel oppressions of innocent and harmless persons enforced simply because they believed certain religious doctrines those who will carefully follow the facts can hardly avoid seeing that the disloyalty preceded the coercion and that if the romanists were maddened into plotting against the government by oppressive laws those laws were not due to groundless fear or malice but were simply the just reward of their own deeds during the five years of queen mary three hundred men women and children were put to death for their religious opinions only during the fortyfour years of queen elizabeth less than thirty priests and five harbourers of priests were executed not for their opinions nor their religion but for distinctly treasonable practices note when matters had come to this pass in the first penal laws were issued against recusancy and seditious publications the penalty for recusancyby which was meant a legal conviction for absence from public worship on religious groundswas not loss of life or limb or whole estate but only a pecuniary mulct and penalty and that also only until they would submit and conform themselves and again come to church as they had done for ten years before the popes bull twenty pounds per lunar month was the fine imposed but this referred only to adult males not being let by sickness compared with the laws of queen mary and even of her predecessors this penalty was gentleness itself and those modern writers who see in it cruelty and rigour must have little knowledge of comparative history yet so far was this from stopping the flow of treason that a jesuit mission entered england with the special purpose of teaching the people that under the bull of pope pius the queen stood excommunicated and that it was a positive sin to obey her their success was only too manifest men of all sorts and conditions from peers to peasants were reconciled in numbers by their teaching if this were to go on not only would elizabeths life be the forfeit but the reformation settlement would be uprooted and undone and the blood of the marian martyrs would have been shed for nought the laws were now made more stringent by the act of it had been provided that every priest saying mass should be liable to a fine of two hundred marks pounds with half that sum for every hearer and both to imprisonment for a year or in the priests case until the fine was paid now all jesuits and priests ordained since the queens accession were banished the kingdom being allowed forty days after the close of the session and none were to enter it on penalty of death all persons receiving or assisting such priests were held guilty of felony recusants were to be imprisoned until they should conform and if they remained obstinate for three months they must be banished these penal laws however were rarely enforced they were kept as a sword of damocles suspended over the heads of the unhappy romanists and capable of being brought down on them at any moment in the hands of an unscrupulous minister of the crown they might be made an agency of considerable vexation yet no reasonable remonstrance could be offered to the reminder that these penalties were inflicted by law and it was only of the queens clemency that they had not been earlier exacted it must also be admitted that the penal laws bore in reality much harder on the romanists than they seem to do in protestant eyes to deprive a protestant of the services of a clergyman is at most to incommode him to deprive a papist of his priest is equivalent in his eyes to depriving him of his salvation to them therefore it was a matter of life and death and yet it must not be forgotten they had brought it on themselves with the death of elizabeth came a serious change revile her as they might under her the romanists had been on the whole gently and justly used but it was in reality though they could not see it after her the deluge who was to be elizabeths successor had been for years at once a serious and an unsettled question there were three persons living when she died each of whom could have put forward a claim to the crown on various grounds humanly speaking the decision was made by two groups of personsthe careys and cecils and the romanists of englandboth of whom were determined that james of scotland should succeed the latter had been working for some time past and had secured promises from james that he would extend special toleration to them he was expected to look kindly on the party which had adhered to his motherit would be difficult to say why since in scotland his adherents had always been at war with hersand it was remembered that he had been born and baptised in the church of rome the roman party therefore wrought earnestly in his favour sir thomas tresham proclaimed him at northampton at considerable personal risk his sons and lord monteagle assisted the earl of southampton to hold the tower for james the pope clement the eighth was entirely on jamess side of whose conversion he entertained the warmest hopes to the french ambassador monsieur de beaumont james asserted that he was no heretic that is refusing to recognise the truth neither was he a puritan nor separated from the church he held episcopacy as necessary and the pope as the chief bishop namely the president and moderator of councils but not the head nor superior we in this nineteenth century accustomed to ideas of complete and perpetual toleration and alas also to galliolike apathy and indifference can scarcely form a conception of what was at that time the popular estimate of a papist a fair view of it is given by the following sarcastic description written on the flyleaf of a volume of manuscript sermons of this date the blazon of a papist priest is erased contrived prettily by som herault of armes in ye compasse of armoury first there is papist rampant a furious beast tis written that the diuell goes about like a roaring lion but the diuell himselfe is not more fierce and rigorous then is papist where he is of force and ability to shew his tyranny wittnes ye murthers ye massacres ye slaughters ye poysoning ye stabbing ye burning ye broyling ye torturing ye tormenting ye persecuting with other their bloody executions euery sic fresh in example infinite to be told and horrible to be rememberd second a papist passant hes an instrument of sedition of insurrection of treason of rebellion a priest a jesuite a seminary and such other as find so many friends in england and ireland both to receaue and harbour them that it is to be feard we shall smart for it one day third a papist volant of all the rest these i take to do the least harme yet they will say they fly for their consciences when its apparently known they both practice and conspire fourth a papist regardant he obserus times occasions places and persons and though he be one of the popes intelligencers yet he walks with such circumspection and heed that he is not known but to his own faction fifth a papist dormant hes a sly companion subtill as a fox he sleeps with open eyes yet somtymes seeming to winke he looks and pries into opportunity still feeding himselfe with those hopes that i am in hope shall never do him good sixth a papist couchant this is a daungerous fellow and much to be feard he creeps into the bosom of ye state and will not stick to look into ye court nay if he can into court counsells he will shew himselfe tractable to ye common wealthe prescriptions and with this shew of obedience to law he doth ye pope more service then others that are more resisting seventh a papist pendant indeed a papist pendant is in his prime pfection a papist pendant is so fitting a piece of armoury for ye time present as all herauds in england are not able better to display him a papist is then in chiefe when he is a pendant and he neuer comes to so high pferment but by ye popes especiall blessing note jamess first act when his succession was peaceably ensured was to remit the fines for recusancy for the first and second years of his reign they were not enforced at all the sum paid into the exchequer on this account in the last year of elizabeth was pounds in the first and second years of james it was about and pounds respectively but in his third year the fines were suddenly revived and the romanists took alarm the king was evidently playing them false he had been heard to say that the pope was the true antichrist that he would lose his crown and his life before he would alter religion that he never had any thought of granting toleration to the catholics and that if he thought that his son would condescend to any such course he would wish the kingdom translated to his daughter and lastly that he had given them a year of probation to conform themselves which seeing it had not wrought that effect he had fortified all the laws against them and commanded them to be put in execution to the uttermost early in all jesuits and seminary priests were banished the recusancy fines and arrears were soon after stringently exacted and many roman catholic families almost reduced to beggary sudden domiciliary visits were made in search of concealed priests usually in the dead of night empty beds were examined walls struck with mallets rapiers thrust into the chinks of wainscots the jesuit missionaries were in especial danger they went about disguised hid themselves under secular callings and travelled from one house to another using a different name at each to avoid discovery one priest named moatford passed as the footman of lord sandys daughter wore his livery and said mass in secret when it seemed safe to do so serious difficulties were thrown in the way of educating children if they were sent abroad the parents were subject to a fine of pounds if taught at home by a recusant tutor both he and his employer were mulcted in forty shillings per day it was in these circumstances that the gunpowder plot originatednot from some sudden ebullition of groundless malice and it was due not to the romanists at large but to that section of them only which constituted the jesuit party it is not generally understood that the roman church which boasts so loudly of her perfect unity is really divided in two parties one siding with and the other against that powerful and mysterious body calling itself the society of jesus it is with this body the power behind the popewhich popes have ere this striven to put down and have only fallen a sacrifice themselvesthat political plots have most commonly originated and the gunpowder plot was no exception to the general rule it was entirely got up by the jesuit faction the ordinary roman catholics not merely having nothing to do with it but placing themselves when interrogated in positive opposition to it there are certain peculiarities concerning the conspirators which distinguish this enterprise from others of its class they were mostly young men they were nearly all connected by ties of blood or marriage twothirds of them if not more were perverts from protestantism and so far from being the vulgar brutal miscreants usually supposed they werewith one exceptiongentlemen of name and family and some of good fortune educated and accomplished men who honestly believed themselves to be doing god service it is instructive to read their profound conviction that they were saving their countrys honour furthering their own salvation and promoting the glory of god the slaughter of the innocents which necessarily attended their project was lamentable indeed but inevitable and gave rise to as little real compunction as the eating of beef and mutton these men were by no means heartless they were only blind from ignorance of scripture and excess of zeal in a false cause the original propounder of the plot was unquestionably robert catesby of ashby saint ledgers a northamptonshire gentleman of ancient ancestry and fair estate he first whispered it in secret to john wright a lincolnshire squire and soon afterwards to thomas winter a younger brother of the owner of huddington hall in worcestershire and a distant cousin of an old friend of some of my readersedward underhill the hot gospeller thomas winter communicated it in flanders to guy fawkes a young officer of yorkshire birth and these four met with a fifth thomas percy cousin and steward of the earl of northumberland the object of the meeting was to consider the condition of the roman catholics with a view to taking action for its relief there was also a priest in the company but who he was did not transpire though it is almost certain to have been one of the three jesuits chiefly concerned in the plotjohn gerard oswald greenway or henry garnet percy usually fertile in imagination and eager in action was ready with a proposition at once he said the only way left for us is to kill the king and that will i undertake to do from him we looked for bread and have received nought save stones let him be prayed to visit my lord mordaunt at turvey where a masque may be had for him and he once there in the house of one of us though my lord be not known so to be he is at our mercy how say you gentlemen nay my son replied the priest there is a better course in hand even to cut up the very roots and remove all impediments whatsoever that were to run great risk and accomplish little added catesby no tom thou shalt not adventure thyself to so small purpose if thou wilt be a traitor i have in mine head a much further design than thatto greater advantage and that can never be discovered every body wished to know his meaning i have bethought me continued catesby of a way at one instant to deliver us from all our bonds and without any foreign help to replant again the catholic religion in a word it is to blow up the parliament house with gunpowder for in that place have they done us all the mischief and perchance god hath designed that place for their punishment truly a strange proposal said thomas winter the scandal would be so great that the catholic religion might sustain thereby the nature of the disease requires so sharp a remedy was catesbys reply but were it lawful objected john wright ask your ghostly father said catesby who was pretty sure of the answer in that case but remember said winter there are many of our friends and catholic brethren amongst the lords shall we destroy them with the rest catesbys answer was in principle that of caiaphas ay tis expedient the few die for the good of the many the next step was to obtain a house convenient for their operations namely so close to the houses of parliament that they could carry a mine from its cellar right under the house percy was deputed to attend to this matter as his circumstances offered an excuse for his seeking such a house he was one of the band of gentlemen pensioners whose duty it was to be in daily attendance on the king a position into which he had been smuggled by his cousin lord northumberland without having taken the oath requisite for it this oath percy could not conscientiously have taken since by it he renounced the authority of the pope a little study of the topography induced him to fix on two contiguous houses which stood close to the house of lords on investigation it was found that these two houses belonged to the parliament and were held by mr wyniard keeper of the kings wardrobe an ancient and honest servant of queen elizabeth both however had been sublet by himthe nearer to mr henry ferris the further to gideon gibbons a public porter subsequently utilised by the plotters to his danger and discomfort percy therefore in march began to labour earnestly with mr wyniard and his wife to obtain these houses mrs wyniard seems chiefly to have attended to this business her husband was not improbably incapacitated by age or illhealth percys efforts proved successful he was accepted as tenant by the wyniards at a rent of pounds per annum mr ferris being bought out with pounds for his goodwill and pounds more in consideration of the charges of the house the agreement was signed on the th of may the next united act of these five exemplary gentlemen was to meet at a house in the fields behind saint clements church near the arch near the well called saint clements well this seems to have been the residence of the jesuit priest gerard but it is uncertain whether it was identical with that of percy or with that of mrs herbert where fawkes had apartments both which are also described as beyond saint clements gerard who was in the company was with delicate consideration left in an upper room where he was provided with all necessaries for the celebration of mass while the conspirators proceeded to business alone in the lower apartment taking a primer in his hand catesby administered to his four accomplices this oath which he also took himself you swear by the blessed trinity and by the sacrament which you now propose to receive never to disclose directly or indirectly by word or circumstance the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep secret nor desist from the execution thereof till the rest shall give you leave then they passed into the upper room where gerard stood ready robed and received the host from his handswith what intention being unknown to him if the assertion of the conspirators may be believed i have gone rather too far chronologically speaking in order to tell this part of the story straight through and now we must go back a little about four months before this oath was taken in january was held the famous conference of bishops at hampton court the king who though baptised a roman catholic had been educated as a presbyterian propounded various queries to the hierarchy concerning practices which puzzled him in the church of england of which he was now the supreme head upon earth in the first place he desired to know the meaning of the rite of confirmation if they held the sacrament of baptism invalidous without it then was it in his judgment blasphemous yet if it were only that children might themselves profess and be blessed then very good the absolution of the church he had heard compared to the popes pardons private baptism he would have administered only by a lawful minister and concerning excommunications he had also something to say on all these points the bishops fully satisfied his majesty whose exquisite expositions did breed wonder and astonishment in that learned and noble audience modern readers of the proceedings have been much less inclined to astonishment except indeed that the bishops should have been so easily astonished on the second day a deputation was received from the puritan ministers who petitioned for four pointswhich had they gained the nineteenth century would have found its burdens considerably lightened they requested that the doctrine of the church might be preserved pure according to gods word that good pastors might be planted in all churches to preach in the same that the book of common prayer might be fitted to more increase of piety and that church government might be sincerely ministered according to gods word king james made the deputation explain themselves and after a days debate he angrily told them that they were aiming at a scottish presbytery which agreed with monarchy as well as god and the devil no bishop no king added his majesty some few members of the conference maintained that the puritans had been crushed and insulted but chancellor egerton said he had never seen king and priest so fully united in one person as in that of his sacred majesty and bancroft afterwards archbishop fell upon his knees unctuously exclaiming that his heart melted for joy to think that england was blessed with such a ruler the bishops and privycouncillors then conferred alone altered a few expressions in the liturgy and summoned the puritans to hear their decision dr raynolds the puritan spokesman entreated that the use of the surplice and the sign of the cross in baptism might be laid aside or at least not made compulsory but the king sternly told him that they preferred the credit of a few private men to the peace of the church that he would have none of this arguing wherefore let them conform and quickly too or they shall hear of it by this shortsighted policy the opportunity for really securing peace to the church was lost for sixty years and many of the troubles of the next reign were sown the next step was to arrest ten of the puritan leaders and then to eject from their benefices three hundred clergy of that school among these was mr marshall the pastor of our friends lady louvaine was sorely troubled she said they were now as sheep without a shepherd and were but too likely to have a shepherd set over them who would fleece and devour the sheep of these clergy some joined the presbyterians some the brownistswhom people now began to call independents others remained in the church ceasing to minister and following such callings as they deemed not unbecoming the position of a christian ministerchiefly tutorship and literature mr marshall was in the last class he said better times might come and he could not see his way to desert the church though her ways to him at this present were somewhat stepmotherly but how mr marshall if the church cast you forth asked temperance then must i needs go he answered with a smile but that look you were not my deed nor should i be responsible for it before god so long as i break not her laws she hath no right to eject me and so long as she abideth in the truth i have no right to desert her but the bishops abide not in the truth as i take it the bishops be not the church replied he let the articles and homilies be changed with evil tendency and then that is to change the church i go forth of her then at once for she should be no longer the church of my faith to which i sware obedience and she hath not that right over me to require me to change with her but so long as these are left unaltered what matter though bishops change they are not immortal and very sure am i they are not infallible what think you mother said edith children replied lady louvaine laying down her knitting in her lap i can get no further at this present than one line of saint john he himself knew what he would do i do not know what he will do it may be as it then was something that none of all his disciples can guess one step at a time is all he allows us to see and all he bids us take he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out but also he goeth before them at times he leads them i think outside the fold and if he is outside and we hear his voice we must needs go to him yet is this rare and we should make very sure that it is from without we hear the familiar voice and not rush forth in haste when he may be calling from within let us know that he is on the road before us and then we need have no fear to run fast no doubt whither the road will lead there be some sheep in such haste to run that they must needs go past the shepherd and then have they no longer a leader and are very like to miss the right way you have the right lady louvaine said mr marshall he that believeth shall not make haste yet there be sheepto follow your imagery or truly that of our lordthat will lag behind and never keep pace with the shepherd ay she answered and i know not if that be not the commoner fault of the twain he calls and calls and they come not and such sheep find many a sharp tap from the rod ere they will walk never say run our shepherd is human therefore he can feel for us he is divine therefore can he have patience with us let us thank god for both note except only this now a northern provincialism is an archaism at least as old as the fourteenth century note nevertheless this strictly lancastrian provincialism is supposed to be a corruption of choose how its exact pronunciation can hardly be put into english letters note this was a revival for persille is found on the rolls of edward ii note

consists of sermonsnot very legible and mostly very dry by the rev thomas stone their dates ranging from to with a few occasional memoranda interspersed chapter four we get into bad company will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy one afternoon during that winter as lettice was coming downstairs her sense of smell was all at once saluted by a strange odour which did not strike her as having any probable connection with araby the blest mixed with slight curls of smoke suggestive of the idea that something was on fire but before she had done more than wonder what might be the matter a sound reached her from below arguing equal astonishment and disapproval on the part of aunt temperance northumberland cumberland westmoreland and durham was the ejaculation of that lady lad art thou afire or what ails thee the answering laugh was in aubreys voice why aunt said he is this the first time you did ever see a man to drink uppowoc drink up a work exclaimed she what on earth picielt said he lettice is that thou inquired aunt temperance call charity quickly and bid her run for the apothecary this boys gone mad a ringing peal of laughter from aubrey was the answer lettice had come far enough to see him now and there he stood in the hall his coat more slashed and puffed than ever and in his hand a long narrow tube of silver with a little bowl at the end in which was something that sent forth a great smoke and smell come aunt temperance cried he every gentleman in the land wellnigh doth now drink the indian weed tis called uppovoc picielt petum whence comes petunia or tobago and is sold for its weight in silver men pick out their biggest shillings to lay against it and tis held a favour for a gentlewoman to fill the pipe for her servant suitor i have heard say some will spend three or four hundred a year after this manner drinking it even at the table and they that refuse be thought peevish and ill company and whither must we flee to get quit of it quoth she grimly that cannot i say aunt in france they have it calling it nicotine from one nicot that did first fetch it thither twas one ralph lane that brought it to england why what think you there are over six thousand shops in and about london where they deal in it now six thousand shops for that stinking stuff oh not for this alone the apothecaries grocers and chandlers have it and in every tavern you shall find the pipe handed round even where as in the meaner sort it be made but of a walnut shell and a straw why aunt tis wondrous wholesome and healing for divers diseases lets hear which of them wellmigraines headaches colics toothache ague colds obstructions through wind and fits of the mother hysterics gout epilepsy and hydropsy dropsy the brain look you being naturally cold and wet all hot and dry things must be good for it id as soon have any of those divers distempers as that solemnly announced aunt temperance brain cold and wet when didst thou handle thy brains that thou shouldst know whether they be cold or not i do ensure you aunt thus saith dr barclay one of the first physicians in london town which useth this tobago for all these diseases he only saith tis not to be touched with food or after it but must be took fasting moreover it helps the digestion itll not help mine and prithee mr aubrey louvaine which of all this list of disorders hast thou i aunt oh im well enough dear heart when i am well enough i warrant you i take no physic oh but aunt tis not physic only tis rare comforting and soothing aunt temperances face was a sight to see she looked aubrey over from the crown of his head to his boots till his face flushed red though he tried to laugh it away soothing said she in a longdrawn indescribable tone lettice prithee tell me what year we be now in in the year of our lord aunt said lettice trying not to laugh nay answered she that cannot be for my nephew aubrey louvaine was born in the year of our lord and he is yet poor babe in the cradle and needs rocking and hushing abybye soothing and aunt temperance drew out the word in a long cry for all the world like a whining baby lad if you desire not the finest thrashing ever you had yet cast down that drivelling folly of a silver toy and turn up your sleeves and go to work like a man when you lie abed ill of the smallpox you may say you want soothing and no sooner and if i hear such another word out of your mouth ill leather you while i can stand over you aunt temperance marched to the parlour door and flung it wide open madam said she give me leave to introduce to your ladyship the king of fools i go forth to buy a cradle for him and edith prithee run to the kitchen and dress him some pap he lacks soothing madam and having been brought so low as to seek it poor fool at the hands of the evillestsmelling weed ever was plucked off a dunghill i am moved to crave your ladyships kindliness for him heres his rattleand aunt temperance held forth the silver pipewhich lacks but the bells to be as rare a fools staff as i have seen of a summer dayget thee in thou poor dizard dolt note to think that i should have to call such a patch my cousin lady louvaine sat looking first at aubrey and then at temperance as though she marvelled what it all meant edith said laughingly why aubrey what hast thou done my boy so to vex thine aunt and faith throwing down her work rose and came to aubrey my darling my poor little boy she cried as a nurse might to a child but faiths blandishment was real while temperances was mockery all aunt temperances mocking nevertheless provoked aubrey less than his mothers reality he flushed red again and looked ready to weep had it been less unmanly temperance took care not to lose her chance ay poor little boy said she prithee faith take him on thy lap and cuddle him and dandle him well and sing him a song o sixpence oh my little rogue my pretty bird well then it shall have a new coral it shallnow madam pray you look on this piece of wastry dear heart but a fool and his money be soon parted what think you tis like truly my dear that cannot i say replied lady louvaine looking at the pipe as temperance held it out but either that or somewhat else it strikes me hath a marvellous ill savour ill savour madam cried temperance would you even such mean scents as roses and lilies to this celestial odour truly this must it be the angels put in their pouncetboxes i am informed of my lord of tobago here that all the gentlemen of the court do use to perfume their velvets with it well i can tell you of two which so do said aubrey in a nettled fashionmy lord of northumberland and sir walter raleigh and youll not call them fools aunt temperance ill give you a bit of advice mr louvaine and that is not to lay your weeks wages out in wagers what i shall do i call any man fool that is given to folly and as to this filthy business i should scarce stick at the kings majesty himself nay the king is clean contrary thereto saith aubrey with a rather unwilling air i hear of my lord that he saith it soils the inward parts of men with oily soot and is loathsome to the eye hateful to the nose harmful to the brain dangerous to the lungs counted effeminate among the indians themselves and by the spanish slaves called sauce for lutheran curs well on my word cried aunt temperance and knowing this thou lutheran cur thou wilt yet soil thine inward parts with this oily soot oh aunt every one so doth lady louvaine and edith exchanged sorrowful looks and the former said aubrey my boy no true man accounts that a worthy reason for his deeds it was true of the israelites when they fell to worship the golden calf and of the scribes and priests when they cried crucify him hadst thou been in that crowd before pontius pilate wouldst thou have joined that cry edith went up to her mother and said in a low voice may i tell him evidently it cost lady louvaine some pain to say yes yet she said it edith went back to her seat aubrey she said fourandtwenty years gone thine uncle my brother walter was what thou art now in the very same office and household his wages were then sixteen pound by the year but mine are thirtyfive aunt responded aubrey quickly as though he guessed what she was about to say in order to be like every one else aubrey and not come in bad odour with his fellows he spent wellnigh four hundred pound by the year and uncle walter cried aubrey in amazement and lettice could have been his echo ay said edith sadly and for over ten years thereafter was my father so crippled with his debts that i mind it being a fine treat when i and my sisters had a new gown apiece though of the commonest serge and all but bare necessaries were cut off from our board walter laid it so to heart that of a spendthrift he became a miser i would not have thee so to do but i bid thee mind that we have very little to live on owing all we yet have and have brought withal to the goodness of my dear aunt joyce and if thou fall in such ways aubrey dear heart aunt think you i have no wit thou hast not an ill wit my lad said aunt temperance if a wise man had the keeping of it temperance you are so unfeeling exclaimed faith must i needs stand up for my fatherless boy youd ruin any lad you were mother to answered her sister hans now coming in she set on him look here hans floriszoon didst ever see any thing like this hans smiled oh ay mistress murthwaite i have seen men to use them hast one of these fiddlefaddles thyself or dost thou desire to have one neither in good sooth was his reply there mr louvaine hearken prithee hans is only a boy i am a man said aubrey loftily though hans was but a year younger than himself lancaster and derby and are you then content my lord man that a contemptible boy should have better wit than your magnifical self truly i think hans was a man before thou hadst ended sucking of thy thumb just then charity brought in the rector see you here mr marshall cried temperance brandishing her pipe be you wont to solace your studies with this trumpery mr marshall smiled truly nay mistress murthwaite tis accounted scandalous for divines to use that tobago not to name the high cost thereof pray you how many pence by the ounce hath any man the face to ask for this stinking stuff three shillings or more and that the poorest sort mercy me and can you tell me how folks use it that account it physical ay i have heard tell that the manner of using it as physic is to fill the patients mouth with a ball of the leaves when he must incline the face downward and keep his mouth open not moving his tongue then doth it draw a flood of water from all parts of the body some physicians will not use it saying it causeth overquick digestion and fills the stomach full of crudities for a cold or headache the fumes of the pipe only are taken his majesty greatly loathes this new fashion saying that the smoke thereof resembles nothing so much as the stygian fume of the bottomless pit and likewise that tis a branch of drunkenness which he terms the root of all sins aubrey laughed rather significantly why asked his mother is the kings majesty somewhat given that way well i have heard it said that when the king of denmark was here their two majesties went not to bed sober every night of the week marry tis whispered all the court ladies kept not so steady feet as they might have done alack the day not the queen i hope nay i heard no word touching her ah friends said mr marshall with a sigh let me ensure you that englands mourning is not yet over for queen elizabeth and we may live to lament our loss of her far sorer than now we do folks say she was something stingy with money loving not to part with it sooner than she saw good reason but some folks will fling their money right and left with no reason at all the present court much affecteth masques plays and such like so that now there be twenty where her late majesty would see one mr marshall asked edith is it true as i have heard say that king james is somewhat papistically given ay and no said he he is not at all thus in the signification of obeying the pope or suffering himself to be ridden of priests in no wise but he hates a puritan worse than a papist mind you not that in his speech when he opened his first parliament he said that he did acknowledge the roman church to be our mother church though defiled with some infirmities and corruptions yet he said also if i err not that he sucked in gods truth with his nurses milk ay but what one calls gods truth is not what an other doth all the papistry in the world is not in the roman church and assuredly she is in no sense our mother truly i thought saint austin brought the gospel hither from rome saint austin brought a deal from rome beside the gospel and he was not the first to bring that the gallican church had before him brought it to kent and long ere that time had the ancient british church been evangelised from no sister church at all but right from the holy land itself and as her own unchanging voice did assert by the beloved apostle saint john that heard i never afore said lady louvaine who seemed greatly interested pray you mr marshall is this true i do ensure you it is replied he that is so far as the wit of man at this distance of time may discern the same was the french church then lesser corrupted than that of rome queried edith certainly so he said and it hath resisted the popes usurpations nigh as much as our own church of england i mean not in respect of the reformation but rather the time before the reformation when our kings were ever striving with the pope concerning his right to appoint unto dignities and livings yet the reformation itself began first in france and had they in authority been willing to aid it as in england france had been a protestant country at this day that evening as they sat round the fire hans astonished them all lady lettice said he were you willing that i should embark in trade hans my dear boy was the astonished response i will not do it without your goodwill thereto said he nor would i at all have done it could i have seen any better way but i feel that i ought to be awork on some matter and not tarry a burden on your hands and all this time have i been essaying two mattersto look out for a service and to make a little money for you the second i have in some sense accomplished though not to the extent i did desire and here be the proceedsand rising from his seat hans opened his purse and poured several gold pieces into his friends lap the former howbeit is not he was interrupted by a little cry from lady louvaine hans thou surely thinkest not dear lad that i shall strip thee of thy first earnings won by hard work you will lady lettice without you mean to disappoint and dishearten me very sore he answered but all this she exclaimed tis much less than i would have had it and it hath taken me threequarters of a year to scrape so much together butnay lady lettice forgive me but never a penny will i take back you sure forget that i owe all unto you what should have come of me but for you and sir aubrey but i was about to say i have essayed in every direction to take service with a gentleman and cannot compass it in any wise so i see no other way but to go into trade but hans thou art a gentlemans son i am a kings son madam said hans with feeling and if i tarnish not the escocheon of my heavenly birth by honest craft then shall i have no fear for that of mine earthly father yet if so were dear ladthough i should be verily sorry to see thee come down so lowyet bethink thee thine apprenticeship may not be compassed without a good payment in money your pardon madam there is one craftsman in london that is willing to receive me without a penny truly i did nothing to demerit it since i did but catch up his little maid of two years that could scarce toddle from being run over by an horse that had brake loose from the rein howbeit it pleaseth him to think him under an obligation to me and his good wife likewise and having made inquiries diligently i find him to be a man of good repute one that feareth god and dealeth justly and kindly by men also of his wife the neighbours speak well seeing then all doors shut upon me save this one whereat i may freely enter it seems to me under your ladyships leave that this is the way which god hath prepared for me to walk in yet if you refuse permission then i shall know that i have erred therein hans i would give my best rebate aubrey had one half thy wit and goodness cried temperance i thank you for the compliment mistress murthwaite said hans laughingly but truly as for my wit i should be very illset to spare half of it and as for my goodness i wish him far more of his own where dwells this friend of thine hans inquired lady louvaine what is his name and what craft doth he follow he dwells near madam in broad saint giles his name andrew leigh and is a silkman we shall miss thee my boy said edith mrs edith that was the only one point that made me to doubt if i should take master leighs offer or no if my personal service be of more value to you than my maintenance is a burden i pray you tell it me but if not we never yet reckoned thy maintenance a burden my dear answered lady louvaine lovingly and indeed we shall miss thee more than a little nevertheless hans i think thou hast wisely judged there is thine own future to look to and though in very deed i am sorry that life offer thee no fairer opening yet the lord wot best that which shall be best for thee ay hans thou wilt do well to take the offer but there were tears in her eyes as she spoke the old feudal estimate was still strong in mens minds by which the most honourable of all callings was held to be domestic service then trade and handicraft and lowest and meanest of all those occupations by which men were not fed clothed nor instructed but merely amused musicians painters poetasters and above all actors were looked on as the very dregs of mankind the views of the old lollards who held that art not having existed in paradise was a product of the serpent had descended to the puritans in a modified form was it surprising when on every side they saw the serpent pressing the arts and sciences into his service it was only in the general chaos of the restoration that this estimate was reversed the view of the world at present is exactly opposite and the view taken by the church is too often that of the world surely the dignity of labour is lost when men labour to produce folly and call it work there can be no greater waste either of time money or toil than to expend them on that which satisfieth not when hans came home a day or two afterwards he went straight to lady louvaine and kissed her hand madam said he in a low voice of much satisfaction i bring good news i have covenanted with mr leigh who has most nobly granted me at my request a rare favour unto a prenticeleave to come home when the shop is closed and to lie here so long as i am every morrow at my work by six of the clock i can yet do many little things that may save you pain and toil and i shall hear every even of your welfare my dear lad god bless thee replied lady louvaine and laid her hand upon his head somewhat later in the evening came aubrey to whom all this concerning hans was news master floriszoon silkman at the black boy in holborn cried he laughingly pray you my worthy master how much is the best velvet by the yard and is green stamyn now in fashion whereto cometh galowne lace the ounce let us hear thee cry what do you lack that we may see if thou hast the true tone hans floriszoon i thought thou hadst more of the feeling of a gentleman in thee the blood flushed to hans forehead yet he answered quietly enough can a gentleman not measure velvet and what harm shall it work him to know the cost of it that is a quibble answered aubrey loftily for any gentleman to soil his fingers with craft is a blot on his escocheon and that you know as well as i for any man gentle or simple to soil his fingers with sin or his tongue with falsehood is a foul blot on his escocheon replied hans looking aubrey in the face once more the blood mounted to aubreys brow and he answered with some warmth what mean you i did but respond to your words be mine other than truth be not scurrilous boy said aubrey angrily hans i am astonished at you said faith i know not how it is but since we came to london you are for ever picking quarrels with aubrey and seeking occasion against him are you envious of his better fortune or what is it moves you it was a minute before hans answered and when he did so his voice was very quiet and low i am sorry to have vexed you mrs louvaine if i know myself i do not envy aubrey at all and indeed i desire to pick no quarrel with any man and him least of any then turning to aubrey he held out his hand forgive me if i said aught i should not aubrey took the offered hand much in the manner of an insulted monarch to a penitent rebel lettice glanced just then at her aunt edith and saw her gazing from one to the other of the two with a perplexed and possibly displeased look on her face but whether it were with aubrey or with hans lettice could not tell what made aubrey so angry did not appear lettices eyes went to her grandmother on her face was a very sorrowful look as if she perceived and recognised some miserable possibility which she had known in the past and now saw advancing with distress but she did not speak either to hans or aubrey the full moon of a spring evening almost as mild as summer lighted up the strand throwing into bold relief the figure of a young man fashionably dressed who stood at the private door of a tailors shop the signboard of which exhibited a very wildlooking object of human species clad in a loose frock with bare legs and streaming hair known to the initiated as the sign of the irish boy fashionably dressed meant a good deal at that date it implied a doublet of velvet or satin puffed and slashed exceedingly and often covered with costly embroidery or gold lace trunk hose padded to an enormous width matching the doublet in cost and often in pattern lightcoloured silk stockings broadtoed shoes with extremely high heels and silver buckles or goldedged shoestrings garters of broad silk ribbons often spangled with gold and almost thick enough for sashes a low hat with a feather and silk hatband the latter sometimes studded with precious stones a suspicion of stays in the region of the waist but too likely to be justified by fact fringed and perfumed gloves of thick white spanish leather lace ruffs about the neck and wrists the open ones of immense size the small ones closer than in the previous reign earrings and lovelocks and over all a gaudy cloak or rather cape reaching little below the elbow in the youths hand was an article of the first necessity in the estimation of a gentleman of fashionnamely a tobaccobox in this instance of chased silver with a mirror in the lid whereby its owner might assure himself that his ruff sat correctly and that his lovelocks were not out of curl a long slender cane was in the other hand which the youth twirled with busy idleness as he carelessly hummed a song lets cast away care and merrily sing for theres a time for every thing he that plays at his work and works at his play doth neither keep working nor holy day a second youth came down the street westwards walking not with an air of haste but of one whose time was too valuable to be thrown away he was rather shorter and younger than the first and was very differently attired he wore a fustian doublet without either lace or embroidery a pair of unstuffed cloth hose dark worsted stockings shoes with narrow toes and plain shoestrings of black ribbon a flat cap cloth gloves unadorned and unscented and a cloak of black cloth of a more rational length than the other as he came to the tailors shop he halted suddenly aubrey the tone was one of surprise and pain spy was the angry response i am no spy and you know it but i would ask what you do here and now are you my gaoler that i must needs give account to you i am your brother aubrey and i as well as you am my brothers keeper in so far as concerns his welfare it is over a month since you visited us and your mother and lady lettice believe you to be with your lord in essex how come you hither so late at night and at another door than your own no business of yours may a man not call to see his tailor men do not commonly go to their tailors after shops be shut oh of course you wot all touching shop matters be off to your grograne and cambric im not your apprentice my masters shop is shut with the rest aubrey i saw you last night though till now i tried to persuade myself it was not youin holborn leaving the door of the green dragon what do you there the answer came blazing with wrath you sawyou mean sneaking blackguardly traitor of a dutch shopkeeper ill have no rascal spies dogging my steps and aubrey said the quiet voice that made reply you know me better than that i never played the spy on you yet and i trust you will never give me cause yet what am i to think when as i pass along the street i behold you standing at the door of a pa hold your tongue the closing word was cut sharply in two by that fierce response it might be a pavior a pearmonger or a papist hans was silent until aubrey had again spoken which he did in a hard constrained tone i shall go where i please without asking your leave or any bodys else i am of age and i have been tied quite long enough to the apronstrings of a parcel of women but i mean not to cut myself loose from them only to pass under guidance of a silly lad that hath never a spark of spirit in him and would make an old woman of me if i gave him leave then in a voice more like his own he added get you in to your knitting old mistress floriszoon and tie your cap well oer your ears lest the cold wind give you a rheum i will go in when you come with me said hans calmly i will not tonight aubreyonly just tonight and what for tonight prithee i have other business afloat tomorrow i will maybe look in perhaps aubrey was growing a little ashamed of his warmth for his voice had cooled down we can never do right either tomorrow or yesterday answered hans tonight is all we have at this present i tell you i will not the anger mounted again i will not be at the beck and call of a beggarly tradesfellow you love better to be at satans take that for your impudence there was the sound of a sharp heavy blowso heavy that the recipient almost staggered under it then came an instants dead silence and then a voice very low very sorrowful yet with no anger in it goodnight aubrey i hope you will come tomorrow and hanss steps died away in the distance left to himself aubreys feelings were far from enviable he was compelled to recognise the folly of his conduct as more calculated to fan than deter suspicion and it sorely nettled him also to perceive that hans shopkeeper though he might be had shown himself much the truer gentleman of the two but little time was left him to indulge in these unpleasant reflections for the door behind him was opened by a girl mr catesby at home ay sir and mr winter is here pray you walk up aubrey did as he was requested adding an unnecessary compliment on the good looks of the portress to which she responded by a simper of gratified vanitythereby showing that neither belonged to the wisest class of mankindand he was ushered upstairs into a small but pleasant parlour where three gentlemen sat conversing a decanter stood on the table half full of wine and each gentleman was furnished with a glass the long silver pipe was passing round from one to another and its smoker looked up as aubrey was announced ah welcome mr louvaine mr winter you know this gentleman sir this is my very good friend mr darcyindicating the third person by a motion of the hand mr darcy suffer me to make you acquainted with mr louvaine my good lord oxfords gentleman and a right pleasant companionpray you help yourself to rhenish and take a pipe aubrey accepted the double invitation and was soon puffing at the pipe which catesby handed to him he had not taken much notice of the stranger and none at all of a gesture on the part of mr catesby as he introduced hima momentary stroking upwards of his forehead intended as a sign not to aubrey but to the other the stranger however perfectly understood it to him it said here is a simpleton mind what you say mr catesby the occupant of the furnished apartments was a man of unusually lofty height being over six feet and of slender build though wellproportioned he had a handsome and expressive face and while not eloquent was possessed of the most fascinating and attractive manners by which man ever dragged his fellowman to evil mr winter on the other hand was as short as his friend was tall his rather handsome features were of the grecian type and he had the power of infusing into them at will a look of the most touching childlike innocence he spoke five languages and was a wellread man for his time the stranger to whom aubrey had been introduced as mr darcy was an older man than either of the others mr catesby was aged thirtytwo and mr winter about thirtyfive but mr darcy was at least fifty he was a wellproportioned man and dressed with studied plainness a long narrow face with very large heavy eyelids and a long but not hooked nose were relieved by a moustache and a beard square and slightly forked in the midst this moustache hid a mouth which was the characteristic feature of the face no physiognomist would have placed the slightest confidence in the owner of that mouth it was at once sanctimonious and unstable the manners of its possessor might be suave or severe his reputation might be excellent or execrable but with that mouth a pharisee and a hypocrite at heart he must be this gentleman found it convenient not to be too invariably known by a single name and that whereby he had been introduced to aubrey was one of five aliases his real one making a sixth different persons in various parts of the country were acquainted with him as mr mease mr phillips mr farmer andhis bestknown aliasmr walley but his real name was henry garnet and he was a jesuit priest to do justice to aubrey louvaine who though weak and foolish being mainly led astray by his own selfsufficiency was far from being deliberately wicked it must be added that he entertained not the least idea of the real characters of his new friends at the house of mr thomas rookwood whither he was attracted by the fair dorothywho had he but known it regarded him with cleverly concealed contempthe had made the acquaintance of mr ambrose rookwood the elder of the brothers and the owner of coldham hall this gentleman to aubreys taste was not attractive but by him he was introduced to mr percy and later to mr thomas winter in whose society the foolish youth took great pleasure for mr catesby he did not so much care the fact being that he was too clever to suit aubreys fancy neither had aubrey any conception of the use which was being made of him by his new friends he was very useful he had just brains enough and not too much to serve their purpose it delighted aubrey to air his familiarity with the court and nobility and it was convenient to them to know some one whom they could pump without his ever suspecting that he was being pumped they often required information concerning the movements and present whereabouts of various eminent persons and nothing was easier than to obtain it from aubrey as they sat and smoked a few glasses of rhenish wine and a few ounces of tobacco were well worth expending for the purpose aubreys anger with hans therefore was not based on any fear of discovery arising from suspicion of his associates he was only aiming at independence combined with a little secret unwillingness to acknowledge his close connection with mr leighs apprentice of the real end of the road on which he was journeying he had not the least idea satan held out to him with a smile a fruit pleasant to the eyes and good for food saying thou shalt be as a god and aubrey liked the prospect and accepted the apple having enjoyed himself for about an hour in this manner andquite unconsciously on his partgiven some valuable information to his associates he bade them good evening and returned to lord oxfords mansion in a state of the most delicatelybalanced uncertainty whether to appear or not at the white bear on the following evening if only he could know how much hans would tell the ladies in the room which he had left he formed for some minutes the subject of conversation where picked you up that jewel asked garnet of winter he livesor rather his friends donext door to tom rookwood answered winter a pigeon worth plucking was the next question as poor as a churchmouse but he knows things we need to know and in point of wits he is a very pigeon he no more guesseth what time of day it is with us than my lord secretary doth the trio laughed complacently but a rather doubtful expression succeeded that of amusement in garnets face now good gentlemen be quiet said he piously was there a faint twinkle in his eyes god will do all for the best we must get it by prayer at gods hands in whose hands are the hearts of princes you pray by all means and well work said catesby removing the pipe from his lips for an instant at that moment the door opened and a fourth gentleman made his appearance he was as tall and as handsome as catesby but the considerable amount of white in his dark hair and more slightly in his broad beard made him look older than his real age which was fortysix he stooped a little in the shoulders his manners were usually gentle and grave but a pair of large and very lively eyes and an occasional impulsive eagerness of speech wherein he was ready and fluent at all times showed that there was more fire and life in his character than appeared on the surface those who knew him well were aware that his temper was impetuous and precipitate and on given occasions might be termed quarrelsome without calumny shall we always talk gentlemen and never do anything demanded the newcomer without previous greeting come in mr percy and with a right good welcome the talk is wellnigh at an end and the doing beginneth our lady be thanked was percys response we have dallied and delayed long enough this morning have i been with mr fawkes over the house and i tell you the mining through that wall shall be no childs play winter lifted his eyebrows and pursed his lips catesby only remarked we must buy strong pickaxes then and resumed his puffing in the calmest manner the seventh of february is it not parliament meets ay i trust the bulls will come from rome before that they will be here in time said garnet rising well i wish you goodnight gentlemen tis time i was on my way to wandsworth i lie tonight at mrs annes whither she looks for her cousin tresham to come my commendations to my cousins said catesby goodnight we meet at white webbs on tuesday pax vobiscum said garnet softly as he left the room note all these are old terms signifying a fool or idiot patch was the favourite jester of henry the eighth whose name was used as synonymous with fool chapter five begins with temperance and ends with treachery whateer we do we all are doing this reaping the harvest of our yesterdays sowing for our tomorrows sv partridge on the following evening aubrey put in an appearance at the white bear as soon as he entered he gave a quick troubled look round the parlour before he went up to kiss his grandmothers hand his aunt temperance greeted him with give you good even my lord chamberlain lancaster and derby do but look on him blue feather in his hatlace ruff and rufflesdoublet of white satin with gold agletstrunk hose o blue velvet paned with silver taffetagarters of blue and white silk and i vow a pair o white silken hose and shoes o spanish leather pray you my lord is your allowance from the kings majesty five hundred pounds or a thousand by the year now aunt you know said aubrey laughing that thou art a spendthrift answered she ay i do and if thou run not into debt this side o christmas my name is not temperance murthwaite im not in debt a penny retorted he then somebody must have given thee thy pantofles replied she be they a castoff pair of his majestys or did my lord oxford so much alms to thee aubrey laughed again as merrily as if he had not a care nor a fault in the world they cost not so much as you reckon he said four yards of velvet calculated aunt temperanceyoull not do it under stuffed that wise of bombast nor buy that quality neither under eighteen shillings the yardlets seethat is three pounds twelve shillings silver taffeta a yard and an half twentytwo and sixpencethats four pounds fourteen and six then the lining dowlas i suppose at fourteen pence they are lined with perpetuana aunt answered aubrey who seemed greatly amused by this reckoning perpetuanalining thou

twelve shillings and sixpence as im a living woman tis sinful waste lad thats what it is your father never wore such babylonian raiment nor your grandfather neither and there was ten times the wisdom and manliness in either of them that therell ever be in you except you mean to turn your coat ere you are a month elder as aubrey turned to reply his eyes fell on hans coming home from the mercers his face changed in a minute but hans came forward with his hand held out as cordially as usual and a look of real pleasure in his eyes good even aubrey i am glad to see you said he ay see him do cried temperance before aubrey could answer and he only gave his hand in silence look at him hans didst ever behold such a pair of pantofles five pounds twelve shillings and sixpence how much cost thine mine be not so brave as these replied hans smiling my lord oxfords squire must needs wear better raiment than a silkmans apprentice mrs murthwaite five pounds twelve shillings and sixpence persisted she come now aunt temperance they cost not the half said aubrey who didst thou cheat out of them then asked she i bought them he answered laughing of a young noble that had borne them but twice and was ill content with the cut and colour of them hell come to no good sternly pronounced aunt temperance you made a good bargain said hans that velvet cost full a pound the yard i should say aubrey inquired temperance i do marvel and i would fain know what thou dost all the day long doth thy lord keep thee standing by his chair first o one leg and then o tother while he hath an errand for thee why no aunt i am not an errandlad said aubrey and laughed more merrily than ever of late is his lordship greatly incommoded and hath kept his chamber during many days of this last month but when he hath his health i will specify unto you what i do prithee specify and i shall be fain to hearken well of a morning i aid his lordship at his lever and after breakfast i commonly ride with him if it be my turn then will he read an hour or twain in the law without the parliament be sitting when he is much busied being not only a morning man but at committees also in the afternoon he is often at court or practising of musicjust now he exerciseth himself in broken music the use of stringed instruments and brachigraphy shorthand then in the evening we join my lady and her gentlewomen in the withdrawing chamber and divers gestes and conceits be usedsuch as singing making of anagrams guessing of riddles and so forth there is my day forsooth and a useless one it is commented she the lawbooks and the parliament business seem the only decent things in it ah tis full little changed remarked lady louvaine these sixty years since i dwelt at surrey place and she sighed temperance i am astonished at you interposed faith you do nought save faultfind poor aubrey poor aubrey ay that he is returned his aunt and like to be a sight poorer for all that i can see if youll faultfind him a bit more faith therell not be so much left for me to do what is the matter asked edith coming softly in theres a pair of velvet pantofles and an other of silken hose the matter my dear answered temperance and a beaver hat with a brave blue feather in it i trust you admire them as they deserve and him likewise that weareth them they are brave indeed said edith in her quiet voice i would fain hope it is as fair within as without my boy she looked up in his face as she spoke with yearning love in her eyes and as aubrey bent his head to kiss her he said in the softest tone which he had yet employed since his entrance i am afraid not aunt edith and edith answered in that low tender voice thy beauty was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee dear aubrey let us seek that aubrey made no answer beyond a smile and quickly turned the conversation on his mother asking if he brought any news but little said he there be new laws against witchcraft which is grown greater and more used than of old and the king is mightily set against itfolks say he is afraid of it none should think i ensure you how easily frightened is his majesty and of matters that should never fright any save a child but that is not news aubrey said his mother plaintively i want to hear something new there isnt an artichoke in the market this morrow suddenly remarked her sister temperance what do you mean why thats news isnt it i am sure you did not know it till i told you mrs louvaine closed her eyes with an air of deeplytried forbearance come lad out with thy news added temperance wherewith hath my lady guarded her new spring gowns that shall serve i reckon aubrey laughed i have not seen them yet aunt but i heard say of one of the young gentlewomen that silk is now for the first to be woven in england so tis like to be cheaper than of old theres a comfort said mrs louvaine rather less languidly than usual i heard tell likewise of a fresh colewort from cyprus in the east they call it broccoli or kaleflower methinks there is nought else without you would hear of a new fashion of building of churches late come upbut his lordship saith tis a right ancient fashion wherein the old greeks were wont to build their houses and temples methinks it scarce meet to go to the heathen for the pattern of a church said lady louvaine are not our old churches fair enough and suitable for their purpose in this new fashion he no chancels said aubrey well and i should hold with that cried temperance they give rise to vain superstitions if there be no mass what lack we of a chancel if men list my dear to bring in the superstitions quietly remarked lady louvaine they shall scarce stick at the want of a chancel true madam yet would i fain make it as hard to bring them as ever i could aubrey left his friends about six oclock and hans followed him to the door on the steps there was a short lowtoned conversation hans after all thou art a good lad did i hurt thee tis all oer now aubrey no matter then i did well i am sorry shall i give thee a silver chain to make up old comrade all is made up prithee give me nothingsavemy brother aubrey aubreys tone was glib and light though with a slight subaccent of regret hanss voice was more hesitating and husky it cost hans much to allow any one a glimpse into his heart it cost aubrey nothing but as is often the case the guarded chamber contained rare treasure while in the open one there was nothing to guard thou art a good lad said aubrey again in a slightly ashamed tone as he took the offered hand truly hans i was after none ill only well i hate to be watched and dogged or aught like thereto who does not replied hans and in truth likewise i was but coming home and spake my astonishment at seeing you we are friends then god forbid we should ever be any thing else goodnight and god keep you in his way not many days afterwards an event happened of some consequence to our friends at the white bear their one powerful friend edward de vere earl of oxford died in june a strange study for a student of human nature is this earl of oxforda curious compound like his late royal lady of greatness and littleness he began life as a youthful exquisite his costumes were more extravagant his perfumes more choice his italian more pure and fluent than those of the other dilettante nobles of his time he was a minor poet of some note in his day and was esteemed to be the first writer of comedy then livingthough shakespeare was living too in middle life he blossomed out into a military patriot he ended his days as a hard cold morose old man his lifelamp was used up it had been made so to flare in early youth that there was no oil left to light him at the end when light and warmth were most needed having quarrelled with his fatherinlaw the great earl of burleigh he registered a savage and senseless vow to ruin his daughter which he could do only by ruining himself in pursuance of this insane resolution he spent right and left until his estate was wrecked and the innocent countess anne was hunted into her grave the son who succeeded to his fathers title and to the few acres which this mad folly had not flung away was a mere boy of twelve years old it became a serious question in lady louvaines mind whether aubrey should remain in the household after the decease of the old earl she found however that the widowed countess elizabeth kept a very orderly house and a strict hand over her son and his youthful companions so that lady louvaine who saw no other door open thought it best to leave aubrey where he was the countess who had been maid of honour to queen elizabeth had been well drilled by that redoubtable lady into proper and submissive behaviour and she now required similar good conduct from her dependants with excellent reasons for absence or dereliction from duty that she was never deceived would be too much to say meanwhile matters progressed busily in the house by the riverside the conspirators took in a sixth accomplicechristopher wright the younger brother of johnand the six began their mine about the eleventh of december the wall of the house of lords was three yards in thickness the cellar of percys house was extremely damp being close to the river and the water continually oozed through into the mine finding their task more difficult than they had anticipated a seventh was now taken into the numbera pervert robert keyes the son of a protestant clergyman in derbyshire a second house was hired at lambeth of which keyes was placed in charge while to fawkes was committed the chief business of laying in the combustibles first in the lambeth house and afterwards of removing them to that at westminster fawkes went cautiously about his business purchasing his materials in various parts of the city so as not to excite suspicion he provided in all three thousand billets of wood five hundred faggots thirtysix barrels of gunpowder with stones and bars of iron in order that the explosion might be more destructive from the bankside or south bank of the thames where it lay in hampers twenty barrels of the powder was first brought in boats by night to the house at westminster where it was stored in the cellar to await the finishing of the mine by christmas they had penetrated the wall of percys house and had reached that of the house of lords they thought it desirable now to rest for the christmas holidays keyes was left in charge of the house at lambeth and the others departed in various directions well upon my word prithee good my master whos your tailor the speaker was temperance murthwaite who was clad in the plainest of brownish drab serges without an unnecessary tag or scrap of fringe and carried on her arm an unmistakable marketbasket from which protruded the legs of a couple of chickens and sundry fishtails notwithstanding the clean cloth which should have hidden such ignoble articles from public view the person addressed was mr aubrey louvaine and his costume was a marvel of art and a feast of colour my tailor is adrian sewell aunt in thieving lane like enough was the response well gentleman shall i the words died on aubreys lips his aunt who read his thoughts exactly stood wickedly enjoying the situation shall you carry the basket by all means if it please your highness have a care though lest the tails of those whitings sully yon brave crimson velvet and see the fowls thrust not their talons into that spanish lace methinks master aubrey considering your bravery of array you were best pocket your civility this morrow itll be lesser like to harm the lace and velvet than the chicks legs and the fishtails you may keep me company an you will if i be good enough to trudge alongside so fine a whitsuntide show as you are thats two of em of what aunt said aubrey feeling about as unhappy as a mixture of humiliation and apprehension could make him if they were to meet one of lord oxfords gentlemen or one of his wealthy acquaintances he felt as though he should want the earth to open and swallow him suits gentleman was the reply blue and white the first crimson and silver the second havent seen the green and gold yet nor the yellow nor purple suppose theyre in the wardrobe rather early times to be thus bedizened or seems so to working folksthe abbey clock went eight but a few minutes since but quality is donned early i know as mistress temperance emitted this tingling smallshot of words she was marching with some rapidity up old palace yard and the abbey close her magnificent nephew keeping pace with her right sore against his will at last aubrey could bear no longer the windows of the golden fish were in sight and his soul was perturbed by a vision of the fair dorothy who might be looking out and whose eyes might light on the jewel of himself in this extremely incongruous setting of aunt temperance and the fishtails aunt temperance couldnt aubreys words did not come so readily as usual that morning couldnt i walk slower suggested the aggravating person who was the cause of his misery well belike i couldtheres mrs gertrude up at the window yonderwithout tis mrs dorothytheres no hurry in especial only i hate to waste time and suiting the action to the word aunt temperance checked her steps so as to give the young lady whether it were gertrude or dorothy a more leisurely view of the fishtails couldnt rachel go marketing instead of you sputtered out aubrey rachel has her own work and so has charity and so have i mr louvaine i suppose you havent as you seem to be gallivanting about westminster in crimson and silver at eight oclock of a morning now then aunt tis not my turn this morrow to wait on my lords lever i shall be at his coucher this even you may open the door my master if it demean not so fine a gentlemangood maid take my basket rachel the fish for dinner and the chicken for tomorrow theres nobut four whitings here mistress shouldnt there be five hush thee good maid theyre twopence apiece eh yo never sen say so ay but i do let be ill have a bit of green stuff or something and as rachel looking but half satisfied went off with the basket temperance threw open the parlour door madam suffer me to announce the duke of damask the prince of plush the viscount of velvet and the baron of bombast pray you look not for four nobles there is but one aubrey was the response in diverse tones from the three ladies the object of this attention did not look happy but he walked in and offered due greeting to his relatives temperance sat down untied her plain black hood and laid it aside and whither might your lordship be going when i captivated you asked she not to this house for you had passed it by in good sooth aunt i did noti meant indeedi should maybe have looked in stammered the young man tell no lies my lad for thou dost it very ill was aunt temperances most inconsiderate reply you might come to see us oftener im sure aubrey if you would said his mother in a plaintive voice it is hard when i have only one child that he should never care to come i wish you had been a girl like lettice and then we could have had some comfort out of you my dear said aunt temperance he is devoutly thankful hes not he doesnt want to be tied at the aprons of a parcel of women trust me have you had your pipe of openwork or what you are pleased to call it gentleman this morrow only think of hanging that filthy stench about those velvet fallals with whom spent you last even lad the question came so suddenly that aubrey was startled into truth with some friends of mine in the strand aunt the next instant he was sorry lets have their names said aunt temperance well tom rookwood was one folks generally put the best atop hope he wasnt the best who else some gentlemen to whom rookwood introduced me i want their names said the female examiner wellone of them is a mr winter aubrey spoke with great reluctance as his aunt saw well he selected winters name as being least uncommon of the group but he soon found that destiny in the person of aunt temperance did not mean to let him off so lightly as this what sort of an icicle is he he isnt an icicle at all aunt but a very good fellow and right pleasant company prithee bring him to see us where lodgeth heis he a london man he is a worcestershire gentleman on a visit hither pass him who else wella man named darcy a man and not a gentleman whence comes he i dont know scarcely a gentleman seeing he deals in horses horses are good fellows enough mostly but folks who deal in horses are apt to be worserwhy can i never tell is the horsedealer pleasant company belike not so much to my liking as mr winter im fain to hear it who else there is a mr percy kin to my lord northumberland aunt temperance drew in her breath with an inverted whistle lo you now we are in select society but edith turned suddenly round aubrey is he a true protestant she knew that lord northumberland was reckoned the head of the recusants i really dont know aunt replied aubrey to whom the idea had never before occurred i never heard him say aught whence i could guess it he is a very agreeable man the more agreeable maybe the more dangerous my boy do have a care he that is not with me is against me oh hes all right i am sure said aubrey carelessly you seem sure on small grounds said aunt temperance well have we made an endis he the last no there is one othermr catesby aubrey had deliberately left catesby to the last yet he could not have explained for what reason lady louvaine spoke for the first time catesbya catesby of ashby ledgers i have not heard further than that his home is in northamptonshire and his mother the lady anne catesby i think it is they are a popish family or were not many years ago aubrey come here the young man obeyed in some surprise his gentle grandmother was not wont to speak in tones of such stern determination as these my boy she said i charge thee on my benison and by the dear memory of him from whom thou hast thy name that thou endeavour thyself to thine utmost to discover whether these men be papists or no ask not of themselvesthey may deceive thee and a papist oft counts deceit no wrong when it is done in the interests of his church make my compliments to my cousin my lady oxford and give her the names of these gentlemen and where they lodge saying also that i do most earnestly beseech that she will make inquiry by her chaplain and give me to know how they stand concerned in this matter aubrey you know not the danger of such friendship i do obey me at your peril never in his life had aubrey heard such words from the usually soft sweet lips of the lady lettice he was thoroughly frightened all the more because the dangers to be feared were so vague and unknown a few minutes before he had been feeling vexed with his aunt temperance for catechising him so strictly about his friends now this sensation had quite given way before astonishment and vague apprehension yes madam i will he answered gravely and he meant it but what a number of excellent people and what a multiplicity of good deeds there would be in this naughty world if only that little conjunction could be left out aubrey quitted the white bear with the full intention of carrying out his grandmothers behest but not just now he must do it of course before he saw her again lady oxford might take it into her head to pay a visit to lady louvaine in which case it would surely be discovered if the question had not been passed on of course it must be done only not just now he might surely spend a few more pleasant evenings at winters lodgings before he set on foot those disagreeable inquiries which might end in his being deprived of the pleasure lady oxford therefore was not troubled that eveningnor the next nor indeed for a goodly number to follow but within a week of his visit to the white bear when the sharp edge of his grandmothers words had been a little blunted by time and the cares of other things had entered in aubrey again made his way to the lodgings occupied by winter at the sign of the duck in the strand hard by temple bar there were various reasons for this action in the first place aubrey was entirely convinced that the judgment of a man of twentyone was to be preferred before that of a woman of seventyseven secondly he enjoyed winters society thirdly he liked winters tobacco fourthly he admired betty who usually let him in and who being even more foolish than himself was not at all averse to a few empty compliments and a little frothy banter which he was very ready to bestow for aubrey was not of that sterling metal of which his grandfather had been made who loved one only and who clave to her and to whom it would have been a moral impossibility to flirt with one woman while he was making serious love to another lastly the society of his friends had acquired an added zest by the probability of its being a dangerous luxury he loved dearly to poise himself on the edge of peril though of course like all who do so he had not the slightest intention of falling in on the evening in question betty made no appearance and aubrey was let in by her mistress a plainfeatured middleaged woman on whom he had no temptation to waste his perfumes he made his way up the stairs to winters door and his hand was on the latch when he heard percys voice through by the seventh of february youll be nothing of the sort i cry you mercy i think we shall answered catesby aubrey lifted the latch and entered four gentlemen sat round the firewinter and catesby percy whom aubrey knew and in whose hand was the pipe and a fourth a tall dark and rather finelooking man with brown hair auburn beard and a moustache the ends of which curled upwards ha mr louvaine you are right welcome said winter rising to greet his young friend while percy took his pipe from his lips and offered it to the latter nobody introduced the stranger and aubrey took but little notice of him especially as thenceforth he sat in silence he might have paid more if he could have known that after three hundred years had rolled by and the names of all then known as eminent men should have faded from common knowledge the name of that man should be fresh in the memory of every englishman and deeply interesting to every english boy he was in the company of guy fawkes to appear as a nameless stranger and indeed to appear at all as little as possible was fawkess policy at this moment he was just about to present himself on the stage as john johnson mr percys man and for any persons in london to know him by his own name would be a serious drawback for it was to a great extent because he was unknown in town that he had been selected to play this part yet matters were not quite ready for the assumption of his new character he therefore sat silent and was not introduced they smoked sipped rhenish wine and chatted on indifferent subjects for an hour or more discussed the sleeping preacher richard haydock then just rising into notorietywho professed to deliver his sermons in his sleep and was afterwards discovered to be an imposter the last benefaction in the parish church for two poor irish gentlewomen on their journey home recommended by letters from the council the last new ballad but have you beheld asked winter when these topics were exhausted the kings new caroche of the german fashion with a roof to fall asunder at his majestys pleasure i have said catesby and methinks it shall take with many gentlewomen more in especial wherefore now inquired percy laughing think you gentlewomen lack air rather than gentlemen or that they shall think better to show their dainty array and their fair faces a little of both was the answer there is truly great increase in coaches of late years remarked winter why the saddlers are crying out they are like to be ruined said percy the roads are cloyed and pestered and the horses lamed ay and that is not the worst of it added catesby evildisposed persons who dare not show themselves openly for fear of correction shadow and securely convey themselves in coaches and so are not to be distinguished from persons of honour the whole company agreed that this was extremely shocking and piously denounced all evildisposed persons in a style which aubrey thought most edifying as he walked back later he meditated whether he should make those inquiries of lady oxford that night and decided not to do so no real papist or traitor thought the innocent youth would be likely to denounce evildisposed persons the airs they had been singing before parting recurred to his mind and he hummed fragments of them as he went along row well ye mariners all in a garden green phillida flouts me and the catch of whoop barnaby finishing up with greensleeves and one or two madrigalsthese had been their evening entertainment but madrigals were becoming unfashionable and were not heard now so often as formerly the music of elizabeths day which was mainly harmony with little melody containing scarcely any tune that the uncultivated ear could carry away was giving way to a less learned but more melodious style along with this there was a rapid increase in the cultivation of instrumental music while vocal music continued to be exceedingly popular it was usual enough for tradesmen and artisans to take part in autiphons glees and partsongs of all kinds while ballads were in such general favour that balladmongers could earn twenty shillings a day a bass viol generally hung in a drawingroom for the visitors to play but the few ladies who used this instrument were thought masculine the education of girls at this time admitted of scarcely any accomplishment but music they were taught to read write sew and cook to play the virginals lute and cithern and to read pricksong at sightnamely to sing from the score without accompaniment those who were acquainted with any language beside their own were the few and highlycultured and a girl who knew french or italian was still more certain to have learned latin if not greek german and spanish were scarcely ever taught indeed the former was regarded as quite outside the list of learnable tongues it was a sore trouble to aubrey that the white bear and the golden fish were next door to each other had he had the ordering of their topography they would have been so situated that he could have dropped into the latter to sun himself in the eyes of the fair dorothy without the least fear of being seen from the former he stood in wholesome fear of his aunt temperances sharp speeches and had a less wholesome because more selfish dislike of his mothers ceaseless complaints moreover aunt edith was wont to disturb his equanimity by a few quiet occasional words which would ring in his ears for days afterwards and make him very uncomfortable her speeches were never long but they were often weighty and were adapted to make their hearers consider their ways and think what they would do in the end thereofa style of consideration always unwelcome to aubrey and especially so since his view of the world had been enlarged by coming to london he was just now in an awkward position and the centre and knot of the awkwardness was dorothy rookwood he was making no way with dorothy her brother he met frequently at winters rooms but if he wished to see her he must go to her home if he went there he must call at the white bear if he did that he must first deliver his grandmothers message to lady oxford and only suppose that lady oxfords inquiries should lead to discoveries which would end in a rupture between the golden fish and the white bearin aubreys receiving an order to drop all acquaintance with the rookwoods for aubreys training while very kindly conducted had been one of decided piety and unchanged as was his heart the habits and tone of eighteen years were not readily shaken off he could not feel easy in doing many things that he saw others do he could not take upon his lips with impunity words which he heard freely used around him his conscience was unseared as yet and it tormented him sorely the result of these reflections was that aubrey turned into oxford house without visiting king street at all and sought his bed without making any attempt to convey the message before the conspirators resumed their work after the christmas holidays they took two more into their number these were robert winter of huddington the elder brother of thomas and john grant of norbrook who had married dorothy sister of the wrights catesby and thomas winter went down to the catherine wheel at oxford whence they sent for their friends to come to them and having first pledged them to secrecy they were then initiated into the plot it was about this christmas that catesby also took into his confidence the only one of the conspirators who was not a gentlemanhis own servant thomas bates partly because he had great opinion of him for his longtried fidelity and partly also because having been employed in carrying messages he suspected that he had some inkling of the secret and wished that like the rest he should be bound to keep it by oath bates is described as a yeoman and a man of mean station who had been much persecuted on account of religion having been desired to confirm his oath by receiving the sacrament with intention and as a prerequisite of this was confession bates went to greenway whom he acquainted with the particulars which he was not desirous to hear and asked if he might lawfully join in such work greenway directed him to keep the secret because it was for a good cause and forbade him to name the subject to any other priest this is batess account greenway asserts that bates never named the subject to him either in or out of confession but the jesuit code of morality required his denial if he had heard it in confession only poor bates was the most innocent of the conspirators and the most truly penitent he was rather a tool and a victim than a miscreant he lost his life through neglect of a muchforgotten preceptif sinners entice thee consent thou not the conspirators now set to work again on their mine and wrought till candlemas day by which time they were half through the wall of the house fawkes was on all occasions the sentinel they had provided themselves with baktmeats pasties and hardboiled eggs sufficient for twenty days in order to avoid exciting the suspicions of their neighbours by constantly bringing fresh provisions to a house supposed to be occupied by one person alone the labour was very severe especially to catesby and percy on account of their unusual height the oozing in of the water was a perpetual annoyance but one day something terrible occurred as the amateur miners plied their picks with diligence the toll of a bell was suddenly heard john wright who was furthest in the mine stopped with uplifted tool blessed saints what can that be work was unanimously suspended it comes from the very midst of the wall said catesby growing a shade paler refugium peccatorum ora pro nobis piously entreated percy crossing himself call mr fawkes suggested christopher mr fawkes was summoned by his official name of johnson and coming down into the cellar declared that he also distinctly heard the uncanny sound tis the devil that seeketh to make stay of our work pronounced percya most improbable suggestion for satan surely had no cause to interfere with his servants when engaged in his own business have we here any holy water asked catesby ay there is in the bedchamber said fawkes pray you fetch it quickly the holy water was at once brought and the wall was sprinkled with it at that moment the tolling ceased blessed be our lady the holy water hath stayed it said percy after a few minutes pause the work was recommenced but it had gone on for barely an hour when again the unearthly bell began its work once more the benitier was brought and the wall sprinkled whereupon the diabolical noise stopped at once for several days these processes were repeated the bell invariably being silenced by the sprinkling of the blessed element at least so said the conspirators about the second of february there was another scare a strange rushing noise was heard on the other side of the wall from what cause was unknown and catesby as usual the chief director whispered to fawkes to go out and ascertain what it was fawkes accordingly went upstairs and out into the street a waggon stood before the door of the house of lords and men were busy carrying sacks and tubs from the cellar to the waggon charcoal only was then sold by the sack seacoal being disposed of in tubs goodmorrow master said roger neck the servant who was superintending the transaction as fawkes paused a moment apparently to look on after the fashion of an idle man roger had seen him more than once passing in and out of percys house but he was the only one of the plotters ever visible in the daytime goodmorrow friend selling your coals off ay were doing a middling stroke of business this morrow how much a load we shall want some ere long charcoal fourteen shillings cannel sixpence to ninepence according to quality fawkes walked down the street to avoid suspicion into king street where he turned into the first shop to which he came it happened to be a cutlers and he bought the first thing he sawa dozen knives of sheffield make had they been londonmade they would have cost four times as much as the modest shilling demanded for them he then returned to percys house carrying the knives in his hand fawkes had now fully blossomed out in his new role of mr percys man and was clad in blue camlet accordingly blue being then the usual wear of servants out of livery what is it johnson asked percy addressing fawkes by his assumed name when he came down into the cellar it is a dozen of sheffield knives master replied fawkes a little drily and by the same token our next neighbour is selling his coals and looks not unlike to clear out his cellar is that all that is all two of the conspirators looked at each other if you could hire the cellar suggested catesby done said percy it should save us a peck of trouble who owns itor who hath it asked catesby why for who owns it i guess the parliament house answered fawkes but for who hath it that must we discover pray you make haste and discover it then fawkes went out again to make inquiries he found without difficulty that the cellar like the houses adjoining was held by the wyniards and it was agreed that percy should call on them and endeavour to obtain it he accordingly went to see his landlady to whom he represented that he wished to bring his wife up to live with him in londonshe was in the country at present and he missed her sorelybut if that were done he must have more stowage for wood and coals mrs wyniards interest was aroused at once in a man who cared for his wife and felt a want of her society well now i am sorry said she you see weve let that vault to mrs skinnerleastwise mrs bright she is nowo king street to store her coals her new husbands a coalseller see you you should have had it as sure as can be if i hadnt it were very much to my commodity said percy truthfully this time if i could hire that cellar andthe second half of the sentence was a falsehoodi have already been to mrs skinner and hold her consent well now but thats a bit mean o skinners wife said mrs wyniard in a vexed tone she shouldnt ha done that and neer ha let me know i wouldnt ha thought that of ellen skinnerno i wouldnt but suggested percy insinuatingly if i gave you twenty shillings over for your goodwill and prayed you to say nought to mrs skinner and i will likewise content her well you know how to drive a bargain forsooth answered mrs wyniard laughing come ill let widow skinner bemistress bright i mean you shall have the vault for four pounds a quarter if so be shes content percys next visit was to the coalseller and his bride mr bright was not at home but mrs bright was and though she could not write her name note she could use her tongue to some purpose to be sure we hold the cellar sixteen pound by the year and thats plenty takes a many loads of coals to make that i warrant you i wondered said percy in a careless manner as though he did not much care whether he got it or not whether you might let me the cellar for the same purpose i think to lay in wood and coals for the winter and my own cellar is scarce large enough for i am a northern man and love a good fire this cellar of yours being so close by should be greatly to my convenience if you were willing well to be sure and it would so assented innocent mrs bright you see i cant speak certain till my master comes in but im sure you may take it as good he mostly does as i bid him so well say if mrs wyniard be content to accept the rent from you you shall have it at four pound by the quarter and give me forty shillings in my hand note done said percy if your husband consent ill see to it he doth she answered with a capable nod the bargain was struck andrew bright did as he was told and percy was to become the occupant of the cellar without delay note she signed her deposition by a mark while her servant roger neck wrote his name note examination of ellen bright gunpowder plot book article chapter six wait a month alas longsuffering and most patient god thou needst be surelier god to bear with us than even to have made us elizabeth barrett browning the conspirators had just concluded their bargain and decided that the cellar must be stored with materials in all haste to be ready for the meeting of parliament on the seventh of february when like a bombshell in their midst fell a royal proclamation proroguing parliament again until the third of october to go on now especially in haste was plainly a useless proceeding a short consultation was held which ended in the decision that they should part and scatter themselves in different places fawkes particularly was enjoined to keep out of the way since he was wanted to appear as a stranger when the moment arrived for action he therefore determined to go abroad the rest dispersed in various directions percy was left alone at the house in westminster where he beguiled his leisure by having a door made through the wall where the mine had been so as to give him easier access to the vault under the house and better opportunities of carrying in the combustibles unseen they agreed to meet again ready for work on the second of september and before parting one other was admitted to their fellowship to whom was confided the task of aiding fawkes to accumulate the store of powder this was mr ambrose rookwood of coldham hall suffolk before fawkes left england he accomplished one important piece of business by carrying into the vault beneath the house all the wood and coals hitherto stored in percys cellar among it was carefully hidden the gunpowder also in waiting billets of wood being heaped upon the barrels the door was then locked and fawkes took the key marking the door on the inside in such a manner that its having been opened could be detected thereafter the wife of the porter gideon gibbons the next door neighbour was placed in charge of percys house in which no telltale combustibles had now been left keyes was made again custodian of the house at lambeth these arrangements being complete percy went to see his wife whom he had left in the country and fawkes embarking at dover took his journey to brussels where he resumed his own name when aubrey applied next at the door of winters lodgings he was informed that the gentlemen were gone into the country he turned back disappointedafter a little frothy banter with betty which it would be a sad waste of paper and ink to detailand began to consider what he should do next a sensation of extreme relief came to his mind as the idea occurred to him that there could be no need at all to make any inquiries during the absence of his friends he might visit the fair dorothy and even venture into the jaws of the white bear without fear of any thing unpleasant merely to say that his friends had left town and he was not now cultivating their society would surely satisfy his grandmother and as for any thing elsewhy let fate take care of the future being usually the creature of impulse no sooner was this said or rather thought than it was done aubrey turned away from the duck and retraced his steps to charing cross left whitehall behind him and came out into king street now came the tug of war would he meet aunt temperance or would that formidable and irresistible individual pounce upon him from the door but all was still and he reached the golden fish without any mishap another disappointment he was shown into the parlour where gertrude rose to meet him and mrs rookwood came in a few minutes later tom was spending the evening with friends and anne was with him aubrey cared nothing about anne whom he mentally dubbed a stupid idiot for toms absence he was more sorry but what was dorothy doing that she did not shine on her worshipper had you honoured us with a visit last tuesday mr louvaine said gertrude glancing at him as she was wont to do out of the corners of her dark eyes we had enjoyed the happiness of bringing you acquainted with our uncle rookwood of coldham hall he left us o wednesday in the morning for his place in suffolk doll is gone with him placidly added mrs rookwood the bright colours of gertrudes embroidery took a sudden tarnish in the eyes of the visitor ay for a month or two said gertrude lightly she shall find a merry house at coldham you may be sure our cousins and all the burgesses and the collinsonsever so many young gentlemen and gentlewomenand with a slight significant laugh mr roland burgess in particular aubrey felt as if he should exceedingly have enjoyed despatching mr roland burgess to the caucasus or cochinchina or any other inconceivably remote locality he did not stay long after that there was nothing to keep him bows and courtesies were exchanged and aubrey feeling as if life were flat and unsatisfying turned into the white bear it was nearly dusk and he could not see whom he met by the parlour door is that your lordship greeted him in the voice of aunt temperance blue or yellow this even truly we scarce looked for so much honour as two visits in the twelvemonth why without i err tis not yet three months since we had leave to see your lordships crimson and silver pray you walk inyou are as welcome as flowers in may as wise as waltoms calf and as safe to mend as sour ale in summer you are full of compliments aunt temperance said aubrey half vexed and half laughing im like with strangers gentleman aubrey went past her into the parlour to receive a warmer and less sarcastic welcome from the rest of his relativeshis mother excepted who reminded him in her usual plaintive tones that she was a poor widow and it was very hard if she might never see her only child well i am here mother ay but you scarce ever come tis ever so long that we have not seen you tis cruel of my lord oxford thus to keep you away from your poor mother my lord oxford has less to do with it my dear than mr aubrey louvaine said her sister young men dont commonly reckon their mothers company the sweetest they never know on which side their breads buttered no butter will stick on my bread aunt said aubrey answering one proverb by another instead of replying aunt temperance lighted a candle and calmly looked her nephew over well said she as the result of her inspection if i were donned in grassgreen velvet guarded o black with silver tags and a silverbossed girdle and gloves o spanish leather i should fancy id got a bit o butter on my bread maybe your honour likes it thick promotes effusing of bile that doth pray you how fare your papistical friends this even lady louvaine looked up and listened for the answer you set it down they be papistical somewhat too soon aunt said aubrey a little irritably mr winter and his friends if they be whom you hit at be gone away into the country and i have not seen them this some time the next question put to him was the one that aubrey was expecting with an expectation which caused his irritability what said my lady oxford to the matter aubrey truly madam i have not yet made the inquiration my lady is at this time full of business and seeing my friends were away i thought you should not require haste aubreys conscience stirred a little uneasily and he said to it be quiet i have not told any falsehood i would not have you to chafe your lady if she have no time to listen said lady louvaine with a disappointed look but indeed aubrey the matter must be seen to and not done by halves moreover a rap at the door preceded charity who came to announce mrs abbotta ceremony always used at the white bear but entirely unnecessary in the eyes of the lady of the angel well what think you she began before her greetings were well over for mistress abbott was a genuine athenian who spent all her leisure hours and some hours when she should not have been at leisure in first gathering information and then retailing it not having any special care to ascertain its accuracy well what think you here be three of our neighbours to be presented by the street wardenslewce the baker for that they cannot keep his pigs out of the kings street joan cotton the silkwoman as a sower of strife amongst her neighbours and adrian sewell for unlawfully following the trade of a tailor why that is thy tailor aubrey exclaimed aunt temperance i trust thou art not deep in his books never a whit aunt i owe him neer a penny said aubrey flushing and not adding that mr william patricks books were separate volumes nor that those of nathan cohen in knightriders street were not entirely guiltless of his name ay thats the way said mrs abbott nodding her head pay as you go and keep from small scores truly i would mr louvaine our stephen were as wise as you such a bill as came in this week past from a silkman in paternoster row white satin collars at eight and ten shillings the piece and a doublet of the same at two pound curled feathers and velvet doublets and perfumed gloves at twenty pence or more his fathers in a heavy taking i can tell you and saith he shall be ruined look you weve four lads and heres stephen agoing this pathand if seth and caleb and ben just go along after stephen itll be a fine kettle o fish i can tell you oh dear but youve a deal to be thankful for and only one to trouble you the bicker those lads do make we have all something wherefore we may be thankful friend said lady louvaine gently when mrs abbott stopped to breathe well then theres the maidsmall and silence and prissy and dorcas and hesterand i can promise you they make such a racket amongst em im very nigh worn to a shadow aubrey and lettice were giving funny glances at each other and doing their utmost not to disgrace the family by laughing if mrs abbott were worn to a shadow shadows were very portly and substantial articles i declare that prissy shes such a rattle as never you saw no getting a word in for her i tell her many a time i wonder her tongue does not ache such a chatterbox as she is im no talker you see nobody can say such a thing of me but as to her a curious sound in aubreys direction was rapidly followed by a cough eh now dont you say youve a spring cough ejaculated mrs abbott turning her artillery on that young gentleman horehound and mallow and coltsfoot theyre the best herbs and put honey to em and take it fasting of a morrow there be that saith this new stuff of late come uptobago or what they call itmy husband says he never heard of aught with so many names talking o names have you seen that young maid daughter of the baker new set up at back here whatever on earth possessed him to call her penelope dear heart but they say theres a jolly brunt betwixt my lord rich and his ladyshe that was my lady penelope devereux you know my lord he is a great puritan and a favourer of that way and my lady she likes a pretty gown and a gay dance as well as eer a one so the wars have fallen out betwixt em if it like you mistress abbott said charity opening the door immediately after a knock heres your ben that says your master wants you ay shouted ben from the door in no dulcet tones and he said if you didnt come hed fetch you you were safe to be gossiping somewhere he said and says he take that for your imperence sir was his mothers answer hurrying to the door with a gesture suited to the words well i do vow if ever i come forth to have half a word with a neighbour that man o mines sure for to call it gossipingget away wi thee im coming in a winkwell but you do look cheery and peaceful i would i could ha tarried a bit mrs lettice my dear you take warning by me and dont you marry a man as gives you no liberty stand up for your rights my dear and get emthats what i say good even theres no end to the imperence of lads and no more to the masterfulness of men dont you have nought to do with em goodnight i could not have stood it another minute said aubrey as soon as she was out of hearing while he and lettice made the walls echo on a calm june evening three men met at a house in thames street where garnet lodged they were robert catesby the reverend oswald greenway and the reverend henry garnet they met to consult and decide on the last uncertainties and as it were to finish off the scheme of the plot the conclusions ended garnet let out his friends who with hats drawn low down and faces muffled in their cloaks glided softly and darkly away as the month of august ran out the conspirators gradually returned to london with some exceptions who joined their ghostly father garnet in a pious pilgrimage to saint winifreds well better known as holywell in flintshire the party numbered about thirty and comprised lady digby two daughters of lord vaux rookwood and his wife thomas winter wrote to grant that friends would reach norbrook on the second or third of september begging him to void his house of morgan and his shemate as otherwise it would hardly bear all the company the route taken was from goathurst the home and inheritance of lady digby by daventry norbrook the residence of grant huddington the house of robert winter and shrewsbury to holt in flintshire in some uneasy nightmare during that pilgrimage did a faint prescience of that which was to come ever flit before the eyes of ambrose rookwood as to the circumstances wherein he should journey that road again from holt the ladies walked barefoot to the holy well which according to tradition had sprung up on the place where saint winifreds head had rolled on being cut off they remained at the well for the night they returned the same way mass being said by garnet at huddington and norbrook it is difficult to believe that those who went on this pilgrimage could be wholly innocent of intention respecting the plot so soon to be executed fawkes arrived from abroad on the first of september staying the first night at an inn outside aldgate the next day he went down to the tower wharf hailed a boat and was ferried to westminster where under his alias of john johnson and percys servant he relieved mrs gibbons of her charge took possession of his masters house and of the cellar where was stored his masters stock of winter fuel a careful examination of the door of the vault showed that it had not been tampered with during the absence of the conspirators winter now returned to london taking up his abode in his old quarters at the duck where keyes rookwood and christopher wright had apartments also catesby and percy did not return till later the latter had gone to bath where he found lord monteagle and the two sent to catesby entreating the dear robin to join them catesby obeyed and came the bath as it was then usual to call the ancient city of hot springs was a very different town from that which we now know like all of roman origin its design was cruciform with four gates and as usual a church at every gate the only one of these churches now standingand that has been rebuiltis saint jamess at south gate the modern fashionable part of bath including milsom street the circus and the crescent lies outside the walls of the ancient aqua solis mr catesby found his friends in cheap street which ran from stawles church in the midst of the city to east gate here he vegetated for a week resting after his toil and applying himself to the business which had apparently brought him by diligent attendance at the kings bath on the site of the present pumproom here at this time ladies and gentlemen in elaborate costumes and adorned by wonderful hairdressing bathed together under the eyes of the public which contributed its quota of amusement and interest by pelting the bathers with dead dogs cats and pigsa state of things not considered disgusting but laughable on the morning after the arrival of catesby he and percy went down to the east gate hailed a boat which ferried them across the avon where laura place now stands and leaving bathwick mill on the left hand they began to ascend the hill on whose summit once stood the yet older british city of caer badon mr percy said catesby as they walked slowly upwards since i have tarried here i have had some time for thought and i can tell you i am nigh beat out of heart touching our matter you mr catesby truly i never thought to see you struck into your dumps but what now i beseech you gentlemen did not at that time speak to each other without the respectful prefix of mister though they might now and then speak of an acquaintance without it when intimacy was so great as to warrant laying it aside the christian name took its place well look you here said catesby we are all men of birth but not one of us is a man of money you tis true have my lord northumberland behind you but how long time may he tarry were he to die or to take pepper in the nose where then are we all is naught with us at once being all but mean men of estate my cousin of northumberland is not like to play that prank or i err answered percy who well knew that lord northumberland was not in all cases cognisant of the use made of his name by this very worthy cousin as to death of course that may hapwe are all prone to be tumbled out of the world at short notice but what then is your project for without you have some motion in your mind good mr catesby i read you not aright to be sure i have said catesby with a smile but firstif i remember rightly your friend young louvaine is not he that can aid us in this juncture hasnt a penny to bless himself with replied percy save his wage from my lord oxford and that were but a drop in the sea for us his old grandmother can do but little for himso much have i picked out of his prattle but surely mr catesby you would not think to take into our number a green lad such as he and a simpleton and a protestant to boot take into our number cried catesby good mr percy you miss the cushion make a mistake a good tale well tinkered should serve that companion and draw silver from his pockets any day what we lack is two or three men of good estate and of fit conditions and discreet years that may safely be swornand i think i know where to find them ill lay my crown to pawn you do exclaimed percy admiringly pray you who be they sir everard digby of tilton in rutland and my cousin frank tresham of rushton good men and true both are strange to me ay digby is a staunch catholic but may lack some persuasion to join us treshamwell i count he may be trusted his moneybags be heavy though his character is but light i will make certain that he will not blab nor tattlethat is the thing most to be feared know you not frank treshammy cousin and my lord monteagles wifes brother oh ay i have met him said percy i wist not it was he you meant i had hope once that mr fawkes should bring grist to our mill said gatesby thoughtfully but i see that is but a willothewisp mr fawkes oh no his father was but a younger sonmr edward fawkes of farnley a notary at york and registrar of the consistory court there he left him but a farm of some thirty pound by the year and guy ran through it like a herring through the water the only hope by his means would be the borrowing of money from his stepfather mr foster and methinks he hath a larger heart than purse they walked on for a few minutes in silence when percy said how will you get hold of these men send tom winter to sir everard and i will tackle tresham then when i return will we go forth with the mine done said percy and the pair of conspirators came down the hill instead of returning direct to london catesby went to visit robert winter at huddington percy going to his own house at the upper end of holborn catesby remained for three days with robert winter whom he induced to send for stephen littleton of holbeach and his cousin humphrey littleton these gentlemen were not however initiated into the plot but only desired to lend their assistance to a matter of weight and for the especial good of all catholics the christmas holidays being over the mining was resumed the conspirators having now added to their number francis tresham and sir everard digby it was not done without some difficulty the oath was administered to both but when they learned to what they had bound themselves they recoiled in horror sir everard was disposed of with comparative ease his own good sense led him to demur but no sooner was he told that three priests had approved of the scheme than as in duty bound the poor weak creature laid his good sense aside told his conscience to be quiet and united cordially and thoroughly in the project finding horses arms and money to the amount of pounds if the church approved the prerogative of the laity was to listen and to obey francis tresham proved less pliable he at once inquired if the roman catholic peers were to be warned so as to keep away from parliament on the doomed day generally only said catesby we have let them understand that strict laws are to be passed against the catholics which they cannot prevent and therefore they had best tarry away my lord arundel though he be not of age is very desirous to be present said percy my lord montague on the contrary part would fain be thence returned catesby and i have told him he can do no good there i asked my lord mordaunt if he meant to come said winter laughing and quoth he nay for i was too much disgusted at the former session being forced to sit there with my robes on all the time the king was in church note but surely cried tresham looking from one to another you will take some further means to save our brethren than only these mr percy you never will suffer your cousin the earl of northumberland to perish indeed mr tresham i should be loth so to do because i am bounden to him gentlemen said the voice of fawkes who had hitherto been silent in the conclave what we must principally respect is our own safety and we will pray for the catholic lords and how shall we set ourselves right with the catholic commons demanded keyes oh we will satisfy the catholics at large that the act is done for the restitution of religion answered catesby and the heretics that it was to prevent the union sought to be established at this parliament sirs i cannot brook this tresham broke in eagerly my lords monteagle and stourton as you know have wedded my sisters i implore you to warn them at the least i do beseech you save my lord monteagle what to tell him what shall hap cried catesby never impossible mr tresham replied percy i regret it as much as you they shall be warned cried tresham vehemently remember your oath answered catesby sternly i shall not forget it but something must be done to save my lord monteagle i am beholden to him and i love him dear well well suggested winter making an endeavour to cast oil upon the troubled waters can you not be earnest with him to do something on that day which shall carry him out of the way i am afraid not said tresham shaking his head he will reckon it his duty to be there or i err time enough betwixt now and october said fawkes ay time enough indeed echoed winter my lord monteagle may be abroad or what not when the parliament opens pray you mr tresham trouble not yourself i doubt not all shall go well tresham murmured something to the effect that things left to drift as they would did not invariably drift into the right harbour but he dropped the topic for the moment hitherto the secret meetings of the conspirators had been in the house beyond clements inn but it was now deemed necessary to have a more secluded and secure retreat in the forest depths of enfield chase was an old huntinglodge named white webbs never used except occasionally by sportsmen this was selected as a nonsuspicious place of meeting the conspirators were now nearly ready a few days would make them quite so satan was also ready and probably required no time for preparation and god was ready too they met at white webbs on the st of september just a fortnight before the day appointed for the meeting of parliament catesby the winters the wrights digby keyes grant and bates tresham was not there he had ceased to attend the meetings and said if lord monteagle at least might not be saved he would neither find the money he had promised nor assist any further with the plot they had not sat many minutes when percy and fawkes joined them the former impetuous person being in an evident state of suppressed excitement while the latter very cool individual showed no trace of emotion now what think you cried percy the parliament is prorogued yet again sure they have never wind of our project suggested one of the brothers wright till when demanded catesby knitting his brows for another monthtill the fifth of november catesby pondered for a moment in silence is there any stir thereaboutsany search made of the house or the vault nono semblance thereof then i think they have not got wind of it but if somr fawkes is all the powder now in the cellar no mr catesby there are five or six barrels to come which i meant to move thither on monday night next wait a little you had best make sure that all is safe tarry for another fortnight and move them then is this not your minds gentlemen the rest of the group as usual deferred to their leader there was now another point requiring discussion and it was introduced by catesby tis time methinks gentlemen that we took thought on a question whereof we have not yet spoken after the thing you wot of is done what then shall follow if not the king alone be present there but the queen also and maybe the prince if they be we will not save them interjected fawkes we need not coolly responded catesby but if all be gone who then shall be published or elected king why we have never entered into that consideration said grant dubiously had we not best enter into it our plans must be ready at once when the time comes not all hanging betwixt the eyelids ie in uncertainty the queen and prince are safe to be there said percy and in any case the prince were best away for if all be true that is said or the half thereof he were like to do us more mischief than his father he is not of the kings humour but more like old besshath a will of his own and was bred up strictly protestant bad that said catesby then the prince must go tis pity though observed robert winter a bright little lad catesby laughed scornfully come now robin no sensibility susceptibility sentimentality i beg we cannot afford to be punctual particular in this affair there are bright lads by the dozen everywhere as cheap as blackberries now what of the little duke the man who spoke thus was himself the father of two boys hell not be much of aught at five years old said winter mr percy you were the most like of any of us to win him into your hands percy as one of the band of gentleman pensioners whose duty it was to wait on the king had opportunities of access to the little prince beyond any of his accomplices i will undertake that said percy eagerly do we concur then to elect him king asked catesby hold good gentlemen by your leave we go something too fast said fawkes how if mr percy be unableas may beto win duke charles into his hands why then comes the lady elizabeth said winter what say you to the only englishborn of the royal issuethe lady mary she at least is uninfect with heresy there was a laugh at this suggestion for the princess mary was not quite five months old very well if we could win her answered catesby but she would be hard to come by nothe one easiest had and as likely as any to serve our turn is the young lady at combe let the memory of elizabeth the heretic so dear to the hearts of englishmen be extinguished in the brighter glories of elizabeth the catholic bring her up in the catholic faith and wed her to a catholic prince and i will lay mine head to pawn that she shall make a right royal queen and the star of englands glory shall suffer no tarnish in her hands i have seen the little maid and a bright brave bonnie lass she is how old asked robert winter nine years just the right age old enough to queen it and take a pleasure therein and not old enough to have drunk in much heresyno more than fathers garnet and gerard can soon distil out again nay too old mr catesby said thomas winter at five years the little duke might be so but not his sister at nine shell have learned heresy enough by then and women are more perverse than men they ever hold error tighter and truth likewise well have the little duke if you can win him replied catesby i doubt thereof trust me for that cried percy ill trust you to break your neck in the attempt said catesby with a grim smile but how look you to secure the lady elizabeth my lord harringtons an old fox and none so easy to beguile he shall smell a rat be sure before you have half your words out and then you may whistle for the rest of your hopesand are like enough to do it in the fleet or newgate kit wright said percy addressing the last speaker who was his wifes brother all the wit in the world is sure not in thine head thinkest we shall march up to the door at combe and sweetly demand of my lord harrington that he give us up the lady elizabeth why man we must compass the matter that he shall wit nought till all be done you might make a huntingparty suggested fawkes say you so mr fawkes you have eyes in your head well send sir everard digby down to see to that business how went your business mr catesby asked grant why right well mr grant i gathered together a goodly number of friends to assist the archduke albert in flanders bought horses and laid in powder all shall be ready when the archduke hath need of them the laugh went round that was a jolly fantasy of yours to levy troops for the archduke said robert winter truly these heretics are easy to beguile not one methinks hath the least suspicion it were soon up with us if they had added his brother look out for yourself tom and smoke not too many pipes with externs responded robert that young louvaine that you affecti scarce trust him that affects me you mean trust him i never do hes only a simpleton at best have you never heard of simpletons carrying tidings said fawkes mind you drop not any chance words mr winter that might do mischief let me alone for that was the answer gentlemen said catesby who had been in a brown study for some minutes methinks mr fawkess proposal to seize the lady elizabeth under cover of a huntingparty is good sir everard will you undertake this willingly where must they be gathered gather them at dunchurch said catesby for a hunt on dunsmoor heath and for the day of the parliaments meeting you shall have notice of the blow struck as quick as a horseman can reach you as soon as you hear it then away to combe and carry off the young lady to my mothers at ashby proclaim her queen and bring her next day to london proclaiming her in all the towns on your way may there not be some awkwardness in the matter if her brothers be alive suggested the most cautious of the party robert winter pooh ejaculated the impetuous percy nothing venture nothing have faint heart never won fair lady were more pertinent to the occasion said thomas winter raising a general laugh we must see to that grimly responded catesby the conspirators then separated sir everard digby set out for warwickshire percy went to see lord northumberland at syon keyes returned to lambeth and fawkes resumed his duties at the house on the riverbank mr marshall on his way to call at the white bear little guessed that the apparently respectable busy manservant in blue camlet who met him as he went down king street was engaged in an evil work which would hand down his name to everlasting infamy mrs abbott was standing at her door as he went past well to be sure so tis you parson hows mrs agnes this even i reckoned i saw her tother day apassing through the strand but she saw not mein a green perpetuance gown and a black camlet hood i trust itll wear better than mine for if ever a camlet was no worth tis that dear heart the roguery of wooldrapers and mercers beside i do hope master floriszoon ll not learn none of their tricks if i see my lady lettice this next day or twain ill drop a word to her dont you think shes looking a bit pale and poorly this last week or so but mayhap you have not seen her not of late i have not but i am now on my way answered mr marshall turning into the white bear in the hope of escaping silences tongue it was the first word he had been able to cast into the stream she poured forth well maybe youll drop a word to her touching master floriszoon dear heart what queer names them foreign folks do get i never could abide no foreigners and if ibless us the mans offtheres no having a word with him i say charity i dont believe them eggs you had of that youll excuse me mistress abbott but ive no time to waste i talk the talk of the lips tendeth only to penuryand if youll go in and look for that i th good book itll happen do you a bit o goodmore than talking good even and charity shut the door uncompromisingly mr marshall was too much at home in the white bear to need announcement he tapped softly at the parlour door and opened it mrs gertrude i dont care who saith it its a wicked heresy were the first words he heard in the blunt tones of temperance murthwaite and its not true to say we puritans teach any such thing its a calumny and a heresy bothmr marshall im fain to see you do pray you tell this young gentlewoman we hold not that if a man but believe in the merits of christ he may live as he list and look for heaven in the end tis a calumny i saya wicked calumny a calumny as old as the apostle james mrs murthwaite answered mr marshall as he turned from greeting lady louvaine some in those days had it should seem been abusing pauls doctrine of justification by faith and said that a man need but believe and not live according thereto why mr marshall i have heard you to say a man may believe and be saved cried gertrude who sat on a velvetcovered stool beside lady louvaine having run in from the next door without hood or scarf that i doubt not mrs gertrude and yet may since you have heard paul and john and the lord himself to say it in the word but believe what believe that a man once lived whose name was jesus and who was marvellous good and wrought many great works that faith shall not save youno more than believing in king jamess majesty should it is a living faith you must have and that is a dead mr marshall i thought puritans made much of the doctrine of imputed righteousness you thought truth mrs gertrude well but what is that save believing that christ hath wrought all goodness for me and i need not work any goodness for mine own salvation look you there is no need if all be done no need of what no need that you should attempt to do what you never can do or no need that you should show your love to him that did it for you at the cost of his own life well said gertrude in a slow deprecating tone but mrs gertrude you mix up two things which be utterly separate and which cannot mix no more than oil and water the man whom christ hath saved it is most true hath no need to save himself but hath he no need to save others hath he no need to honour christ hath he no need to show forth to angels and to men his unity with christ the oneness of his will with his the love wherewith christs love constraineth him you mix up justification and sanctification as though they were but one justification is the washing of the soul from sin sanctification is the dressing of the soul for heaven sanctification is not a thing you do for god tis a thing god doth in you there is need for it not that it should justify you before his tribunal but that it should make you meet for his presencechamber it were not fit that you should enter the kings presence though cleansed yet dressed in your old soiled clothes but you make a third minglement of things separate when you bring in imputed righteousness the righteousness of christ imputed unto us justifieth us before the bar of god it payeth our debt it washeth our stains it unlocketh our fetters but this is not sanctification justification was wrought by christ for us sanctification is wrought by the holy ghost in us justification was completed on calvary sanctification is not finished so long as we be in this life justification is quick and lively the moment my faith toucheth the work of christ for me that moment am i fully justified and for ever sanctification is slow and groweth like a plant i am as entirely justified as i ever shall be but i am not as sanctified as i ever shall be i look to be more and more sanctifiedto grow up unto him in all things to be like him to be purified even as he is pure i pray you make no minglemangle of things that do so differ in themselves though tis true they come all of one sourcethe union and the unity of christ and the believer gertrude was yawning behind her hand before the clergyman was half through his explanation i thank you mr marshall said temperance who had listened attentively methinks i had some apprehension of the difference in myself but i could not have expounded it thus clearly to know it in yourself my sister is a far greater thing and a better than being able to expound itand how is it with you lady lettice well mr marshall she said with her soft smile at times i think that a few more pins of the tabernacle are taken down and then the passing wind causeth the curtains to shake but at worst it shall be only the moving of the pillar of cloudthe come up higher into the very presence of the king and in the interim the lord sitteth between the cherubim be the people never so unquiet and how is it dear sister with your two young men lady louvaine paused to accept gertrudes offered hand and bid her goodnight that young woman did not enjoy mr marshalls conversation and suddenly discovered that it was time for her return home hans is all i could desire said the old lady returning to the subject he is a dear good soberminded lad as need be but i will not disguise from you mr marshall that i am in some disease of mind touching aubrey may i ask wherefore you may ask indeed yet can i scarce tell that is no wisesounding thing to say yet one may have cause for fear where he hath no evidence for demonstration he may so indeed then you reckon there is good cause for fear mr marshall you told us some time back that our neighbour mr rookwood was brother to a papist know you aught of a friend of his one mr winter that is in london at times and hath his lodging in the strand a friend of this mr rookwood your neighbour i reckon so at least a friend of his son sons do at times make friends apart from their fathers said mr marshall with a smile i cannot say lady lettice that the name is quite unknown to me yet cannot i like you lay a finger on any special thing i may have heard thereabout what were the other names edith i cannot call them to mind mr catesby mother and mr percy and mr darcy those i think were what aubrey told us mr percywhat percy is he i know not some kin to my lord northumberland where dwells he that know i not at the green dragon in upper holborn in saint giless parish said another voice ha echoed mr marshall turning to his new informant a recusant madam and a dangerous fellow and if this mr catesby you name be mr robert catesby of ashby ledgers he also is a recusant and if i know him a worser man than the other hans art thou sure of this mr percythat he whom aubrey wist is the same man of whom mr marshall speaks i have seen aubrey leave his house madam lady louvaine looked very uneasy and mr darcy said edith him i know not answered mr marshall which was not surprising since he knew him only as mr walley hans how much dost thou know hans knelt down by the large cushioned chair and kissed the thin blueveined hand dear lady lettice i know very little and aubrey would account me a sneak and a spy were i to tell you what i do know but i would not care for that if it might save him i do hope mr louvaine is not drawn in among them said mr marshall thoughtfully they have been away of late replied hans and he hath not been there so often are they away now no lately returned i would i could win aubrey for a talk said edith shall i call at my lord oxfords and leave a message that you would have him call here truly mr marshall you should do me a great kindness then i so will goodnight aubrey was playing billiards with his young master and several of the younger gentlemen of his household when he was told that mr marshall requested a word with him the information alarmed him for he thought it meant bad news having obtained the young earls leave to go and ascertain why he was wanted aubrey ran hastily down the stairs and found mr marshall awaiting him in the hall good even mr louvaine said he rising i had the honour this evening to wait on my lady your grandmother and was desired to drop a word to you as i went home to the effect that your friends have a mind to speak with you on some matter of import her ladyship bids you the first opportunity you can make to visit the white bear i will do so said aubrey recovering from his alarm i cry you mercy for my short greeting but truly i was afraid not knowing if you had ill news for me that i have not at this time god be thanked yet if i may i would fain ask you mr louvaine whether some time hath not run since you saw your friends in king street oh no not very longat least not more than commononly about aubrey hesitated and flushed as he realised that it was now the middle of october and his last visit had been paid early in june you see sir i am close tied by my duties here he added in haste so close tied that you may not even be away for an hour well you know your own duty do it and all shall be well but i would beseech you not to neglect this call any longer than till your earliest opportunity shall give leave mr marshall bowed and with an official may god bless you passed out of the hall door aubrey returned to his urgent duties in the billiardroom who is your visitor louvaine asked the youthful earl if it please your lordship tis but a messenger from my grandmother what would the ancient dame inquired one of the irreverent young gentlemeninwaiting she would have me go and wait on her what else i know not i shall find out i reckon when i go when saw you her ladyship mr louvaine said an unexpected voice behind him and aubrey turned to meet the countess madam in june last under your ladyships pleasure it scarcely is to my pleasure son henry cannot you allow this young gentlemen to visit his friends more often under your leave madam he can visit them every day if he will i tarry him not then how comes it mr louvaine that you have not waited on my lady lettice for four months aubrey mentally wished mr marshall in america and himself anywhere but in oxford house there was no escape the wise countess added no unnecessary words to help him out but having put her question in plain terms quietly awaited his reply he muttered something not very intelligible in which business was the chiefly audible word methinks your duty to your mother and lady lettice should be your first business after god said the countess gravely i pray you mr louvaine that you wait on her ladyship tomorrow even the earl will give you leave aubrey bowed and as the countess took her departure for she had merely paused in passing through the room gave a vicious blow to the nearest billiard ball you are in for it now louvaine said his next neighbour poor lad will his grammer beat him suggested another in mock compassion hes been stealing apples and the parson has told of him added a third will you hold your stupid tongues said aubrey stung beyond endurance take a pinch of sneezing tobago said one of his companions holding out his snuffbox never mind it lad put on a bold face and use ruffling language and youll get over this brunt aubrey flung down his cue and escaped pursued by his companions laughter we were somewhere near the truth said the young earl he looks for a scolding take my word for it very like it aubrey felt as he went down king street on the following evening he too met a man not in blue camlet but in a porters frock trundling a truck with two or three barrels on it in whom he did not in the least recognise the dark tall stranger to whom he had not been introduced in catesbys rooms he received a warm welcome at the white bear aubrey hast thou of late seen thine acquaintance mr percy not since his return out of the country madam he had seen winter but he did not think it necessary to mention it nor mr catesby nay save to meet him in the street madam my son should it give thee great compunction grief annoyance if i bade thee have no more ado with either of these gentlemen what mean you madam i mean not that if thou meet them in the street thou shalt not give them greeting but no more to visit them in their lodgings my boy mr percy is a popish recusant and there is much fear of mr catesby likewise not all recusants are bad men i hope answered aubrey evasively as if he were unwilling to respond by a direct promise to that effect i hope likewise but some are as we know and when innocent men be drawn in with bad men tis often found that the bad slip forth unhurt and leave the innocent to abide the hazard promise me aubrey that thou wilt haunt visit these mens company no longer truly madam i know not what i should say to my friends bethink you also i pray that i am of age of what age demanded his aunt temperance in her usual style not of the age of discretion i being witness of the age at which a man commonly takes care of himself answered aubrey loftily bate me an ace quoth bolton at the age at which a man commonly takes no care of himself nor of any other belike nor you are not the wisest man of your age in this world my master dont go for to think it you dont need to look at me in that way my fine young gentleman youll not get sugarplums from temperance murthwaite when you need rhubarb i know that aunt temperance said aubrey trying to laugh and you may as well open your mouth and take your physic with a good grace if not therell be another dose to follow what demanded aubrey with drawn brows and a flash in his eyes three can keep a secret if twain be away was the enigmatical answer now then answer lady lettice he has no mind to promisethat can i see said lady louvaine sorrowfully he shall afore he go was the cool reply of temperance aunt temperance i am not a babe exclaimed aubrey rather angrily that you are and in sore need of leadingstrings aubrey here asked his mother coming in well now i do think one of you might have told me but you never think of me why aubrey it must be six months since we saw you four mother under your pleasure i am sure tis six why come you no oftener i have my duties said aubrey in a rather constrained voice closer than to thy mother my boy asked edith softly prithee harry not him retorted aunt temperance hast thou not heard he hath his duties to hold skeins of silk whilst my lady winds them maybe and to ride the great horse and play tennis and shuttlecock with his lord and to make up his mind to which of all his ladys damsels hell make love o the lightest make aubrey i do hope you are neer thinking of marriage said his mothers querulous voice thou shouldst be put out of thine office most like and not a penny to keep her and she saddled upon us that thatll kick and throw her as like as not said aunt temperance by way of interjection i ensure you mother i have no expectations of the kind tis but aunt temperance thatthat that sometimes hits the white sir if she do now and then shoot aside o the mark howbeit hold thou there and if thou want leave to carry on thine acquaintance with these gentlemen bring them to see us ill lay mine head to an orange i see in ten minutes if they be true men or no what business have they asked edith aubrey hesitated he knew of none except garnets pretended profession of horsedealing is there any woman amongst them said temperance i never saw one not even at mr percys house i went there but once to ask for him i have heard that he hath a wife but she lives very privately and teaches children he dwelleth not with her but hath his lodging at my lord northumberlands i never saw her thats an ill hearing tis meet for men to come together by themselves for business but to dwell in their own homes and never a woman with them wife mother sister nor daughterthat means mischief lad it means some business of an evil sort that they dont want a woman to see through if there had been one i went about to say take me with thee some even to visit her id have known all about it under an hour trust me you should have seen nought aunt tell that to the cowcumbers you see nought very like lady louvaine laid her hand on her grandsons aubrey promise me at least this that for a month to come thou wilt not visit any of these gentlemen after an instants pause aubrey replied very well madam i am ready to promise that thats not much to promise commented temperance it is enough said lady louvaine quietly an hour later when aubrey was gone faith asked rather complainingly what had induced lady louvaine to limit the promise to a month i cannot tell thee faith was the answer something seemed to whisper within me that if the lad would promise that he would be safe it may be no more than an old womans fantasy and even so no harm is done or it might be that god spake to meand if thus let us obey his voice he knows what he will do and what men will do ive as great a mind as ever i had to eat what to do temperance get to see those fellows somehow wait the month temperance suggested edith quietly wait youre always for waiting i want to work waiting is often the hardest work said edith the middle of the month was nearly come the six last barrels of powder were in the vault the whole thirtysix were covered with stones and iron bars gideon gibbons the porter was delivering at the door three thousand billets and five hundred faggots of wood and another man in a porters frock was stacking the wood in the vault there thats the last lot said gibbons throwing in a packet of tiedup billets count right johnson all right gibbons your master likes a good fire i should say observed gibbons with a grin of amusement as he looked into the vault theres fuel there to last most folks a couple of winters ay he doth so hes a northern man you seecomes from where seacoals cheaper than here and they are wont to pile their fires big shouldnt ha thought them billets wouldnt hardly ha taken all that there room said gibbons looking into the vault while he scratched his head with one hand and hitched up his porters frock to put the other in his pocket oh i didnt stack em so tight said mr percys man carelessly tying up a bit of string which he picked from the floor ah well but tight or loose shouldnt hardly ha thought it master coming soon eh havent heard what day afore long very like has he eer a wife that hell bring shes in the country said the disguised manservant who knew that she was then at the green dragon teaching sundry little girls the mysteries of felling and whipping cambric well tis dry work come and have a pint at the maids head no thank you i dont care for it theres a penny for yours as this was the price of a quart of the best ale mr gibbons pocketed the penny with satisfaction and forbore to remark censoriously on what he deemed the very singular taste of mr percys man he shambled awkwardly off with his waggon meaning first to put up his horses and then go and expend his penny in the beverage wherein his soul delighted his companion gave a low laugh as he turned the key in the door of the cellar no thank you gideon gibbons said he to himself it may suit you to sit boozing at the maids head telling all you know and guessing much that you dont heres wishing your early muddlement before you get on the subject of this wood but it wont do for guy fawkes my fine fellow note lord mordaunt was a trimmer afraid of being known to be a papist and like most halfhearted people a great sufferer from the struggle between the conscience and the flesh chapter seven an applecast and a letter better the blind faith of our youth than doubt which all truth braves better to die gods children dear than live the devils slaves dinah mulock goodmorrow lady lettice i am come to ask a favour ask it i pray you mrs rookwood will you suffer mrs lettice to come to our applecast on tuesday next we shall have divers young folks of our neighboursmrs abbotts mary dorcas and hester mrs townsends rebecca my lady woodwards dulcibel and grissel and such like and our doll i am in hopes shall be back from suffolk and maybe her cousin bessy with her i have asked mr louvaine to come and twain more of my lord oxfords gentlemen and mr manners mr stone and our tom shall be there what say you lady louvaine looked with a smile at her granddaughter who sat in the window with a book she was not altogether satisfied with the rookwoods yet less from anything they said or did than from what they omitted to say and do they came regularly to church they attended the sacrament they asked the vicar to their dinnerparties they were very affable and friendly to their neighbours there was absolutely nothing on which it was possible to lay a reproving finger and say this is what i do not like and yet while she could no more give a reason for distrusting them than the schoolboy for objecting to the famous dr fell she did instinctively distrust them still lettice was a good girl on the whole a discreet girl she had very few pleasures especially such as took her outside her home and gave her the companionship of girls of her own age lettice had been taught as all puritan maidens were that life is to do the will of god and that pleasure was not to be sought at all and scarcely to be accepted except in its simplest forms and as coming naturally along with the duties of life an admirable lessona lesson which girls sadly need to learn now if only for the lowest reasonthat pleasures thus taken are infinitely more pleasing than when sought and the taste for them is keener and more enduring to the moral taste no less than the physical plain fare with a good appetite is incomparably more enjoyable than the finest dainties with none and the moral appetite can cloy and pall at least as soon as the physical lettices healthy moral nature had been content with the plain fare and had never cried out for dainties but like all young folks she liked a pleasant change and her grandmother who had thought her looking pale and somewhat languid with the summer heat in town was glad that she should have the enjoyment she knew she might trust her not even to herself did lady louvaine confess her deepest reason for allowing lettice to go to the applecastan assembly resembling in its nature the american bee and having an applegathering and storing for its object it was derived from the fact that aubrey had been invited it occurred to her that something might transpire in lettices free and innocent narrative of her enjoyment which would be of service in the difficult business of dealing with aubrey at this juncture lettice as beseemed a maiden of her years was silent though her eyes said please in very distinct language i thank you mrs rookwood lettice may go lettices eyes lighted up then mrs lettice will you step in about nine oclock my maidsll be fain to see you and if any of you gentlewomen should have a liking to look in nay the girls should count us spoilsports said edith laughingly now come mrs edith tis not so long since you were a young maid twelve good years mrs rookwood as long pretty nigh as hester abbott has been in the world eh but years dont go for much not with some folks not with them that keep the dew of their youth said lady louvaine with a smile but to do that friend a woman should dwell very near to him who only hath immortality it was something so unusual for one of this sober household to go out to a party that a flutter arose when mrs rookwood had departed concerning lettices costume she had best go in a washing gown was the decision of her practical aunt temperance if shes to be any good with the apples she must not wear her sunday best lettices sunday best was not of an extravagant character being a dark green perpetuana gown trimmed with silver lace a mantle of plumcoloured cloth and a plumcoloured hood lined with dark green but a washing gown temperance it should look so mean objected mrs louvaine her best gownll look meaner if all the lace be hung with cobwebs and all the frilling lined with appleparings said temperance shell take better care of it than so i hope said edith and a lawn gown should be cold for this season well let the child wear her brown kersey thatll not spoil so much as some in her heart lettice hoped she would not have to wear the brown kersey brown was such an ugly colour and the kersey already worn two seasons was getting shabbyfar too shabby to wear at a party she would have liked to put on her best but no girl of twenty unmarried at that date decided such matters for herself oh never that ugly thing said mrs louvaine i mean her to wear my pearls and that brown stuff wear aunt faiths pearls lettices heart beat faith my dear i would not have the child use ornaments said lady louvaine quietly you wot those of our way of thinking do commonly discard them let us not give occasion for scandal i would have lettice go neat and cleanly and not under her station but no more the palpitations of lettices heart sobered down of course she could not expect to wear pearls and such worldly vanities grandmother was always right i can tell you mrs gertrude and mrs anne shall not be in brown kersey said mrs louvaine in her usual petulant tone and if aubrey don him not in satin and velvet my name is not faith it shouldnt have been my dear for it isnt your nature was her sisters comment we need not follow a multitude to do evil quietly responded lady louvaine as she sat and knitted peacefully well madam what comes that tothe brown kersey trow edith saith truth lawn is cold this weather i think my dear the green perpetuana were not too good with clean apron ruff and cuffs and a silver lace but i would have nought more so lettice made her appearance at the applecast in her sunday gown but decked with no pearls and her own brown hair turned soberly back under her hood she put no hat on over it as she had only to slip into the next house in the hall tom rookwood met her and bowing requested the honour of conducting her into the garden where his sisters and cousin were already busy with the days duties on the short ladder which rested against one of the appletrees stood dorothy the tallest of the rookwoods clad in a long apron of white lawn edged with lace over a dress of rich dark blue silk gathering apples and passing them to anne at the foot of the ladder by whom they were delivered to gertrude who packed them in sundry crates ready for the purpose by gertrudes side stood a dark rosy merrylooking child of six whom she introduced to lettice as her cousin bessy lettice who had expected bessy to be much older was disappointed for she was curious to know what kind of a creature a female papist might be now tom do your duty cried dorothy as tom was about to retire i am weary of gathering and you having the longest legs and arms amongst us should take my place here come mr montague and rebecca townsend im coming down up with you tom pulled a face and obeyed but showing a disposition to pelt dorothy and bessy instead of carefully delivering the apples unbruised to anne he was screamed at and set upon at once gertrude leading the opposition tom you wicked wretch come down this minute or else behave properly i shall theaccidentaldescent of an enormous apple on the bridge of gertrudes nose put her announcement of her intentions to speedy flight and in laughing over the fracas the ice rapidly melted between the young strangers the applegathering proceeded merrily relieved by a few scenes of this sort until the trees were stripped the apples laid carefully in the crates for transportation to the garrets and on their arrival as carefully taken out and spread on sheets of grey paper on the floor when all was done the girls were marshalled into gertrudes room to tidy themselves after which they went down to the diningroom mrs rookwood had provided an excellent dinner for her youthful guests including geese venison and pheasants various pies and puddings muscadel and canary wines after dinner they played games in the hall and diningroom hoodman blind and hunt the slipper and when tired of these separated into little groups or formed teteatetes for conversation lettice who could not quite get rid of an outside feeling as if she did not belong to the world in which she found herself was taken possession of by her oldest acquaintance gertrude and drawn into a windowseat for what that young lady termed a proper chat i thought my cousin was to be here said lettice glancing over the company ay tom asked him i believe said gertrude maybe his lord could not spare him do you miss him i would like to have seen him said lettice innocently tom would not love to hear you say so much i can tell you laughed gertrude he admires you very much lettice oh do let us drop the mistressit is so stiff and soberi hate it me was all that it occurred to lettice to answer you dont you like men to admire you i dont know they never did gertrude went off into a soft explosion of silvery laughter o lettice you are good you have been brought up with all those sober starched old gentlewomen till you dont know what life iswhy my dear you might as well be a nun dont i know what life is said lettice ive had twenty years of it you havent had twenty days of itnot life youve been ruled like a copybook ever since you were born i have pitied you poor little victim you cannot guess how much i begged mother to try and win you for today she said she did not believe starch and knittingpins would suffer it but she would try wasnt i astonished when i heard you really were to come what do you mean by starch and knittingpins asked the bewildered lettice oh that awful aunt of yours who looks as if she had just come out of the wash and your sweetsmiling grandmother who is always fiddling with knittingpins gertrude stopped suddenly she understood better than lettice did herself the involuntary unpremeditated gesture which put a greater distance between them on the windowseat and knew in a moment that she had scandalised her guest my dear creature she said with one of her soft laughs if you worship your starchy aunt i wont say another word and as to my lady louvaine i am sure i never meant the least disrespect to her of course she is very sweet and good and all that but dear me have you been bred up to think you must not label people with funny names everybody does my dearno offence meant at all i assure you i beg your pardon said lettice stifflymore so indeed than she knew or meant if that be what you call life i am afraid i know little about it and wish for no more said gertrude laughing well if i offended you i ought to beg pardon i did not intend it i am sure but my dear what a pity you do not crisp your hair or curl it that oldfashioned roll back is as ancient as my grandmother and a partlet i declare they really ought to let you be a little more properly dressed you never see girls with turnedback hair now lettice did not know whether to blush for her deficiencies or to be angry with gertrude for pointing them out she felt more inclined to the latter now if i had you to dress said gertrude complacently i should just put you in a decent neat corset with a white satin gown puffed with crimson velvet a velvet hood lined with white satin a girdle of gold and pearls crimson stockings white satin slippers a lace rebato and a pearl necklace oh how charming you would look you would not know yourself then i should put a gold bodkin in your hair and a headdrop of pearls set round a diamond and bracelets instead of these lawn cuffs and a fan and wash your face in distilled waters and odoriferous oils for your hands but i should not like my hands oily said lettice in amazement gertrude laughed oh yes you would when you were accustomed to it and then just the least touch on your forehead and cheeks ando lettice my dear you would have half london at your feet the least touch of what inquired lettice oh just to show the blue veins you know show the blue veins what can you show them with oh just a touch of blue said gertrude who began to fear she had gone further than lettice would follow and did not want to be too explicit you never surely meanpaint asked lettice in tones of horror my dear little puritan be not so shocked i do really mean paint but not all over your facenothing of the sort only a touch here and there ill take care it does not touch me said lettice decidedly i dont want to get accustomed to such abominable things and as to having half london at my feet there isnt room for it and i am sure i should not like it if there were o lettice lettice cried gertrude amidst her laughter i never saw such a maid why you are old before you are young i have heard say answered lettice laughing herself that such as so be are young when they are old oh dont talk of being oldtis horrid to think on but my dear you should really have a little fine breeding and not be bred up a musty humdrum puritan i do hate those sheprecise hypocrites that go about in close stomachers and ruffles of geneva print and cannot so much as cudgel their maids without a scripture to back them nobody likes them you know dont grow into one of them youll never be married if you do lettice was silent but she sat with slightly raised eyebrows and a puzzled expression about her lips well why dont you speak said gertrude briskly because i dont know what to say i cant tell what you expect me to say and you give such queer reasons for not doing things do i so said gertrude looking amused why what queer reasons have i given that nobody will like me and i shall never be married well arent they very good reasons they dont seem to me to be reasons at all i may never be married whether i do it or not and that will be as god sees best for me so why trouble myself about it and as to people not liking me because i am a puritan dont you remember the lords words if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you oh you sucked in the bible with your mothers milk i suppose said gertrude pettishly and have had it knitted into you ever since by your grandmothers needles i did not expect you to be a spoilsport lettice i thought you would be only too happy to come out of your convent for a few hours thank you i dont want to be a spoilsport and i do not think the bible is unless the sports are bad ones and they might as well be spoiled might they not theres mr stone cried gertrude inconsequently and in a relieved tone for lettice was leading in a direction whither she had no wish to follow look isnt he a fine young man what a shame to have christened so comely a man by so ugly a name as jeremy do you think so it is a beautiful name it means him whom god hath appointedaunt edith says so think you i care what it means was the answer in a rather vexed tone though it was accompanied by a laugh tis ugly and oldfashioned child now your cousin mr louvaine has a charming name but fancy having a name with a sermon wrapped up in it i do not understand said lettice a little blankly you seem to think little of those things whereof i have been taught to think much and to think much of those things whereof i have been led to think little it puzzles me excuse me gertrude laughed more goodnaturedly my dear little innocence said she i am sorry to let the cold garish daylight in upon your pretty little stainedglass creed it is never pleasant to have scales taken from your eyes but really you look on things in such false colours that needs must why my child if you were to go out into the world you would find all those fancies laughed to scorn tis only puritans love sermons and bibles and such things no doubt they are all right and good and all that quite proper for sunday and sickbeds and so on i am not an infidel of course but thenwell lettices face of utter amazement arrested the flow of words on gertrudes lips would your mother think you loved her gertrude if you told her you never wanted to see her except on sundays and when you were sick and if god hears all we say is it not as good as telling him that you puzzle me more and more i have been taught that the world is the enemy of god and refuses to guide its ways by his word but you speak as if it were something good that we ought to look up to and hearken what it bids us it cannot be both and what god says about it must be true lettice whatever one says you always come back to your puritan stuff i wish you would be natural like other maids see i am about to turn you over to dorothy let us see if she can make something of youi cannothere doll come and sit here and talk with lettice i want to go and speak to grissel yonder dorothy sat down obediently in the windowseat i thought mr louvaine was to be here today she said so did i likewise i cannot tell why he comes not have you seen him lately no not in some time i suppose he is busy dorothy looked amused what think you he doth all the day long lettice had not been present when aubrey detailed his days occupations and she was under the impression that he led a busy life with few idle hours truly i know not what she answered but the earl no doubt hath his duties and tis aubreys to wait on him the earl belike reads an hour or two with his tutor seeing he is but a child and the rest of the time is there music and dancing riding the great horse playing at billiards tennis bowls and such like that is your cousins business mrs lettice only thatbut i reckon he cannot be let go but must come after his masters heels he is on duty but three days of every week save at the lever and coucher and may go whither he list on the other four then i marvel he comes not oftener to visit us said innocent lettice do you so i dont answered dorothy with a little laugh why how old are you mrs lettice the notion of discourtesy connected with this query is modern i was twenty last june said lettice dear heart i should have supposed you were about two said dorothy with a little curl of her lip but my grandmother thinks so likewise and she is near eighty said lettice ah extremes meet answered dorothy biting her lip lettice tried to think out this obscure remark but had not made much progress when at the other end of the room she caught a glimpse of aubrey though he stood with his back to her she felt sure it was aubrey she knew him by the poise of his head and the soft golden gloss on his hair and a moment later his voice reached her ear he came up towards them stopping every minute to speak with some acquaintance so that it took him a little time to reach them there is cousin aubrey said lettice dorothy answered by a nod you admire your cousin yes i think he looks very well replied lettice in her simplicity dorothy bit her lip again he is not so wellfavoured as mr jeremy stone said she though he hath the better name and comes of an elder line by much by this time aubrey had come up ah lettice said he kissing her mrs dorothy your most obedient humble servant are you responded she surely i am lay your commands on me then bring mr stone to speak with me aubrey gave a little shrug of his shoulders a laugh and turned away as if to seek mr stone while dorothy the moment his back was turned put her finger on her lip and slipped out of sight behind a screen with her black eyes full of mischievous fun why my dear said a voice beside lettice is none with you i thought i saw doll by your side but now she was gentlewoman answered lettice looking up at mrs rookwood and beginning to wish herself at home again might she slip away may i pray you of the time mrs rookwood was neither of wealth nor rank to carry a watch so she went to look at the clock before replying and aubrey came up with mr stone why where is gone mrs dorothy asked the former knitting his brows all the beauty has not departed with her responded mr stone gallantly bowing low to lettice who felt more and more uncomfortable every minute tis on the stroke of four my dear said mrs rookwood returning but i beg you will not hurry away oh but i must if you please answered lettice feeling a sensation of instant and intense relief grandmother bade me not tarry beyond four oclock i thank you very much gentlewoman and i wish you farewellaubrey you will come with me aubrey looked extremely indisposed to do so and lettice wondered for what reason he could possibly wish to stay but mrs rookwood hearing of lady louvaines order made no further attempt to delay her young guest she called her daughters to take their leave and in another minute the golden fish was left behind and lettice ran into the door of the white bear she went straight upstairs and in the chamber which they shared found her aunt edith lettice had no idea how uneasy edith had been all that day she had a vague general idea that she was rather a favourite with aunt edith perhaps the one of her nieces whom on the whole she liked best but of the deep pure well of motherlike love in ediths heart for dudley murthwaites daughter lettice had scarcely even a faint conception she rather fancied herself preferred because as she supposed her mother had very likely been aunt ediths favourite sister little notion therefore had lettice of the network of feeling behind the earnest wistful eyes as the aunt laid a hand on each shoulder of the niece and said well lettice aunt edith was the answer if that is the world i have been in today i hope i shall never go again thank god spoke ediths heart in its innermost depths but her voice only said quietly enough ay so dear heart and what misliked thee it is all so queer aunt edith they think the world is something good and they want me to paint my face and they call aunt temperance starch and they say i am only two years old and they purse up their faces and look as if it were something strange if i quote the bible and they talk about being married as if it must happen whether you would or not and as if it were the only thing worth thinking about and they seemed to think it was quite delightful to have a lot of gentlemen bowing at yon and saying all sorts of silly things and i thought it was horrid and altogether i didnt like it a bit and i wanted to get home lettice i prayed god to keep thee and i think he has kept thee my dear heart mayest thou ever so look on the world which is his enemy and his contrary ediths voice was not quite under her controla most unusual thing with her aunt edith i did think at firstwhen mrs rookwood camethat i should like it very well i felt as if it would be such a pleasant change you know andsometimes i have fancied for a minute that i should like to know how other maids did and to taste their life as it were for a little while because you see i knew we were so quiet and other people seemed to have more brightness and merriment andwell i wanted to see what it was like very natural sweet heart at thy years i can well believe it and so when mrs rookwood asked i so hoped grandmother would let me go and i did enjoy the applegathering in the garden and the games afterward in the hall but when we sat down and girls came up and talked to me and i saw what they had inside their heartsfor if it had not been in their hearts it would not have come on their tonguesaunt edith i hope i shall never never never have anything more to do with the world id rather peel onions and scrub tiles every day of my life than live with people and perhaps get like them who could call my dear old grandmother knittingpins in scorn and tell god himself that they only wanted to think of him on sundays that worlds another world and i dont belong to it and please ill keep out of it amen and amen said aunt edith my lettice let us abide in the world where god is king and father and sun and water of life may that other world where satan rules ever be another and a strange world to thee wherein thou shalt feel thyself a traveller and a stranger my child there is very much merriment which hath nought to do with happiness and very much happiness which hath nought to do with mirth tis one thing to shut ourselves from gods world which he made and quite another to keep our feet away from satans world which he hath ruined when god saith love not the world he means not love not flowers and songbirds and bright colours and sunset skies and the innocent laughter of little children those belong to his world and tis only as we take them out thereof and hand them unto satan and they get into the devils world that they become evil and hurtful unto us satan hath ruined and will yet so far as he may all the good things of god and beware of the most innocentseeming thing so soon as thou shalt see his touch upon it thank god my darling that he suffered thee not to shut thine eyes thereto was aubrey there lettice he came but late aunt and therefore it was i suppose that as it seemed he had no list to come with me he said he might look in perchance at after and mr tom rookwood ay he was there though i saw scarce anything of him but just at first edith was privately glad to hear it she had been a little afraid of designs upon lettice from that quarter aunt was it not rude to give nicknames very rude and very uncomely lettice i thought it was horrid said lettice louvaine tom rookwood was saying next door i met mr tom winter this afternoon and he asked me if you had gone to the low countries to take service under the archduke he hath seen nought of you saith he these three weeks i know it said aubrey sulkily well he told me to bid you to supper with him o thursday even next i shall be there and sir josceline percy sir edward bushell and mr kit wright i cant wish i could why whats to hinder oh imahpromised beforehand said aubrey clumsily cant you get off no but ive as great a mind to go you come and never mind the other fellows youll find us much jollier grigs of the twain i know that hang it tom ill go theres a brave lad four oclock sharp at the duck ill meet you there done where was he promised i marvel asked dorothy in a whisper with a yawn behind her hand oh didnt you see how he flushed and stammered said gertrude laughing i vow i do believe old knittingpins had made him swear on her big bible that he wouldnt speak another word to mr winter had it been but another merrymaking he should never have looked thus there was no visit from aubrey at the white bear that evening he felt as if he could not meet his grandmothers eyes he was not yet sufficiently hardened in sin to be easy under an intention of deliberate disobedience and violation of a solemn promise yet the sin was too sweet to give up this once he said to himself only this onceand then no more till the month was over when the saturday evening arrived aubrey made a very careful toilet and set forth for the strand it was a long walk for the earl of oxford lived in the city near bishopsgate aubrey was rather elated at the idea of making the acquaintance of sir josceline percy and sir edward bushell he was concerned at the family disgrace as he foolishly considered it of hanss connection with the mercer and extremely desirous to attain knighthood for himself the way to do that he thought was to get into society here was an opening which might conduct him to those elysian fieldsand at the gate stood his grandmother trying to wave him away he would not be deprived of his privileges by the foolish fancies of an old woman what did old women know of the world aubrey was not aware that sixty years before that very grandmother then young lettice eden had thought exactly the same thing of those who stood in her way to the same visionary paradise temple bar was just left behind him and the duck was near when to aubreys surprise and not by any means to his satisfaction a hand was laid upon his shoulder hans you here truly so where look you i should be an halfhour after closing time this was a most awkward contretemps how should hans be got rid of before the duck was reached you are on your way to the white bear said hans in the tone of one who states an incontrovertible fact have with you aubrey privately wished hans in the arctic sea or the torrid zone or anywhere out of the strand for that afternoon and as if to render his discomfiture more complete here came mr winter and tom rookwood arm in arm just as they reached mrs mores door what on earth was to be done mr thomas rookwood whose brain was as sharp as a needle guessed the situation in a moment and with much amusement from a glance at aubreys face he of course at once recognised hans and was at least as well aware as either that hans represented the forces of law and order and subordination to lawful authority while aubrey stood as the representative of the grand principle that every man should do what is right in his own eyes a few lowtoned words to mr winter preceded a doffing of both the plumed hats and the greeting from tom rookwood as they passed of good even to you both charming weather a scarcely perceptible wink of toms left eye was designed to show aubrey that his position was understood and action taken upon it aubrey saw and comprehended the gesture hans saw it also but did not comprehend it except as a sign of some private understanding between the two they walked on together aubrey engaged in vexed meditation as to how he was to get rid of hans but hans had no intention of allowing himself to be dismissed he began to talk and aubrey had to answer and could not satisfy himself what course to pursue till he found himself at the door of the white bear charity was at the door doing what every housemaid was then compelled to do namely pouring her slops into the gutter eh mestur aubrey is that yo said she tis a month o sundays sin weve seen you you might come a bit oftener i reckon if youd a mind stand out o th way a minute do while i teem these here slops out theres no end to folks idleness down this road heres marget rumboll at th back been bidden by th thirdborough to get hersen into service presently under pain of a whipping and mary quinton up yon to do th same within a month at her peril note i reckon if i know aught of either mall or marget theyll both look for a place where th works put forth dun ye know o any such mestur aubrey up city way aubrey was not sufficiently sharp to notice the faint twinkle in charitys eyes and the slight accent of sarcasm in her tone hans perceived both i do not charity but i dare be bound there are plenty said aubrey stepping delicately over the puddle which charity had just created so as to cause as little detriment as possible to his spanish leather shoes and crimson silk stockings ay very like there will theyll none suit you mestur ans youre not one of yon sort have a care o th puddle mestur aubrey or youll mire your brave hose and therell be wark for somebody with which parthian dart charity bore off her pail and aubrey and hans went forward into the parlour good even my gracious lord was the greeting with which the former was received your lordships visits be scarcer than the suns and he has not shown his face none wist when marry but i do believe ive seen that suit afore of course you have aunt temperance answered the nettled aubrey he was exceedingly put out his evening was spoiled he was deprived of his liberty of his friends company of a good dinnerfor mr winter gave delightful little dinners and mrs elizabeth more the housewife at the duck was an unusually good cook moreover he was tied down to what he contemptuously designated in his lofty mind a parcel of women with the unacceptable and very unflattering sarcasms of aunt temperance by way of seasoning it really was extraordinary thought mr aubrey that when women passed their fortieth milestone or thereabouts they seemed to lose their respect for the nobler sex and actually presumed to criticise them especially the younger specimens of that interesting genus such women ought to be kept in their places and theoretically he would see that they were but when he came in contact with the obnoxious article in the person of aunt temperance in some inscrutable manner the young lord of creation never saw it at the duck the company were making merry over tom rookwoods satirical account of aubreys discomfiture for his company they cared little and the only object they had for cultivating it was the consideration that he might be useful some day their conversation was all the freer without him since all the rest were papists something at that moment was taking place elsewhere with which the company at the duck and even aubrey louvaine were not unconcerned lord monteagle was entertaining friends to supper at his house at hoxton where he had not resided for some time previously just before the company sat down to table a young footman left the house on an errand returning a few minutes later as he passed towards his masters door a man of indifferent stature muffled in a cloak and his face hidden by a slouched hat drawn down over the brow suddenly presented himself from amongst the trees is your lord within and may a man have speech of him asked the apparition his lordship is now sitting down to supper was the answer the stranger held out a letter i pray you deliver this into your lords own hand said he seeing it holdeth matter of import the young man took the letter and returned to the house lord monteagle was just crossing the hall to the diningroom when his servant delivered the letter grace having been said and the business of supper begun he unfolded the missive his lordship found it difficult to read which implies that his education was not of the most perfect order for the writing is not at all hard to make out but gentlemen were much less versed in the three rs at that date than at the present time note and lord monteagle calling one of his servants named thomas ward desired him to read the letter now mr thomas ward was in the confidence of the conspiratorsa fact of which there is no doubt and that lord monteagle was the same may not inaptly be described as a fact of which there is doubtan extremely strong probability which has been called in question without any disproof see appendix both these gentlemen however conducted themselves with perfect decorum and as if the subject were entirely new to them this was what mr ward read my lord out of the loue i beare you this word was crossed out and instead of it was written some of youere trends i haue a caer of youer preseruacion therfor i would aduyse yowe as yowe tender youer lyf to deuyse some exscuse to shift of youer attendance at this parleament for god and man hathe concurred to punishe the wickednes of this tyme and thinke not slightlye of this aduertisment but retire youer self into youre contri wheare yowe maye expect the euent in safti for thowghe theare be no apparance of anni stir yet i saye they shall receyue a terrible blowe this parleament and yet they shall not seie who hurts them this councel is not to be acontemned because it maye do yowe good and can do yowe no harm for the dangere is passed as soon as yowe have burnt the letter and i hope god will giue yowe the grace to mak good use of it to whose holy proteccion i commend yowe the writing was tall cramped and angular there was neither signature nor date the hearers gazed on each other in perplexed astonishment not unmixed with fear what can it mean asked one of the guests some fools prating replied lord monteagle how else could the danger be past so soon as i had burnt the letter this question no one could answer lord monteagle took the letter from the reader pocketed it and turned the conversation to other topics the thoughts of the company soon passed from the singular warning and occupied by their own fancies and amusements they did not notice that their host quitted them as soon as they left the diningroom with the letter in his pocket lord monteagle slipped out of his garden gate mounted his horse and rode to his house in the strand leaving the horse here he went down to the waterside where he hailed a boat and was rowed to westminster stairs to hail a boat was as natural and common an incident to a londoner of that day as it is now to call a cab or stop an omnibus lord monteagle stepped lightly ashore made his way to the palace of whitehall and asked to speak at once with the earl of salisbury lord high treasurer of england note these exemplary women really resided at southampton a few years later note a letter of lord chiefjustice popham would be a suitable subject for a competitive examination chapter eight the fifth of november better to have dwelt unlooked for in some forests shadows dun where the leaves are pierced in triumph by the javelins of the sun better to be born and die in some calm nest howeer obscure with a vine about the casements and a figtree at the door the earl of salisbury sat in his private cabinet in whitehall palace he was robert cecil younger son of the great earl of burleigh and he had inherited his fathers brains without his fathers conscientiousness and integrity the dead queen had never trusted him thoroughly she considered him as he was a schemera schemer who might pay to virtue the tribute of outward propriety but would pursue the scheme no less yet if robert cecil cared for any thing on earth which was not robert cecil that thing was the protestant religion and the liberties of england note the present sovereign was under preeminent obligation to him for had he not cast his great weight into the scale in his favour the chances were that james might very possibly if not probably have been james the sixth of scotland still lord salisbury was in person insignificantlooking when she wished to put him down his late mistress had been accustomed to address him as little man and his present master termed him my little beagle his face was small with wizened features moustache and pointed beard and though only fortyfive years of age there were decided silver threads among the brown he looked up in surprise at the announcement that lord monteagle requested permission to speak with him quickly what could this young roman catholic nobleman want with him at nine oclock in the eveninga time which to his apprehension was much what midnight is to ours perhaps it was better to see him at once and have done with the matter he would take care to dismiss him quickly show my lord monteagle this way in another moment lord monteagle stood by the table where salisbury was seated his plumed hat in his hand my lord said he i entreat your lordships pardon for my late coming and knowing your weighty causes will be as brief as i may a letter has been sent me which in truth to my apprehension is but the prating of some fool yet seeing that things are not alway what they seem and that there may be more in it than appeareth i crave your lordships leave to lay it before you that your better judgment may pronounce thereupon truly i am not able to understand it myself and the nameless undated letter on which the fate of king and parliament hung was laid down before salisbury the lord high treasurer read it carefully through scanned it back and front as if to discover any trace of origin then leaned back in his chair and thoughtfully stroked his moustache pray you be seated my lord whence had you this lord monteagle gave such details as he knew you have no guess from whom it could come never a whit nor you know not the writing it resembleth none hand of any that i know there was another short pause broken by lord monteagles query thinks your lordship this of any moment that were not easy to answer it may be of serious import or it may be but a foolish jest truly at first i thought it the latter for how could the danger be past as soon as the letter were burnt ah that might be butmy lord i pray you leave this letter with me i will consider of it and if i see cause may lay it before the king any way you have well done to bring it hither if it be a foolish jest there is but a lost halfhour and if as might be it is an honest warning of some real peril that threatens us you will then have merited well of your king and country i may tell you that i have already received divers advices from beyond seas to the same effect i thank your lordship heartily and i commend you to god so saying lord monteagle took his leave the sunday passed peacefully thomas winter in his chamber at the sign of the duck laid down a volume of the writings of thomas aquinas and began to think about going to bed when a hasty rap on the door and the sound of some one being let in was succeeded by rapid steps on the stairs the next moment thomas ward entered the room what is the matter said winter the moment he saw his face the saints wot a warning letter is sent to my lord monteagle and whereto it may growhie you to white webbs when morning breaketh with all the speed you may and tell mr catesby of this i feari very much fear all shall be discovered its that rascal tresham cried winter he was earnest to have his sisters husband warned and said he would not pluck forth not another stiver without our promise so to do be it who it may it may be the ruin of us god forbid i will be at white webbs with the dawn or soon after before it was light the next morning winter was on horseback and was soon galloping through the country villages of islington holloway and hornsey on his way to enfield chase in the depths of that lonely forest land stood the solitary huntinglodge named white webbs which belonged to dr hewick and was let in the shooting season to sportsmen this house had been taken by mr meaze who was garnet as a very quiet locality where mass might be said without being overheard by protestant ears and no inconvenient neighbours were likely to gossip about the inmates in london garnet was a horsedealer at white webbs he was a gentleman farmer and a sportsman here he established himself and somebody eke who has not yet appeared on the scene and whom it is time to introduce and i introduce her with no feeling save one of intense pity as one more sinned against than sinninga frail passionswayed impulsive woman one of the thousands of women whose lives rome has blighted by making that sin which was no sin and so in many instances leading up to that which was sinpoor loving unhappy anne vaux the hon anne vaux was a younger daughter of william lord vaux of harrowden and elizabeth beaumont his first wife like many another she loved one only and she clave to him whose happy and honourable wife she might have been had he been a protestant clergyman instead of a jesuit priest that anne vauxs passionate love for garnet was for the man and not the priest her own letters are sufficient witness and garnet returned the love she took a solemn vow of obedience to the superior of the jesuit mission in england in order that she might be with him where he was might follow his steps like a faithful dog that his people should be her people and his god her god but where he died she could not die to live without the vanished light was her sadder destiny at white webbs she passed as mrs perkins or parkyns a widow lady and the sister of mr mease she received numerous visitors beside mr mease himselfcatesby who does not appear to have assumed any alias mr and mrs brooksby the latter of whom was annes sister eleanor tresham the winters and two dubious individuals who passed under the names of robert skinner and mr perkins the former was accompanied by his wife real or professed the latter professed to be a brotherinlaw of mrs perkins and is described as of middle stature long visage and somewhat lean of a brown hair and his beard inclining to yellowa description which suits none of the conspirators whose personal appearance is known at white webbs accordingly thomas winter alighted and broke in on the party there assembled with the startling news that all is discovered there is a letter sent to my lord monteagle and our action is known the party consisted of anne vaux fawkes the brooksbys and catesby who had presented himself there a few days before with the avowed object of joining the royal huntingparty at royston the next day but in the morning resolving to stay and be merry with his friends he settled down comfortably sent his man for venison and took his ease the ease and comfort were broken up by this sudden and startling news pray you flee mr catesby while you have time said winter anxiously nay i will be further as yet was the resolute answer what shall we now do how say you make sure how much is truth go you to town mr fawkes tomorrow as soon as may be and bring us word what time of day it shall be with us try the uttermost for if the part belonged to myself i would try the same adventure fawkes obeyed on the wednesday returning at night to the great relief of the conspirators with reassuring news there was no appearance of any attempt to meddle with the cellar all seemed quiet in london no excitement among the people no signs of special precaution by the authorities they might safely go on with the work on the following day thomas winter returned to london and fawkes followed in the evening arriving at the chequers in holborn just before it grew dark he did not stay here but proceeded to the house next to the house of lords where he slept that night in its solitary bed turning out his supposed master as the one bed would not accommodate both and when mr percy lay there his man lay abroad percy meanwhile had not been idle his vocation as gentleman pensioner gave him easy access to any part of the palace and the previous day had seen him making himself very agreeable in the apartments of the young prince playing with the child and chatting in a very affable manner with his nurse the youthful princes nurse happily for him was a shrewd scotchwoman and percy took little by his motion pray you mrs fordun whither leads that door out o the chalmer sir said agnes fordun what time doth his highness ride forth commonly when it likes the kings majesty how is his highness attended atweel tis maistly by them that gang wi him is his highness a brisk lively child or no hes what a prince suld be stiffly said agnes percy gave her up as impracticable and reported to his colleagues at white webbs that the duke could not be compassed comes the prince then to the parliament asked catesby percy and winter agreed that on this head rumour was assuming a negative aspect then must we have our horses beyond the water said catesby and more horses and company to surprise the prince and let the duke alone the king returned from royston on the st of october the next morning salisbury requested a private audience and in the long gallery of whitehall palace laid before his majesty the mysterious letter the astute salisbury and also the lord chamberlain had already fathomed the meaning of the terrible blow and the means by which it was to be effected but the former would scarcely have been a cecil had he not also read his royal master his majesty must have the matter so communicated to him that he should be able to believe that his own supernatural sagacity had solved a mystery impenetrable to the commonplace brains of the lords of the council it might be reasonably anticipated that such a warning should be no mystery to the son of lord darnleythat his thoughts would fly rapidly to that house in the kirk o field where his own father had received his deathblow and had not seen who hurt him that the one word gunpowder should drop from white stern lips was to be expected but do people ever do what is expected of them by others in this case at any rate nothing half so dramatic took place his majesty made a short replywhich it may be was then thought such but which now would assuredly be set down as long wordy and sententious the incertainty of the writer and the generality of the advertisement began the royal orator besides the small likelihood of any such conspiracy on the general body of any realm gives me less cause to apprehend it as a thing certain to be put in execution considering that all conspiracies commonly distinguish of men and persons yet seeing the words do rather seem as far as they are to be regarded to presage danger to the whole court of parliament over whom my care is greater than over mine own life and because the words describe such a form of doing as can be no otherwise interpreted than by some stratagem of fire and powderi wish that there may be special consideration had of the nature of all places yielding commodity for those kinds of attempts and i will then deliver my further judgment the man who could deliver his judgment in this stilted style of pompous wordbuilding in such circumstances as were then existing would have required a powdered footman in spotless plush to precede him out of a house on fire i must confess to a little misgiving as to the authenticity of this speech it looks much more likely to have been deliberately penned by my lord salisbury in the calm of his official study when the smoke had cleared away from the battlefield than to have been fired off by king james in haste and trepidationwhich he was sure to feelat the moment when the letter was laid before him the evidence that the government account of the circumstances was drawn up with due regard to what they might and should have been to produce the proper effect on the docile public and not very much as to what they were is irresistible but as no other narrative exists we can but have recourse to the stainedglass article before us his sacred majesty having thus exhibited his incomparable wisdom and been properly complimented and adored on account thereof my lord salisbury left the gallery with a grave face and hastily summoning the lords of the council went through the farce of laying the letter before them sire said he when he returned to the king the lords of the council subject to your majestys gracious pleasure advise that my lord chamberlain shall straitly view the parliament house and my lord monteagle beseecheth leave to be with him gude said his majesty who to the day of his death never lost his scottish accent i wad hae ye likewise my lord salisbury tae note o such as wad without apparent necessity seek absence frae the parliament because tis improbable that among a the nobles this warning should be only gien to ane sire your majestys command shall be obeyed atweel let the search be made and report to me said the king as he left the gallery the following monday which was the day before the opening of parliament was appointed for the search on the friday catesby thomas winter and tresham met at barnet when catesby angrily accused tresham of having sent the warning to lord monteagle and tresham vehemently denied it marry it must be you said catesby the only ones that harried us touching the saving of persons were you and mr keyes who would fain have saved his master my lord mordaunt all other were consenting to the general issue that the catholic lords should be counselled to tarry away on account of the new statutes i never writ nor sent that letter on my honour cried tresham did he speak the truth no man knows to this day on the saturday the conspirators had another scare in lincolns inn walks thomas winter met tresham who told him in a terrified whisper that lord salisbury had been to the king and there was grave reason to fear had shown him the fatal letter winter hastened away to catesby to whom he communicated the news for the first time gatesbys heart failed him i will be gone said he yetnay i will stay till mr percy come without whose consent will i do nothing but money was wanted and one of the moneyed men who had been drawn into the conspiracy for that purpose could alone supply it tresham that one who was at hand took winter to his apartments in clerkenwell note where he counted out a hundred pounds the same night a letter was brought to salisbury which had been found dropped in the street a few words of it were in cipher it purported to be written by ef mak to richard bankes and in it these words occurredthe gallery with the passage thereto yieldeth the best of assurance and a safety of the actors themselves i hope to behold the tyrannous heretic defeated in his cruel pleasures these mysterious hints coming so quickly after the monteagle letter still further alarmed and excited the council the conspirators gathered on sunday night in the house behind saint clementsfawkes catesby thomas winter and the two wrights they were shortly joined by percy it was late when they partedparted to meet all together in this world never any more catesby had made up his mind to go down into the country the next day percy and the wrights were preparing to follow all were ready to escape the moment the necessity should arise except fawkes who was to fire the powder and thomas winter who said he would tarry and see the end some had already departedsir everard digby to coughton the house of mr throckmorton which he had borrowedwhere garnet already was percy spent the monday in a visit to the earl of northumberland at syon christopher wright and thomas winter in buying articles needful for the coming journey in the morning rookwood accidentally met catesby whose spirits had risen there was no need to fear things would go on well three oclock in the afternoon saw lord suffolk the lord chamberlain of the household accompanied by lord monteagle descending into the vaults of the house of lords they glanced into different parts and coming to the cellar immediately under the house the lord chamberlain noticed that it was apparently filled with stacked faggots whose are all these said he a tall dark man who had unlocked the cellar for their lordships entrance and was now standing by with the key in his hand gave the answer with an air of rustic simplicity ant like your lordships tis my masters provision for the winter who is your master asked the lord chamberlain ant please you mr percy one of his majestys pensioners that hath his lodging this next door i thought none dwelt next door how long hath your master had the house under your lordships leave about a year and an half but hath deferred his lying there by reason of some occasions which caused him to be absent well he has laid in a good stock of fuel said the chamberlain as if carelessly and their lordships turned and remounted the stairs arrived at a place where they might speak unheard the noble searchers looked each into the others face with the same question on the lips of both what thinks your lordship of all this stock of fuel below nay what think you my lord truly i am very suspicious thereof my lord the more i do observe the letter said lord monteagle earnestly and meditate on the words thereof the more jealous am i of the matter and of this place look you this mr percy the pensioner and i had great dearness of friendship between us at one time he is a near relative of my lord northumberland and a catholic were i you that cellar should be thoroughly overhauled well let us go to the king it was between five and six oclock and the short november daylight was over when the searchers brought back their report to his majesty recounted their suspicions and asked what they were to do gie me a man wi his heid on his shoulders said his majesty and ye ha that my lord monteagle noo ill just tell ye i ay held ane maxim to wit either do naething or do that quhilk shall make a sure so yell just gang your ways and hae a glint ahint thae faggots in the bit cellar if it please your highness is there no fear that so we may give room for murmurings and evil rumours if we search this cellar and find nothing may not men say the government is unduly suspicious and under your highness leave shall it not place my lord northumberland in jeopardyhe being akin to mr percy and his great friend ay is there twa heids weel screwit on i jalouse my lord monteagle yere saying ae word for my lord northumberland and twa for yoursel be it sae a man hath but ane life my lord chamberlain can ye no raise a bit rumour that a wheen o the hangings are missing that suld hae been in the wardrobe in wyniards keeping then gang your ways and turn out the faggots and if it might please your majesty suggested the lord chamberlain were it not best some other made the searchone of the gentlemen of your privy chamberso as to rouse less suspicion ay gang your ways and send auld knevet down wi a pair or twa o younger hands to toss the faggots might it not be well also sire to extend the search to the houses adjoining the parliament house and so make examination of the lodging where mr percy lieth do sae do sae responded the king i affy me in you only heed this what you do do throughly just as the abbey clock struck eleven fawkes came out of percys rooms and went down into the vault by the door which had been made the previous easter he carried in one hand a dark lantern lighted and in the other a piece of touchwood and a match eight or nine inches in length as he set the lantern down in the corner of the vault he felt a touch upon his shoulder and looked up in alarm until he met the eyes of robert keyes mr fawkes take this watch which mr percy sends you that you may the better know when to fire the train keyes spoke in a very low tone so that he might not be heard outside fawkes took the watch and secreted it carefully watches were rare and precious things not carried by every gentleman even when wealthy and percy had bought this one for its special purpose keyes departed and fawkes opened the door of the vault for a breath of fresh air he had scarcely come out and closed it behind him when another hand grasped his shoulder not with the light touch of his confederate who are you asked the voice of an old man my name is john johnson my master i am mr percys man make stay of him said the voice and you come after me into the vault into the vault went sir thomas knevet and with his men began a search among the carefullystacked wood it did not take long to lay bare the sixandthirty barrels and by drilling a small hole into two of them to make sure of the nature of their contents spread before them in the full magnitude of its horror lay the gunpowder treason and plot which through the coming ages of english history should never be forgot a slight noise overhead alarmed the searchers who feared lest mr percys man might be endeavouring to escape sir thomas sent up one of his men named doubleday to make sure of him till his return fawkes however was still in the hands of the watchman but on doubledays appearance he requested permission to go to his own room in the adjoining house this doubleday allowed posting himself as watchmen at the door no sooner was fawkes alone than he took the opportunity to rid himself of the chief evidences against him by flinging the match and tinder out of his window which overlooked the river in another minute sir thomas knevet and his men entered the chamber know you what we have found in your masters cellar you have found what was there i suppose was the cool reply search the man was sir thomas knevets order but this indignity fawkes resented and opposed with all his strength the struggle was severe but short he was overpowered and bound with his own garters they found on him the watch which keyes had brought from percy how could you have put fire to the gunpowder asked knevet without danger to yourself i meant to fire it by a match eight or nine inches long as soon as i had set it i should have fled for mine own safety if i had been in the cellar when you took me i would at once have blown up all keep a strong guard on this caitiff said sir thomas and you doubleday see to the cellar i will to his majesty as he left percys house midnight tolled out on the clock of the abbey the fifth of november had begun sir thomas knevet left his prisoner under guard and returned to the king late as it was his majesty had not retired the members of the council who were at handfor some always slept in the palacewere called in the gates secured a cordon of troops set across king street and another at charing cross the remainder of the council in town had been sent for and as soon as they arrived about one oclock am the king sat at their head in his bedchamber and fawkes was brought in and placed before them nothing quelled the spirit of guy fawkes the councillors were eager impatient vehement he was calm as a summer eve cool as the midnight snow to their hurried queries he returned straightforward unabashed imperturbable answers still keeping up his character of an ignorant rustic tell us fellow why that store of gunpowder was laid in to blow up the parliament house said fawkes when should it have been executed tomorrow when the king had come and the upper house was sitting of whom of myself how knew you that the king would come only by report and the making ready his barge and for what cause for the advancement of the catholic religion you are a papist ay and wherefore would you be a party to the destruction of so many of your own religion we meant principally to have respected our own safety and would have prayed for them your name and calling john johnson and mr percys man was your master a party to this treason you can ask him when you see him who were your accomplices then the dark eyes shot forth fire you would have me betray my friends said guy fawkes the giving warning to one hath overthrown us all it was found impossible to obtain any further information from fawkes neither fear nor coaxing would induce him to name his accomplices he was sent to the tower which he entered by traitors gate well to be sure whatten a thingcums what sort of a thing this has summat happened sin we went to bed rachel i say rachel lass come here rachel heard the exclamation when charity opened the front door and came running with a wooden spoon in her hand see thou lass dost thou see all

both so warm this november morrow that you stand at the street door said ediths voice behind them prithee shut it charity my mother comes anon charity obeyed while rachel hastily poured the astonishing news into ediths ears the latter grew a shade paler what be these traitors she said theyre papists for sure said rachel decidedly nobry elsed think of nought so wicked ah i reckon they are added charity clinching the nail theyre right naught note the whole boilin of em the news was broken to lady louvaine more gently than it had been to edith but she clasped her hands with a faint cry ofaubrey if these be they with whom he hath consorted god keep the lad i trust mother dear god will keep him responded edith softly would you have him hither truly i know not what to say daughter maybe he is the safest with my lady of oxford nay i think not now came temperance with her marketbasket and she had to be told her first thought was of a practical nature but it was not aubrey dear heart you say not so how ever am i to get to market lancaster and derby but i would those papist companions were swept clean away out of the realm i dont believe theres a loyal man amongst em nay temperance we know not yet if they be papists know not if they be why of course they are was the immediate decision of temperance what else can they be theres none other sort ill enough to hammer such naughty work out of their fantasy dont know indeed dont tell me and temperance and her basket marched away in dudgeon the previous evening had been spent by christopher wright rookwood and keyes at the duck and they were the first among the conspirators to hear of the discovery and arrest at five oclock in the morning christopher wright made a sudden appearance in thomas winters chamber where that worthy was sleeping certainly not the sleep of the just rise up mr winter he cried excitedly rise and come along to essex house for i am going to call upon my lord northumberland the matter is discovered by a letter to my lord monteagle thomas winter sat up in his bed go back mr wright said he and learn what you can about essex gate off dashed christopher and winter dressed hastily he was scarcely ready when his friend returned surely all is lost cried wright for leyton is got on horseback at essex door and as he parted he asked if their lordships would have any more with him and being answered no is rode as fast up fleet street as he can ride go you then to mr percy urged winter for sure it is for him they seek and bid him be gone i will stay and see the uttermost away went wright again and winter followed more slowly he found the court gates straitly guarded so that he was not allowed to enter then he turned and went down towards the houses of parliament and in the middle of king street he found the guard standing who would not let him pass as winter passed up king street again silence abbott came out of her door having just published herself for the day and accosted rachel who was busy with the doorsteps why whatevers all this todo said she in considerable dismay had she been wasting daylight and precious material for gossip by lying in bed halfanhour longer than usual why theres a treason discovered said rachel wringing out her flannel lackaday what manner of treason biggest ever was heard on the king and all th lords o th parliament to be blown up winter hesitated no more evidently all was known to save himselfif it might bewas the only thing now possible he went straight to the liverystable where he kept his horse mounted and set forth for dunchurch where the huntingparty was to meet if all were lost in london it was not certain that something might not be retrieved in the country it was a grievous blunder and grievously they answered it had they instantly gone on board the vessel which lay moored in the river ready to carry fawkes away when the mine was fired and set sail for flanders every one of them might have fulfilled the number of his days it seems almost as if their eyes were holden that they should go up and fall at the place appointed the first to fly had been catesby and john wright keyes followed at eight oclock going straight to turvey rookwood at eleven overtaking keyes three miles beyond highgate and catesby and wright at brickhill as they rode together wright cast their cloaks into a hedge to ride more speedily percy had spent the night in the city but christopher wright soon found him and they galloped after their colleagues at hockliffe percys servant story met them with fresh horses and overtaking the others further on they at last reached ashby saint ledgers in safety robert winter the elder brother of thomas was then at grafton the residence of his fatherinlaw stalwart old john talbot whither he and his wife had ridden on the last day of october he was among the more innocent of the plotters and had taken no active part in anything but the mining riding from grafton on the th he spent the night at the bull inn coventry and next day reached the hall at ashby saint ledgers where the widowed lady catesby held her solitary state lady catesby nee anne throckmorton and her worthy son were not on the best terms having found it necessary or amusing to sue one another in his majestys law courts and shortly before this lady catesby had been to huddington to request robert winters assistance in making peace with her son he was now on his way to advise her and had heard nothing of the proceedings in london but soon after his arrival at the hall four weary bemired men arrived also these were percy the wrights and rookwood keyes having left them on the way lost lost cried impetuous percy as he came booted spurred and covered with mud into the very neat drawingroom where lady catesby and her young daughter elizabeth were engaged on their embroidery all is lost the whole plot discovered i cast no doubt proclamations shall be out by morning light to seize us all with a full relation how short or how long we be lady catesby exerted herself to provide for the refreshment and comfort other very unexpected guests and they were soon on their way across the hall to supper when one of the servants came up with a message that one at the base door prayed speech of mr winter robert winter excused himself to his hostess and going to the backdoor he there found martha bates wife of the bates who was his fellowconspirator and catesbys servant pray you sir said martha with a bob of deprecation mingled with deference to come into the fields by the towns end where is one would speak quickly with you who is it martha glanced round as if afraid of the chestnuts overhearing her well sir to tell truth tis mr catesby but i pray you let not my lady anne know of his being here robert winter took his way to the place appointed and found a group of some twelve horsemen awaiting him good even well what news the worst could be mr fawkes is taken and the whole plot discovered ay you have heard it then here are come but now my cousins wright with mr percy and mr rookwood bringing the same news what now do we what say you well it seems to me best that each should submit himself weve not yet come to that bid them every one follow me to dunchurch without loss of time onlymind you let not my mother know of my being here to dunchurchwhat afore supper we were but just come into the diningchamber and i smell somewhat uncommon good you may tarry for jugged hare said catesby contemptuously i shall ride quickly to dunchurch and there consult wellif you must have with you bring some pies in your pocket robin and then youll not fall to cannibalism on the way called catesby after him andhark ask if any wist the road to dunchurch for i know it not the question was put in vain to all the party it appeared when they came up with catesby that nobody knew the road to dunchurch guideposts were a mystery of the future we must needs have a guide said catesby but i am fain at this moment not to show myself in ashby robin wilt thou win us one go thou to leeson the smith at the entering in of the village as thou comest from ravensthorpe ay i know ask him if he will guide us to dunchurch and he shall be well paid for it he is safe being a catholic we will follow anon bennet leeson the blacksmith at ashby saint ledgers had given up work for the day and having gone through some extensive ablutions and the subsequent supper now stood at his cottage door looking out on the green and taking his rest he was not enjoying a pipe for that was as yet a vice of the city which had not penetrated to rustic and primitive places such as ashby saint ledgers a horseman came trotting up the street and drew bridle at his door give thee good den smith dost know the road to dunchurch bennet leeson took off his leather cap and scratched his head as if it were necessary to clear a path to his brains before the question could penetrate so far well i reckon i do when tis wanted what o that wilt guide me thither what this even ay now bennets cap came off again and he repeated the clearing process on the other side of his head i will content thee well for it said the stranger but make up thy mind for time presseth a dulcet vision of silver shillingsof which no great number usually came his wayfloated before the charmed eyes of the blacksmith well i shouldnt mind if i did tarry while i get my horse the stranger waited though rather impatiently till bennet reappeared leading a rough dunsmoor pony with a horsecloth tied round it on which he mounted without saddle now then my master nay not that way youre turning your back on dunchurch so the horseman checked his hasty start with a smile and followed his guide as they reached the other end of the village and came out into the open catesby and his companions emerged from the trees and joined robert winter hims growed said bennet leeson to himself as he glanced round at the increased sound of horses hoofs first time i ever see one man split his self into thirteen the beasts split his self too wonder if themll ha come to sixandtwenty by the time us gets at dunchurch the company however grew no further and bennet led them up to the door of the lion at dunchurch without any more marvels it was now about seven or eight oclock in the night catesby the only one whom he knew by sight said to the smith as he dismounted here smith wilt walk the horses a few moments it shall not be forgot in the reckoning the whole party then went into the lion where sir everard digby and others awaited them a hurried eager discussion of future plans took place here the drawer was called to bring bottles of sack and glasses and before he was well out of hearing impetuous percy cried we are all betrayed softly ant like you responded the cooler catesby we must go on now cried percy we shall die for it else but what must we now do asked rookwood go even yet to combe abbey and seize on the lady elizabeth we wait for you mr catesby said sir everard you have been our leader from the beginning and we of your following will not forsake you now too late for anything of that sort was catesbys decision there are scarce enough of us and word will sure be sent to my lord harrington quicker than we could reach the place remember they will go direct and we have come round nay our only way is to gather all our friends together and see what manner of stand we can make in numbers is our safety every catholic in the realm will rally to us said sir everard and many protestants belike suggested robert winter marry we shall have brave following ere we be twelve hours older said percy but which way go we now let us first cross over to grants we shall maybe increase our numbers there then go we to coughton pressing such as will join us on the way done said percy always the first to agree to anything which was action and not waiting for events outside in the meantime bennet leeson was walking the horses as he had been requested tarry a bit leeson thou hast not yet handled all thou mayest gain this night said a voice the smith knew why whence came you tom bates youve good eyes bennet ive been behind you ever since we left ashby by the same token but i never saw you well let be seeing me or nowilt guide me to rugby and back here for another shilling bates and leeson accordingly rode away to a little town called rugby where at the bailiffs house they found nine more worthies who had finished their supper and were playing cards one of these gentry was john winterthe halfbrother of robert and thomaswhose mother was the daughter of queen marys redoubtable secretary sir john bourne note he was either very simple or very clever and at this distance of time it is not easy to say which bates delivered the message with which he was charged that the gentlemen at dunchurch desired their company to be merry and the nine cardplayers accordingly returned with him to that place having paid the promised shilling to leeson bates took his new convoy into the inn whence the whole party emerged in about a quarter of an hour that is for thy pains smith and i thank thee said catesby stooping from his saddle to put two shillings in the hand of his guide the whole party now rode away in the direction of coventry well thats a queer start said the blacksmith to himself looking first after the horsemen and then down at the money in his hand if it hadnt abeen muster catesby now and tom bates might ha thought us d been out wi the fairies this even youre good silver arent you let we see ayan edward shovelboard note and a new shilling o king james and three groats o queen bessthats not fairy silver i count come along yethard note as he scrambled on the back of his shaggy friend thee and mell go home now us has done a good nights work they shillings ll please she if hers not in a tantrum gee up wi thee note sicklemore one of the priests said with a sigh the divell is in that lord of salisbury all our undoing is his doing and the execution of garnet is his only deed additional manuscript folio note clerkenwell was a suburb wherein many roman catholics dwelt there were divers houses of recusants in saint johns street among them those of sir henry james and thomas sleep at the last of which fawkes was a frequent visitor mrs wyniard bore witness that when fawkes paid her the last quarters rent on sunday november rd he had good store of gould in his pocket note modern writers are apt to confuse nought and naught at this time they were quite distinct the former signifying nothing and the latter whence naughty is derived wickedness note this is the gentleman described by the hot gospeller as coming to the door of the councilchamber looking as the wolf doth for a lamb unto whom my two keepers delivered me and he took me in greedily narrative of edward underhill harl manuscript folio b note the shilling of edward the sixth acquired this popular name from being so large and flat that it was found convenient for use in the game of shovelboard note the northamptonshire pronunciation of edward chapter nine on the weary way to holbeach and thou hast fashioned idols of thine own idols of gold of silver and of stone to them hast bowed the knee and breathed the breath and they must help thee in the hour of death sir edwin arnold while the discomfited conspirators were thus speeding on their weary way in hope of yet gathering recruits enough to raise the standard of rebellion in the interests of that church on whose behalf they counted everything lawful lord harrington at combe abbey heard the news and hurried the little princess off to coventry as a safer place than his own house for coventry was determinately protestant and loyal elizabeth afterwards well known as the queen of bohemia was deeply impressed and horrified with the terrible discovery what sort of a queen should i have been said the truehearted child when i had won to my throne through the blood of my father and my brothers thanked be god that it was not so the metropolis was passing through a ferment of delight amazement and activity everywhere in the streets bonfires were blazingthe first of those gunpowder plot bonfires which every fifth of november has seen after them a watch was set on percys house in holborn and his wife was guarded a priest named roberts was taken in the house mrs martha percy appears to have been a fitting mate for a conspirator she put on an affectation of the sublimest innocence how should she know anything she who lived so quietly and was entirely occupied in teaching her own and other children as to her husband she had not seen him since midsummer he was attendant on my lord of northumberland and lodged as she supposed in his house having thus lulled to sleep the suspicions of those set to watch her the next morning mrs percy was not to be found whether she slipped through a door or climbed out of a window or went up the chimney on a broomstick there was no evidence to show but three days later she made her appearance at norbrook house in warwickshire the residence of her eldest brother john wright and was affectionately received by her sisterinlaw at westminster lord chiefjustice popham and sir edward coke sat in judicial ermine and summoned before them two prisonersgideon gibbons the porter and the clever gentleman who called himself john johnson and whose real name was guy fawkes gibbons was soon disposed of for he was as innocent as he seemed to be all that he could say was that he had been hired in his usual way of business with two other porters to carry three thousand billets of wood to the parliament house and that mr percys servant johnson had stacked them in the cellar the key of the house next door had been at times left in charge of his wife so much he knew and no more the examination of john johnson was another matter the king himself had drawn up a paper containing questions to be put to him and he answered these and all others with an appearance of perfect frankness and wish to conceal nothing his replies were in reality a mixture of truth and falsehood which was afterwards proved the catechism began as usual what is your name john johnson to this he adhered through two more examinations how old are you thirtysix this was true where were you born in netherdale in the county of york how have you lived hitherto by a farm of thirty pounds a year how came those wounds in your breast they are scars from the healing of a pleurisy the treatment of pleurisy in the seventeenth century was apparently rather severe fawkes went on to reply to the articles demanded that he had never served any man but percythough he had been in the service of anthony browne lord montague a few months before that he obtained percys service only by his own means being a yorkshire man that he had learned french in england and increased it when abroad that he was born a papist and not pervertedwhich was false being asked why he was addressed as mr fauks in a letter as he alleged from mrs colonel bostock which was found in his pocket mr johnson replied with the coolest effrontery that it was because he had called himself so in flanders where mrs bostock resided this letter was subsequently discovered to come from anne vaux thus far went king jamess queries in respect of which the king desired if he will no other ways confesse the gentle tortours to be first used unto him et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur and so god speede your good work it was not however necessary to urge a confession mr percys man seemed anxious to make a clean breast of it and promised to tell everything he proceeded accordingly to lead his examiners astray by a little truth and a good deal of falsehood he gave a tolerably accurate account of the hiring of the house and the cellar the bringing in of the powder etcetera except that he refrained from implicating any one but himself there was at first a certain air of nobility about fawkes and he sternly refused to become an informer he declined to admit his summer journey abroad and would not allow that the spring excursion had any other object than to see the country and pass away the time what would you have done asked the examiners with the queen and the royal issue if they had been there i would not have helped them if all had gone who would have been published or elected king we never entered into that consideration what form of government should have succeeded we were too few to enter into the consideration the people themselves would have drawn to a head all this was untrue as fawkes subsequently allowed a number of arrests were made mostly of innocent persons all in whose houses the conspirators had lodged mrs herbert mrs more the tailor patrick mrs wyniard mrs bright and their respective servants lord northumberlands gentlemen and the earl himself were put under lock and key the poor earl bemoaned himself bitterly and entreated that percy might be searched forwho alone could show him clear as the day or dark as the night he asserted that percy had obtained money from him by falsehood and seeing how exquisitely little value most of these worthy gentlemen seem to have set upon truth it was not at all unlikely lady northumberland wrote an impulsive letter to lord salisbury entreating him to stand her friend by salving her husbands reputation much wounded in the opinion of the world by this wretched cousin but the only result of the appeal was to make the lord treasurer angry and give rise to an intercession in her behalf from her lord and master who begs salisbury to bear with her because she is a woman and therefore not able with fortitude to bear out the crosses of the world as men are and adds the earl humorously she will sometimes have her own ways let me do what i can which is not unknown to you note the prisoners were remanded and the great metropolis slept but there was no sleep for those bemired and weary horsemen who pressed on that night journey to norbrook where grant joined them is not recorded but humphrey littleton had left them at dunchurch his share in the plot had been insignificant but we shall hear of him again catesby john wright and percy who rode in front beguiled their journey by a discussion as to how they could procure fresh horses they were approaching warwick and it was proposed that grant and some of the servants should be sent on in front with instructions to make a raid on a liverystable in the town kept by a man named bennock and seize as many horses as they could get robert winter riding behind saw the men sent on and pressing forward to the front inquired the meaning of it when told the intention he combated it strongly and did his best to dissuade catesby from it the man who had swallowed the camel of the gunpowder plot was scandalised at the idea of horsestealing note i pray you no more of this said robert winter it will but further increase the wrath of the king some of us may not look back said catesby robert replied with some spirit for he knew himself to be among the less guilty of the plotters yet others i hope may and therefore i beg you let this alone catesby looked up with a faint sad smile and tired sleepless eyes what hast thou any hope robin i assure thee there is none that knoweth of this action but shall perish when the body of the conspirators reached warwick about am the horses were almost ready for them to mount ten were seized at the the liverystable and a few more were either stolen or borrowed from the castle thus provided and now about eighty in number they rode on to grants house at norbrook on arrival here they despatched bates to coughton with a letter to garnet from digby this letter was read by garnet to greenway both of whom are represented by bates as spotlessly ignorant of the plot until that moment greenway returned with bates at his earnest request attired in coulored satten done with gould lace and was met by catesby with the exclamation here is a gentleman who will live and die with us from norbrook robert winter despatched a servant in advance summarily ordering his wife to go forth of the house and take the children with her which the obedient gertrude did about two oclock on the afternoon of the sixth thirtysix wornout men arrived at huddington to be rearmed from robert winters armoury after which finding himself rather at a loss in the housekeeping department the master of the house recalled his gertrude to minister to the comfort of himself and his guests that submissive lady did her duty and leaving the children with the neighbour at whose house she had taken refuge returned to her own kitchen to superintend a hastilyprepared supper for the weary travellers before this was ready catesby and john wright took robert winter aside and tried hard to induce him to write to his fatherinlaw attempting to draw him into the now almost hopeless rebellion there is no remedy robin said john wright but thou must write a letter to thy father talbot to see if thou canst therewith draw him unto us nay that will i not was the determined answer robin you must said catesby my masters ye know not my father talbot so well as i replied robin winter all the world cannot draw him from his allegiance neither would i if i could in this case what friends hath my poor wife and children but he and therefore satisfy yourselves i will not well then suggested wright write as we shall say unto thee to master smallpiece that serves thy father talbot robert winter who liked an easy life suffered himself to be persuaded on this point and wrote the letter of which all that now remains is a few halfburnt lines written in great haste and barely legible good cousin i fear it will not seem strange to you thata good number of resolved catholics so perform matters of such will set their most strength or hang all those that ever use your best endeavour to stir up my father talbot which i hold much more honourable than to be hanged after cousin pray for me i pray you and send me all such friends haste i commend you from huddington this th of november r having written this letter mr robert winter proceeded not to forward but to pocket it and declined to give it up until the next morning when he resigned it to stop a peace withal late in the evening of the th the conspirators were joined by stephen littleton and thomas winter the latter of whom had not been able to overtake them any sooner before daybreak on the following morning they assembled in the private chapel of huddington house where mass was sung by the family confessor mr hammond and the sacrament was administered to all present after due confession then leaving huddington about sunrise they recommenced their weary flight they were now armed at all points in open rebellion yet with daggers and guns only instead of continuing their course as hitherto directly westward they turned towards the north and made for hewell grange the residence of lord windsor where they plundered the armoury the company had much decreased one and another every now and then dropped off stealthily doubtful of what was coming though catesby and sir everard rode pistol in hand warning them that all who sought to steal away would be shot without quarter percy grant john wright and morgan were placed behind for the same purpose as the party rode towards hewell grange they asked all whom they met to join them the usual response was we are for king james if you go for him then will we have with you to this the conspirators were wont to replywe go for god and the country but the shrewd worcestershire peasants declined to commit themselves to anything so vague as this at last they came to an old countryman to whom they addressed their customary appeal the old man planted his staff firmly in front of him and set his back against a wall i am for king james he said for whom i will live and die upon this the disloyalty of the company was plainly manifested by shouts of kill him kill him but there was no time to stop for that which probably saved the brave old loyalists life upon leaving hewell the conspirators rode up to the houses of all the roman catholic gentry in the neighbourhood and summoned their owners to join them for god and the church but sore disappointments met them on every side from door after door they were driven with horror and contumelywere openly told that they had brought ruin on the catholic cause not one man came to take our part is their lament though we had expected so many to add to their misery the rain began to pour down in torrents one after another deserted them as they fled and when at last in the darkness the heath was passed and holbeach house was reached instead of the gallant company of eighty wellaccoutred troops who had left norbrook the morning before there crept into the courtyard only eighteen wet and weary men who had lost all including honour holbeach house was about two miles from stourbridge and was the home of stephen littleton one of the latest to join the plot here the wornout men sleptthe last sleep for some of them so weary and wornout were they that they sank to sleep just as they were in the diningroomsome pillowing their heads on the table others casting themselves on the floor at this very unsuitable moment it seemed good to mr john winter to inquire of percy what he meant to do note percy in extremely somnolent tones answered that he intended to go on ay but how and whither responded thomas winter as wide awake as he usually was in all senses if you have eer a plan in your head out with it replied percy just now ive no head to put one in if you will hearken to me said thomas you will now despatch robins letter to my cousin smallpiece what to do what to doto win his aid he is as true a catholic as any of us ay hes catholic but he is very timorous he has no mind to be hanged trust me have you i should stand to it better than he then youll meet old master talbot who shall kick you forth ere you have time to say ant please you ill have a care of that steenie wilt have with me mr stephen littleton had to be awoke before he could answer the question as soon as he understood what was demanded of him he professed his readiness to accompany anybody anywhere in the future so long as he might be let alone to finish his nap at the present before another sentence had been uttered he reverted to an unconscious state suddenly sir everard sprang up mr catesby methinks i shall best serve you if i go to hasten the succours what think you if you will said catesby for once a little doubtfully ten minutes later one of the least wearied horses in the group carried him away there were troops on their way to holbeach but it was not for succour sir richard walsh the sheriff sir john folliott a few gentlemen and a party of the kings troops with all the force of the county were on the track of the wretched fugitives they had chased them from northamptonshire into warwickshire from warwickshire into worcestershire and now they were approaching their last refuge in staffordshire it was still dark on the friday morning when thomas winter and stephen littleton rode to pepperhill where old mr talbot was at that time robert declined to accompany them and bates excused himself to obtain sight of mr smallpiece without being seen by mr talbot was the delicate business on which they were bent leonard smallpiece seems to have been an agent or bailiff of mr talbot and a relative of the winters he was exceeding popishe but very timorous note the pair of worthies settled that stephen should remain outside in charge of the horses while winter tried to effect safe entrance they rode up to the yard door and having dismounted were about to investigate possibilities when without any warning the doors were flung open and the sturdy old loyalist owner appeared behind them how dare you come hither was his fierce greeting to the unwelcome visitors considering what speech there is of your tumultuous rising sir answered winter deprecatingly my meaning was not to speak with you but with one in your house and i am very sorry i have met with you so am i too said john talbot your coming may be as much as my life is worth it is very fit you should be taken i shall not easily be taken was the reply fare you well get you away answered talbot as he slammed the gate in winters face they came to the conclusion that discretion would be the better part of valour and retraced their steps to holbeach here stephen went into the house leaving winter outside the former found his friends very busily engaged in making preparations for resistance for they had now determined that at holbeach their last stand should be made their gunpowder like themselves had been soaked in the rain the stour being extremely high and the cart which they had stolen from hewell grange a very low one catesby rookwood and grant applied themselves to the drying of the powder they laid about sixteen pounds of it in a linen bag on the floor and heaping about two pounds on a platter placed it in the chimneycorner to dry by the fire a servant entering to put fresh logs on the fire was not sufficiently careful of the platter a spark flew out lighted on the powder and it exploded part of the roof was blown off the linen bag was carried through the hole thus made and afterwards taken up uninjured in the courtyard but the three powderdryers with henry morgan were severely injured both in face and body in the same pit that they had dug privily was their own foot taken when the conspirators thus beheld themselves hoist with their own petard the first feeling among them was less fear for their safety than awe at the just judgment of god the most guilty among them were also the most horrified for a moment those nearest the powder were supposed to be killed john wright lost his head flung himself on what he believed to be the corpse of his leader with a wild cry woe worth the time that we have seen this day bring me the powder bring me the powder that i may set it afire and blow up ourselves and this house together rookwood rushed to a picture of the virgin and throwing himself on his knees confessed that the act was so bloody that he desired god to forgive him in which prayer he was joined by some of the others catesby himself lost his firmness and on recovering himself gasped out his fear that god disapproved of their project robert winter and greenway fled in terrorso far that they never came back stephen littleton went off also but he waited long enough to send a message to thomas winter who had not yet come in tell him to fly said the valiant stephen and so will i whatever else thomas winter was he was loyal to his oath and to his friends his honour rooted in dishonour stood and faith unfaithful kept him falsely true he supposed the news to mean that catesby was killed nay said he i will first see the body of my friend and bury him whatsoever befall me returning to the house winter found his friends decidedly alive and reasonable well what resolve you to do he asked them we mean here to die was the answer well replied winter i will take such part as you do and john wright said i will live and die among you not long afterwards about noon the sheriff and his troops surrounded holbeach house after several ineffectual summonses to surrender and the reading of a proclamation in the kings name bidding the rebels to submit themselves which met only with blunt refusals the sheriff fired the house and led an attack upon the gates the conspirators who were left showed no lack of courage they walked out into the courtyard set the gate open and took up their stand in front of it catesby in the middle with percy and thomas winter on either side at the first assault an arrow from a crossbow had struck winter in the shoulder and rendered his right arm useless the second shot struck john wright the third christopher wright the fourth rookwood the two wrights fell and were supposed to be dead stand by me tom said catesby to winter and we will die together sir was the answer i have lost the use of my right arm and i fear that will cause me to be taken they were the last words of robert catesby the next bullet passed clean through his body and lodged in that of percy at his side catesby fell mortally wounded he had just strength to crawl on his hands and knees into the vestibule of the house where stood an image of the virgin and clasping it in his arms he died percy sank down also wounded to death he expired the following day john wright recovering somewhat from his wound called to bates and delivered him a bag of money entreating him to fly and take it to mrs wright at norbrook winter was seized grant rookwood and morgan yielded themselves to the sheriff but the exasperated mob rushing in while the sheriffs men were lifting one of the wounded seized upon the others stripped and illused them until wounds which might possibly have been healed were past cure john and christopher wright died in two or three days one or two fugitives were brought into holbeach later five were arrested at stourbridge sir everard digby at dudley bates succeeded in making good his escape with the bag and reached wolverhampton in the night his wife martha who lived at ashby hearing a false rumour of his capture and imprisonment in shrewsbury gaol went to see him and both stayed for the night in the same inn at wolverhampton neither of them knowing the nearness of the other bates finding himself unable to reach lapworth and with no hope of escaping finally delivered the bag of money to a friend to convey to martha and departed not wishing to endanger his friend he then went to oldfield in shropshire to the house of his cousin richard bates by whom having been betrayed he was apprehended and brought to london by his confession on his examination garnet and greenway were implicated though bates tried his best to prove them innocent sir richard walsh conveyed his prisoners to worcester where he occupied himself in taking their examinations and sending the information obtained to the lords of the council sir richard verney was sent to scour the country on the recent track of the fugitives and to arrest the relatives and servants of every one of them john winter gertrude winter at huddington ludovic grant at dudley dorothy grant at norbrook and at lapworth john wrights wife dorothy and christophers wife margaret ambrose rookwoods wife and her sister and thomas rookwood of claxton at bidford were all gradually added to the group mrs dorothy grant whether from fright or loquacity proved very candid in answering questions and from her they learned that the missing martha percy was not far off sir richard verney however found it no easy matter to keep his prisoners when he had got them twice his house was set on fire evidently by design but he held stoutly to the lively ladies in his care and delivered them all safely in london in due time we must now for a short time follow the two conspirators who had escaped in company and whose wanderings are not devoid of interest robert winter and stephen littleton got safely away from holbeach thus evading the miserable fate of their fellowconspirators they succeeded in reaching the house of a certain christopher white a servant of stephens cousin humphrey littleton who lived in the village of kings rowley this man they bribed to allow them to remain in his barn until the search for the fugitives should have ceased when they promised to give him a substantial reward and no longer to endanger him by their presence there they abode a great while but with very poor and slender fare such as otherwise had been too coarse and out of fashion for them a proclamation was meanwhile set forth by government for their discovery wherein robert winter was described as of mean stature rather low than otherwise brown hair and beard not much beard short hair somewhat stooping square made near forty stephen littleton was a very tall man swarthy complexion no beard or little brown coloured hair about thirty a neighbour of whites named smart and apparently smart by nature as well as name noticed the unusual evidences of prosperity in his neighbours dwelling and shrewdly surmised the reason upon due consideration of the subject mr smart like a good many people both before and after him came to the conclusion that it was highly unreasonable that his neighbour should be mounting the social ladder when he remained at the bottom he therefore applied himself to the matter discovered the refugees in the barn and strongly recommended his barn as far preferable to whites the fugitives were persuaded to change their hidingplace this was no sooner done than another neighbour named hollyhead set his wits also to work and dulcetly represented that smarts barn was a much less safe and attractive locality than his house each of these worthy individuals being of course moved by respect to the pecuniary reward for which he hoped on the departure of his guests white took fright and fled which caused much rumour to be blabbed abroad concerning the vain search and the probable vicinity of the fugitives humphrey littleton who was in the secret began to be alarmed and removed his friends from hollyheads house to that of a man named john perks in the village of hagley close to hagley park the residence of his widowed sisterinlaw it was before dawn on new years day that they reached the cottage of perks a warrener or gamekeeper who had been dismissed from mrs littletons service for dishonesty the wearied men knocked at his door and when perks came forth said they were friends and begged him to help them to food and shelter ye be mr stephen littleton and mr winter said perks we are so they admitted pray you goodman grant us meat and lodging till we be fit for journeying and when we can travel then shall you bring us to london and have a great reward from the king for taking us we being willing to die and not live any longer in so miserable a condition if mr perkss eyes glistened as this distant prospect of a great reward was held out to him they grew yet more radiant when humphrey littleton counted into his hand thirty golden sovereigns twenty into that of his man and seventeen to his sister perks led the way to his barn where mounting on a barley mow he formed a large hole in its midst and here the unhappy gentlemen were secreted food being brought to them by perks as occasion served by his sister margaret or at times by his man thomas burford here they might have remained in safety for a considerable time without fear of discovery had not mr perks entertained rather too close an affection for barley in another form than heaped up in a barnnamely in company with hops and water mr perks had a friend named poynter who liked beer and rabbits quite as well as himself and one winter night nine days after the fugitives had been hidden in the mow these worthies set forth on a poaching expedition returning home somewhat late and well tippled in drink it occurred to mr poynter that it would save him a walk home if his friend perks were to lodge him for the night the latter however did not see the circumstance in that light and a tipsy altercation followed which was ended by perks shaking off poynter and staggering home by himself the night was cold and wet and mr poynters temper was scarcely so cool as the atmosphere he was tipsily resolved that he would have a lodging at perkss expense whether that gentleman would or not and bethinking himself that if perkss house were locked against him his barn was not he took thither his unsteady way and scrambling up the barley mow to his own unfeigned astonishment dropped into the hole on the top of the sleeping conspirators thus roused suddenly in the dead of night and naturally concluding that their enemies were upon them winter and littleton sprang up to defend themselves and to sell their lives dearly poynter who was quite as much amazed and terrified as they could be as naturally fought for his own safety and a desperate struggle ensued it ended in the two overcoming the one and insisting on his remaining with them so that they could be certain of his telling no tales for four days poynter remained on the mow professing resignation and contentment and lamenting the sore pain which he suffered from a wound in the leg received in the pursuit of his vocation as a rabbitstealer when margaret perks came with food and afterwards burford poynter pretended to be in mortal anguish and besought them earnestly to bring him some salve without which he was quite certain he should die the salve was brought and the wily poynter then discovered that lying in the hole he had not sufficient light to apply it he was suffered to creep up on the top of the mow which he professed to do with the greatest difficulty but even there the light was scarcely sufficient might he drag himself a little nearer the door being now quite deceived by mr poynters excellent acting and believing that he was much too suffering and disabled to escape they permitted him to crawl quite to the edge of the mow nearest to the light and of course next to the door the moment this point was reached the disabled cripple slipped down from the mow and the next instant was out of the door and far away running with a fleetness which made it hopeless to think of following him there was still however some room for that hope which springs eternal in the human breast poynters friendship for perks and the expectation that perks could bribe him to secrecy weighed with the fugitives who had not sufficiently learned that the friendship of an unprincipled man is worth nothing poynter on the other hand considered his chances superior in the opposite direction he made at once for hagley hall intending to tell his story there but on the way he met with perks who was ignorant of poynters recent adventure and that gentleman suggesting a joint visit to the nearest tavern poynter easily suffered his steps to be diverted in that attractive direction the precious pair of friends drank together and departed to their respective homes now mistress littleton the lady of hagley park was a protestant and a gentlewoman of extreme discretion and the day on which poynter thus made his escape from the haymow had been chosen by her to commence a journey to london before her departure she summoned her steward mr hazelwood and desired him to be circumspect during her absence owing to the mischances happening in the county mistress littleton having ridden forth on her journey her worthy brother mr humphrey commonly called red humphrey who certainly did not share the discretion of his sister determined to play the mouse during the absence of his cat and to convey his traitorfriends into his own chamber at hagley park there is reason to think that mistress littleton was not only a sagacious but also a somewhat managing dame who rode red humphrey with a tighter curb than that reckless individual approved accordingly having heard of poynters escape and taking one person only into his confidence he repaired to the barn about eleven oclock that night and smuggled his cousin and friend away from the barley mow into the pleasanter shelter of his own room in hagley park the one person thus selected as humphreys confidant was john fynwood or fynes alias jobber also known as john cook from the office which he bore in the household humphrey had brought him up and when come to suitable age had induced his sisterinlaw to engage him as cook he therefore expected this man being thus beholden to him to remain faithful to his interests but there was another person whose interests were considerably dearer to john cook and that was himself the trio reached master humphreys chamber in safety aided by john cook robert winter turned round as he entered and grasped the cooks hand ah jack said he little wots thy mistress what guests are now in her house that in so long a space did never so much as look upon a fire welcome heartily answered humphrey motioning to his guests to approach nearer to the cheerful hearth jack lad the time being thus late canst kill some hen or chickens about the house to serve and fit the present occasion withal i will recompense it to thee afterward jack readily undertook the commission and brought up a very appetising dish with great diligence and promptness master said he you shall need drink and the butler is in bed to call on him for the key might rouse suspicion pray you shall i run in the town to my mother and fetch you drink from thence so do honest jack and hie thee back quickly see here is a tester for thee honest jack picked up the tester and disappeared it does seem strange considering the danger which was thus run that the fugitives should not have been satisfied to drink water with their supper since even thus they would have fared much better than they had done for some time past but in truth the very idea of drinking water was foreign to mens minds in those days except in the light of a very cruel hardship and about the last strait to which a starving man could be reduced the mother of jack kept a small tavern in the village thither he ran to fill his jug and to pour into the ears of the hostess the interesting fact that the traitors then sought for by the kings proclamation were at that moment entertained in master humphreys chamber at hagley park pray you mother he added when morning breaketh raise the town to take them for i fear lest i may not unsuspected get forth again to do it having made which little arrangement honest jack and his jug returned to the park where the trio of traitors finished their supper and proceeded to sleep three in a bed to make assurance doubly sure jack rapped at mr hazelwoods door and bestowed upon him the same interesting information already given to mrs fynwood the morning being come the cook paid another visit to his prisoners whom he found nearly dressed and looking out of the window to see the meaning of the noise they heard which was in fact the arrival of the sheriffs officer and his men even then so complete was their confidence in jack that they never imagined themselves betrayed and humphrey having stowed his friends for more complete security in a closetroom opening out of his chamber went down into the halland met the officer of the law sir i understand there be in this house certain traitors so charged by proclamation of his sacred majesty whom you have in keeping never an one my master i do ensure you answered humphrey as lightly as if he spoke the truth and he cut a large slice from the loaf standing on the table pray you sit down and break your fast you are full welcome as i am sure my good sister should tell you were she at home after that ye have eaten ye shall search the house an ye willsee here jack cook make a good toast for these worthy masters and thou david butler go up to my chamber for my cupthou shalt find it on the windowledge i think outside mr hazelwood was giving directions for the search hints being constantly supplied to him by the cook as to what transpired within the butler david bate went to fetch his masters cup and of course found the room empty as he came to the foot of the backstair master humphrey met him good david help me to the key of the backdoor into the cellar he said in a hurried whisper as ever thou wilt do anything for me stick now to me and help save my life sir i have not the key answered the astonished butler the brewer hath it the brewer was hastily summoned delivered the key and was as hurriedly dismissed then humphrey ran up to his closet brought down his concealed guests and conducted them through the buttery towards the cellar the butler slipped away from them and told the officers the situation was now desperate inside the house the officers were pursuing them outside a crowd in league with the authorities was shouting itself hoarse in execration of them the wretched men made one last frantic dash around the house and robert winter and stephen littleton were arrested in the stableyard and prevented from reaching the neighbouring wood but what had become of red humphrey the instant he saw the game was up he hurriedly mounted his horse and eluded his pursuers but he was not to escape much longer the searching party which poynter had led to the barn disappointed there scoured the neighbourhood and at prestwood the fugitive was taken and committed to safe custody in stafford gaol even after they were secured it was no easy matter to carry the other prisoners to worcester while they were refreshing themselves in an alehouse at hagleyprobably the tavern kept by mrs fynwooda tumult arose among the people outside which almost led to their rescue and a few miles from hagley sir thomas undirhood and his company overtook the sheriff and vainly attempted to gain possession of them to take them back to staffordshire the worcestershire men however held on grimly to their prize and at last triumphantly lodged their prisoners in the gaol at worcester the examinations of the culprits in london went on they were mainly characterised by mr fawkess contradictions on every occasion of something which he had previously said by the addition of a little information each time and by the very small amount of light that could be obtained from any outsiders on his third examination mr john johnson owned that his name was guy fawkes that he was born at york the son of edward fawkes a younger brother who had left him but small living which he ran through with equally small delay he denied on his conscience that he was in orders major or minor regular or secular on which occasion he told the truth fawkes added that he did not now desire to destroy the king it is past he said and i am now sorry for it for that i now perceive that god did not concur with it he admitted also the design on the lady elizabeth but he still declined to name his accomplices and proved obdurate to all attemptsand the attempts were basely madeto persuade him to accuse the prisoners in the tower of whom the chief was sir walter raleigh the utmost he could be induced to admit concerning this point was that it had been under consultation that the prisoners in the tower should have intelligence of the intended plot and that raleigh and several others had been named in this connection we should have been glad to have drawn any of what religion soever unto us he said we meant to have made use of all the discontented people of england but he would not allow even to the last that any communication had actually been made in his fourth examination fawkes gave the names of those who had been made privy afterwards but he still refused to reveal those of the original traitors he was accordingly put to the torture gentle or ungentle this worked its office and on the ninth of november after halfanhour on the rack fawkes recounted the names of all his accomplices he made also an admission which proved of considerable importancehe mentioned a house in enfield chase where walley garnet doth lie every examination is signed by the prisoner to the first he signs guido faukes in a free elegant italian hand the hand of an educated man but it is pitiful to see the few faint strokes which sign the fifth even the guido being left unfinished he is supposed to have fainted before the word could be written the subsequent reports are fully signed and in a firmer hand but the old free elegant signature never comes again that night an unheardof event occurred at the white bear hans floriszoon was two hours late in coming home my lad said edith meeting him in the hall we feared some ill had befallen thee it hath not befallen me mrs edith was the answer and may god avert it from us all but these men that aubrey was wont to visitmr catesby mr winter and the restare now confessed by the caitiff in the tower to have an hand in the plot aubrey the word was only just breathed from ediths lips i went thither at once and spake with aubrey whom i found to have heard nought and to be very sore troubled touching mr winter whose friendship i can see hath been right dear unto him i besought him to lie very closenot to come forth at all and if he would communicate with us these next few days to send a messenger to me at mr leighs and not here for it seemed to me there was need of caution after a time if all blow over there may be less need will you tell my lady lettice or no dear hans thou art ever thoughtful and good thou hast done very well but i think my mother must be told better softly now than roughly afteras it may be if it be let alone lady louvaine sat silent for a few minutes after that gentle communication had been made then she said the floods lift up themselves and rage mightily but yet the lord who dwelleth on high is mightier tis strange that it should be so much harder to trust him with the body than with the soul o father keep my boy from evilwhat is evil thou knowest undertake for us on the rd of november one of the prisoners in the tower escaped the sentence of the law by an inevitable summons to the higher tribunal of god almighty francis tresham died in his prison cell retracting with his last breath and upon his salvation the previous confession by which he had implicated garnet in the spanish negotiations it has been suggested that he was poisoned by government because he knew too much but there is no foundation for the charge except the possibility that his death might have been convenient to the government and the fact that they allowed his wife and servant to be with him in his last illness goes far to disprove this improbable accusation the authorities were now engaged in lively pursuit of the new track which fawkes had indicated to them a house in enfield chase where garnet was or might be found was too appetising a dainty to be lightly resigned on the rd they obtained a full confession from thomas winter and the actual name of white webbs from this moment white webbs became their ultima thule of hope and expectation a poor and mean revenge was taken on the dead catesby and percy their bodies were exhumed and beheaded and their heads set on the pinnacles of the houses of parliament the spectators noticed with superstitious terror that blood flowed from percys wound the authorities seem to have regarded percy as the head and front of the conspiracy they term him the archtraitor but by the testimony of both fawkes and winter catesby was the original deviser of the gunpowder plot note excerpts from burghley papers additional manuscript folios lady northumberland was dorothy devereux daughter of walter earl of essex and lettice knolles and sister of the famous robert earl of essex in whose rebellion so many romanists took part poor lord northumberland if innocent paid dearly for his relationship to his wretched cousin being fined pounds which in was commuted to pounds he borrowed pounds from peter vanlore to discharge the fine and repaid half of it within a year note the most comical item of this assumption of virtue is the reason as given by himself for mr rookwoods riding on in advance at this juncture seeing that he was so well horsed as he washe having fifteen or sixteen good bourseshe meant not to adventure himself in stealing of any note at holbeach i demanded of mr percy and the rest being most of them asleep what they meant to do letter of john winter gunpowder plot book article note for this shot one of the sheriffs men named john streete received shillings per day up to chapter ten the chain of our sins when on the problems of the past a flood of light has come when we see the evil that we did and the good we might have done cyrus thornton on the th of january robert and thomas winter guy fawkes john grant ambrose rookwood robert keyes and thomas bates were placed upon their trial at westminster grant and bates were really guilty of very little beyond knowing of the plot and keeping silence but they all received the same sentenceto be hung drawn and quartered sir everard digby was tried separately but to the same end he alone pleaded guilty his principal anxiety seemed to be to save the priestsa wish wherein all the conspirators agreed on leaving the dock sir everard bowing himself towards the lords said if i may but hear any of your lordships say you forgive me i shall go more cheerfully to the gallows whereupon the lords said god forgive you and we do of all the conspirators sir everard won the greatest sympathy from his rank his youth his accomplishments and especially his fine person which last drew expressions of pity from the queen who was afflicted with that fatal worship of beauty which was the bane of the stuart race three days later the scaffold was set up at the west end of saint pauls cathedral and four of the traitors were brought forth to die they were the four least guilty of the groupsir everard digby robert winter john grant and thomas bates as the prisoners were being drawn to the scaffold upon hurdles a pathetic incident took place martha bates had followed her husband to london and as the procession passed by she rushed from the crowd of spectators and flung herself upon the hurdle in an agony bates then told her of the money entrusted to him by wright which he wished her to keep for her own relief and it was afterwards granted to her by the crown arrived at the place of execution sir everard was the first to ascend the ladder very pale yet very selfcontrolled he spoke to the people saying that his conscience had led him into this offence which in respect of religion he held to be no sin at all but in respect of the law he confessed that he had done wrong and he asked forgiveness of god the king and the kingdom he declined the ministrations of the clergy and after a few latin prayers crossed himself and so made an end of his wicked days in this worldan example for all time how little education and accomplishments can do to keep man from sin a martyr to a priestridden conscience unenlightened by the word of god robert winter followed next he scarcely spoke asked no forgiveness but after a few silent prayers passed calmly into the silent land the next was john grant this grave melancholy man went smiling to his death when he was entreated to seek for pardon for his crimes his reply was in a triumphant tone i am satisfied that our project was so far from being sinful that i rely entirely upon my merits in bearing a part of that noble action as an abundant satisfaction and expiation for all sins committed by me during the rest of my life he died thus with a lie in his right hand and went to present the filthy rags of his own righteousness before his eyes in whose sight the heavens are not pure and whose command is thou shalt do no murder last came poor bates who seemed sorry for his offence and said that only his love for his dead master had drawn him to forget his duty to god his king and country and thus ended that days business in old palace yard over against the parliament housenamely where now stands the statue of godfrey de bouillonthe second scaffold was erected on the following day the four prisoners who were now to suffer were the priests excepted the most guilty of those left alive they were drawn from the tower on hurdles as was usual as they passed along the strand from an open window the beautiful elizabeth rookwood called to her husband ambrose be of good courage thou art to suffer for a great and noble cause raising himself from the hurdle as well as he could rookwood answered my dear pray for me i will i will she cried and do you offer yourself with a good heart to god and your creator i yield you to him with as full an assurance that you will be accepted of him as when he gave you to me and so the procession passed on the first to suffer of these was thomas winter he was extremely pale and seemed sorry for his offence after a sort but he spoke little merely protesting that he died a true catholic rookwood who came next made a long speech he said that he asked forgiveness of god whom he had offended in seeking to shed blood of the king and of the people he prayed for the king and royal family entreating that the king might become a catholic note and he besought the kings goodness to his elizabeth and her children he was spared the worst for he drew his last breath ere it began the next to follow was keyes he had said on the trial that his fortunes being desperate his fate was as good now as another time and for this cause rather than another in this hardened reckless spirit he flung himself from the ladder with such force as to break the halter last came the great devil of all guy fawkes who being weak with torture and sickness was scarce able to go up the ladder he made no long speech but after a sort seemed to be sorry and asked forgiveness and with his crosses and his idle ceremonies was castoff dying instantaneously so ended the awful scenes which were the reward of the gunpowder plot but not yet had justice overtaken all the perpetrators of this villainy three important traitors were yet at large and they were all jesuit priests greenway who had fled from holbeach with robert winter had not continued in his company for ten days he hid in barns and cottages in worcestershire but when the proclamation was made for his arrest thinking it safest to be lost in a crowd in the metropolis he came to london here he was one day seized by a man as they stood among others reading the proclamation for his arrest greenway with artful composure denied the identity but went quietly with his captor till they reached an unfrequented street when the priest who was a very powerful man suddenly set upon his companion and escaping from him after a few days concealment fled to the coast whence he safely crossed to the continent he afterwards wrote for his superiors a narrative of the plot wherein all the conspirators are impeccable heroes of the romantic novel type and the plotwhich during its existence he upheld and fervently encouragedis condemned as a rash desperate and wicked piece of business he succeeded so well in deceiving his superiors or else they were equally hypocritical with himself that he was appointed penitentiary to the pope and ended his life in the full favour of that potentate gerard also who had originally assisted the plotters in taking their oath of secrecy had now disappeared so excellent an opinion had the roman catholics of him that many refused to believe that holy good man could have had any share in the conspiracy the description of this worthy as given in the proclamation for his arrest is curious in its detail and the better worth quoting since it has apparently not been printed john gerrarde the jesuit is about thirty years old of a good stature something higher than sir thomas leighton this name is crossed out and replaced by the word ordinary and upright in his pace and countenance somewhat staring in his looke and eyes curled headed by nature and blackish and not apt to have much hair on his beard his nose somewhat wide and turning up blebberd lipped thicklipped turning outward especially the upper lip upward toward the nose curious in speech if he do continue his custom and in his speech he flewreth note and smiles much and a faltering lisping or doubling of his tongue in his speech note what a picture of a jesuit this is the type of man who practises an art which i never saw to such perfection as once in the principal of a jesuit collegethat of washing the hands with invisible soap in imperceptible water lastly what had become of garnet he had not escaped nor left england yet he seemed in some inscrutable manner to have vanished from the face of the earth as completely as a morning mist the next step was to secure white webbs commissioners were sent down to enfield chase with directions to search for that undiscoverable house to make thorough investigation of it and to take into custody every individual therein they found the placean old rambling house in the heart of the chase full of trapdoors passages unexpected steps up or down holes corners and cupboards at every turn but it had no inhabitants save servants and they could tell little their mistress was mrs perkins the widowed sister of mr mease a berkshire farmer it was quite true they were catholics all allowed and elizabeth shepherd admitted that mass had been performed in the house but what connection could there be between the gunpowder plot and worthy mr mease the faimer or innocent mrs perkins the widow many persons would have resigned the search but not so sir william wade sir william wade the keeper of the tower had an uncommonly keen scent for a heretic which term was in his eyes the equivalent of a jesuit he could see much further than any one else through a millstone and detected a jesuit where no less acute person suspected anything but a farmer or a horsedealer not only was a jesuit capable of every crime that man could commit but every criminal was pretty nearly certain to turn out a jesuit moreover sir william loved a joke only less than he bated a jesuit and apathy in any pursuit was not one of his failings who wrote that he thanked god on the knees of his soul for the discovery of the gunpowder plot mr mease was not to escape sir williams penetration he was anxious to see a little more of mr mease and of mrs perkins also for the moment however he was doomed to disappointment sturdy james johnson mrs perkins servant would not betray his employers even when put to the rack until he had suffered appallingly halfanhour had been sufficient to exhaust guy fawkes endurance but james johnson bore three hours even then he could tell little for his mistresss brother he knew no name but mease except that he had heard him addressed as farmer but he did know and had known for two years that the real name of his mistress was anne vaux he could also say that she had been visited by a mr and mrs skinner a mr and mrs thomas jennings a mr catesby and a little gentleman whom the latter called tom and whose name he said was winter as to himself johnson asserted that he was a romishe catholic and never was at church nor yet at mass in his life frightened little jane robinson aged fourteen admitted that mass had been said in the house but when asked what vestments the priest wore could only answer that he was apparelled like a gentleman sir william wade went down once more upon the knees of his soul when his ears were refreshed by these delightful names at harrowden the seat of lord vaux the family had already been questioned to no purpose mrs vaux the mother of the young lord and the sisterinlaw of anne was astonished that anybody should suspect her of a guilty knowledge of the plot having previously denied that she knew any such person as gerard she subsequently confessed that gerard and garnet had been frequently at her house and that she had a vague suspicion that something was going to happen harrowden must be further investigated and admissions were wrung from the servants at white webbs which satisfied the commission that the relations between anne vaux and garnet had been of an intimate character sir william wade was now on the track of a jesuit and might be trusted to pursue that enticing path with eager and untiring accuracy the watch set at harrowden was removed just too soon had it lasted two days longer gerard would have been starved out for he lay concealed in the priests hidingplace as soon as the watching party took their leave he emerged from his refuge and succeeded through multifarious difficulties in safely escaping over seas about this timefrom what source is uncertaina hint reached the government to the effect that gerard might possibly and hall would probably be found in one of the priests hidingplaces at hendlip hall in worcestershire the residence of mr thomas abington edward hall alias oldcorne note was mr abingtons private chaplain and though there is little evidence extant to connect him with the plot the government appear to have been extremely suspicious of him when therefore the suggestion reached them that they might as well inspect the curiosities of hendlip hall the authorities lost no time in sending down sir henry bromley of holt castle at the head of a searching party for that purpose until or thereabouts hendlip hall remained standing on the highest ground in the neighbourhood between droitwich and worcester and rather nearer to the latter a most curious cunninglyplanned perplexing house it wasa house of houses wherein to secrete a political refugee or a jesuit priestfull of surprises unexpected turnings sliding panels and inconceivable closets without apparent entrances there is scarcely an apartment wrote a spectator shortly before its destruction that has not secret ways of going in or going out some have back staircases concealed in the walls others have places of retreat in their chimneys some have trapdoors and all present a picture of gloom insecurity and suspicion on one side was a high tower from which the approach of any enemy could be easily observed the house had been built in by john abington cofferer to queen elizabeth but his son thomas the owner in had added the hidingplaces such concealed chambers were very common in houses belonging to roman catholic families and in the safest of all those at hendlip hall two priests were at that moment in close confinement the government had been so far truly informed hall too was one of them but gerard was not the other sir william wade would have danced in delight could he have known that his colleagues were on the track of the great provincial of the jesuit mission to this heathen country of england the chief of all the conspirators yet left at large about two months before this garnet had come to the conclusion that he was no longer safe at coughton which as the property of mr throckmorton and lately in the occupation of sir everard digby would be likely to obtain a thorough overhauling from mr hall he had received a pressing invitation to hendlip for himself and his confidential servant nicholas owen who went by the name of little john the latter was an old acquaintance at hendlip for it was his ingenuity that had devised the numerous hidingplaces which had been added to the hall by its present owner to hendlip accordingly garnet removed from coughtonaccompanied by anne vaux and the brooksbys about the th of december and for some weeks resided with the family without concealment but on monday the th of january as the day broke sir henry bromley and his troops marched up to and invested hendlip hall the hon mrs abington was a sister of lord monteagle and was quite as good an actress as her brother was an actor she possessed the power of assuming the most complete outward composure as if nothing whatever were the matter however adversely things might be going to her wishes she had also a very quiet very firm very unmanageable will mr abington was not at home but that signified little for the grey mare was unquestionably the superior creature of the pair if the information imparted to her so early on that morning had been that the cat had mewed or that a hen had dropped a feather the lady of hendlip could scarcely have received it with more repose of manner that is what we might look for said she if it please you holy fathers it might be as well that you should repair to one of your chambers for a whilebid edward come to me edward a whiteheaded confidential servant with an aspect of appalling respectability presented himself at once in response to his mistresss summons edward said mrs abington i would have you quickly take up these holy fathers to the hole in your chamber and set little john and chambers in the next safest there are enemies approaching edward bowed his dignified head and obeyed he led garnet and hall up the chief staircase and into the bedroom occupied by edward himself which stood behind that of his master garnet cast his eyes round the chamber truly good edward said he i scarce see means to hide so much as a mouse in this chamber other than in yonder closet which is as plain as the door or the window edward replied by an amused smile youve a deal of booklearning father garnet said he but under your leave theres a few things you dont know in this world he walked into the chimneycorner chimneys be it remembered were much wider in the seventeenth century than they have been since the invention of grates there was room in every chimneycorner not only for the fire but for one or two chairs and settles where people could sit when they wished to warm themselves and as there was no fire on edwards hearth moving about on it was as easy as in a closet are we to fly up the chimney on a pair of broomsticks laughed hall edward only smiled again and after a moments feeling with his hand among the bricks at the side of the chimney they heard a sound as of the pushing back of bolts slowly as if it moved with some difficulty a square door opened in the chimney so cleverly concealed that it required a skilful detective indeed to guess its existence the door was of wood curiously covered over with brick mortared and made fast to it and coloured black like the other parts of the chimney that very diligent inquiry might well have past by behind it was a very small square recess large enough to hold the two though not sufficiently high for them to stand upright a narrow tunnel in outward appearance like a chimney led up to the top of the house designed for the admission of light and air to the hidingplace but capable of conveying no great quantity of either having fetched a short ladder edward placed it in position so that the priests could climb up into the chamber it had been more to your comfort fathers could we have cast forth some of this furniture he said looking round it but it were scarce wise to defer the matter the house being already invested let be we will serve ourselves of it as it is and well the priests mounted into the tiny hidingplace see you holy fathers edward asked a vessel of tin standing below a little hole in the wall have a care that you move it not without you first stop the hole for it runneth through into my mistresss chamber and by a quill or reed therein laid can she minister warm drinks unto you as broths and caudle she can likewise speak to you through the hole and be heard but if you hear the noise of feet or strange voices in that chamber have a care to lie as squat quiet and close as ever you can so may you safely hover lie concealed for the cleverest soldier of them all shall be hard put to it to find you here if it please god would it please god did no memory come to either of those wellread priestly refugees of a familiar questionshall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee a tight fit this for two said hall ay it is there hath not been above one here aforetime but it is the safest hilling hidingplace in the house goodday holy fathers and god keep you safe while these scenes were enacting in one part of the house in another sir henry bromley was introducing himself to the lady of hendlip hall and with plumed hat in hand apologising for his intrusion and civilly requesting her permission to examine the house a kindly tenderhearted man was the commander of this searching party but at the same time a conscientious one and a determined protestant if anything could be more considerate and cordial than sir henrys appeal it was to all appearances the spirit wherein it was received mrs abington begged her visitor not to speak of intrusion his majesty the king had no subjects more loyal than every man and woman in that house it was really a source of pleasure to her that her abode should be scrutinised in the most critical manner and her perfect innocence and submission to law thus made manifest the lady at once delivered her keysshe did not say that a few of them were on a separate bunch and requested that no quarter might be given appearances were so charming and innocence apparently so clear that they might have deluded a more astute man than sir henry bromley sir henry however had come to do his duty and he did it in spite of appearances lord salisbury had furnished him with minute instructions which pointed decidedly to probable need of caution in this respect he was to search for a suspected vault at the east end of the diningroom for a similar erection beneath the cellars for ingenious closets squeezed in between the walls of upper rooms for possible holes in corners and chimneys wainscots which could be pierced by gimlets double lofts and concealed chambers in the rafters sir henry set to work madam said he to mrs abington were it not more to the conveniency of yourself and these gentlewomen your friends that you should take occasion to pay some visit forth of the house i fear the noise made by my men not to speak of the turning about of your chambers by taking up of boards and trying of wainscots shall greatly incommode you if you tarry sir henry wanted sadly to get the ladies away but mrs abington was quite as sagacious as himself and more determined she assured him that the noise was nothing and the little novelties of holes in her diningroom floor and broken wainscots in her drawingroom would be rather amusing than otherwise poor sir henry baffled by this clever woman laments to lord salisburyi did never hear so impudent liars as i find hereall recusants and all resolved to confess nothing what danger soever they incuri could by no means persuade the gentlewoman of the house to depart the house without i should have carried her which i held uncivil as being so nobly born as i have and do undergo the greater difficulties thereby the monday night brought home the master of the house he answered the queries of the gentlemen in possession with as much apparent frankness as his wife but assured sir henry that the persons for whom he was searching were absolute strangers to him he had never seen any of them save gerard and him only some five and twenty years before for suspecting him of harbouring priests not to speak of traitors there was not a shadow of reason sir henry went on searching though he was out of hope in the first place he discovered some parcels of books and writing which showed at that time that some scholars must have used them an ordinary country gentleman was not expected to have any books except bible and prayerbooks one or two on law needed in his capacity as a magistrate a book on etiquette and a few dogseared plays on the wednesday a discovery of more importance was made for in three or four places where boards were uplifted a quantity of popish trash was brought to light thus encouraged the searchers resolved to continue their work which they were on the point of giving up mr abington continued to protest his supreme innocence of all knowledge or connivance the books were none of his the popish stuff astonished him as much as it did the searchers this assumption of exquisite stainlessness lasted until one day a hidingplace was discovered which contained his family muniments and the titledeeds of his estate after that mr abington protested no more and it was needless for he would not have been believed had he done so sir henry at once despatched him to worcester to be taken care of by a magistrate and being much wearied on wednesday night returned to his own house to take rest leaving his brother sir edward in charge on the thursday morning when he returned to hendlip he was met by two wan gaunt men whose countenances showed privation and suffering they gave their names as william andrews and george chambers by some unexplained want of care or foresight these two unfortunate men had been suffered to secrete themselves without provisions and had nothing but one apple between them from monday to thursday sir henry was delighted for at first he thought he had secured greenway and hall a little further examination however showed him that his captives were only the priests servants yet he shrewdly surmised that the servants being there the masters in all probability were not far away for four days more the search was pursued in vain but on the th news came that not only was hall certainly concealed in the house but that the most important of all the implicated jesuits garnet would probably be found by a diligent continuance of the search it came from an unexpected quarterno other than red humphrey littleton justice had not been slow in overtaking the harbourers of robert winter and stephen littleton white and his brothers had got clear away but smart hollyhead perks and burford suffered the last penalty of the law margaret perks was pardoned though condemned to death humphrey littleton received the torture and when apparently at the point of death entreated permission to confess important facts which he promised to do if his life might be spared his appeal was granted and he then told the authorities that the most important criminal still at large would be found in the priests hidingplace at hendlip hall fortified by this encouraging news though the prisoners already taken denied all knowledge of any others being hidden in the house sir henry pushed on his search and at last on the th eight days after his arrival one of his men broke into the cunningly contrived hidingplace in the chimney of edwards room this brave discoverer was so terrified by his own success that he ran away lest the priests should shoot him but others coming rapidly to his assistance the priests offered to come out if they might do so with quietude so they helped us out says garnet very charitably garnets account of their experiences in the hoale as he terms it is not suggestive of an inviting place we were in the hoale seven days and seven nights and some hours and were well wearied the place was so encumbered with books and furniture that they could not find place for their legs even when seated and the cramped positions which they were compelled to assume caused their legs to swell greatly garnet seems to have suffered more of the two yet he adds that they were very merry and content and could have stayed three months though when they came out at last we appeared like two ghosts sir henry bromley at once recognised the provincial of the jesuit mission but which of his various aliases really belonged to him puzzled his captor not a little and garnet declined to enlighten him call me as you will said he i refer all to my meeting with my lord of salisbury and he will know me in truth i say not thus for any discourtesy but that i will not in the places we are be made an obloquy but when i come to london i will not be ashamed of my name sir henry now marshalled his prisoners for transport to worcester he described them to the authorities as humphrey phillips alias henry garnet john vincent alias hall thomas abington esquire william androwes alias nicholas owen either a priest or servant to garnet george chambers servant of hall edward jarrett servant of mrs dorathie abington william glandishe servant of mr abington note mr abington and the priests were taken to worcester in sir henrys coach the mind of that gentleman was somewhat exercised as to what he was to do with them when he got them there before leaving hendlip he had promised to place them in the house of some bailiff or citizen but as they were driving into worcester he said uneasily my masters i cannot do for you as i would i must needs send you to the gaol in gods name note responded garnet but i hope you will provide we have not irons for we are lame already and shall not be able to ride after to london sir henrys tender heart was touched at once well said he i will think of it he thought of it to such purpose that when they reached the inn he placed garnet in a private room with a guardhis reverence says to avoid the peoples gazing sir henry would probably have added that it was also in order to prevent the prisoners disappearance after despatching his business he ordered his coach and took his prisoners home with him to holt castle here on their own testimony they were exceeding well used and dined and supped with him and his every daynot without some apprehension on the part of their kindly gaoler that they might reward him by perverting his young daughters from the protestant faith when candlemas day came sir henry made a great dinner to end christmas and sent for wine to drink the kings health it was then customary for gentlemen always to dine with their hats on and to uncover when a royal toast was proposed the hats were doffed accordingly the wine came in and with it a wax candle lighteda blessed candle taken at hendlip among the popish trash and destined for use on the services of that very day having jesus painted on one side of it and maria on the other garnets heart leaped at the familiar sight and he begged leave to take the candle in his hand passing it to mr hall he said half joyfully half sadly i am glad yet that i have carried a holy candle on candlemas day restoring the holy wax to the unholy candlestick the priests drank the kings health in what mr garnet is kind enough to tell us was a reasonable glassa piece of information the more valuable since this adjective was not always applicable to his reverences glasses when they came to leave worcester the parting between garnet and the ladies was almost affectionate the priest was evidently possessed of that strong personal magnetism which some men and women have and which is oftener exercised for the purposes of satan than in the service of god madam he said to lady bromley i desire you all to think well of me till you see whether i can justify myself in this cause the journey to london took longer than would otherwise have been needed on account of the condition of the prisoners garnet whose sufferings had been the more severe was also the one in whom their results lasted longest and on the th of february sir henry wrote that he was but a weak and wearisome traveller he was however passing well used at the kings charge and that by express orders from my lord salisbury and had always the best horse in the company garnet adds i had sorde bickering with ministers by the way two very good scholars and courteous mr abbott and mr barlow met us at an inn but two other rude fellows met us on the way whose discourtesy i rewarded with plain words and so adieu the jesuit superior apparently rather enjoyed a little brisk brushing of wits with welleducated gentlemanly clerics but felt some disgust of abuse which passed for argument with others on the evening of the th of february they reached london where they were lodged in the gatehouse and garnet was very sick the first two nights with ill lodging it was not until the th that the first examination took place before the privy council at whitehall note to which the reporter adds otherwise a papist which god for his mercy ever forbid note to flewer or fleer is to smile in that grinning manner which shows all the teeth our forefathers considered it a mark of a sneering envious man note domestic state papers james the first volume eighteen article note this most untruthful gentleman asserted that his true name was oldcorne but garnet and anne vaux both call him hall in writing to each other note domestic state papers james the first volume article mrs dorathie abington was mr abingtons maiden sister who lived at hendlip hall and had a priest of her own a jesuit named butler or lyster he does not appear in this narrative and was very likely absent note this was not meant profanely but was simply equivalent to saying gods will be done chapter eleven according to that beginning carry him forth and bury him deaths peace rest on his memory mercy by his bier sits silent or says only these few words let him who is without sin mongst ye all cast the first stone dinah mulock a great crowd had assembled near whitehall and was lining charing cross and the tiltyard below on the morning of that th of february when sir henry bromley and his guard with the prisoners in their midst marched down the street to the palace among them were temperance murthwaite and rachel and near them was mrs abbott the crowd was deeply interested in the prisoners especially the two priests there is a provincial said a respectablelooking man who stood next to rachel ay and there goeth a young pope returned temperance grimly in allusion to hall they bear a good brag most of em said the man would we were rid of em all neck and crop said another pack em off to the american plantations suggested a third if i dwelt there i shouldnt give you thanks replied the first find some land where nought dwelleth save baboons and snakes and send em all there in a lump was the response what think you rachel demanded mrs abbott who was not often silent for so long at once why theyre men just like other folks was rachels contribution did you think theyd have horns and tails said temperance well nay not justly that answered rachel but i reckoned theyd ha looked a bit more like wastrels scoundrels yon lads none so badlooking as many a man you may meet i th street and th owd uns meterly middling too happen perhaps they arent any o the worst why maid said the man who had first spoken thats father garnet the head of all the jesuits in this country there isnt a craftier fox in all england than he well i shouldnt ha thought it saith rachel faces tell not alway truth said temperance hes good eyes though remarked mrs abbott though they be a bit heavy as though hed had a poor nights rest hes one o them long narrow faces said the man i never trust such and a long nose toojust like a fox ay ill be bound hes a fause cunning un commented rachel his mouths the worst thing about him said temperance its a little un observed rachel little or big its a false one answered temperance theres a prim fixed sanctimonious look about it that i wouldnt trust with anything i cared to see safe eh id none trust one o themnot to sell a pound o butter said rachel and by th same token mrs temperance i mun be home to skim th cream or charityll take it off like a gaumless stupid lass as hoo she is hoo can do some things well enough but hoo cannot skim cream go good maid if thou canst win out of this crowd but methinks thou shalt have thy work cut out to do so eh she will said mrs abbott and mind you rachel if you pull yourself forth youll find your gown in rags by the time youre at home i do hope neighbour you deal not with simpkinson in the strand that rogue sold me ten ells of green stamyn and charged me thirty shillings the ell and i vow it was scarce made up ere it began acoming to bits ill give it him when i can catch him and if i serve not our seth out for dinting in the blackjack last night im a dutch woman and no mistake black jacks are halfacrown apiece and so i told him but ill give him a bit more afore ive done with him trust me there

good may it do thee do you ever hear mice in your house mrs murthwaite im for ever and the day after plagued wi them and i do wish those lads ud make theirselves a bit useful and catch em instead o dinting in black jacks but dear heart youll as soon catch the mice as catch them at aught thats useful theyll my mistress said mrs abbotts next neighbour may i ask if your husband be a very silent man im sure o that said the man who followed him eh bless you they all talk and chatter at our house while i cant slip a word in was the ladys answer thats why she has so many to let go out o door remarked the last speaker i thought so observed the neighbour because i have marked that men and women do mostly wed with their contraries why what mean you inquired mrs abbott turning round to look him in the face that my way lieth down this bystreet said he working himself out of the crush into channon row and so i bid you all goodmorrow temperance murthwaite laughed to herself as she let herself in at the door of the white bear while mrs abbott hurried into the angel with a box on the ear to dorcas and hester who leaned upon the gate watching the crowd get you in to your business said she chatter chatter chatter one might as well live in a cage o magpies at once and ha done with it be off with the pair of ye garnets admissions in answer to the questions put to him were few and cautious he allowed that for twenty years he had been the superior of the english jesuits but denied any knowledge of the negotiations with spain carried on before the death of queen elizabeth as to fawkes he had never seen him but once in his life at the previous easter questioned about white webbs he flatly denied that he ever was there or anywhere near enfield chase since bartholomewtide he was not in london or the suburbs in november the attorneygeneral was very kind to the prisoner and promised to make the best construction that he could of his answers to the king but sir william wade was not the man to accept the word of a jesuit unless it should be the word guilty he accused garnet of wholesale violation of the decalogue in the plainest english and coolly told him that he could not believe him on his oath since the pope could absolve him for any extent of lying or equivocation it was plainly no easy matter to beguile sir william wade the next day february th garnet and hall were removed to the tower of london where the former found himself to his satisfaction lodged in a very fine chamber next to that of his brother priest here as he records in a letter to his friends he received the best treatment being allowed every meal a good draught of excellent claret wine as well as permitted to send for additional sack out of his own purse for himself and the keeper and he was suffered to vegetate as he thought proper with only one sorrow to vex his soulsir william wade sir william wade the lieutenant of the tower constituted himself the torment of poor garnets life he was perpetually passing through his room or at the furthest loitering in the gallery beyond sometimes he treated the prisoner as beneath contempt and would not utter a word to him at other times he sat down and regaled him with conversation of a free and easy character the scornful silence was bad enough but the conversation was considerably worse whatever else garnet was he was an english gentleman as his letters testify and sir william wade was not he was on the contrary one of those distressing people who pride themselves on being outspoken and calling a spade a spade which they do in the most vulgar and disagreeable manner he favoured the prisoner with his unvarnished opinion of the society to which he belonged and with unsavoury anecdotes of its members mingled with the bitterest abuse and the worthy knight was not the man to spare his adjectives when a sufficient seasoning of them would add zest to a dish of nouns at other times sir william dipped his tongue in honey and used the sweetest language imaginable it is manifest from the manner in which garnet mentions him that the smallest of his trials was not sir william wade mr garnets first act on being inducted into these comfortable quarters in his majestys tower was to bribe his keeper to wink at his peccadilloes a few cups of that supernumerary sack and an occasional piece of silver were worth expending on the safe carriage of his letters and other necessities which might in time arise he made affectionate inquiries as to the keepers domestic relations and discovered that he was blessed with a wife and a mother to the wife he despatched a little of that excellent sack and secured permission for his letters to be placed in the custody of the mother who dwelt just outside the walls but he was especially rejoiced when a few days after his incarceration the keeper sidled up to him with a finger on his lips and a wink in his eye and beckoned him to a particular part of the room where with great parade of care and silence he showed him a concealed door between his own cell and that of hall intimating by signs that secret communications might be held after this fashion and he the keeper would take care to be conveniently blind and deaf this was a comfort indeed for the imprisoned priests could now mutually forgive each others sins there was a little cranny in the top of the door which might be utilised for a mere occasional whisper but when a regular confession was to be made the door of communication could be opened for an inch or two the one drawback was that the vexatious door insisted on creaking as if it were a protestant door desirous of giving warning of popish practices but the jesuits were equal to the difficulty when the door was to be shut the unemployed one either fell to shovelling coals upon the fire or was suddenly seized with a severe bronchial cough so that the ominous creak should not be heard outside the comfort therefore remained and heartily glad were the imprisoned jesuits to have found this means of communication by the kind help of their tenderhearted keeper alas poor jesuits they little knew that they were caught in their own trap the treacherous keeper drank their sack and pocketed their angels but their letters rarely went further than my lord of salisburys desk and in a convenient closet unseen by them close to the creaking door mr forset a justice of the peace and mr locherson lord salisburys secretary were listening with all their ears to their confidential whispers and taking thereby bad coulds which they subsequently had to go home and nurse it was fox versus fox as soon as the door was closed under cover of cough or coals the hidden spies came quickly forth and in another chamber wrote down the conversation just passed for the benefit of his majestys judges benighted protestants were evidently messrs forset and locherson for the catholic practice of auricular confession was to them a strange and perplexing matter they innocently record that the confession was short with a prayer in latin before they did confess to each other and beating their hands on their breasts the confiteor was succeeded by the whispered confession in such low tones that scarcely anything reached the disappointed spies hall made his confession first and garnet followed the subsequent conversation was in louder tones though still whispered garnet informed his fellowconspirator that he was suspicious of the good faith of some one whose name the spies failed to hearto which frailty he allowed that he was very subject that he had received a note from thomas rookwood who told him of greenways escape and from gerard who therefore was evidently in safety though he had been put to great plunges that he believed mrs anne was in the town and would let them hear from their friends that the keeper had accepted an angel and sundry cups of sack for himself and his wife and taken them very kindlyrecommending similar treatment on halls part that garnet was very much afraid he should be driven to confess white webbs but if so he would say that he was there but knew nothing of the matter then hall made a remark lost by the spies to which garnet answered with a profane invocationtoo common in all ranks at that dayhow did they know that if he were pressed as to his treasonable practices before the queens death he would admit them seeing that he held a general pardon up to that time garnet bemoaned himself concerning sir william wade and expressed his annoyance at the persistent questioning of the court touching white webbs i think it not convenient said he to deny that we were at white webbs they do so much insist upon that place since i came out of essex i was there two times and so i may say i was there but they press me to be there in october last which i will by no means confess but i shall tell them i was not there since bartholomewtide he expressed his apprehension lest the servants at white webbs should be examined and tortured which might make them yield to some confession a fear which made him more resolute to admit nothing concerning the place he was also very much afraid of being asked about certain letters which lord monteagle had written but in truth i am well persuaded he concluded that i shall wind myself out of that matter and for any former business i care not just as garnet whispered these words footsteps were heard approaching the chamber hark you hark you mr hall cried garnet in haste whilst i shut the door make a hawking and a spitting mr hall obediently and energetically cleared his throat under cover of which garnet closed the door and presented himself the next moment to the edified eyes of sir william wade in the pious aspect of a priest telling his beads another conference through the door was held on the th of february wherein garnet was heard to lament to hall that he held not better concurrencenamely that he did not use diligence to tell exactly the arranged falsehoods on which the two had previously agreed the poor spies found themselves in difficulties on this occasion through a cock crowing under the window of the room and the cackling of a hen at the very same instant hall however was heard to undertake a better adherence to his lesson it is more than once noted by the spies that in these conferences the prisoners used not one word of godliness or religion or recommending themselves or their cause to god but all hath been how to contrive safe answers during garnets imprisonment in the tower if his gaolers may be trusted his consumption of that extra sack was not regulated by the rules of the blue ribbon army they averred that he was indulgent to himself in this particular and daily drank sack so liberally as if he meant to drown sorrow on the th garnet knew that one of his apprehensions was verified when he was confronted with poor james johnson who had borne the torture so bravely and who now admitted that the prisoner thus shown to him was the man whom he had known at white webbs as mr mease the supposed brother of his mistress mrs perkins he confessed that he had seen him many times after this it was useless to deny white webbs any longer hall was examined on the same day but being ignorant of the evidence given by johnson he audaciously affirmed that he had not visited white webbs and knew of no such place that evening garnet gave a shilling to his keeper with a request to have some oranges brought to him this fruit first introduced into england about was at that time very cheap and plentiful about eighteenpence the hundred being the usual price sir william wade lounging about the gallery as usual met the keeper as he came out of the cell with the money in his hand what would the old fox now demanded he an t please you sir mr garnet asked for oranges oh come he may have an orange or twohe cant do any harm with them without he choke himself and that should spare the king the cost of a rope to hang him said shrewd sir william but he was not quite shrewd enough for it never occurred to his nonjesuitical mind that one of those innocent oranges was destined to play the part of a traitorous inkstand by the reverend henry garnet a large sheet of paper folded letterwise came out of the prison in the keepers hand an hour later it was addressed to the reverend thomas rookwood and contained onlyin appearancethe following very unobjectionable words they were written in ink at the top of the first page let these spectacles be set in leather and with a leather case or let the fould be fitter for the noseyours for ever henry garnett who could think of detaining so innocent a missive or prevent the poor prisoner from obtaining a pair of comfortable spectacles but when the sheet of paper was held to the fire a very different letter started out in faint tracings of orangejuice this bearer knoweth that i write thus but thinks it must be read with water the papers sent with bisketbread i was forced to burn and did not read i am sorry they have without advise of friends adventured in so wicked an actioni must needs acknowledge my being with the two sisters and that at white webbs as is trew for they are so jealous of white webbs that i can no way else satisfy my names i all confesse but that last i have acknowledged that i went from sir everards to coughton where is mrs anne a few days later on the nd of march after a careful reconnoitre to avoid the ubiquitous sir william garnet applied his lips to the cranny in the door hark you is all well let us go to confession first if you will the spies ensconced in secret confess that they heard nothing of halls confession but that garnet several times interrupted it with well well garnet then made his own confession very much more softlier than he used to whisper in their interloqucions it was short but unless the spy was mistaken he confessed that he had drunk so extraordinarily that he was forced to go two nights to bed betimes then something was said concerning jesuits to which garnet added that cannot be i am chancellor it might proceed of the malice of the priests the conversation on this occasion was brought to a hasty close by garnets departure to read or write a letter mr hall being requested to make a noise with the shovel while he was shutting the door the second letter to mr thomas rookwood followed this interview it was equally short in its ostensible length and piously acknowledged the receipt of two bands two handkerchiefs one pair of socks and a bible beneath came the important postscript your last letter i could not read the pen did not cast incke mr catesby did me much wrong and hath confessed that he asked me the question in queen elizabeths time of the powder action and i said it was lawfull all which is most untrew he did it to draw in others i see no advantage they have against me for the powder action gunpowder plot book article garnet added that his friend might communicate with him through letters left in charge of the keepers mother but he begged him not to pay a personal visit unless he could first make sure that the redoubtable wade was absent an answer from the reverend thomas consisted to all appearance of a simple sheet of writingpaper enclosing a pair of spectacles in their case and bearing the few words written outsidei pray you prove whether the spectacles do fit your sight inside in orangejuice was the real communication from anne vaux wherein she promised to come to the garden and begged garnet to appoint a time when she might hope to see him gunpowder plot book article this seems to show that garnet was sometimes allowed the liberty of the tower garden on the th of march hall and garnet were reexamined when hall confessed the truth of the conversations through the door and garnet denied them the same day the latter wrote a long letter addressed to mrs anne vaux or any of his friends giving a full account of his sufferings while in the hoale at hendlip hall and of his present condition in the tower remarking that he was permitted to purchase sherry out of his own purse garnet adds this is the greatest charge i shall be at for fire will soon be unnecessary if i live so long whereof i am very uncertain and as careless they say i was at white webbs with the conspirators i said if i was ever there after the st of september i was guilty of the powder action the time of my going to coughton is a great presumption but all catholics know it was necessary i thank god i am and have been intrepidus wherein i marvail at myself having had such apprehension before but it is gods grace on the third examination which was on the th of march both garnet and hall confessed white webbs at lastthe former that he had hired the house for the meetings of the conspirators the latter that they had met there twice in the year garnet also allowed that perkins was the alias of the hon anne vaux to avoid whose indictment he afterwards said his confession had been made it is evident from several allusions in his letters that garnet was terribly afraid of torture and almost equally averse to confronting witnesses the first was merely human nature the second speaks ill for his consciousness of that innocence which he repeatedly asserts but not yet had the gunpowder plot secured its latest or its saddest victim soon after sir henry bromleys departure from hendlip mrs abington came to london bringing anne vaux with her and they took lodgings in fetter lane then a more aristocratic locality than now here they remained for a few weeks doing all that could be done to help garnet and poor anne continually haunting the neighbourhood of his prison and trying to catch glimpses of him if not to obtain stolen interviews at the garden gate but on the th of march the authorities interfered and anne vaux was a prisoner of the tower examined on the following day she deposed that she kept the house at white webbs at her own charge that she was visited there by catesby thomas winter tresham and others but said that she could not remember dates nor further names she refused to admit that garnet had been there but she allowed that she had been among the party of pilgrims to saint winifreds well in company with lady digby and others whom she declined to name lastly she persisted in saying that she had known nothing of the plot she was toldnot improbably by sir william wade and if so we may be sure not very tenderlythat garnet had been one of the chief criminals a few sorrowful lines remain showing the spirit in which she heard it they were written on the th of march i am most sore to here that father garnet shoulde be ane wease pryue to this most wicked actione as himselfe euer cauled it for that hee made to mee maney greate prostertations to the contrari diuers times sence anne vaux gunpowder plot book article after this garnet gave up the fiction of his total ignorance of the conspirators object in his fourth examination on the th of march he said that on the demise of queen elizabeth he had received a letter from the general of the jesuits stating that the new pope clement had confirmed the order of his predecessor that no such plot should be set on foot and that garnet had accordingly done what in him lay to turn catesby from the idea catesby however thought himself authorised by two briefs received by garnet about twelve months earlier commanding the roman catholics of england not to consent to any successor of elizabeth who should refuse to submit to rome these garnet had shown to catesby before destroying them it is evident from these admissions not only that garnet had been privy to the plot from the first but also that it was known at rome and controlled from the vaticanforbidden when success appeared unlikely and smiled on as soon as it seemed probable shortly after this a letter came from anne vauxa letter which sadly reveals the character of its writer and shows how different life might have been for this poor passionatehearted woman had she not been crushed under the iron heel of rome to live without you she writes to garnet it is not life but death now i see my los i am and euer will be yours and so i humbly beseche you to account me o that i might see you her second examination took place a few days later on the th of march she now acknowledged that tresham catesby and garnet used to meet at her house at wandsworth and that garnet was wont to say to them when they were engaged in discussiongood gentlemen be quiet god will do all for the best and we must get it by prayer at gods hands in whose hands are the hearts of princes the confession was carried to garnet poor frail loving heart she meant to save him and he knew it he wrote calmly underneath i do acknowledge these meetingsh garnett gunpowder plot book article even her very gaolers dealt pitifully with anne vaux this gentlewoman said lord salisbury to garnet hath harboured you these twelve years last past and seems to speak for you in her confessions i think she would sacrifice herself for you to do you good and you likewise for her garnet made no answer letters continued to pass between the cells a remarkable one was sent to anne on the nd of april written principally in orangejuice on the question which she had submitted to garnet as to her living abroad after her release concerning the disposal of yourself i give you leave to go over to them the vow of obedience ceaseth being made to the superior of this mission you may upon deliberation make it to some there if you like to stay here then i exempt you till a superior be appointed whom you may acquaint but tell him that you made your vow yourself and then told me and that i limited certain conditions as that you are not bound to sin note except you be commanded in virtute obedientiae we may accept no vows but men may make them as they list and we after give directions accordingly mr hall dreamed that the general provided two fair tabernacles or seats for us and this he dreamed twice gunpowder plot book article the sentence in italics is terrible no protestant ever penned a darker indictment against popery anne vaux received this letter for she answered it at once she speaks of her vow of poverty and adds mr haule his dreame had been a great cumfert if at the fute of the throne there had bin a place for me god and you know my unworthenes yours and not my own anne vaux gunpowder plot book article on the following day garnet wrote againeight closely covered pages in his own hand throughout i append a few extracts from this pathetic letter my very loving and most dear sisteri will say what i think it best for you to do when it please god to set you at liberty if you can stay in england and enjoy the use of the sacraments as heretofore it would be best and then i wish that you and your sister live as before in a house of common repair of the society or where the superior of the mission shall ordinarily remain or if this cannot be then make choice of some one of the society as you shall like which i am sure will be granted you if you like to go over stay at saint omer and send for friar baldwin with whom consult where to live but i think saint omer less healthy than brussels in respect of your weakness i think it better for you to live abroad and not in a monastery your vow of obedience being made to the superior of the mission here when you are over ceaseth and then may you consult how to make it again none of the society can accept a vow of obedience of any but any one may vow as he will and then one of the society may direct accordingly garnet proceeds to say that the vow of poverty was to cease in like manner and might be similarly renewed all that which is for annuities he had always meant to be hers in the hope that she would afterwards leave it to the jesuit mission but she is at liberty if she wish it to alienate a third of this or if she should desire at any time to retire into religionie to become a nunand require a portion she is to help herself freely he thanks god most humbly that in all his speeches and practices he has had a desire to do nothing against the glory of god he was so much annoyed by having been misunderstood by the two spies that he thought it would make our actions much more excusable to tell the truth than to stand to the torture or trial by witnesses as to his acquaintance with the plot he sought to hinder it more than men can imagine as the pope can tell how could he have dissuaded the conspirators if he had absolutely known nothing but he thought it not allowable to tell what he knew none of them ever told him anything though they used his name freelyhe implies more freely than truth justified them in doing yet have i hurt nobody he ordered the removal of certain books which he does not further describe if they be found you can challenge them as your own as in truth they are he will die not as a victorious martyr but as a penitent thief but let god work his will the most touching words are the last up to this point the spiritual director has been addressing his subject now the priest disappears and the mans heart breaks out howsoever i shall die a thief yet you may assure yourself your innocence is such that but if you die by reason of your imprisonment you shall die a martyr from this point the letter is in latin the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god farewell my ever beloved in christ and pray for me domestic state papers james the first volume article yet a few words were to be written before the end the execution of hall which took place at worcester on the th of april unnerved garnet as nothing else had done he wrote a fortnight later to her who was his last and had always been his truest frienda few hurried incoherent words which betray the troubled state of his mind it pleaseth god daily to multiply my crosses i beseech him give me patience and perseverance to the end i was after a weeks hiding taken in a friends house where our confessions and secret conferences were heard and my letters taken by some indiscretion abroadthen the taking of yourselfafter my arraignmentthen the taking of mr greenwellthen the slander of us both abroadthen the ransacking anew of erith and the other housethen the execution of mr halland now last of all the apprehension of richard and robert with a cipher i know not of whose laid to my charge and that which was a singular oversight a letter in cipher together with the cipherswhich letter may bring many into question the patience of job ye have heard and have seen the end of the lordthat the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy blessed be the name of the lord these quotations are in latinyours eternally as i hope hg st aprili thought verily my chamber in thames street had been given over and therefore i used it to save erith but i might have done otherwise at the end of the letter is a symbolic sketch the mystic letters ihs within a circle are surmounted by a cross and beneath them is a heart pierced by three nails underneath is written in latingod is the strength of my heart and god is my portion for ever so end the last words which passed between the unhappy pair in his sixth examination four days later garnet admitted that as often as he and greenway had met he had asked concerning the plot being careful of the matter and that in general he had inquired who was to be chosen protector after the explosion greenway having answered that this was to be deferred until the blow was passed and then the protector to be chosen out of the noblemen that should be saved this completely settles the question as to garnets guilty knowledge of the plot before he received digbys letter greenway is here shown to be garnets informant whereas the letter was addressed to garnet himself and the occasion on which he received it was the last time that he ever saw greenway a few days before his execution the prisoner received a visit from three deans who essayed to converse with him upon various points of doctrine garnet however declined any discussion on the ground that it was unlawful for him he was asked whether he thought that he should die a martyr i a martyr exclaimed garnet with a deep sigh oh what a martyr should i be god forbid if indeed i were really about to suffer death for the sake of the catholic religion and if i had never known of this project except by the means of sacramental confession i might perhaps be accounted worthy of the honour of martyrdom and might deservedly be glorified in the opinion of the church as it is i acknowledge myself to have sinned in this respects and deny not the justice of the sentence passed upon me then after a moments pause he added with apparent earnestness would to god that i could recall that which has been done would to god that anything had happened rather than that this stain of treason should hang upon my name i know that my offence is most grievous though i have confidence in christ to pardon me on my hearty penitence but i would give the whole world if i possessed it to be able to die without the weight of this sin upon my soul the st of may had been originally fixed for the execution but it was delayed until the rd to the last moment when he received notice of it which was on the th of april garnet fully expected a reprieve he could hardly be persuaded to believe in approaching death yet even then on the very night before his executionif we may believe the testimony of his keepershe drank so copiously that the gaoler thought it necessary to inform the lieutenant who came to see for himself and was invited in thick and incoherent accents to join garnet in his potations sir william wade was not the man to allow such a fact to rest in silence and garnet is neither the first nor the last whose words have been better than his actions on the rd of may he was drawn on a hurdle to the west end of saint pauls churchyard where the first conspirators had suffered and where the scaffold was again set up his conduct on the scaffold was certainly not that of a martyr nor that of a penitent thief the impenitent thief appeared rather to be his model advised by the attendant deans of saint pauls and winchester to prepare and settle himself for another world and to commence his reconciliation with god by a sincere and saving repentance garnet answered that he had already done so he showed himself very unwilling to address the people but being strongly urged by the recorder he uttered a few sentences the purport of which was that he considered all treason detestable that he prayed the kings pardon for not revealing that of which he had a general knowledge from catesby but not otherwise that he never knew anything of the design of blowing up the parliament house the dean of winchester reminded him that he had confessed that greenway told him all the circumstances in essex that was in secret confession said garnet which i could by no means reveal the dean having reminded him that he had already allowed the contrary the recorder was about to read his written confessions to the peoplea course commanded by the king if garnet should deny his guilt upon the scaffold but garnet stopped this conviction from his own mouth by telling the recorder that he might spare himself that trouble he would stand to the confessions he had signed and acknowledge himself justly condemned for not having declared his general knowledge of the plot he then spoke of anne vaux and denounced as slander all the injurious reports concerning his relations with her then he asked what time would be permitted him for prayer he was told that he should choose his own time and should not be interrupted kneeling down at the foot of the ladder garnet proceeded to his devotions in such a manner as to show that they were to him the purest formalities as the words fell from his lips he was gazing at the crowd listening to the attendants sometimes even replying to remarks they made when he rose from his knees he was urged once more to confess his guilt in plain terms he answered that he had no more to confess his guilt had been exaggerated as he undressed for execution he said in a low voice to those nearest to him there is no salvation for you unless you hold the catholic faith their reply was that they were under the impression they did hold it but the only catholic faith responded garnet is that professed by the church of rome having ascended the ladder he addressed the people he expressed in these closing words his grief that he had offended the king and that he had not used more diligence in preventing the execution of the plot he was sorry that he had dissembled with the lords of the council and that he did not declare the truth until it was proved against him but he said i did not think they had such sure proofs against me he besought all men not to allow the catholics to fare worse for his sake and bade the latter keep out of sedition then he crossed himself and addedjesus maria mary mother of grace mother of mercy save me from mine enemies and receive me in the hour of death in thine hands i commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth crossing himself once more he addedalways in latinby this sign of the cross may all evil things be dispersed plant thy cross lord in mine heart but his last words were jesus maria mary mother of grace then the ladder was drawn away and henry garnet the conspirator and liar stood before that lord god of truth who will by no means clear the guilty by express command of the king the afterhorrors of a traitors death were omitted three months after that sad close of life the tower gates opened againthis time to release a prisoner the hon anne vaux was bidden to go whither she would whither she wouldwhat a mockery to her to whom all the earth and the heavens had been made one vaulted gravewho had no home left anywhere in the world for her home had been in the heart of that dead man to what part of that great wilderness of earth she carried her bitter grief and her name of scorn no record has been left to tell us except one thirty years later in a jesuit school for catholic youths of the nobility and gentry was dispersed by authority it was at stanley a small hamlet about six miles to the northeast of derby a short distance from the nottingham road the house was known as stanley grange and it was the residence of the hon anne vaux so she passes out of our sight old and full of days true to the end to the faith for which she had so sorely suffered and to the memory of the friend whom she had loved too well o solitary love that was so strong let us leave her to the mercy of him who died for men and who only can presume to sit in judgment on that faithful passionate broken heart note this word is plainly sin though mr lemon in his copy tried to read it himan interpretation which he was obliged to abandon chapter twelve the fruit of his own way say not this brackish well i will not taste ere long thou mayst give thanks that even this is left for thee in such a burning waste reverend horatius bonar tell mr louvaine that i desire speech of him the page who received this order looked up in apprehension so exceedingly stern were lady oxfords tone and so frowning her aspect that he trembled for himself apart from aubrey escaping from that awful presence at the earliest moment possible he carried the message to aubrey who when he received it was lounging on a daybed or sofa with his arms crossed behind his head and youd best go soon sir said the page for her ladyship looks as though she could swallow me in two bites then i rather count id best not said aubrey looking very much indisposed to stir what on earth would she have of me theres no end to the whims and conceits of women he unwreathed his arms and stood up yawned and very slowly went upstairs to the gallery where he had learned that the countess was awaiting him aubrey louvaine was at that moment a most unhappy young man the first sensation of amazement and horror at the discovery of the treachery and wickedness of his chosen friends was past but the apprehensions for his own safety were not and as the time went on the sense of loss weariness and disgust of life rather grew than lessened worst of all and beyond all were two better feelingsthe honest affection which aubrey had scarcely realised before that he entertained for thomas winter and the shock and pain of his miserable fate and even beyond this a sense of humiliation very wholesome yet very distressing at the folly of his course and the wreck which he had made of his life how complete a wreck it was he had not discovered even now but that he had been very foolish he knew in his inmost heart and when a man is just making that valuable discovery is not the best time for other men to tell him of it that fate was preparing for him not a sedative but a stimulant he had little doubt as he went slowly on his way to the gallery but of the astringent nature of that mixture he had equally small idea until he turned the last corner and came in sight of the countesss face there was an aspect of the avenging angel about lady oxford as she stood up tall and stately in that corner of the gallery and held out to aubrey what that indiscreet young gentleman recognised as a lost solitaire that was wont to fasten the lace ruffles on his wrist is this yours mr louvaine her voice said guilty or not guilty so plainly that he was almost ready to respond of what aubrey gave the garnet solitaire a more prolonged examination than it needed he felt no doubt of its identity yes madam i think it is he answered slowly at the least i have lost one that resembles it i think it is too said the countess no less sternly do you know where this was found mr louvaine aubrey began to feel thoroughly alarmed no madam he faltered in the chamber of thomas winter the traitor and papist at the sign of the duck in the strand perhaps you can tell me how it came thither aubrey was silent from sheer terror a gulf seemed to yawn before his feet and the countess appeared to him in the light of the minister of wrath waiting to push him into it with the rapidity of lightning his whole life seemed to pass in sudden review before himhis happy childhood and guarded youth at selwick hall the changed circumstances of his london experiences his foolish ways and extravagant expenditure his friendship with winter the quiet home at the white bear into which his fall would bring such disgrace and sorrow the possible prison and scaffold as the close of all was it to end thus he had meant so little ill had done so little wrong yet how was he to convince any one that he had not meant the one or even that he had not done the other in that moment one circumstance of his early life stood out bright and vivid as if touched with a sunbeaman act of childish folly done fifteen years before for which his grandfather had made him learn the text thou god seest me it came flashing back upon him now had god seen him all this while then he knew all his foolishnessay and his innocence as well could hewould hehelp him in this emergency aubrey louvaine had never left off the outward habit of saying prayers but it was years since he had really prayed before that unheard cry went up in the gallery of oxford houselord save me for my grandmothers sake he felt as if he dared not ask it for his own all these thoughts followed each other in so short a time that lady oxford was conscious of little more than a momentary hesitation before aubrey said i suppose i can madam he had made up his mind to speak the plain full truth even that slight touch of the hem of christs garment had given him strength then do so have you visited this man i have madam how many times several times madam i could not say with certainty how many how long knew you this thomas winter almost as long as i have dwelt in your ladyships housenot fully that time who made you acquaint with him mr percy what the archtraitor percy was then supposed to be what catesby really wasthe head and front of the offending he madam i will not deceive your ladyship and pray who made you acquaint with him demanded the countess grimly in her heart as she looked into the eyes honestly raised to hers she was saying the lad is innocent of all ill meaninga foolish daw that these kites have plucked but she showed no sign of the relenting she really felt madam that was mr thomas rookwood he that dwells beside the lady lettice his son madam were you acquaint with any of their wicked designs not one of them madam nor i never imagined no such a thing of any of those gentlemen who of them all have you seen madam i have seen divers of whom i knew no more than to see them whose namesbut no morei can specify if your ladyship desire it but those that i did really know and at all consort with were three only beside mr tom rookwoodto wit mr percy mr catesby and mr thomas winter and i saw but little save of the last the boys telling truth said lady oxford to herself he has been exceedingly foolish but no worse then aloud she askedsaw you ever any priests there not to know them for such madam tampered they with you in any wise as to religion never madam and you are yet at heart a true protestant and loyal to king james as much so as i ever was madam but as aubrey spoke the question arose in his consciencewhat had he ever cared about either not half as much as he had cared for tom winternay not so much as he had cared for tom winters tobacco mr louvaine said the countess suddenly have you discovered that you are a very foolish young man aubrey flushed red and remained silent it seems to me she continued that you speak truth and that you have been no worser than foolish yet so being you must surely guess that for your own sake no less than for the earls you must leave this house and that quickly he had not guessed it and it came upon him like a bombshell leave oxford house what was to become of him and if you will take my advice you will not essay to win into any other service tarry as still as you can some whither till matters be blown over and men begin to forget the inwards of this affair not in town have you no friend in the country that would take you in for a while tis for your own good and for my lady lettice sake that i give you this counsel lie hidden in the country aubreys tones were perfectly aghast such an expectation had never visited his least coherent dreams mr louvaine said lady oxford in a kinder voice i can see that you have never reckoned till this moment whither your course should lead you nor what lay at the end of the road you traversed i am sorry for you rather than angered for i believe you thought no ill you simply failed to think at all as so many have done before you yet is it the truest kindness not to cover your path by a deluding mist but to point out to you plainly the end of the way you are going trust me if this witness in mine hand were traced to you by them in power they should not take your testimony for truth so easily as i may i know you and the stock whence you come to them you were but one of a thousand without favour or distinction maybe you think me hard yet i ensure you you have no better friend nor one that shall give you truer counsel than this which i have given go you into the country the further from london the better and lie as quiet as you may till the whole matter be blown over and maybe some time hence it shall be possible to sue you a pardon from his majesty to cover all some time broke from aubreys lips ay and be thankful it is no worse he that leaps into a volcano counting it but a puddle shall not find it a puddle but a volcano you have played with firebrands mr louvaine and must not marvel nor grumble to feel the scorching of your fingers aubreys silence was the issue of sheer despair you must leave this house today said the countess firmly and not as though you went on a journey go forth this afternoon as for a walk of pleasure and carrying nothing save what you can put in your pockets when you have set a few miles betwixt yourself and the town you may then hire an horse and ride quickly i would counsel you not to journey too directif you go north or south tack about somewhat to east and west one may ride with far more safety than many i am not as you know over rich yet i will for my lady lettice sake lend you a sufficiency to carry you an hundred milesand if it fall out that you are not able to return the loan trouble yourself not thereabout i am doing my best for you mr louvaine not my worst i thank your ladyship faltered the unhappy youth butmust i not so much as visit my grandmother it was no very long time since the white bear had been to aubrey a troublesome nuisance now it presented itself to his eyes in the enticing form of a haven of peace he was loved there and he began to perceive that love even when it crossed his wishes was better worth having than the due reward of his deeds too great a risk to run said the countess gravely if any inquiration be made for you and you not found here the officers of justice should go straight thither no i will visit my lady lettice myself and soften the thing as best i may to her and to mrs louvaine the only thing she paused a moment in thought what other friends have you in london truly none madam save my cousin david not a relative is there no clergyman that knows you who is of good account and a staunch protestant there is truly mr marshall a friend of my grandmother and an ejected puritan where dwelleth he in shoe lane madam is he a wise and discreet man i think madam my grandmother holds him for such it is possible said lady oxford meditatively that you might be safe in his house for a day or two and your friends from the white bear could go as if to see him and his wifehath he a wife he buried his wife this last summer madam he hath a daughter that keeps his house of about mine own years if you think it worth to run the risk you might ask this good gentleman to give you a days shelter so as to speak with your friends ere you depart it were a risk yet not perchance too great you must judge for yourself if you choose this way i will take it on myself to let your friends know how it is with you it was a bitter pill to swallow mr marshall was about the last man in his world to whom aubrey felt any inclination to lay himself under an obligation both as a clergyman a puritan and an ejected minister this undiscerning youth had looked down exceedingly upon his superior the popular estimate of the clergy was just then at the lowest ebb and it required some moral courage for any man to take holy orders who was neither very high up in rank nor very low down this was the result partly of the evil lives and partly of the gross ignorance of the prereformation priests the lives were now greatly amended but too much of the ignorance remained and the time had not been sufficient to remove the stigma a clergyman was expected to apprentice his children to a trade or at best to place them in domestic service and he would have been thought forward and impertinent if when dining with laymen in a good position he had not spontaneously taken his departure before dessert made its appearance to be indebted therefore for an essential service to one of this lowly class aubrey was sufficiently foolish to account a small degradation happily for him he had just enough sense left and had been sufficiently humiliated to perceive that he could not escape the necessity of devouring this unpalatable piece of humble pie and that the only choice left him was a choice of bitters the false manliness which he had been diligently cultivating had vanished into thin air and something of the childs spirit so long despised was coming back to himthe longing for the sound of a familiar voice and the touch of a tender hand even aunt temperance would have received just then a welcome which might have astonished her but it showed the character of the women of his family that in this emergency aubreys thoughts scarcely touched his mother and dwelt longingly on his grandmother and his aunt edith the wise countess waited quietly till aubreys meditations had taken time to settle themselves into resolution madam i thank your ladyship he said at last as he looked up with an expression which had not dwelt for many a month in his eyes i think i perceive now how matters stand suffer me to say that i never knew until now how foolish i have been under your ladyships leave i will take your kindly counsel and seek aid of mr marshall i would like to see them again his voice faltered as the last words were spoken so will you do well said the countess more kindly than before all is not yet lost mr louvaine you have been foolish but there is time before you wherein you may be wise aubrey bowed took his leave and went to his own room where he filled his pockets with a few immediate necessaries and what little money he had it was hard to bear this going forth into the wilderness not at gods call but as the consequence of his own follyegypt left behind and no canaan in prospect he must take leave of none save lady oxfordmust appear to none to be what he wasa homeless fugitive with his life in his hand as he came downstairs he was met in the hall by the same page who had previously summoned him my lady would speak a word with you in her cabinet ere you walk forth aubrey found lady oxford at her desk busied with household accounts and a little pile of gold beside her when she had reminded him that she was not rich she had spoken very truly that deceased husband of hers as wanting in reason in his age as in his youth having reduced the great vere estates to almost nothing his second wife the countess elizabeth and her young son earl henry had to sustain the dignity of the house upon a very insufficient number of gold pieces twenty months had elapsed since the death of earl edward and the excellent management and strict economy of the widowed countess had done something to retrieve the ruined fortunes of the family but much still remained to do lady oxford glanced up at aubrey as he entered mr louvaine i owe you your quarters wages she said at least so little time remains that it need not tarry and tis to my conveniency to reckon with you this afternoon this was said in a voice that the page could hear then as aubrey came up to her with a significant look she laid another ten pounds in his hand with a few words for his private ear let me hear of you in time to come as a good man god go with you farewell ten minutes later aubrey closed the door of oxford house for the last time and went out truly not knowing whither he went his primary destination of course was shoe lane but after thatwhither through back streets he made his way to aldersgate and passed through it out of the city over snow hill and holborn bridge and down shoe lane to the small house where mr marshall had his lodgingto use the phrase of the timein other words where he and agnes made their home in three rooms the kitchen being open to all the lodgers to cook for themselves two of the rooms were moderately large these formed the sittingroom and the clergymans bedroom and study the bedroom end being parted from the study end by a curtain between the two the remaining room a mere closet was his daughters bedchamber pleasantest of the three was the sittingroom the front half of which was the general and public portion while the back was reserved as agness boudoir where her little worktable and stool were set by a small window looking out over the little garden towards fetter lane bounded on the right hand by the wall of saint andrews church the door was opened by a rather slipshod girl the landladys daughter pray you is mr marshall at home hes not sir hes gone for a country walk what time look you for him well about dark i dare say mrs agnes shes in thank you i will come again about dusk aubrey walked up the lane turned aimlessly to the left and sauntered on towards bloomsbury it was no matter where he wentno matter to any one himself least of all passing saint giless church he turned to the right up a broad country road lined by flowery banks wherein the first primroses of spring were just beginning to appear there are primroses there yetin flowergirls baskets they bloom now no otherwise in tottenham court road when he had gone some little distance aubrey grew tired it was a warm day for the season he sat down to rest on the flowery bank and lost himself in unhappy thought a mile further on mr marshall was coming home down the same road in a more despondent mood than was usual with him things were going badly for the puritans abroad and for the marshalls at home an ejected minister was at all times an unfashionable person and usually a very poor man his income was small was growing smaller and was not at all likely to take a turn and increase his wife was gone and he felt her loss rather more than less as time passed on and agnes had her private trouble for her affianced husband a young tradesman to whom she had been engaged for two years had jilted her when he heard of her fathers ejectment altogether the prospect before the marshalls was not pleasant rent was due and clothes were needed and money was exceedingly scanty in the outside world too the sky was dull and gloomy the puritans were in no greater favour than they had been though the papists were at the lowest ebb that there was any inconsistency in their conduct did not apparently occur to the authorities nor that the true way to repress popery was by cultivating puritanism believing the true principles of the church of england to be the golden mean between the two they acted under the pleasing illusion that when both halves were cut off the middle would be left intact and all the better for the operation as mr marshall walked on in the tottenham road he saw a figure seated on the grassy bank at some distance before him when he came nearer he perceived that it was a young man who sat with his head cast down in an attitude of meditation and a light cane in his hand with which now and then he switched off the head of an unoffending dandelion drawing nearer still the minister began to suspect that the youths face was not unfamiliar and when he came close instead of passing the sitter on the bank he stepped down and took a seat beside him the youth had paid no apparent attention to his companion until that moment his face was turned away northward and only when mr marshall sat down close to him did he seem to perceive that he was not alone how goes the world with you this afternoon mr louvaine mr marshall i ask your pardon i had not seen you i thought not you have taken a long walk aubrey made no reply now how am i to get at this shutup heart said mr marshall to himself to say the wrong thing just now may do considerable harm yet what is the right one aloud he said onlyi hope my lady lettice is well i know not whether you or i saw her last i have not seen her for months said aubrey curtly then i am happier than you for i saw her three weeks since i thought her looking somewhat frail and feeble even more so than her wont yet very ripe for heaven when as it shall please god to take her there was no answer again aubreys cane applied itself diligently to making a plantain leaf lie to the right of its neighbour instead of the left mr louvaine did you ever hear that my mother and your grandfather were friends of old time for the first time aubrey turned his head fully and looked at his companion the face which mr marshall saw was not as he had imagined it might be sullen and reluctant to converse it was only very very weary and sad with heavy eyes as though they had slept little or were holding back unshed tears no never was all he said my mother said mr marshall was an oxfordshire woman of minster lovel by her birth but she wedded a bookseller in oxford town where she was in service to a lady i think you were not present when i told this to my lady lettice but do you remember your old friend mrs elizabeth wolvercot that she told me you were wont to call cousin bess remember cousin bess of course i do said aubrey a tone of interest coming into his voice what of her my mother was her sister ellen why mr marshall are you my cousin if it please you to acknowledge me cousin aubrey that i will indeed said aubrey clasping the hand of the ejected minister then with a sudden and complete change of tonebut maybe if you knew all i know you were not over ready to acknowledge me you are in trouble my friend answered mr marshall sympathisingly can i help you thereout at least i can feel for you in it if i may do no more there was another minute of dead silence the next question came suddenly and bluntly mr marshall did you ever in your life feel that you had been a grand fool yes was the short quiet answer i am glad to hear it though i should not have thought so i thought you had always been a precisely proper person and i did not suppose you could feel for me a whit but i must tell my trouble to somebody or i shall grow desperate look you i have lost my place and i can get none other and i have not twenty pounds in the world and i owe an hundred pounds and i cant go home thank god was the strange answer well to be suremr marshall what on earth are you thanking god for that your husks have lost their flavour my son so long as the prodigal finds the husks sweet there is little hope of him but let him once discover that they are dry husks and not sweet fruits and that his companions are swine and not princesthen he is coming to himself and there is hope of making a man of him again i say therefore thank god i shall never make anything better than a fool a man commonly ceases to be a fool when he begins to reckon himself one you know not the worst yet butmr marshall if i tell it you you will not betray me for my poor old grandmothers sake i never gave her much cause to love me but i know she doth and it would grieve her if i came to public hurt and shame it would grieve me my cousin more than you know fear not but speak freely welli know not if my grandmother told you that i was intimate with some of these poor gentlemen that have paid the penalty of their treason of late i know that you knew percy and winterand i dare say rookwood i knew them all and catesby too and though i was not privy to the plotnot quite so bad as thatyet i would have followed mr tom winter almost anywhereay even into worse than i did surely aubrey louvaine you never dreamed of perversion mr marshall i was ready to do anything tom winter bade me but he never meddled with my religion andcome i may as well make a clean breast as i have beguni loved dorothy rookwood and if she had held up a finger i should have gone after you think the rookwoods protestants dont you they are not mr marshall sat in dismayed silence for a moment i doubted them somewhat he said but i never knew so much as you have told me then mrs dorothy oh she would have none of me she told me i was a beggar and a fool both and she spake but the bitter truth yet it was bitter when she said it my poor boy said mr marshall compassionately i thought hans but a fool when he went and bound himself to yon mercerhe the son of a dutch baron but i see nowi was the fool not he had i spent my days in selling silk stockings instead of wearing them and taken my wages home to my mother like a good little boy it had been better for me i see nownow that the doors are all shut against me and i dare not go home yet tell me aubrey for i scarce understand itwhy dare you not go home as aubrey laid the matter before him from the point of view presented by lady oxford mr marshalls face grew graver every moment he began to see that the circumstances were much more serious than he had apprehended there was silence for a few minutes when aubrey finished his account then the clergyman said tis a tangle and a tight one my boy yet by gods blessing we may see our way out let us take one point at a time these debts of yourswill you tell me are they debts of honour falsely socalled only twenty pounds the rest is due partly to patrick the tailor and others for goods and partly to tom rookwood for money i borrowed of him how much to tom rookwood twenty pounds i will see what i can do with him said mr marshall thoughtfully if these rookwoods are in no wise dragged into the plot so that they have no land escheated nor fines to pay then i think he can afford to wait for his moneybetter very like than the tradesfolk but aubrey you must get another place bear with me if i ask youcould you bring your pride down to serve in a shop the young shapely head went up suddenly as if in proud protest against this most unacceptable proposal then it dropped again and the cane toyed with the plantain i thought my pride was down he said in a low voice but i see it might be lowered yet further mr marshall i will try to humble myself even to that if it be needful aubrey did not suspect that mr marshall had never come so near respecting him as at that moment well he said quietly i will do what i can to help you i will see tom rookwood and i know a bookseller in oxford town to whom i could speak for you if you wish it the question for you at this moment is not what is easy and pleasantbut what is right facilis descensus averniyou knowsed revocare gradum it is always hard work turning back there is a bitter cup to be drunk and if you would win back your lost selfrespectif you would bring help and comfort to your grandmother in her old ageif you would light up the lamp of joy where hitherto you have wrought darknessnay if you would win a smile from the blessed lips which said father forgive them for youthen aubrey louvaine be a man and drink off that bitter draught you will find it sweeter afterwards than all the dainties you have been searching after for so long aubrey sat still and silent for some time and his companion let him alone to consider his ways mr marshall was a wise man and never gave more strokes to a nail than were needful to drive it in at last the question came in low unsteady tones mr marshall did god send you up this road this afternoon i have no doubt he did my friend if anything i say or do can help you to the right way you see i knew not of your being here and he did when you came up said the low voice i thought all was over and my mind was very near made up to enlist as a common soldier and leave no trace behind i see now it should have been an ill deed to do an ill deed in truth for your poor friends if the only news they had ever heard of you were your name in a list of the dead yes i wished to be killed as soon as might beget to the end as fast as possible would that have been the end aubrey the reply was barely audible no i suppose not take up your burden instead my son and bear it by gods grace he does not refuse that even when the burden is heaped and bound by our own hands unlike men his compassion faileth never he has maybe emptied thine heart aubrey that he may fill it with himself aubrey made no reply but mr marshall did not think that a bad sign well come now said he rising from the bank and in a more cheerful tone let us go to shoe lane and see if agnes hath any supper for us the prodigal son was not more welcome to his old father than you shall be to my poor lodging for so long a time as may stand with your safety and conveniency my lady oxford you say was to give my lady lettice to know how things went with you but methinks it shall do none ill if i likewise visit her this evening two heads are better than one and though tis said oer many cooks spoil the broth yet three may be better than two the feeling of humiliation which grew and deepened in aubreys mind was one of the best things which could have come to him vanity and selfsufficiency had always been his chief failings and he was now finding to his surprise that while his chosen friends surrounded him with difficulties the people whom he had slighted and despised came forward to help him out of them he had looked down on no one more than on mr marshall and agnes had received a share of his contempt partly because of her fathers calling and comparative poverty partly because she was not pretty and partly because she showed no power of repartee or spirit in conversation in aubreys eyes she had been a dull humdrum thing only fit to cook and sew and utterly beneath the notice of any one so elevated and spirituel as himself during the last few hours aubreys estimate of things in general had sustained some rude shocks and his hitherto unfaltering faith in his own infallibility was considerably shaken it suffered an additional blow when mr marshall led him into his quiet parlour and he saw agnes seated at her work the suppertable spread and a cheerful fire blazing upon a clean hearth an expression of slight surprise came into her eyes as she rose to greet aubrey you see daughter i have brought home a guest said her father he will tarry with us a little season then stepping across the room he opened a closed door and showed aubrey another chamber the size of the first across which a red curtain was drawn this is my chamber and shall be also yours said he i pray you use it freely at this end is my study and beyond the curtain my bedchamber i somewhat fear my library may scarce be to your liking he added an amused smile playing round his lips but if you can find therein anything to please you i shall be gladnow daughter what have we here we so rarely have guests to supper i fear mr louvaine may find our fare somewhat meagre though better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith it is a dinner of herbs father said agnes echoing the smile for tis a bit of gammon of bacon and spinach with eggs in poach how say you my friend asked mr marshall of aubrey can you make your supper of so simple a dish indeed i can sir and thankfully was the answer agnes marshall though very quiet was observant and she perceived in a moment that something was wrong with the magnificent youth who had scarcely deigned to look at her when they had met on previous occasions she saw also that his manner had greatly changed and very much for the better he spoke to her now on terms of equality and actually addressed her father in a tone of respect something must have happened aubrey naturally the less observant of the two was looking on just now with quickened senses and discovered also to his surprise that the simple supper was served with as much dainty neatness as at lord oxfords table that mr marshall could talk intelligently and interestingly on other than religious subjects that agnes really was not dull but quite able to respond to her fathers remarks that her eyes were clear and bright her complexion not at all bad and her smile decidedly pleasant and lastly that both his hosts though take a thus unawares were exceedingly kind to him and ready to put themselves to any trouble or inconvenience in order to accommodate him he had learned more when he lay down to sleep that night in twelve hours than in any previous twelve months of his life since his infancy the lessons were of higher value and they were not likely to be lost when supper was over mr marshall repaired to the white bear and aubrey was left to agnes as entertainer she was sewing a long seam and her needle went in and out with unfailing regularity for a few minutes he watched her in silence discovering a sunny gleam on her hair that he had never before noticed then he suddenly spoke out one of his thoughts dont you find that exceeding wearisome agnes looked up with amused surprise truly she said i never thought about it i am sure i could not work at it ten minutes replied aubrey agnes laugheda low soft musical laugh which struck pleasantly on the ear my father would be ill off for shirts if i could not she answered you see mr louvaine things have to be done tis to no good purpose to be impatient with them it doth but weary more the worker and furthers not the work a whit would you not like to lead a different lifesuch a life as other young maids doamid flowers and sunshine and jewels and dancing and laughter and all manner of jollity he was curious to hear what she would say to the question agnes answered by a rather wondering smile then her eyes went out of the window to the steeple of saint andrews and the blue sky beyond it i might well enjoy some of them she said slowly as if the different ideas were passing in review before her i love sunshine and flowers but there is one thing i love far better and that is a light that never was from sun nor moon flooded the grave grey eyes of agnes marshall her voice was very low and subdued as she answered that is to do the will of god there is nothing upon earth that i desire in comparison of him is not that a gloomsome dismal sort of thing there was divine compassion mingled with human amusement in the smile which was on agness lips as she looked up at him have you tried it mr louvaine aubrey shook his head i have tried a good many things but not puritan piety it ever seemed to me a most weary and dreary matteran eternal thou shalt not carved oer the gate of every garden of delight that i would fain enter they may be angels that stand there but they bear flaming swords he spoke lightly yet there was an accent in his voice which revealed to agnes a deep unfilled void in his heart dont try piety she said quietly try jesus christ instead there are no flaming swords in the way to him and the truest and deepest satisfaction cannot be reached without him have you found it thus mrs agnes i have mr louvaine but thenyou seeyou have not tried other fashions of pleasure maybe said aubrey slowly have you said agnes aya good many and did you find them satisfying i say not pleasant at the moment but satisfying well that is a large word said aubrey it is a large word was the reply yet christ can fill it and none can do it but he know you any thing or creature else that can i cannot say for i have not needed it that is you have not been down yet into deep places methinks where the floods have overflowed you i have not visited many in truth yet have i been in one or two where i should have lost my footing had not my lord held me up a very sorrowful look came into the gentle eyes agnes was thinking of the faithless jonas derwent who had cast her off in the day of her calamity aubrey made no answer he was beginning to find out that life was not as he had always imagined it a field of flowers but a very sore and real battlefield wherein to lose the victory meant to lose his very self and to win it meant to reign for ever and ever and then mr marshalls voice said on the other side of the doorthis is the wayand another voice dearly welcome to aubrey responded as aunt edith came into the room mine own dear boy god be thanked that we see thee safe from harm and again for the twentieth time aubrey felt as he kissed her that he had not deserved it chapter thirteen which is full of surprises ah who am i that god hath saved me from the doom i did desire and crossed the lot myself had craved to set me higher jean ingelow as mr marshall approached the white bear that evening he was unexpectedly pounced upon by silence abbott eh parson i declare its you how fares mrs agnes this cold even marry i do believe we shall have snow ere the day break again the white bearll be a bit whiter i reckon if he be well snowed oer are you going in there youll have some work to peace mrs louvaine shes lamenting and weeping you never heardand all for her son as cometh not home and she is fair sure hell be hung because she saith he was in with those rogues yonder he was nothing of the sort said mr marshall breaking in sternly on the flow of silences tide of words and let me tell you mrs abbott if you spread such a lie you may have a death at your door as like as not mr louvaine i have no doubt is safe and well and had no more ado with the gunpowder plot than you had and i saw you with mine own eyes talking with fawkes that rascal that called himself johnson eh deary parson but youd never go to tell on a poor woman and as honest as any in westminster if i did pass the time o day to a fellow that i never guessed to be a villain i do assure you on my truth as i hope you are an honest woman mrs abbott and so is mr louvaine an honest man and if you would have me keep my tongue off your doings see that you keep yours off his now i have given you warning that is a bargain eh deary deary but i never heard parson i such a way afore lamented mrs abbott to her daughter mary the only listener she had left for mr marshall had walked straight into the white bear ill say the lads a prince of the blood or an angel or anything hes a mind if hell but let me be me talk to guy fawkes indeed i never said no worser to him than fine morning or wet isnt it as it might be and to think o me being had up afore the lords of the council for just passing a word like thatand the parson too eh deary me whatever must i say to content him now i fancy mother said mary who took after her quiet father hell be content if youll hold your peace mr marshall found the ladies at the white bear all assembled in the parlour mrs louvaine had the ear of the house as he entered so unfeeling as you are temperance to a poor widow and my only child as good as lost and never found again and officers and thirdboroughs and constables all going about making all manner of inquirations trying to bring folks to justice and aubrey in with those wicked people and going to sup with them and alland nobody ever trying to prevent him and not a soul to care but me whether he went right or wrongi do believe you thought more of the price of herrings than you ever did of the dear boyand now hes completely lost and nobody knows what has become of him mr marshalls quiet voice effected a diversion mrs louvaine pardon me aubrey is at my house safe and sound there is no need for your trouble of course responded temperance i told her so might as well talk to the firebricks when she takes a fancy of this sort if the lad had come to any harm we should have heard it faith never will think that no news is good news i am glad aubrey is with you mr marshall said the gentle voice of lady louvaine i met with him madam in a walk this afternoon and brought him so far with me and why not a bit further trow asked temperance that am i come to say madamand he addressed himself to lady louvainehaving told you that your grandson is well in body and safe at my lodging i trust it shall not greatly touch you to learn that he is in some trouble of mind didnt i tell you demanded mrs louvaine in tones suited to cassandra amid the ruins of troy i said i was sure some harm had come to the boy and you laughed me to scorn and not one of you went to see nobody laughed at you but me my dear said her sister and as to going to see when his mother did not reckon it worth while to budge i dont see why his aunts should not sit quiet why you never looked for me to go responded mrs louvaine with a faint scream of horror me a poor widow and with my feeble health when i havent been out of the door except to church for nigh a month mores the pity if you knocked about a bit more and went to market of a morrow and such like maybe your health would not be so feeble temperance you barbarous creature how can you well i know there are folks that can faith and there are folks that cant you never heard me ask my lady lettice why she didnt stir up and go amarketing she cant shed be only too glad if she could and would want no asking but you could if you wouldits true my dear and you dont need to stare as if youd never seen me before this evening as for looking for you to go i didnt indeed i never look for aught but cumber and so im not disappointedmr marshall i ask your pardon im staying you from speaking mr marshall accepted the apology with a smile well the upshot of the matter is this mr louvaine though in truth as i do verily believe innocent of all ill is in danger to fall in some suspicion through a certain jewel of his being found in the lodging of one of the caitiffs lately execute he saith that he knew not where he had lost it no doubt it dropped out of his apparel when he was there as he allows he hath been divers times he never heard saith he a word of any traitorous designs nor did they tamper at all with his religion but this jewel being carried to my lady oxfordtruly whether by some suspicion that it should be mr louvaines or how i know not nor am sure that he doth himselfshe charged him withal yet kindly and made haste to have him forth of the house warning him that he must in no wise tarry in the town but must with all haste hie him down into the country and there lie squat until all suspicion had passed she would not even have him come hither where she said he should be sought if any inquiry were made the utmost she would suffer was that he should lie hid for a day or twain in my lodging whither you might come as if to speak with agnes and so might agree whither he should go and so forth my lady paid him his wage wellnigh nine pound and further counted ten pounds into his hand to help him on his journey truly she gave him good counsel and dealt well with him but the poor lad is very downcast and knows not what to do and he tells me he hath debts that he cannot pay so i carried him to my lodging where he now lieth and i wait your further wishes i thank you right truly for that your goodness said lady louvaine there now didnt i say the boy was sure to run into debt moaned mrs louvaine how much be these debts mr marshall asked the old lady twenty pounds borrowed from mr thomas rookwood twenty lost at play and about sixty owing to tailors mercers and the like ay i reckoned that velvet would be over a penny the yard i see the lad hath disburdened himself to you said lady louvaine with a sad smile truly i am sorry to hear this though little astonied mr marshall i have been much troubled at times thinking whether in suffering aubrey to enter my lord oxfords service i had done ill and yet in very deed at the time i could see nothing else to do it seemed to be the way wherein god meant us to goand yet madam the lords mercies are great enough to cover our mistakes along with our sins and it may be you made none i have never seen mr louvaine so softened and humbled as he now looks to be may the lord lead him forth by the right way what do you advise true friend i see two courses madam which under your good leave i will lay before you mr louvaine can either lie hid in the country with some friend of yoursor what were maybe better some friend of your friend or if he would be doing at once towards the discharging of his debts he can take the part mr floriszoon hath chosen and serve some tradesman in his shop trade aubrey shrieked mrs louvaine in horror he never will my boy hath so delicate a soul he said he would answered mr marshall quietly and thereby won my high respect nay you never mean it exclaimed temperance bless the lad i neer gave him credit for half the sense if aubrey be brought down to that he must have learned a good lesson said his grandmother not that i could behold it myself entirely without a pang edith who had hitherto been silent now put in a suggestion our charity is true as steel she said why not let aubrey lie close with her kindred where none should think to look for him in pendlewhat amid all the witches said temperance edith im amazed at you i could never lie quiet in my bed wailed mrs louvaine only to think of the poor boy being bewitched by those wicked creatures why they spend sunday nights dancing round the churchyard with the devil and the place is chokefull of em charity says added temperance she once met mother demdike her own self muttering under her breath and she gave her the evillest look as she passed her that the maid ever saw ay saying the lords prayer backwards of course well i cant say said temperance dubiously it did not seem to do charity any ill i shouldnt wonder truly for mercys sake stop her cried mrs louvaine shes going to say something wickedi know she is shell say there are no witches or no devil or something horrible nay ill say nought o the sort responded temperance whether there be witches or no the lord knows and there i leave it but that there is a devil im very sure for he has tempted me over and over again all i say is if charity could meet a witch and get no ill why should not aubrey too i wont have it cried mrs louvaine in an agony my poor darling boy i wont have it my fatherless child shall not go among snakes and witches and demons now faith do be quiet or youll have a fit of the mother hysterics nobody wants to send the lad amongst snakesi dont know that theres so much as an adder there as to devils hell find them whereer he goeth and some of them in mens and womens bodies or i mistake if your ladyship liked better suggested mr marshall quietly to take the other road i named i am acquaint with a bookseller in oxford town that is a cousin of my sisters husband a good honest man and a godfearing with whom if you so pleased he might be put tis a clean trade and a seemly that need not disgrace any to handle and methinks there were no need to mention wherefore it were save that the place were sought for a young gentleman that had lost money through disputes touching lands that is true and it should be sufficient to account for all that the master might otherwise note as strange in a servant my poor fatherless boy sobbed mrs louvaine with her handkerchief at her eyes servant to a tradesfellow we are all servants answered mr marshall and we need think no scorn thereof since our lord himself took on him the form of a servant howbeit for this even the chief question is doth any of you gentlewomen desire to return with memrs louvaine i could not bear it came in a stifled voice from behind the handkerchief to see my poor child in his miseryit would break mine heart outright tis enough to think of and tootoo exceedingly great to brook even so let her pass shell be neer a bit of good said temperance in a contemptuous whisper then raising her voice she addednow lady lettice dont you think thereof theres no need for edith and i can settle everything and youd just go and lay yourself by that you should have no good of your life for a month or more be ruled by me and let edith go back and talk matters oer with aubrey and see whether in her judgment it were better he lay hid or went to the bookseller shes as good a wit as any of us yourself except said i well if your ladyship would suffer me to add a word said the clergyman i think mrs temperance has well spoken there was a moments hesitation as if lady louvaine were balancing duties mr marshall noticed how her thin hand trembled and how the pink flush came and went on her delicate cheek well children have it as you will said the old lady at last it costs me much to give it up but were i to persist maybe it should cost more to you than i have a right to ask at your hands let be i will tarry dearest mother you have a right to all that our hands can give you answered edith tenderly but i pray you tarry until the morrow and then if need be and your strength sufficient you can ride to shoe lane so edith went with mr marshall alone even after all she had heard aubreys condition was a delightful surprise never before had she seen him in so softened humbled grateful a mood as now they talked the matter over and in the end decided that subject to lady louvaines approval aubrey should go to the bookseller when the white bear was reached on her return edith found lady oxford in the parlour the sternness with which the countess had treated aubrey was quite laid aside to lady louvaine she showed a graceful and grateful mixture of sympathy and respect endeavoured to reassure her hoped there would be no search nor inquiry thought it was almost too late highly approved of ediths decision promised to send over all aubreys possessions to the white bear and bade them let her know if she could do them any service will you suffer me to ask you one thing she said if mr louvaine go to oxford shall you tarry here or no would it be safe for us to follow him follow himno i did but think you might better love to be forth of this smoky town amen with all my heart said temperance but madam and saving your ladyships presence crowns bloom not on our raspberry bushes nor may horses be bought for a groat apiece down this way mrs louvaine behind the cambric was heard to murmur something about a sordid spirit people whose minds never soared and old maids who knew nothing of the strength of maternal love strength o fiddlesticks said temperance turning on her madam i ask your ladyships pardon my dear lady i cannot answer you as now was lady louvaines reply the pillar of cloud hath not moved as yet and so long as it tarrieth so long must i also it may be as seemeth but like that my next home will be the churchyard vault that let my father judge if it had been his will that i might have laid my bones in mine own country and by the side of my beloved it had been pleasant to flesh and blood but i know well that i go to meet him wherever my dust may lie i am wellnigh fourscore years old this day and if the lord say go not over this jordan let him do as seemeth him good methinks the glory of the blessed city burst no less effulgent on the vision of moses because he had seen the earthly canaan but far off and what i love the best is not here but there temperance and edith accompanied lady oxford to her coach she paused a moment before stepping in mrs edith she said methinks your good mother would fain see mr louvaine ere he depart if so she shall not be balked thereof i have made inquiry touching mr marshalls house and i find there is a little gate from the garden thereof into saint andrews churchyard i will call for her as tomorrow in my coach and carry her to take the air an ancient servant of mine that is wedded to the clerk of saint andrews dwelleth by the churchyard and i will stay me there as though to speak with her sending away the coach upon another errand that i can devise then from her house my lady may safely win to mr marshalls lodging and be back again ere the coach return your ladyship is most good unto us responded edith thankfully i am assured it should greatly comfort my dear mother lady oxford turned with a smile to temperance it seems to me mrs temperance that your words be something sharp well madam to tell truth folks do put me out now and again more than a little manys the time i long to give faith a good shaking and i could have laid a stick on aubreys back middling oftenill not say i couldnt but if the lad sees his blunders and is sorry for em ill put my stick in the corner i think i would leave it tarry there for the present said lady oxford with a soft little laugh god grant you a good even the coach had only just rolled away and four youthful abbotts whom it had glued to the window were still flattening their noses against the diamond panes when a clear strong sweet voice rang out on the evening air in the back road which led by the palings of saint jamess park both edith and temperance knew well whose voice it was they heard it every night lifted up in one of the psalms of david as hans floriszoon came home from his work with the mercer hans was no longer an apprentice mr leigh had taken such a fancy to him and entertained so complete a trust both in his skill and honesty that six months before he had voluntarily cancelled his indentures and made him his partner in the business nothing changed hans floriszoon he had sung as cheerily in his humble apprenticeship and would have done so had he been lord mayor of london as now when he came down the back road lantern in hand every evening as regularly as the clock struck four mrs abbott declared that she set her clock by hans whenever it stopped which it did frequently for it was an ancient piece of goods and suffered from an asthmatic affection theres mestur ans said charity see thee rachel ill teem them eggs into th pan thou doesnt need to come rachel sat by the window trying to finish making a new apron before supper thats a good lass she said eh but its a dark day theyll none see a white horse a mile off tonight note theyd have better een nor me to see it any night said charity breaking the eggs into the pan hearken to th lad said rachel eh its gradely excellent exactly right music is that he sings well does mestur ans the words were audible now as the singer unlatched the gate and turned into the garden and in the presence of my foes my table thou shalt spread thou shalt o lord fill full my cup and eke anoint mine head through all my life thy favour is so frankly showed to me that in thy house for evermore my dwellingplace shall be hans lifted the latch and came into the kitchen heres a clean floor rachel tarry a minute while i pluck off my shoes and i will run across in my stockingfeet it shall be february filldyke methinks ere the day break hes as good as my lady and mrs edith for not making work said charity as hans disappeared i would we could set him i th garden and have a crop on him responded rachel hes th only man i ever knew that d think for a woman eh lass yo never knew sir aubrey was charitys grave comment there was a good deal for hans to hear that evening and he listened silently while edith told the tale and temperance now and then interspersed sarcastic observations when at last the story was told hans said quietly say you that you look to see aubrey again toorrow lady lettice doth and edith not i said temperance tis a case wherein too many cooks might spoil the broth and the lad shall be all the easier in his mind for his old crusty aunt temperance to tarry at home but i say edith i would you had asked him for a schedule of his debts tailors and silkmen is scarce enough to go to market withal if we had the means to pay them so did i temperance and he told metwenty pounds to mr tom rookwood and forty to patrick at the irish boy fifteen to cohen of the three tuns in knightriders street and about ten more to bennett at the bible in paternoster row lancaster and derby why however many suits can the lad have in his wardrobe it should fit me out for life such a sum as that well i would we could discharge them said lady louvaine with a sigh twenty to tom rookwood and forty to patrick make your mind easy madam came in the quietest tones from hans not a penny is owing to either what can you mean hans i am sure of it who told you so much nay ask mr rookwood and see what he saith ill go this minute said temperance rising i wis not what bee thou hast in thy bonnet but i dont believe thee lad maybe you will when you come back was the calm response away flashed temperance and demanded an interview with mr thomas rookwood if he were at home mr thomas was at home and did not express the surprise he felt at the demand but when the subject of aubreys debt was introduced mr thomass eyebrows went up mr louvaine owes me nothing i do ensure you i heard you had lent him twenty pounds i did but it was repaid a month ago by aubrey so i suppose i understood so much was the answer in a slightly puzzled tone he repaid it not himself then himself nayhe sent it to me but i gave the quittance as to mr louvaine i thank you mr rookwood then that ends the matter out of the golden fish and into the white bear ran temperance with drops of rain lying on her gown and hood madam she announced in a stern voice i am that flabbergasted as never was heres mr tom rookwood saith that aubrey paid him his money a month gone why aubrey told me this afternoon that he owed him twenty pounds replied edith in a tone of astonished perplexity hans what meaneth this methinks madam it means merely that i told you the truth mr rookwood you see bears me out he saith aubrey sent the money by a messenger unto whom he gave the quittance dear heart but if he lost it yet aubrey must have known if he sent the money said edith in the same tone as before the messenger lost not the quittance said hans it is quite safe he had been out of the room for a minute while temperance was away and now passing his hand into his pocket he took out a slip of paper which he laid in the hand of lady louvaine she drew forth her gold spectacles and was fitting them on when edith impulsively sprang up and read the paper over her mothers shoulder received of mr aubrey louvaine gent the sum of twenty pounds for moneys heretofore lent by me this fifteenth of january the year of our lord god according to the computation of the church of england thomas rookwood northumberland cumberland westmoreland and durham was the comment from temperance hans said edith a light flashing on her wert thou the messenger i was not sent was the placid answer hans thou admirable rascal cried temperance laying her hands on his shoulders i do believe thou didst pay this money if thou own not the truth ill shake thee in twenty bits hans looked up laughingly into her face methinks mrs temperance you should shake yourself in forty ere you did it answer me this minute thou wicked knave didst thou pay this money or no i was there when it was paid ill wager my best boots thou wert was any else there certainly who beside the cat i believe temperance gave him a shake which he stood with complete calm only looking a little amused more about his eyes than his lips hans tell me said lady louvaine is it possible these debts were paid with thy money how shall i repay thee my true and dear friend hans freed himself from temperances grasp and knelt down beside lady louvaine nay madam do you forget that you paid me firstthat i owe unto you mine own self and my very life from the time we came hither i have seen pretty clearly which way aubrey was going and having failed to stay him methought my next duty was to save all i could that you should not at some aftertime be cumbered with his debts mr rookwoods and patricks whereof i knew have i discharged and the other for which i have a sufficiency will i deal withal tomorrow so that you can tell aubrey he is not a penny in debt save to thee my darling boy there are no debts between brothers madam or should not be hans thou downright angel do forgive me burst from temperance dear mrs temperance i should make a very poor angel but i will forgive you with all mine heart when i know wherefore i should do it why lad here have i been like an old curmudgeon as i am wellnigh setting thee down as a pennyfather because i knew not what thou didst with thy money it was plain as a pikestaff what aubrey did with his for he set it all out on his back but thy habit is alway plain and decent and whither thy crowns went could i never tell eh but i am sorry i misjudged thee thus tis a lesson for me and shall be my life long i do believe thou art the best lad ever trod shoeleather well tis a very proper deed hans and i am glad to see in you so right a feeling said mrs louvaine the lord bless thee my boy added lady louvaine with emotion but how may i suffer thee to pay aubreys debts i scarce see how you shall set about to help it madam said hans with a little laugh of pleasure i thank god i have just enough to pay all and leave thyself bare my boy said edith of what mrs edith asked hans with a smile a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth i am one of the richest men in england i take it and my wealth is not of a sort that shall make it hard to enter into the kingdom of god the corn and wine and oil may be good things and are such being gods gifts yet the gladness which he giveth is a better and will abide when they are spent lady oxford kept her word and his grandmother and aunt edith had a farewell interview with aubrey his face was a study for a painter when the receipts were shown him tom rookwood had refused him a second loan only a few weeks earlier and had pressed him to repay the former hans floriszoon had paid his debts without even letting him know it yet he had lent many a gold piece to tom rookwood while the memory of that base cruel blow given to hans made his cheek burn with shame had he not been treasuring the pebble and flinging away the pearl hans has paid my debts he said in an exceedingly troubled voice hans out of his own pocket may god forgive me tell himand aubreys voice was almost chokedtell him he hath heaped coals of fire on mine head edith asked no questions but she gave a shrewd guess which was not far off the truth and she was confirmed in it by the fact that hans received the message with a smile and expressed no doubt what it meant that night there were twentytwo miles between aubrey and london and the next day he rode into oxford and delivered mr marshalls letter of recommendation to the bookseller mr whitstable whose shop was situated just inside the west gatenamely in close contiguity to that aristocratic part of the city now known as paradise square mr whitstable was a whitehaired man who seemed the essence of respectability he stooped slightly in the shoulders and looked aubrey through and over with a pair of dark brilliant penetrating eyes in a way not exactly calculated to add to that young gentlemans comfort nor to restore that excellent opinion of his own virtues which had been somewhat shaken of late you are of kin to the writer of this letter mr marshall aubrey admitted it and you desire to learn my trade i am afeared i scarce do desire it master but i am content and needs must what have you hitherto done master said aubrey looking frankly at his questioner i fear i have hitherto done nothing save to spend money and make a fool of myself that is no recommendation i know you have done one other thing young man said the old bookseller you have told the truth that is a recommendation mr marshall tells me not that yet can i read betwixt the lines i shall ask you no questions and as you deal with me so shall i with you have you eaten and drunk since you entered the city good take this cloth and dust that row of books i shall give you your diet three pound by the year and a suit of livery and mr whitstable walked away into the back part of his shop leaving aubrey to digest what he had just heard the idea of wearing livery was not in his eyes what it would be in ours a part of his humiliation for it was then customary for gentlemen as well as servants to wear the livery of their employers even ladies did it when in the service of royal or noble mistresses this therefore was merely what he might expect in the circumstances and as his own meanest suit was not in keeping with his new position it was rather a relief than otherwise but he was slightly disconcerted to find how accurately his master had read him in the first minute a little wholesome reflection brought aubrey to the conclusion that his best plannay his only plan in present circumstanceswas to accommodate himself to them and to do his very best in his new calling almost unconsciously he set hans before him as a suitable example and dusted the row of books under this influence in a creditable manner his experiences for the evening were new and strange now an undergraduate entered for the epistles of casaubon or the paraphrases of erasmus now a portly citizen demanded the mirrour of magistrates a labouring man asked for the shepherds calendar a schoolmaster required a dozen hornbooks and a lady wanted a handsomelybound communion book psalters at two shillings each grammars from sixpence to a shilling speeds chronicle at fifty shillings a map of england at thirty the life of sir philip sidney at fourpence a paper book at sixteen pence an italian dictionary at fifteen shillingsclassics songbooks prayerbooks chronicles lawbooksaubrey learned to handle them all and to repeat their prices glibly in a style which astonished himself at the end of a week mr whitstable told him in his usual grave and rather curt manner that if he would go on as he had begun he should be satisfied with him the going on as he had begun was precisely the difficulty with aubrey to do some magnificent deed by a sudden spurt of heroism or behave angelically for a day might be possible to him but that quiet daily fulfilment of uninteresting dutiesthat patient continuance in welldoing which seemed as if it came naturally to hans was to aubrey louvaine the hardest thing on earth had the lesson been a little less sharp humanly speaking he would have failed but aubreys conscience had been startled into life and he was beginning to see that it would be too little profit to gain the whole world if in so doing he lost his own soul which was himself men are apt to look on their souls not as themselves but as a sort of sacred possession a rich jewel to be worn on sundays and carefully put up in cottonwool for the rest of the weekof immense value theoretically of course yet not at all the same thing as the me which is the centre of sensation to each one and for which every man will give all that he hath the mountain was terribly steep but aubrey climbed itonly god knew with how much inward suffering and with how many fervent prayers the aubrey who sold mr whitstables books that spring in the shop at the west gate of oxford was a wholly different youth from my lord oxfords gentleman only a few weeks before three months had passed by and no further apprehensions were entertained at the white bear of any government inquiries if lady oxford still felt any she kept them to herself it was a summer evening hans had come home and the little family party were seated in the parlour when a summons of charity to the front door was followed by her appearance before the ladies madam said she heres one would have speech of your ladyship and hell not take a civil nay neither i told him he might ha come i daylight and he said youd be just as fain of him i th dark hes none aila bashful for sure well let him come in charity said lady louvaine smiling charity drew back and admitted a man of about fiveandtwenty years clad in respectable but not fashionable garments and with an amused look in his eyes i do believe your maid thinks ive come to steal the spoons said he i could scarce win her to let me in well does nobody know me dont you grandmother why sure tis never david lewthwaite responded lady louvaine in some excitement tis david lewthwaite the son of your daughter milisent said he laughing why who was to know you my boy asked his aunt edith we have not seen you but once since we came and you have changed mightily since then when last we saw you said temperance your chin was as smooth as the hearthstone and now youve got beard enough to fit out a flock of goats ah id forgot my beard was new well i have been remiss i own but i will expound another time the reasons why you saw us not oftener tonight methinks youll have enough to do to hearken to the cause which has brought me at last no ill news david i trust asked his grandmother growing a shade paler none madam and yet i come to bring news of death of whose death of the death of oswald louvaine of selwick hall there was a cry from editho david can you possibly meanis selwick come back to us oswald louvaine died unwedded and hath left no will his heiratlaw is my cousin aubrey here may the lord help him to use it wisely said his grandmother with emotion amen said david heartily and now madam as i have not stolen the spoons may i let somebody else in that i left round the cornerwhom perchance you may care rather to see than me prithee bring whom thou wilt david there shall be an hearty welcome for him well i rather guess there will be said david as he walked out of the parlour dear heart but who is talking fast enough to shame a racehorse well now you dont say so was what met davids ear as he unlatched the gate of the white bear and youve come from camberwell you say well thats a good bit o walking and i dare be bound youre weary id i cry you mercycumberland said a silvery voice in amused tones dear heart why thats a hundred mile off or more isnt it and how many days did it take youand how did you comeo horsebackand be the roads very miryand how many of you be thereand what kin are you to my lady lettice now and how long look you to tarry with her my mistress said david doffing his hat ant like you i am a lawyer and tomorrow morning at nine oclock if you desire it will i be at your service in the witnessbox for two shillings the week and my diet for tonight i wish you good even lackadaisy was all that mrs abbott could utter as david rescued the owner of the silvery voice and bore her off laughing to the white bear madam and my mistresses he said as he threw open the door i have the honour to announce the most excellent mistress milisent lewthwaite tears and laughter were mixed for more than one present as milisent flew into her mothers arms and then gave a fervent hug to her sister edith i would come with robin she cried it feels like a whole age since i saw one of you my dear heart such a journey said her mother and where is the dear robin then oh he shall be here anon he tarried but to see to the horses and such like and i set off with daviei felt as though i could not bear another minute madam i give you to wit said david with fun in his eyes this mother of mine that had not seen me for an whole year spake but three words to mehow fare you my boy help me to light and now let us be off to westminster well i had seen thee in a year answered milisent echoing his laugh and them not for three years less a month a little soft echoing laugh came from lady louvaine shall i tell thee my dear heart what i think aunt joyce should say to thee well done lettice edens daughter ah mother dear said milisent kissing her mothers hand i may be like what you were as a young maid but never shall i make by onehalf so blessed a saint in mine old age that must you ask your grandchildren said temperance nay i will ask somebody that can judge better replied milisent laughing what sayest thou robin mr lewthwaite had entered so quietly that only his wifes quick eyes had detected his presence he came forward now kissed lady louvaines hand and then laying his hand on milisents bright head he said softly the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her whether he would have gone further was never to be known for a sudden rap at the door preceded charity madam heres mistress abbott and hoo will come in i cannot keep her out ive done my best and they were all feeling so happy and yet for various reasons so humblethe two are very apt to go togetherthat as edith observed afterwards there was charity enough and to spare even for silence abbott note on candlemas day you should see a white horse a mile off is a proverb in the north and perhaps elsewhere chapter fourteen ends with joyce morrell vanished is each bright illusion they have faded one by one yet they gaze with happy faces westwards to the setting sun talking softly of the future looking oer the golden sands towards a neverfading city builded not with earthly hands cyrus thornton well to be sure my man wouldnt let me come no soonertis his fault not mine but i did want to know which of them lads o ours told his tale the tightest heres seth will have it youve had a thousand left you by the year and ben he saith young master floriszoons to be a lord dear i hope not said hans well but theyre asaying so much all up and down the kings street i can tell you how could it have crept forth said edith then tis true eh but im as glad as if id had forty shillings left mei am so cried mrs abbott and she was sincere for a fresh subject for conversation was worth quite that to her and is it true as our seth said that youve a fine house and a park in northamptonshire come to you and fifteen hundred head o red deer and a lake to fish in quite true said robert lewthwaite with a grave bow allowing my mistress of four corrections there is not a park it is not in northamptonshire there be no red deer and the lake longeth not to the house and jewels worth ever so many thousands as our ben saith for mistress lettice and ten barbary horses o th best and a caroche fine enough for the kings majesty ah i would that last were true said edith my mistress the barbary horses be all there saving ten and the caroche is abuilding in the air as to the jewels seeing they be mistress lettices i leave her to reply lettice was in no condition to do it for she was suffering torments from suppressed laughter her uncle roberts preternatural gravity and mrs abbotts total incapacity to see the fun were barely endurable eh but you will be mortal fine said mrs abbott turning her artillery on the afflicted lettice i only wish our mall had such a chance if she mrs abbott i cry you mercy but here comes your caleb said hans calmly i reckon he shall be after you i reckon he shall the caitiff that man o mine hes for ever and the day after asending the childer after me i rejoice to hear you have so loving an husband mr lewthwaite was sufficiently inconsiderate to respond eh bless you theres no love about it just like them men theyd shut a womans mouth up as tight as a fish and never give her no leave to speak a word if they had their way but im not one of your meek bagpuddings thatll take any shape you pinch emnot i forsooth and he knows it ill have my say soon or late and prissy shes a downright chatterbox not that im that you knownot a bit of it but prissy she is and i can tell you when prissy and dorcas and ben theyre all at it the house isnt over quiet for none on em hearkens what tothers are saying and their father whacks em by timesay he doth now caleb whats to do nothing particular mother said slow deliberate caleb through the open window only theres yon pedlar with the mercery and he willnt tarry only ten minutes more thou lackhalter rascal and neer told me while i asked thee the parlour of the white bear was free in another moment theres a deliverance said mr lewthwaite blessed be the pedlar have you been much pestered by that gadfly theres been a bit of buzzing by times replied temperance now mother darling said milisent how are we to carry you down home my dear child was the response methinks if you would do that it should be only in my coffin i have one journey to go soon and it is like to be the next mother sweet heart i wont have it you shall yet win to selwick if i carry you every foot of the way nay nay my dear heart i cannot hope that at fourscore fourscore ay or forty score cried milisent why old mistress outhwaite journeyed right to the border but just ere we came and shes four years over the fourscoreand on horseback belike sure you might go in a waggon or a caroche where is the caroche milly well but at any rate we might find a waggon there is a travelling waggon said hans leaves the chequers in holborn for york once in the monthmethinks tis the first thursday in every month that is three weeks hence why not sure your landlord would suffer you to let this house and you might leave some behind till it were off your hands what saith temperanceor hans that where my lady goeth i go was the answer from hans is it needful milly to settle all our futures ere the clock strike humorously inquired mr lewthwaite methinks we might leave that for the morrow milisent laughed and let the subject drop mr lewthwaite and temperance happened to be the last up that night when all the rest had departed and charity came with the turf to bank up the parlour fire for the night temperance was saying one thing can i promise youwhich is if aubrey return to selwick as lord and master you may trust faith to go withal as for me i live but in other lives and where i am most needed there will i be if god be served but truly i see not how we shall move my lady lettice i would fain with all my heart have her back yonder and so she would herselfof that am i right sure but to ride so far on an horse at her years and with her often painshow could she and though the waggon were safer it were too long and weary a journey think you not so charity having now settled her peatsod to her satisfaction left the room with a heartygoodnight mrs temperance goodnight mestur robin truly i think with you said mr lewthwaite when she was gone but there is time to consider the matter let us decide nothing in haste the next morning for the first time for many weeks charity asked for a holiday it was granted her and she was out till twelve oclock when she came home with a very satisfied face ways and means were discussed that day but to little practical purpose of course aubrey must be informed of the good fortune which had fallen to him and after some consideration it was settled that if hans could make arrangements with mr leigh he should be the messenger in this direction setting forth when sunday was over people did not rush off by the next train in those days and scald their tongues with hot coffee in order to be in time the saturday evening came and with it the calm quiet which most puritan families loved to have on the eve of the lords day while it was not necessary it was nevertheless deemed becoming to lay aside secular occupations and to let worldly cares rest there was therefore some astonishment in the parlour when a sudden rap came on the door and charitys face and cap made their appearance if you please madam whenll you be wanting your coach think you my coach charity said lady louvaine in amazement everybody was staring at charity its ready madam said that damsel with much placidity hes only got to put the horses to hasnt zekiel and theyre at tomkins stable yon by th tilt yardspring gardens i reckon they call it charity lass are you in your right senses think you demanded temperance well mrs temperance i reckon youll be best judge o that said charity coolly seems to me i am but that scarce makes sure i count but charitywhat ezekiel zekiel cavell mrs edith hes i th kitchen you can see him if youve a mind ezekiel cavell aunt joyces coachman where on earth has he come from well i rather think it was somewhere on earth answered the calm charity and i expect it was somewhere i oxfordshire howbeit here he is and sos th coach and sos th horses and he says to me charity says he will you ask my lady when shell be wanting th coach so i come everybody looked at everybody else is it possible cried edith has dear aunt joyce sent her coach to carry down mother home nay its none hers its my ladys said charity and nobry elses and if shes a mind to bid me chop it up for firewood i can if mestur ans ll help me we can eat th horses too if she likes but they mun be put in salt for wes neer get through em else theres six on em shall i tell rachel to get th brine ready charity what have you been doing said hans laughing ive done nought mestur ans nobut carry a letter where it belonged and serve zekiel his fourhours they began to see light dawning on the mystery a letter to whom charity and who writ it to mestur marshall and mrs joyce morrell writ itleastwise her man did at her bidding what said it i didnt read it sir responded charity demurely come i reckon you know what was in it said mr lewthwaite out with it charity come forward into the room charity and tell your tale like a man said temperance i amnt a man mrs temperance answered charity doing as she was bid but ill tell it like a woman well when i were with mrs joyce afore we came hither hoo gave me a letterlets see nay it were two letters one lapped of a green paper and one of a white and hoo said as soon as yo geet got here i were to ask my way to shoe lane just outside o th city gate and gie th letter i th white paper to mestur marshall and th green un i were to keep safe by me till it cameif it did comethat my lady lacked a coach either to journey home or to minster lovel and when i heard that i were to carry it to mestur marshall too so i did as i were bid what were i th letters i cannot tell you but mestur marshall come to see you as soon as he geet th white un and when he geet th green un come zekiel wi th coach and th tits mrs joyce hoo said hoo were feared nobryd tell her if a coach were wanted and that were why she gave me th letter so now you know as much as i know and i hope youre weel pleased wi it and if you please what am i to say to zekiel dear aunt joyce said edith under her breath make ezekiel comfortable charity said lady louvaine as she drew off her glasses and wiped them and on monday we will talk over the matter and come to some decision thereupon the decision unanimously come to on the monday was that hans should ride down to oxford and see aubrey before anything else was settled lady louvaine would have liked dearly to return home to selwick but aubrey was its master and was of age and he might be contemplating matrimony when he could afford it if so she would make a long visitpossibly a lifelong oneto her beloved joyce at minster lovel accompanied by edith temperance and lettice were to return to keswick faith must please herself that faith would please herself and would not much trouble herself about the pleasing of any one else they were tolerably convinced and of course aubreys own mother had a greater claim on him than more distant relatives she would probably queen it at selwick unless aubrey provided the hall with a younger queen in her place it was on a lovely summer afternoon that hans rode into oxford by the water gate or little gate from which a short street led up northwards to christ church and saint aldates just beyond these he passed through the city portal of south gate and turning to the left down brewers street he soon came to mr whitstables shop under the shadow of west gate just on the eastern side was a liverystable where hans put up his horse and then wishing to see aubrey before he should be recognised he walked straight into the shop at the further end aubrey was showing some solidlooking tomes to two solidlooking dons while mr whitstable himself was just delivering a purchase to a gentleman in canonicals hans stepped up to the bookseller and in a low tone asked him for a book of articles this meant the famous thirtynine then sold separate from the prayerbook at a cost of about sixpence mr whitstable laid three copies on the counter of which hans selected one and then said still speaking low may i with your good leave tarry till my brother yonder is at liberty and have speech of him i have ridden from london to see him the keen eyes examined hans critically youbrothers was all the reply of the old bookseller not by blood said hans with a smile nor truly by nation but we were bred up as brothers from our cradles you may tarry pray you sit hans complied and sat for a few minutes watching aubrey he perceived with satisfaction that his costume was simple and suitable entirely devoid of frippery and foppery that his mind seemed to be taken up with his employment that he was looking well and appeared to understand his business at last the grave and reverend signors had made their choice bullingers decades at nine shillings was selected and bezas new testament at sixteen aubrey received the money gave the change and delivered the books he was following his customers down the shop when his eyes fell on hans whether on this occasion he was welcome or not hans was not left to doubt every feature of aubreys face every accent of his voice spoke gratification in no measured tones hans my dear brother he said as they clasped hands when came you and have you had to eat since how left you all at home mr whitstable was looking on with eyes that saw i came but now and have left all well god be thanked said hans i have not yet eaten for i wished to see you first i will now go and break bread and we can meet in the evening when you are at large there was a momentary look of extreme disappointment and then aubrey said that is right as you alway are where meet we under west gate mr whitstable spoke methinks mr louvaine it were pity to snatch the crust from an hungry man go you now with your brother until he make an end of his supper then return here in time to make up accounts and close if this gentleman be the steady and sober man that his looks and your words promise you can bring him hither to your chamber for the night i thank you right heartily master he is sober as mr vicechancellor and good as an angel said aubrey hans followed him with an amused look to the golden lion where they supped on chicken and banbury cakes and aubrey heard all the newsthe one item excepted which hans had come especially to tell the tongues went fast but no sooner had the hour rung out from the clock of saint ebbes than aubrey sprang up and said he must return thou canst wander forth for an hour only lose not thyself he said to hans and when my work is done i will join thee beneath the arch of west gate hans obeyed with amused pleasure this was an altered aubrey when had he cared to keep promises and be in time for work they met presently under west gate and aubrey played cicerone until dusk set in when he took hans to his own quiet little chamber at the booksellers shop it was very plainly furnished and hans quickly saw that on the drawers lay a bible which bore evidence of being used thou little wist said hans affectionately when they were thus alone how glad i am to see thee aubrey and to perceive thy good welfare in this place he did not add good conduct but he meant it how much richer shouldst thou have been hans if thou hadst never beheld me was the answer i should have been poorer by the loss of the only brother i ever had there was more feeling in aubreys look than hans was wont to see and an amount of tenderness in his tone which he had no idea how it astonished hans to hear my brother he said you have had your revenge and it is terrible hans looked as he felt honestly surprised it was his nature to remember vividly benefits received but to forget those which he conferred dost thou not know said aubrey reading the look after my unworthy conduct toward thee that thou shouldst take my debts upon thine own prithee shut thy mouth answered hans with a laugh and make me not to blush by blowing the trumpet over that which but gave me a pleasure i ensure thee my brother he added more gravely that i had a sufficiency to cover all was a true contentment unto me as to revenge no such thought ever crossed my mind for a moment the revenge had been lesser if it were designed was the reply and how goeth it with thee here asked hans not sorry to change the subject art thou content with thy workand doth mr whitstable entreat thee well mr whitstable is the manner of master good for me responded aubrey with a smile namely not unkindly but inflexibly firm and just i know that from him if i deserve commendation i shall have it and if i demerit blame i am evenly sure thereof which is good for me as to contentay i am content but i can scarce go further and say i find a pleasure in my work that were more like thee than me and if it so were aubrey that the lord spake unto thee and me saying work thus no more but return unto the old life as it was ere ye came to london townhow shouldst thou regard that the momentary light of imagination which sprang to aubreys eyes was succeeded and quenched by one of wistful uncertainty i cannot tell hans said he that i were glad is of course that i were wise to be glad is somewhat more doubtful i am afeared i might but slip back into the old rut and fall to pleasing of myself riches and liberty seem scarce to be good things for me and i have of late a little hesitation accompanied this part of the sentencei have thought it best to pray god to send me that which he seeth good and not to grant my foolish desires truly i seem to know better wellnigh every day how foolish i have been and how weak i yet am there was a second of silence before hans said aubrey what god sees good for thee now is the old home at selwick hall may he bless it to thee and fit thee for it what mean you asked the bewildered aubrey a few minutes put him in possession of the facts nothing which had passed convinced hans of a radical change in aubreys heart so completely as the first sentence with which he greeted the news of his altered fortune then my dear old grandmother can go home thou wilt be glad to hear added hans quietly that mrs joyce morrell hath sent her a caroche and horses wherein to journey at her ease mrs temperance and lettice go back to keswick not if i know it was the hearty response i lack aunt temperance to keep me straight otherwise i should have nought save soft southwest airs playing around me and she is a cool north breeze that shall brace me to my duty but how quick hans canst thou get free of mr leigh for we must not tarry grandmother at her years and in this summer weather when journeying were least weariful wilt thou have me then aubrey hans that is the worst cut thou hast ever given me i have a mind to say i will not turn back without thee hans smiled i thank thee my dear brother i dare say that i can be quit with mr leigh as soon as thou canst shake thee free of mr whitstable mr whitstable smiled rather cynically when the matter was laid before him well young gentleman said he to aubrey methinks you shall make a better country squire than you should have done three months gone and maybe none the worse for your tarrying with the old bookseller mr whitstable i con you hearty thanks for your good and just entreatment of me said aubrey and if ever your occasions call you into cumberland i promise you a true welcome at selwick hall that night aubrey seemed to be in a brown study and the sagacious hans let him alone till his thoughts should blossom forth into words of themselves they came at last hans thou wist it is customary for chaplains to be entertained in great houses ay said hans smiling to himself i desire not to ape the great butthinkest thou we might not have a prophets chamber in some corner at selwickthe chamber over the east porch belike truly if the prophet were to hand said hans looking as grave as if he were not secretly amused the prophet is to hand rather than the chamber was the answer couldst thou not guess i meant mr marshall hans had guessed it some seconds back a good thought truly he replied that will i ask my grandmother said aubrey it was the evening after aubreys return to the white bear when that proposal was suggested to lady louvaine a light of gladness came to the dim blue eyes my dear lad how blessed a thought said she but what should come of mrs agnes then suggested temperance oh she could easily be fitted with some service answered mrs louvaine who for once was not in a complaining mood hans you might ask of mr leigh if he know of any such or maybe of some apprenticeship that should serve her she can well work with the needle and is a decent maid that should not shame her mistress were she not over high in the world mother the indignant tone of that one word brought the handkerchief instantly out of mrs louvaines pocket well really aubrey i do think it most unreasonable such a way to speak to your poor mother and she a widow when i have but one child and he he is sorry mother if he spake to you with disrespect said aubrey in a different tone but suffer me to say that if mr marshall come with us so must mrs agnes now faith do be quiet ive been counting on mrs agnes to see to things a bit and save edithrun about for my lady lettice see you and get our lettice into her good ways you dont say to spare me wailed mrs louvaine no my dear i dont replied temperanoe significantly ill spare you when you need sparing dont you fear mr marshall and agnes were as glad as they were astonishedand that was no littleto hear of the provision in store for them to pass from those three rooms in shoe lane to the breezy hills and wide chambers of selwick hallto live no more from hand to mouth with little in either but to be assured as far as they could be so among the changes and chances of this mortal life of bread to eat and raiment to put onto be treated as beloved and honoured friends instead of meeting with scornful words and averted looksthis was glad news indeed mr marshall rejoiced for his daughter and agnes for her father hers was a nature which could attain its full happiness only in serving god and man to have shut herself up and occupied herself with her own amusement would have been misery not pleasure the idea of saving trouble to lady louvaine and edith of filling in some slight degree the empty place of that beloved friend whom selwick hall called cousin bess and agnes aunt elizabeththis opened out to agnes marshall a prospect of unadulterated enjoyment to her father whose active days were nearly over and who was old rather with work hardship and sorrow than by the mere passage of time the lot offered him seemed equally happy the quiet rest the absence of care the plenitude of books the society of chosen friends who were his fellowpilgrims zionwardto contemplate such things was almost happiness enough in itself and if he smothered a sigh in remembering that his eleanor slept in that quiet churchyard whence she could never more be summoned to rejoice with him it was followed at once by the happier recollection that she had seen a gladder sight than this and that she was satisfied with it it was but natural that the journey home should be of the most enjoyable character the very season of the year added to its zest the five ladies and two girls travelled in the coachprivate carriages were much more roomy then than now and held eight if not ten persons with comfortmr lewthwaite aubrey hans and the two maids were on horseback so they set forth from the white bear farewell to thee said charity to that stolidlooking animal as she rode under it for the last time rachel what dost thou mean lass art thou crying to leave yon beast or mistress abbott nay nother on em for sure said rachel wiping her eyes ive nobut getten a fly into my eye mrs abbott however was not behindhand she came out to her gate to see the cavalcade depart followed by a train of youthful abbotts two or three talking at once as well as herself what reached the ears of the ladies in the coach therefore was rather a mixture fare you well lady louvaine and all you young gentlewomenand i hope youll have a safe journey and a pleasant im sure ill write and tell you the new modes mrs lettice said prissy youll have neer a chance to be stuck in the mud ere youve gone a mile came in seths voice and where tarry you tonight trow demanded mrs abbott is it to be at saint albans or up atop of yon tree screamed hester there she was with a kitten in her mouth and all the jewels you could think of dorcas was heard to utter the words on either side were lost but nobodyexcept perhaps the speakersthought the loss a serious one under way at last the coach rumbled with dignity up king street through the court gates past charing cross and along the stranda place fraught with painful memories to one at least of the partypast the strand cross through temple bar up fetter lane over holborn bridge and snow hill up aldersgate street along the barbican and by the fields to shoreditch into the saint albans road as they came out into the shoreditch road a little above bishopsgate they were equally surprised and gratified to find lady oxfords groom of the chambers standing and waiting for their approach as he recognised the faces he stepped forward in his hand was a very handsome cloak of fine cloth of the shade of brown then called mealcolour lined with crimson plush and trimmed with beaver fur madam my lady bids you right heartily farewell and prays you accept this cloak to lap you at night in your journey with her loving commendations tis of her ladyships own wearing it was considered at that time to add zest to a gift if it had been used by the giver lady louvaine returned a message suited to the gratitude and pleasure which she felt at this timely remembrance and the coach rolled away leaving london behind weel god be wi thee and all thine said charity looking back at the great metropolis and if i neer see thee again itll none break my heart nay nor mine nother added rachel i can tell thee lass im fair fain to get out o th smoke and mire th devil mun dwell i london i do think i doubt it not said hans who heard the remark but he has country houses rachel well said that damsel in a satisfied tone at any rate we shallnt find him at selwick maybe not if the house be empty was hanss reply but he will come in when we do take my word for it yore reet mestur ans said charity gravely four days travelling brought them to the door of the hill house at minster lovel they had had no opportunity of sending word of their coming how amazed aunt joyce will be and rebecca said edith with a happy laugh i reckon theyll have some work to pack us all in answered temperance let be children was the response of lady louvaine the hill house is great enough to hold every one of us and aunt joyces heart is yet bigger for a coach and six to draw up before the door of a country house was then an event which scarcely occurred so often as once a year it was no great wonder therefore if old rebecca looked almost dazed as she opened the door to so large a party we are going home rebecca cried ediths bright familiar voice how fares my aunt eh you dont mean its you mine own dear child cried the old servant lovingly and your ladyship belike well here is a blessed even itll do the mistress all the good in the world well shes very middling my dearvery middling indeed but i think tis rather weariness than any true malady and thatll flee afore the sight of you like snow afore the warm sun well theres a smart few of youall the better my dear all the better you can hang one or two of us up in a tree if you cant find us room said aubrey as he sprang from his saddle theres room enough for such good stuff and plenty to spare answered old rebecca if you was some folks now i might be glad to have the spare chambers full of somewhat elsei might come in every one of you well help you to make ready all we can said rachel as she trudged after rebecca to the kitchen ay we will echoed charity warmer and tenderer yet was the welcome in the credence chamber where aunt joyce lay on her couch looking as though not a day had passed since she bade them farewell she greeted each of them lovingly until aubrey came to her then she said playfully yet meaninglywho is this aunt joyce replied aubrey as he bent down to kiss her shall i say a penitent fool nay my lad was the firm answer a fool is never a penitent nor a penitent a fool the fool hath been let the penitent abide this is our dear kind friend mr marshall joyce said lady louvaine he is so good as to come with us and be our chaplain at selwick and here is his daughter i think mrs joyce can guess said the clergyman that the true meaning of those words is that her lady ship hath been so good as to allow of the same to our much comfort very like you are neither of you over bad said aunt joyce with her kindly yet rather sarcastic smile i am glad to see you mr marshall hitherto we have known each other but on paper is this your daughter why my maid you have a look of the dearest and blessedest woman of all your kindear old cousin bess that we so loved may god make you like her in the heart no less than the face indeed mistress i would say amen with all mine heart answered agnes with a flush of pleasure there was a long discussion the next day upon ways and means which ended in the decision that aubrey and hans faith and temperance with the two maids should go forward to selwick after a few days rest to get things in order lady louvaine edith lettice agnes and mr marshall remaining at minster lovel for some weeks and im as fain as id be of forty shillings said old rebecca to edith eh but the mistress just opens out when youre here like a flower in the sunlight now dont you go to want faith to tarry behind observed temperance addressing the same person the dear old gentlewomen shall be a deal happier without her and her handkerchief it shall do her good to bustle about at selwick as she will if shes mistress for a bit and ill try and see that she does no mischief so far as i can aunt joyce who was the only third person present gave an amused little laugh how long shall she be mistress temperance why till my lady lettice comes said temperance with a rather perplexed look for lady lettice read mrs agnes marshall was the answer of aunt joyce aunt joyce cried edith you never mean dont i but i do mistress batseyes well i never so much as never so much as saw a black cow a yard off didst thou see if it come not true now my maids go not and meddle your fingers in the pie without you wish it not to come true methinks aubrey hath scarce yet read his own heart and agnes is innocent as driven snow of all imagination thereof nevertheless mark my words that agnes marshall shall be the next lady of selwick hall and i wouldnt spoil the pie were i you it shall eat tasty enough if youll but leave it to bake in the oven it were a deal better so than for the lad to fetch home some fine town madam that should trouble herself with his mother and grandmother but as the cuckoo with the young hedgesparrows in his fostermothers nest shes a downright good maid agnes and she is bounden to your mother and yon and so is her father and though if selwick were to turn you forth your home is at minster lovel as my child here knowsand aunt joyce laid her hand lovingly on that of edithyet while we be here in this short wilderness journey tis best not to fall out by the way let things be children god can take better care of his world and his church than you or i can do it eh ill meddle with nought so good responded temperance heartily if the lad come to no worse than that he shall fare uncommon well and better than he deserveth as for the maid im not quite so sure but ill hope for the best the best thing you can do my dear we are saved by hopenot as a man is saved by the rope that pulleth him forth of the sea but rather as he is saved by the light that enableth him to see and grasp it he may find the rope in the dark yet shall he do it more quicklier and with much better comfort in the light hope thou in god have faith in god fear notall those precepts be brethren and one or other of them cometh very oft in scripture for a man cannot hope without some faith and he shall find it hard to hope along with fear faith hope lovethese do abide for ever the party for selwick had set off with some stir in the early morning and the quiet of evening found the friends left at the hill house feeling as those left behind usually doenjoying the calm yet with a sense of want perhaps mr marshall was the least conscious of loss of any of the party for he was supremely happy in the library over the works of bishop jewell in the gallery upstairs lettice and agnes sat in front of the two portraits which had so greatly interested the former on her previous visit and talked about aunt anstace and cousin bess and the blessed sense of relief and thankfulness which pervaded agness heart and lastly in the credence chamber aunt joyce lay on her couch and lady louvaine sat beside her in the great cushioned chair while edith on a low stool at the foot of the couch sat knitting peacefully and glancing lovingly from time to time at those whom she called her two mothers joyce dear lady louvaine was saying tis just sixty years since i came over that sunshine afternoon from the manor house to make acquaintance with thee and anstace sixty years why tis the lifetime of an old man and it looks but like sixty days no doth it was the rejoinder thou and i lettice by reason of strength have come to fourscore years yet is our life but a vapour that vanisheth away i marvel at times how our anstace hath passed her sixty years in heaven what do they there dost thou mind joyce aubreys once saying that we are told mainly what they do not there out of that i take it we may pick what they do there shall be no nightthen there must be eternal light no cursethen must there be everlasting blessedness no tearsthen is there everlasting peace no toilthen is there perpetual rest and comfort go on letticeno sickness therefore perfect health no parting therefore everlasting company and eternal love ay what a blessed forecast who would not give all that he hath but to be sure he should attain it and yet men will fling all away but to buy one poor hours sinful pleasure one pennyworth of foolish delight and howsoeer often they find the latter pall and cloy upon their tongues yet shall they turn to it again with neverresting eagerness as the sow to her wallowing in the mire there is a gentleman dwells a matter of four miles hence with whose wife and daughters i am acquaint and once or twice hath he come with them to visit me he hath got hold of a fancyhow judge youthat man is not a fallen creature indiscreet at times maybe and so forth yet not wholly depraved how man comes by this indiscretion seeing god made him upright he is discreet enough not to reveal dear heart said i but how comes it if so be that man shall sell his eternal birthright for a mess of sorry pottage as over and over again you and i have seen him do call you this but indiscretion methinks you should scarce name it thus if mrs aletheia yonder were to cast away a rich clasp of emeralds for a piece of a broken bottle of green glass if you whipped her not well for such indiscretion i were something astonied well see you he cannot perceive it mans perceptions be fallen along with all else surely and then shall this blind bat reckon poor fool that he could devise out of his disordered imagination a better god than the real wot you what this mr watkinson said to me once when we fell to talking of the sacrifice of isaac oh he could not allow that a loving and perfect god could demand so horrible a sacrifice and another time through christ had we won the right notion of god why said i how know you that are you god that you are able to judge what god should be through christ in very deed have we won to know god but that is by reason of the knowledge and authority of him that revealed him not by the clear discernment and just judgment of us that received that revelation i do tell thee letticewhat with this man o the one side with his philosophical follies and parson turnham on the other with his heathenish fooleries i am at times wellnigh like old elias ready to say now then o lord take me out of this wicked world for i cannot stand it any longer he will take thee dear joyce so soon as thou shalt come to the further end of the last of those good works which he hath prepared for thee to walk in wellthen must edith do my good works for me when our father calls this child in out of the sun and wind and bids her lie down and fall asleep must that child see to it that my gardenplots be kept trim and no evil insects suffered to prey upon the leaves ay my dear heart thou wilt be the lady of the hill house when old aunt joyce is laid beneath the mould may god bless thee in it and it to thee but whensoever the change come i shall be the gainer by it not thou not i indeed said edith in a husky voice as a watch in the night said joyce morrell solemnly as a vapour that vanisheth away what time have we for idle fooleries only time to learn the letters that we shall spell hereafterto form the strokes and loops wherewith we shall write by and bye here we know but the alphabet of either faith or love and how often are we turned back in the very alphabet of patience ay we think much to tarry five minutes for god though he may have waited fifty years for us i reckon it takes god to bear with this poor thing man that even at his best times is ever starting aside like a broken bowgoing astray like a lost sheep thank god that he hath laid on the only man that could bear them the iniquities of us all and that he hath borne them into a land not inhabited where the lord himself can find them no more and let us thank god likewise said lady lettice that our blessed duty is to abide in him and that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming chapter fifteen appendix robert catesby he was a descendant of another infamous catesby sir john the wellknown minister of richard the third satirised in the distich the cat the bat and lovel the dog govern all england under the hog this gentleman fought with his master at bosworth and was beheaded three days after the battle his son george who died in was father of sir richard who died in and who was succeeded by his grandson sir william then aged six years having been born at barcheston in he was perverted by campion in and developed into a famous recusant was cited before the star chamber in chiefly on the confession of campion for being a harbourer of jesuits and a hearer of mass married at ashby th june anne daughter of sir robert throckmorton of coughton warwickshire and died in the eldest of his children four sons and two daughters was robert catesby the conspirator born at lapworth warwickshire in at the age of thirteenfor boys went up to college then at a much earlier age than nowhe matriculated october th at gloucester hall now worcester college oxford a house much suspected many of its undergraduates being privately roman catholics it was probably during his residence in oxford that he became a protestant and his change of religion being evidently of no moral value he also led a dissipated and extravagant life in he married a protestant wife katherine daughter of sir thomas leigh of stoneleigh abbey warwickshire she died before his talents were considerable his will inflexible and he possessed that singular power of attraction inherent in some persons a portrait reputed to be his exists at brockhall near ashby he was very wise writes gerard and of great judgment though his utterance not so good besides he was so liberal and apt to help all sorts as it got him much love he was of person above two yards high and though slender yet as wellproportioned to his height as any man one should see greenway adds that his countenance was singularly noble and expressive his power of influencing others very great in on the death of his grandmother he came into possession of chastleton near chipping norton county oxford where he resided until when in consequence of foolishly joining like many other romanists the insurrection of lord essex he sold chastleton for pounds to pay the fine of pounds imposed on him for treason he had in returned to his original faith in defence of which he was thenceforward very zealous nine days before the death of queen elizabeth catesby undeterred by his past experiences and hungerstarved for innovations joined sir edward baynham and the wrights in a second plot for which he suffered imprisonment the gunpowder plot was his third treasonable venture and to him principally is due the inception of this fearful project though john wright and afterwards thomas winter joined him at a very early stage until easter catesby himself bore all the charge of the mine during the summer he was very busy gathering volunteers arms and ammunition in the country ostensibly for the service of the archduke albrecht in flanders but in reality for the purpose of creating a general commotion at the time of the intended explosion about september he met percy at bath when they agreed to take into the plot two or three moneyed men as their own means were fast failing these were digby and tresham robert winter rookwood and grant followed a little later catesby however never ceased to regret the admission of tresham see tresham in london he had three lodgings a chamber in percys house in holborn apartments in the house of william patrick tailor at the herishe boy in the strand and also in the house of one powell at paddle wharf on the th of october catesby dined at the mighter in bread street with lord mordaunt sir josceline percy and others the lastnamed was a brother of lord northumberland and a frequent visitor of catesby after this he met his servant william pettye in a field called the common garden in london by druerye lane the story of the flight to holbeach is given in the tale and embraces many little details not before in print catesby was only thirtythree years of age at death he left two sons william and robert the latter of whom was with his father in london when the plot was discovered they were subsequently sent in mrs rookwoods coach under charge of a lady not named to their grandmother at ashby robert alone lived to grow up and married one of percys daughters but he left no issue his posterity was cut off and in the generation following their name was blotted out sir everard digby this weak and bigoted young man who was only twentyfour at death had really little part in the gunpowder plot he was the son of everard digby of drystoke county rutland and mary daughter and coheir of francis nele of heythorpe county leicester he was born in and lost his father a romanist in his mother married again to sampson erdeswick of landon county stafford who was a protestant and young digby was brought up in a protestant atmosphere until his majority he was much at court where he was noted for graceful manners and rare parts says greenway and gerard adds that he was very little lower in height than mr catesby but of stronger making skilful in all things that belonged unto a gentleman a good musician and excelled in all gifts of mind he is also described as of goodly personage and of a manly aspect he was always strongly inclined to his fathers religion but did not openly profess it until he reached manhood sir everard married in mary daughter and heir of william mulsho of goathurst county buckingham who survived him and by whom he left a son the famous sir kenelm digby who was little more than two years old at his fathers death if her piteous letter to lord salisbury may be believed lady digby was treated with unnecessary harshness she complains that the sheriff has not left her the worth of one peni belonging to the grounds house or within the walls nor so much as great tables and standing chests that could not be removed without cutting and sawing apeses he permitted the base people to ransack all so much as my closet and left me not any trifle in it he will not let me have so much as a suit of apparel for mr digby the little kenelm nor linens for my present wearing about my bodi she implores to be allowed to retain goathurst her own inheritance during the imprisonment of her husband for whose life she would give hers or would beg during life burghley papers additional manuscript folio guy fawkes guy fawkes whom his horrified contemporaries termed the great devil of all the conspirators but who was simply a singleeyed fanatic owes his reputation chiefly to the fact that he was the one selected to set file to the powder his responsibility was in reality less than that of catesby percy or thomas winter his father edward fawkesin all probability a younger son of the old yorkshire family of fawkes of farnleywas a notary at york and registrar of the consistory court of the minster he could not of course have filled such as office unless he had been a protestant edward fawkes died in and was buried january th in the church of saint michaellebelfry york his widow whose maiden name was edith jackson is said by some to have subsequently married a zealous roman catholic mr denis bainbridge of scotton but sir w wade gives the name of her second husband as one foster within three miles of york she was living at the time of the plot guy who was baptised in saint michaels church april th and educated at the free school in the horse fair did not become a professed papist until he was about sixteen years of age he had a stepbrother of whom no more is known than that he belonged to one of the inns of court in guy was not eight years old when he lost his father who left him no patrimony beyond a small farm worth about pounds per annum he soon ran through this sold the estate and at the age of twentythree went abroad living in flanders for eight years during which time he was present at the taking of calais by the archduke albrecht in he returned to england with the reputation of one ready for any enterprise to further the faith he now entered along with the winters and the wrights into negotiations with spain for a fresh invasion of england which was put a stop to by elizabeths death since the king of spain declined to take up arms against his old ally king james fawkess own statements in his examinations have been proved to consist of such a mass of falsehood that it is scarcely possible to sift out the truth and all that can be done is to accept as fact such portions of his narrative as are either confirmed by other witnesses or seem likely to be true from circumstantial evidence his contradictions of his own previous assertions were perpetual and where confirmation is accessible it sometimes proves the original statement but sometimes and more frequently the contradiction this utter disregard for truth prepares us to discount considerably the description given of fawkes by greenway as a man of great piety of exemplary temperance of mild and cheerful demeanour an enemy of broils and disputes a faithful friend and remarkable for his punctual attendance upon religious observances so far as facts can be sifted from fiction they seem to be that thomas winter who had known fawkes from childhood came to him in flanders to acquaint him with the plot and subsequently introduced him to catesby and percy that fawkes was in the service of anthony browne lord montague about that in the summer of that year when the mine was stopped on account of the prorogation of parliament he went to flanders returning about the st of september during the progress of the mine he served as sentinel passing by the name of john johnson mr percys man and he was the only one of the conspirators allowed to be seen about the house his face being unknown in london he said that he prayed every day that he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the catholic faith and the saving of his own soul fawkes provided the greater part of the gunpowder and stowed it in the cellar as is described in the story his lodging when in london was at the house of mrs herbert a widow at the back of saint clements inn mrs herbert disliked fawkes suspecting him to be a priest on his return from flanders he took up his quarters in the house at westminster where the mine had been and brought in the remainder of the gunpowder at the end of october he went to white webbs whence he was sent to town on the th to make sure of the safety of the cellar and its dangerous contents he returned at night to report all safe but came back to town not later than the rd when he was present at the last meeting of the conspirators but as to the exact day he made three varying statements the circumstances of his arrest are told in the story it is difficult however to reconcile some of the details according to greenway fawkes was taken as he opened the door of the vault according to the official report he was newly come out of the vault while according to fawkes himself when he heard the officers coming to apprehend him he threw the match and touchwood out of the window in his chamber near the parliament house towards the waterwhich can only refer to the room in percys house the one certainty is that he was not apprehended inside the vault he said himself that if this had been the case he would at once have fired the match and have blown up all the lantern now in the bodleian library was found lighted behind the door the watch which percy had sent by keyes was upon the prisoner fawkes originally assumed an appearance of rustic stupidity for sir w wade writes to lord salisbury a little later that he appeareth to be of better understanding and discourse than before either of us conceived him to be additional manuscript folio that fawkes was tortured there can be no doubt from the kings written command and the tacit evidence of fawkess handwriting garnet says he was halfanhour on the rack sir edward hoby that he was never on the rack but only suspended by his arms upright nothing could induce him to betray his companions until he was satisfied that all was known and with a base treachery and falsehood only too common in the statecraft of that day he was deceived into believing them taken before they were discovered lying is wickedness in all circumstances but the prisoners falsehood was based on a worthier motive than the lies which were told to him there was indeed in the fearless courage and unflinching fidelity of guy fawkes the wreck of what might have been a noble man and he certainly was far from being the vulgar ruffian whom he is commonly supposed to have been in person he was tall and dark with brown hair and auburn beard henry garnet if catesby be regarded as the most responsible of the gunpowder conspirators and fawkes as the most courageous garnet may fairly be considered the most astute like the majority of his companions he was a pervert his father brian garnet was a schoolmaster at nottingham and his mothers maiden name was alice jay he was born in educated at winchester college in the protestant faith and was to have passed thence to new college oxford this intention was never carried into effect his romish biographers say because he had imbibed at winchester a distaste to the protestant religion adding that he obtained the rank of captain of the school and by his modesty and urbanity his natural abilities and quickness in learning so recommended himself to the superiors that had he entered at oxford he might safely have calculated on attaining the highest academical honours but he resolved by the grace of god upon embracing the catholic faith although his old professors at winchester stemp and johnson themselves catholic in heart together with another named bilson at first favourable but afterwards hostile to catholicity made every exertion to persuade him to remain unhappily for this rosy narrative the other named bilson afterwards bishop of worcester and winchester has left on record his account of the matter namely that garnet when at winchester was a youth of such incorrigible wickedness that the warden dissuaded his going to the university for the sake of the young men who might there be corrupted by his evil example the reader can accept which version he may see good on leaving school garnet proceeded to london where for about two years he was employed as corrector of the press by the celebrated lawprinter tottel at the end of this time he was received into the church of rome and subsequently travelled abroad first to spain and afterwards to rome where on th september he entered the society of jesus in the jesuit college at rome he studied diligently under bellarmine and others and he was before long made professor of hebrew and licenced to lecture on mathematics in on the recommendation of parsons he was appointed to the jesuit mission to england where he landed on july th it is said that he was so remarkably amiable and gentle that aquaviva the general of the jesuits objected to his appointment on the ground that the post required a man of sterner and more unyielding character bellarmine records that his sanctity of life was incomparable but jesuits are apt to entertain peculiar notions of sanctity as was then usual garnet on coming to his native country adopted a string of aliaseswalley darcy mease roberts parmer and phillips walley however was the name by which he was best known two years after he joined the mission he was promoted to be its superior for some years he lived in the neighbourhood of london following various occupations to disguise his real calling but chiefly that of a horsedealer that he was implicated in the intrigues with spain before the death of elizabeth he never attempted to deny but during the lull in the penal legislation which followed the accession of james garnet purchased a general pardon for all past political offences he was frequently at harrowden the house of lord vaux whose daughter anne travelled everywhere with him passing as his sister mrs perkins about as mr mease a berkshire man he took the house in enfield chase named white webbs for the meetings of the romanists after which he was seldom absent from it for a quarter of a year together examination of james johnson servant in charge of white webbs gunpowder plot book article this house was ostensibly taken for anne vaux and was maintained at her expense her sister eleanor with her husband mr brooksby whose alias was jennings and who is described as of low stature red beard and bald head being often with her catesby was a frequent visitor anne vaux had also a house at wandsworth where she and garnet occasionally resided these details gathered from the evidence of anne vaux herself james johnson and others do not however agree with some statements of gerard he asserts that mrs brooksby was a widow and was the real mistress of the house and he compares the two to the sisters of lazarus the two women who received our lord it is impossible to avoid seeing the tacit further comparison as to garnet when a queens messenger arrived gerard writes rosaries etcetera all signs of piety are thrown into a cavern the mistress is hidden away on these occasions the younger sister the unmarried one passed for the mistress of the house gerard to aquaviva quoted by foley records of the english province of the society of jesus volume page all the evidence apart from this tends to show that brooksby was alive and that he and eleanor were only visitorsthough very constant onesat white webbs where anne was the real mistress in garnet was returned as living with mrs brooksby of leicestershire at arundell house he hath lodgings of his own in london domestic state papers james the first volume article these lodgings were in thames street a large house at erith was also a frequent meetingplace of the recusants that garnet was acquainted with the gunpowder plot from its very beginning is a moral certainty notwithstanding his earnest efforts to show the contrary he not only made assertions which he afterwards allowed to be false but he set up at different times two lines of defence which were inconsistent he had been told nothing yet he had tried to dissuade catesby and his colleagues from the execution of the plot if the first allegation were true the other must have been false but garnets distinctly avowed opinions on the question of equivocation make it impossible to accept any denial from him he believed that while in the common intercourse of life it is not lawful to use equivocation yet where it becomes necessary to an individual for his defence or for avoiding any injustice or loss or for obtaining any important advantage without danger or mischief to any other person there equivocation is lawful he held as some do at the present day that if the law be unjust then is it ipso facto void and of no force so that the laws against recusantsare to be esteemed as no laws by such as steadfastly believe these romish rites to be necessary observances of the true religion that is no treason at all which is made treason by an unjust law in other words the subject is to be the judge of the justice of the law and if in his eyes it be unjust he is released from the necessity of obeying it this is simply to do away with all law at once for probably no law was ever made which did not appear unjust to somebody and it lays down the grand and ancient principle that every man shall do what is right in his own eyes we have heard a good deal of this doctrine lately it is of jesuit origin and a distinct contradiction of that book which teaches that the powers that be are ordained of god and whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god those who set up such claims however they may disavow it really hold that christs kingdom is of this world since they place it in rivalry to the secular authority if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge one great distinction of the antichrist is that he is ho anomos the lawless one even further than this garnet was prepared to go and did go at his last examination in all cases he said where simple equivocation is allowable it is lawful if necessary to confirm it by an oath this i acknowledge to be according to my opinion and the opinion of the schoolmen and our reason is for that in cases of lawful equivocation the speech by equivocation being saved from a lie the same speech may be without perjury confirmed by oath or by any other usual way though it were by receiving the sacrament if just necessity so require domestic state papers james the first volume article garnet asserted that catesby did him much wrong by saying that in queen elizabeths time he had consulted him as to the lawfulness of the powder action which was most untrue but after the preceding extracts who could believe their writer on his oath poor anne vaux who undoubtedly meant to excuse and save him urged that he used to say to the conspirators in her hearing good gentlemen be quiet god will do all for the best and garnets own last confession admitted that partly upon hope of prevention partly for that i would not betray my friend i did not reveal the general knowledge of mr catesbys intention which i had by him domestic state paper volume article he allowed also that about a year before the queens death he had received two briefs from rome bidding him not consent to the accession of any successor to her who would not submit to the pope he had shown them to catesby and then burned them catesby said garnet considered himself authorised to act as he did by these briefs but he had tried vainly to dissuade him from so doing since the pope had forbidden the action ibidem volume articles in september garnet led a pilgrimage of roman catholics to saint winifreds well in returning from which he and anne vaux visited rushton the seat of francis tresham sir thomas his father was then just dead and the widowed lady tresham kept her chamber accordingly they stayed but one night examination of anne vaux gunpowder plot book article and then returned to goathurst where they remained for some weeks until on the th of october they removed with the digbys and brooksbys to coughton the house of mr thomas throckmorton which sir everard had borrowed on account of its convenient proximity to dunchurch the general rendezvous for the conspirators after the execution of the plot this journey to coughton was considered strong evidence against garnet and his meaning has never been solved in writing that all catholics know it was necessary domestic state papers volume article at coughton was the reverend oswald greenway another jesuit priest who has left a narrative of the whole account wherein he describes the conspirators and their doings with a pen dipped in honey in the night between november th and th bates arrived at coughton with digbys letter which afterwards told heavily against garnet garnet remained at coughton until about the th of december when at the instigation of his friend edward hall alias oldcorne he removed to hendlip hall garnet and hall made up between them an elaborate story describing their arrival at hendlip and immediate hiding on sunday night january th but this was afterwards confessed both by hall and owen to be false and garnet was overheard to blame hall for not having kept to the text of his lesson in one detail nicholas owen garnets friend and servant committed suicide in the tower on march nd from fear of further torture mr abington who had voluntarily offered to die at his own gate if any such were to be found in his house or in that sheire was condemned to death but afterwards pardoned on condition of never again quitting the county made wiser by adversity he spent the rest of his life in innocent study of the history and antiquities of worcestershire the remainder of garnets story is given in the tale and is almost pure history as there detailed in his conferences with hall he made no real profession of innocence only perpetual assurances that he trusted to wind himself out of the charges brought against him and when lord salisbury saidmr garnet give me but one argument that you were not consenting to it the plot that can hold in any indifferent mans ear or sense besides your bare negativegarnet made no answer he persistently continued to deny any knowledge of white webbs until confronted with johnson and all acquaintance with the plot before his receipt of digbys letter at coughton until shown the written confession of hall and the testimony of forset and locherson concerning his own whispered admissions when at last he was driven to admit the facts previously denied with abundant oaths he professed himself astonished that the council were scandalised at his reckless falsehoods what should i have done he writes why was i to be denied every lawful means of escape that the government did not deal fairly with garnetthat as is admitted by the impartial dr jardine few men came to their trial under greater disadvantages and that he had been literally surrounded by snaresmay be allowed to the full but when all is said for him that honesty can say no doubt remains that he was early acquainted with and morally responsible for the gunpowder plot the evidence may be found in jardines narrative of the plot to produce it here would be to swell the volume far beyond its present dimensions one point however must not be omitted there have been two raids on the public record office two acts of abstraction and knavery with respect to these gunpowder plot papers and it can be certainly stated from the extracts made from them by dr abbott and archbishop bancroft that the stolen papers were precisely those which proved garnets guilt most conclusively a manuscript letter from dr jardine to mr robert lemon attached to the gunpowder plot book states that mr lemons father had often observed to me that those fellows the jesuits in the time of the powder plot not the gunpowder plot had stolen away some of the most damning proofs against garnet that thievery of some kind abstracted such documents as the treatise of equivocation with garnets handwriting on itthe most important of the interlocutions between garnet and hall in the towerand all the examinations of garnet respecting the popes breves is quite clear the first thievery i have proved to have been made by archbishop laud the others probably occurred in the reigns of charles the second and james the second when jesuits and jesuited persons had free access to the state paper office an old proverb deprecates showing the cat the way to the cream but there is one folly still more reprehensibleplacing the cat in charge of the dairy let us beware it is not done again john grant of this conspirator very little is known apart from the plot his residence was at norbrook a few miles south of warwicka walled and moated house of which nothing remains save a few fragments of massive stone walls and the line of the moat may be distinctly traced while an ancient hall of large dimensions is also apparent among the partitions of a modern farmers kitchen before may he married dorothy winter the sister of two of the conspirators he had been active in the essex insurrection for which he was fined and with his brotherinlaw robert winter he was sent for by catesby in january for the purpose of being initiated into the conspiracy but he was not sworn until march greenway describes him as a man of accomplished manners but of a melancholy and taciturn disposition gerard tells us that he was as fierce as a lion of a very undaunted courage which he was wont to exhibit unto poursuivants and prowling companions when they came to ransack the houseby which dubious expression is probably intended not burglars but officers of the law he paid them so well for their labour not with crowns of gold but with cracked crowns sometimes and with dry blows instead of drink and good cheer that they durst not visit him any more unless they brought great store of help with them mr grant appears to have anticipated some tactics of modern times all else that is known of him will be found in the tale his wife dorothy seems to have been a lady of a cheerful and loquacious character to judge by the accounts of sir e walsh and sir r verney who thought she had no knowledge of the conspiracy gunpowder plot book articles it is however possible that mrs dorothy was as clever as her brothers and contrived to wind herself out of suspicion better than she deserved john grant had at least two brothers walter and francis the latter of whom was apprenticed to a silkman the relationship of ludovic grant is less certain he had also two married sisters mrs bosse and anne wife of his bailiff robert higgins gunpowder plot book articles his mother and then unmarried sister mary were living in robert keyes this man who appears to have been one of the most desperate and unscrupulous of the conspirators was the son of a protestant clergyman in derbyshire who is supposed to have been the reverend edward kay of stavely a younger son of john kay of woodsam yorkshire his name is variously rendered as keyes keis and kay he himself signs robert key his mother was a daughter of sir robert tyrwhitt of kettleby a very opulent roman catholic gentleman of lincolnshire and through her he was cousin of mrs rookwood the opulence of the grandfather did not descend to his grandson whose indigence was a great cause of his desperate character he lived for a time at glatton in huntingdonshire but afterwards entered the service of lord mordaunt as keeper of his house at turvey his wife being the governess of his lordships children he is described as a young man with no hair on his face additional manuscript folio it was about june when keyes was taken into the plot and his chief work thereafter was the charge of the house at lambeth sometimes called catesbys afterwards mr terretts since rookwoods ibidem folio where the powder was stored his only other service was the bringing of the watch from percy to fawkes just before the discovery of the plot keyes left one son robert foleys records volume page who was living about and was then a frequent visitor of his relatives the rookwoods domestic state papers charles the first humphrey and stephen littleton these cousins belonged to the family of the present baron sir john littleton of hagley had with other issue two sons of whom gilbert the eldest was the father of humphrey while sir george littleton of holbeach the third son was the father of stephen humphrey was known as red humphrey to distinguish him from another of his name and one of these two was a university man of broadgate hall oxford where he took his ba degree th january and his ma nd july his cousin stephen was born in with the plot humphrey at least was but partially acquainted for catesby writ to mr humphrey littleton from huddington to meet him at dunchurch but he being then destitute of a horse returned written answer that he could not then meet him in regard of his unfurnishment before remembered whereupon mr robert winter sent a good gelding to mr humphrey littleton whereon he rode away to dunchurch and saith himself demanding of the matter in hand and what it might be mr catesby told him that it was a matter of weight but for the especial good of them all which was all he would then disclose to him harl manuscript the account given in the text from this volume of the escape and wanderings of robert winter and stephen littleton is somewhat varied by another narrative in the same manuscript according to which humphrey bade the officers begone or he would fetch that should send them packing he affirmed in his confession th january that he had intention to apprehend the refugees in regard of the odiousness of their treasons and the horribleness of the offence which this partie in his heart detested and that he deferred doing so out of love to his cousin and affection to their religion until he should be able to obtain counsel of hall ibidem mrs john littleton the lady of hagley park was muriel daughter of sir thomas bromley and a protestant though renowned for her hospitality and benevolence she contrived to pay off pounds of debt left by her fatherinlaw and husband william parker lord monteagle lord monteagle was of very distinguished and ancient race being the eldest son of edward third baron morley of his line heir of a younger branch of the lovels of tichmersh and elizabeth only daughter and heir of william stanley lord monteagle born in he succeeded his mother as lord monteagle and his father in as lord morley his wife was elizabeth daughter of sir thomas tresham and his sister mary was the wife of mr thomas abington of hendlip hall the chief interest attaching to lord monteagle concerns the famous letter and the two questions requiring answer arewho wrote it and was the recipient a party to the plot the second question which may be first dealt with must be answered almost certainly in the affirmative nay more lord monteagle was not only a party to the gunpowder plot but there is strong reason to believe that in conjunction with lord salisbury and others he got up a counterplot for its discovery the laying of the letter before lord salisbury on the night of october th note was probably not the first intimation which salisbury had received and assuredly not the first given to lord monteagle the whole catena of circumstances when carefully studied shows that the episode of the letter was a cleverlydevised countermarch designed at once to inform the public and at the same time to give a warning to the conspirators the party got up at hoxton where lord monteagle was not living the mysterious delivery of the letter the placing of it in the hands of thomas ward a known confidant of the conspirators these and other circumstances all tend to one conclusionthat monteagle was acting a part throughout and that it was in reality he who gave warning to them not they to him if the conspirators had taken his warning they might all have escaped with their lives for the vessel designed to bear fawkes abroad as soon as he should have fired the mine was lying in the river and there was abundant time for them all to have made good their escape had they not foolishly tried to retrieve their loss at dunchurch this is made more certain by the fact that the government were as garnet remarked determined to save lord monteagle and that any reference in the confessions of the prisoners which tended to implicate him was diligently suppressed in one examination the original words ran being demanded what other persons were privy to the plot beside the lord mounteagle catesby etcetera the three words in italics have been rendered illegible by a slip of paper being pasted over them and a memorandum in red ink made on the back time however has faded the red ink and the words are again visible criminal trials page garnet too confessed that catesby showed the popes breves to my lord mounteagle at the time when mr tresham was with him at white webbs additional manuscript folio these facts raise a doubt whether the whole story of treshams anxiety to warn lord monteagle was not false and a mere blind to cover something else which perhaps is not now to be revealed it remains to inquire who wrote the letter it has been ascribed to three persons beside tresham percy mrs abington and anne vaux if it really were a part of the government counterplot as is very probable it was not likely to be any of them if not so tresham seems the most likely though it is customary to charge mrs abington with it lord monteagle would at once have recognised his sisters writing and perhaps that of her intimate friend his wifes cousin anne vaux why percy should be supposed to have written it is a mystery the handwriting is undoubtedly very like that of anne vaux indeed for this reason i suspected her as the writer on the first investigation and before i knew that she had ever been charged with it dr jardine votes decidedly in favour of tresham the real truth respecting this matter will in all probability never be known in this world lord monteagle was in the essex rebellion for which he was fined and imprisoned until the end of but he was in high favour with king james probably owing to his strenuous efforts to secure his succession he died in leaving three sons and three daughters a characteristic letter from this nobleman is yet extant which shows his style and tone and has not i believe been printed it is that summoning catesby to bath and if it were written in rather confirms the supposition that the writer was an accomplice dr jardine and others suppose it i know not why to belong rather to it runs as follows to my loving kinsman rob catesbye esquire give these lipyeat if all creatures born under the moons sphere cannot endure without the elements of aier and fire in what languishment have we led our life since we departed from the dear robin whose conversation gave us such warmth as we needed no other heat to maintain our healths since therefore it is

william mounteagle cott manuscript titus b folio thomas percy the exact place of this conspirator in the northumberland pedigree has been the subject of much question he is commonly said to have been a near relative of the earl but gerard thinks that he was not very near in blood although they called him cousin among the various suggestions offered that appears to be the bestfounded which identifies him not with the percys of scotton but as the son of edward percy of beverley whose father joscelyn was a younger son of the fourth earl the wife of joscelyn was margaret frost the wife of edward and mother of the conspirator was elizabeth daughter of sir thomas waterton of walton yorkshireof the family of the famous naturalist charles waterton of whom it was said that he felt tenderly towards every living thing but twoa poacher and a protestant the character of percy as sketched by one of the jesuit narrators is scarcely consistent with that given by the other greenway writes of him he was about fortysix years of age though from the whiteness of his head he appeared to be older his figure was tall and handsome his eyes large and lively and the expression of his countenance pleasing though grave and notwithstanding the boldness of his mind his manners were gentle and quiet gerard says he had been very wild in his youth more than ordinary and much given to fightingso much so that it was noted in him and in mr john wright that if they heard of any man in the country more valiant than the others one or other of them would pick a quarrel to make trial of his valour he had a great wit and a very good delivery of his mind and so was able to speak as well as most in the things wherein he had experience he was tall and of a very comely face and fashion of age near fifty as i take it for his head and beard was much changed white the proclamation for his apprehension describes him as a tall man with a great broad beard a good face the colour of his beard and head mingled with white hairs but his head more white than his beard he stoupes somewhat in the shoulders well coloured in face longe foted smale legged percy was steward and receiver of rents to his kinsman the earl whose rents he appropriated to the purposes of the plotwithout the owners knowledge if his earnest denial may be trusted percy married martha sister of john and christopher wright by whom he had three children elizabeth who died young and was buried at alnwick nd february a daughter name unknown who married young robert catesby and robert percy of taunton who married emma meade at wivelscomb

second wife dorothy daughter of sir william drury of hawkstead he became eventually the heir of his father ambrose was born in and was educated in flanders as a roman catholic according to greenway he was beloved by all who knew him gerard describes him as very devout of great virtue and valour and very secret he was also of very good parts as for wit and learning he was remarkable for his stud of fine horses coldham hall his family mansion built by his father in is still standing and is a picturesque house about four miles from bury saint edmunds very reluctant at first to join the plot march st when arrested he denied all privity on his soul and conscience and as he was a catholic he was drawn into it by catesby with whom he had long been acquainted and whom he said that he loved and respected as his own life objecting that it was a matter of conscience to take away so much blood catesby replied that he was resolved that in conscience it might be done whereon rookwood being satisfied that in conscience he might do it confessed it neither to any ghostly father nor to any other exam of rookwood gunpowder plot book article sir william wade writes that rookwood can procure no succour from any of his friends in regard of the odiousness of his actions additional manuscript folio he seems to have been fond of fine clothes for he not only had a fair scarf embroidered with ciphres but made a very fair hungarian horsemans cote lyned all with velvet and other apparel exceeding costly not fyt for his degree ibidem folio his wife who was very beautiful and a virtuous catholic was the daughter of robert tyrwhitt esquire of kettleby county lincoln they had three children sir robert rookwood who warmly espoused the cause of charles the first and was buried th june he married mary daughter of sir robert townsend of ludlow and left issue henry and elizabeth wife of william calverley esquire the rookwoods of the golden fish in the story are all fictitious persons the real brother of ambrose was the reverend thomas rookwood of claxton the correspondent of garnet francis tresham sir thomas tresham the father of francis had suffered much in the cause of rome perverted by campion in he was repeatedly imprisoned for recusancy and harbouring jesuits but remained the more resolutely devoted to the faith of which he speaks as his beloved beautiful and graceful rachel for whom his direst adversity seemed but a few days for the love he had to her by his wife muriel daughter of sir robert throckmorton he had two sons of whom francis was the elder he was educated at gloucester hall and having been very actively participant in the rebellion of essex was on his trial extremely insolent to the lord chancellor his life was saved only by the intercession of lady catherine howard whose services were purchased apparently for pounds catesby never ceased to regret the admission of tresham to the conspiracy but if as is probable see ante monteagle lord monteagle were himself a party to the plot the muchvaunted earnestness of tresham to save him is in all probability a fiction and a mere piece of the machinery gerard says that he was of great estate esteemed to be worth pounds a year he had been wild in his youth and even till his end was not known to be of so good example as the rest jardine says he was known to be mean treacherous and unprincipled he vehemently denied however the charge of having sent the warning letter to lord monteagle of which he was always suspected by his brother conspirators catesby and thomas winter had determined to poniard him on the spot if he had shown any hesitation in this denial he escaped the gallows by dying of illness in the tower on the rd of november lord salisbury has been accused of poisoning tresham because he knew too many state secrets but why then did he not poison lord monteagle for the same reason the fact that treshams wife and servant were admitted into his prison and allowed to nurse him till he died is surely sufficient answer by his wife anne daughter of sir john tufton tresham left no issue he showed no remorse but seemed to glory in it as a religious act to

earnest catholic though not as yet generally known to be so he was a wise man and of grave and sober carriage and very stout ie courageous as all of that name have been esteemed he joined the conspirators march st but he like others objected at first to the scandal to the catholic cause and was a halfhearted accomplice to the end he is said to have been terrified by a horrible dream on the night of november th which made him more willing to desert the cause he married gertrude daughter of sir john talbot of the shrewsbury line and of katherine petre by whom he had four childrenjohn who died in leaving issue helen of cooksey died th may mary a nun and catherine died before all the daughters were unmarried thomas winter one of the chief actors in the plot was probably born about and seems to have died a bachelor he may have been the thomas or william wynter apparently of bradgate hall oxford who took his ba degree on th january he had served in the dutch army against spain and quitted it on account of religious scruples but so long afterwards as he is spoken of as captain winter additional manuscript folio after this he was secretary to lord monteagle he was says greenway an accomplished and able man familiarly conversant with several languages the intimate friend and companion of catesby and of great account with the catholic party generally in consequence of his talents for intrigue and his personal acquaintance with ministers of influence in foreign courts gerard adds that his elder brother and another younger were also brought into the action by his means he was a reasonable good scholar and able to talk in many matters of learning but especially in philosophy or histories very well and judicially he could speak both latin italian spanish and french he had been a soldier both in flanders france and i think against the turk and could discourse exceeding well of those matters and was of such a wit and so fine carriage that he was of so pleasing conversation desired much of the better sort but an inseparable friend to mr robert catesby he was of mean stature but strong and comely and very valiant about thirtythree years or more his means were

loving friend thomas wintour john winter the youngest brother seems to have had very little share in the plot and most fervently denied any knowledge of it whatever gerard see ante asserts that he was engaged in it and gertrude winter bore witness that he came to huddington with the other conspirators on november th his own amusing narrative is to the effect that grant asked him on the th of november if he would go to a horserace and he answered that he would if he were well that on the th he went to a little town called rugby where he and others supped and played cards that a messenger came to them and said the gentlemen were at dunchurch and desired their company to be merry that at holbeach he demanded of mr percy and the rest being most of them asleep what they meant to do and they answered that they would go on now and shortly afterwards he left them gunpowder plot book article john winter was imprisoned but released there is no evidence to show that he was married john and christopher wright concerning the parentage of these brothers i can find no more than that they were of the family of wright of plowland in holderness yorkshire they were cousins of robert winter perhaps through his mother were both schoolfellows of guy fawkes and neighbours children john wright originally lived at twigmore in lincolnshire and removed to lapworth in warwickshire when he became a party to the plot he was the first layman whom catesby took into his confidence thomas winter being the second and fawkes the third like so many of the others the brothers were involved in essexs rebellion they were perverts and since their perversion john had been harassed with persecutions and imprisonment greenway says he was one of the best swordsmen of his time gerard describes him as a gentleman of yorkshire not born to any great fortune but lived always in place and company of the better sort in his youth very wild and disposed to fighting he grew to be staid and of good sober carriage after he was catholic and kept house in lincolnshire where he had priests come often both for his spiritual comfort and their own in corporal helps he was about forty years old a strong and a stout man and of a very good wit though slow of speech much loved by mr catesby for his valour and secrecy in carriage of any business of christopher he says that though he were not like him john in face as being fatter and a lightercoloured hair and taller of person yet was he very like to the other in conditions and qualities and both esteemed and tried to be as stout a man as england had and
