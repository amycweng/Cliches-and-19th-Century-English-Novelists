they that know him not see his days from the earliest ages of the world the needsbe of suffering has been a mystery down to the latest it will be a mystery still truly the more we know him the less mystery it is to us for even where we cannot see we can trust his love yet there are human analogies which may throw some faint light on the dark question and one of these will be found in the following pages what i do thou knowest not nowsometimes because it is morally impossibleour finite capacity could not hold it but sometimes too because we could not be trusted with the knowledge in

waiting for the inevitable xiv sybils choice lady sybils choice chapter i guy takes the cross but what are words and what am i an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry tennyson alix says i am a simpleton i dont think it is particularly pleasant sometimes she says i am a perfect simpleton and i cannot say that i like that any better nor do i think that it is very civil in ones sister to put her opinion on record in this certainly perspicuous but not at all complimentary manner still i have heard her say it so many times that i might almost have come to believe it if she did not say so of anybody but me but whenas she did this morningshe says guy is a simpleton that i cannot stand with any patience because there is nobody like guy in all the world he is the best kindest dearest brother that ever a girl had or could have and it is a shame of alix to say such things i am sure of it the brothers in this family are historical persons the sisters fictitious i do not know how it is but alix seems vexed that i should like guy best of all my brothers she says i ought to make companions of amaury and raoul who are nearer me in age but is that any reason for liking people at that rate i ought to love alix least of all because she is furthest off andthough i should not like her to know that i said soi am not at all sure that i dont being like you in character it seems to me is a much better reason for choosing companions than being near you in age and i think guy is much more like me than amaury or raoul either they dont care for the same things that i do and guy does now how can you like a mans company when you can never agree with him alix says my tastesand of course guysare very silly i believe she thinks there is no sense in anything but spinning and cooking and needlework but i think amaury and raoul are quite as foolish as we are amaury admires everything that shines and glitters and he is not at all particular whether it is gold or brass i believe this minute he knows more about samite and damask and velvet than i do you would think the world was coming to an end by the wail he sets up if his cap has a feather less than he intended or the border of his tunic is done in green instead of yellow is that like being a man guillot says amaury should have been a woman but i think he should have stayed a baby then raoul cares for things that bang and clash in his eyes everybody ought to be a soldier and no tale is worth hearing if it be not about a tournament or the taking of a city now i do think guy and i have more sense what we love to hear is of deeds really nobleof men that have saved their city or their country at the risk of their own lives of a mother that has sacrificed herself for her child of a lady who was ready to see her true knight die rather than stain his honour when we were little children at old marguerites knee and she used to tell us tales as a reward when we had been goodand who ever knew half so many stories as dear old margueritewhile raoul always wanted a bloody battle and amaury a royal pageant and alix what she called something practicalwhich so far as i could see meant something that was not interestingand guillot he said something all boys with no girls in itthe stories guy and i liked were just those which our dear old nurse best loved to tell there was the legend of monseigneur saint gideon who drove the heathen saracens out of his country with a mere handful of footsoldiers and that of monseigneur saint david who when he was but a youth fought with the saracen giant count goliath who was forty feet highguillot and raoul used to like that too and of monseigneur saint daniel who on a false accusation was cast to the lions and in the night the holy apostle saint peter appeared to him and commanded the lions not to hurt him and the lions came and licked the feet of monseigneur saint peter the story that amaury liked best of all was about madame esther the queen of persia and how she entreated her royal lord for the lives of certain knights that had been taken prisoners but he always wanted to know exactly what madame esther had on and even i thought that absurd for of course marguerite had to make it up as the legend did not tell and he might have done that for himself raoul best loved the great legend of the wars of troy and how monseigneur achilles dragged monseigneur hector at the wheels of his chariot which i never did like for i could not help thinking of madame the queen his mother and madame his wife who sat in a latticed gallery watching and remembering how their hearts would bleed when they saw it the story guy liked best was of two good knights of greece whose names were sir damon and sir pythias and how they so loved that each was ready and anxious to lay down his life for the other and i think what i best loved to hear was the dear legend of madame saint magdalene and how she followed the blessed steps of our lord wherever he went and was the first to whom he deigned to appear after his resurrection i wish sometimes that i had known my mother i never had any mother but marguerite if she heard me i know she would say ha my damoiselle does not well to leave out the damoiselle alix but i am sure alix was never anything like a mother if she were mothers must be queer people why dont i like alix better surely the only reason is not because she is my halfsister our gracious lord and father was twice marriedfirst to the lady eustacie de chabot who was mother of alix and guillot and guy and amaury and raoul and then she died soon after raoul was born and the year afterwards monseigneur married my mother and i was her only child but that does not hinder my loving guy why should it hinder my loving alix most certainly something does hinder itand some tremendous thing hinders my loving cousin hugues de la marche i hate him marguerite says hush when i say so but hugues is so intensely hateable i am sure she need not he is more like guillot than any other of us but rougher and more boisterous by far i cant bear him and he always says he hates girls and he cant bear me so why should i not hate him o mother mother i wish you had stayed with me somehow i dont think of her as i do of any one who is alive i suppose if she were alive i should call her fair madame and be afraid to move in her presence but being dead seems to bring her nearer i call her mother and many a time i say her pretty gentle name clemencenot aloud but in my thoughts would she have loved me if she had stayed does she love me where she is with god they say she was so gentle and pious i am sure she must be in heaven she stayed only a very little while with us i was not two years old when she died marguerite says she used to carry me up and down the long gallery looking tenderly down at my baby face and call me her darling her dove her precious elaine oh why could i not have heard her to remember it only once there is no need to ask why i feel lonely and desolate and muse on my dead mother as i always do when i am miserable i can never be anything else now that guy is gone monseigneur our gracious lord and father gave consent a month since that guy should take the holy cross and yesterday morning he set forth with a company on his perilous journey was there no one in all the world but my guy to fight for our lords sepulchre and does our lord think so very much about it that he does not care though a maidens heart be broken and her life desolate if she give up her best beloved to defend it well i suppose it is wrong to say that the good god is always good of course and i suppose it is right that guy should put the sepulchre before me he is the true knight to sacrifice himself to duty and i am not the noblehearted damsel if i wish he had done otherwise and i suppose the great tears that fell on that red cross while i was broidering it were displeasing to the good god he ought to have the best oh yes i see that quite clearly and yet i wonder why he wanted my best when he has all the saints and angels round him to do him homage and i had only guy i cannot understand it oh dear i do get so puzzled sometimes i think this is a very perplexing world to live in and it is of no use to say a word to alix because she only calls me a simpleton and that does not explain anything and marguerite says hush my damoiselle would not speak against the good god and neither of them helps me a bit they do not see that i never mean to speak against the good god i only want to understand they do not feel the same sort of want i suppose and so they think it wicked in me to feel it does my mother understand it all must one die to understand and if so why guy would let me ask him such questions i do not know that he saw the answer any better than i did but at least we could agree in feeling them and could try to puzzle the way out but alix appears not even to see what i mean and it is disheartening when one takes the trouble to brace up ones courage to ask such questions from somebody above one of whom one feels ever so little afraid only to be told in reply what the same person had told one a hundred times beforethat one is a simpleton i wish somebody would listen to me if i could have seen a saintsome one who lived in perpetual communion with our lord and knew all things but do saints know all things if so why could not i be a saint myself and then i should know too well i have no doubt of the answer to that question for if i were a saint i must first be a nun and that would mean to go away from home and never never see guy any more oh no that would not do so it is plain i can never be a saint when i come to think about it i doubt if there ever were a saint in our family of course we are one of the oldest families in poitou and indeed i might say in france for count hugues i lived about nine hundred years after our lord and that is nearly as far back as charlemagne and monseigneur has no one above him but our gracious lord the count of poitou who is in his turn a vassal of our suzerain the king of england and he pays homage to the king of france i never did like that and i dont now i cannot see why our king should pay homage to the king of france for his dominions on this side of the sea the french say there were kings in france before there ever were in england well that may be so but i am sure it was not long before and our king is every bit as good as the king of france when raoul wants to tease me he says i am a frenchwoman and i wont be called a frenchwoman i am not a subject of king louis i am a poitevine and a subject of the lord henry king of england and count of poitou to begin with and under him of his son the lord richard who is now our young count and beneath him again of monseigneur my own father who has as much power in his own territory as the king himself this homage exacted by the kings of france was always a sore subject with the kings of england who took every opportunity of evading that personal payment of it which it was the anxiety of the french monarchs to secure coeurdelion it is true monseigneurs territory is not very large but father eudes told us one day when he was giving us our latin lessons that the great emperor of rome monseigneur julius caesar who was such a wonderful man and a great magician used to say that he would rather be the first in a village than the second in imperial rome itself and that is just what i feel i would rather be the damoiselle elaine daughter of monseigneur the count of lusignan than i would be the niece or cousin of the queen of france i do like to be at the top of everything and i would rather be at the top of a little thing than at the bottom of a big one marguerite smiles and shakes her head when i say so to her she says it is pleasanter down at the bottom it makes me laugh to hear her it is natural enough that she should think so as she is only a villein and of course she is at the bottom and it is very well if she likes it i could never bear it but then i am noble and it could not be expected that i should do so though we never had a saint in our house yet as every one knows we sprang from a supernatural source the root of the house of lusignan was the fairy melusine who was the loveliest creature imaginable but half woman and half serpent i do not know when she lived but it must have been ages ago and she built the castle of lusignan by enchantment sometimes on a still summer evening any one who is out alone will catch a glimpse of her bathing in the fountain which stands in the pleasance i would not cross the pleasance after dark on a summer eveningno not to be made a queen i should be frightened to death of seeing the lady melusine for when any one of our line is about to die she is sure to appear so i should think i was going to die if i saw her she comes too when any great calamity is threatening france perhaps i should not be quite sure to die but i would rather not risk it i never did see her the saints be thanked and marguerite says she never did i think she cannot have appeared for a long time about forty years ago before the death of the lady poncette countess of angouleme who was a daughter of our house arlette the mother of our varlet robert thought she saw the lady melusine but it was nearly dark and there were trees between them and arlette is nearsighted so it was not possible to be sure but she says her motherinlaws nieces grandaunt really did see her and no mistake at all about it she was bathing in the fountain and she splashed her long tail about till the maiden almost lost her wits from the fright and the very next year count hugues the good was murdered by the duke of guiennes people which shows plainly that there are such things as ghosts pleasuregrounds the night before guy went awaycan it be two evenings sinceonly twowe crept into the long gallery as we two always do when we want a quiet talk and sat down in that window from which you get the lovely view of the church spire through the trees across the river that is always our favourite window guy was trying to comfort me and i am rather afraid i was crying and he said drawing me up to him and kissing me now my little elaine there have been tears enough for once i am not going to forget thee any more than thou meanest to forget me when i have fought the saracens and taken saladin captive and brought him in chains to jerusalem and the king has made me a count and given me a beautiful lady for my wife and everybody is talking about meof course i knew that was only guys fun he did not really expect all thatthen he went on i will send home for amaury and my little pet and you shall come to me in the holy land monseigneur promised me that thou knowest he said it would be an excellent thing for thee because thou wouldst not only have all thy sins forgiven at the holy sepulchre but very likely i should have the chance of getting a good husband for thee and i have talked well to amaury about taking care of thee on the journey and marguerite must attend thee so look forward to that lynette and dry those red eyes they will be red till thou comest back guy said i with another burst of tears i am sure i hope not he answered laughing they will be very ugly if they are and then how am i to get thee a husband i dont care about one i thank thee said i so that does not signify ah that is because thou art fourteen said guy wait till thou art fourandtwenty there now if i could have been vexed with my own dear guy and just when he was going away for everat least it looks very like for everbut of course i could not but why will meneven the very best of themalways fancy that a girl cares more for a husband than anything else in this world however i let it pass how could i quarrel with guy guy i said dost thou care very much about having a beautiful lady for thy wife guy takes the cross oh certainly replied guy pursing up his lips and pretending to be grave i did not like the idea one bit i felt more inclined to cry till guy came back than ever what will she be like guy i asked trying not to show it she will be the loveliest creature in all the world said guy with eyes as black as sloes and hair like a ravens plumage and so rich that whenever she puts her hand in her pocket thou wilt hear the besants go chink chink against each other wilt thou love her guy i said gulping down my thoughts to distraction replied guy casting up his eyes well i knew all the while it was nonsense but i did feel so miserable i could not tell what to do i know raoul and guillot have a notion that they are only fulfilling the ends of their being by teasing their sisters but it was something so very new for guy but thou wilt not give over loving me guy i wailed and i am sure there were tears in my voice as well as my eyes my dear foolish little lynette said guy half laughing and smoothing my hair dost thou not know me any better than that why i shall be afraid of talking nonsense or sense either if thou must needs take it to heart in that style i felt rather comforted but i did not go on with that there was something else that i wanted to ask guy and it was my last opportunity guy i said softly after a moments pause canst thou remember my mother oh yes darling he said i was eleven years old when she died didst thou love her said i very dearly he answeredquite grave now am i like her guy guy looked down on me and smiled yesand no he said the lady clemence had lighter hair than thou and her smile was very sweet thine eyes are darker too and brighterthere is something of the falcon in them she had the eyes of the dove yet there is a likeness though it is not easy to tell thee what did monseigneur love her very much guy i said more than he ever loved any other i think answered guy he was married to my mother when both were little children as thou knowest is generally the case but he married thine for love andi dont know but i always fancy that is the reason why he has ever been unwilling to have us affianced in infancy when people are married as babies and when they grow up they find that they do not like each other it must be very disagreeable i should think i should think it was just horrible guy said i but alix and guillot were affianced as babies so they were said he but i doubt if guillot ever cared about it why is umberge one to care about i replied there is nothing in her of any sort was alix very sorry guy when her betrothed died how old was she about ten years old he said oh nonot she i do not think she had seen him five times well i said i am very glad that i was not treated in that way so we went on talking i hardly know what we talked about or rather what we did not for it was first one thing and then another as our thoughts led that way i asked guy if he thought that our mothers knew what befel us here on earth and he said he supposed they must for how else could the saints and angels hear us i saw old marguerite at one end of the gallery and i am sure she was come to bid me go to bed but as soon as she caught sight of guy and me talking in the window she made believe to be about something else and slipped away again she knew i wanted to have my talk out with guy the last talk i may ever have with him for years and now it is all over and guy is gone i wonder how he will get on will he do some grand gallant deed and be sent for to the court of the holy land and made a count or a dukeand have all sorts of jewels and riches given him perhaps the queen will put a chaplet of flowers on his head and all the princesses will dance with him and he will be quite a hero but about that beautiful ladyi dont feel at all comfortable about her i cannot tell whether i should love her or hate her if she did not almost worship guy i am sure i should hate her and then there is another side to the picture which i do not like to look at in the least instead of all this guy may get taken prisoner and may languish out twenty years in some saracen dungeonperhaps all his life oh dear dear i dont know what to do and the worst of it is that nothing i can do will make any difference why does the good god let there be any saracens marguerite saysand so does father eudes so it must be truethat god can do everything and that he wants everybody to be a good christian then why does he not make us all good christians that is what i want to know oh i cannot cannot make it out but then they all say hush hush and fie damoiselle as if i had said something very wicked and shocking they say the good god will be very angry why is the good god angry when we want to know i wonder why men and women were ever made at all i wonder why i was made did the good god want me for something that he took the pains to make me oh can nobody tell me why the good god wanted me he must be good for he made all so beautiful and he might have made things ugly but then sometimes he lets such dreadful things happen are there not earthquakes and thunderstorms and why does he let nice people die could notwell i suppose that is wicked no it isnt i may as well say it as think itwould it not have done as well if alix had died and my mother had lived it would have been so much nicer and what difference would it have made in heaveni hope alix would have gone therewhere they have all the angels and all the saints surely they could have spared my motherbetter than i can well i supposeas alix says when she wants one to be quietit is no use talking things are so and i cannot change them and all my tears will not give me guy back i must try to think of the neuvaine which he has promised to offer for me at the holy sepulchre and hope that he wont be taken prisoner and that he will be made a count andwell and try to reconcile myself to that beautiful lady who is to have guy instead of me oh dear me nine days masses now there is another thing that puzzles me every thing puzzles me in this world i wish there had been another to which i could have gone where things would not have puzzled me if god be everywhereas father eudes sayswhy should prayers offered at the holy sepulchre be of more value than prayers offered in my bedchamber i cannot see any reason unless it were that god loves the holy land so very much because he lived and died there that he is oftener there than anywhere else and so there is a better chance of getting him to hear but how then can he be everywhere in using this one of the divine names a mediaeval romanist almost always meant to indicate the second person of the trinity only why will peoplewise people i meannot try to answer such questions marguerite only says hush then my damoiselle alix says oh do be quiet when will you give over being so silly and monseigneur pats me on the head and answers why should my cabbage trouble her pretty little head those are matters for doctors of the schools little one go thou and call the minstrels or bind some smart ribbons in thine hair that is more fit for such maidens as thou do they never want to know and why should the answers be only fit for learned men if the questions keep coming and worrying me if i could once know i should give over wanting to know but how can i give over till i do either the world has got pulled into a knot or else i have and so far from being able to undo me nobody seems to see that i am on a knot at all if you please damoiselle the damoiselle alix wishes to know where your nobleness put the maccaroons oh dear heloise i forgot to make them can she not do without them if you please damoiselle your noble sister says that the lady umberge will be here for the spice this afternoon and your excellence is aware that she likes maccaroons yes i ambetter than i like her i never did see anybody eat so many at once as she does she will do for once with cheesecakes i would not mind staying up all night to make maccaroons for guy but i am sure cheesecakes are good enough for umberge and alix does make good cheesecakesi will give her that scrap of praise well heloisei dont know i really think we should do but i supposeis there time to make them now if you please damoiselle it is three oclock by the sundial then it is too late and i thought but of course i did not say to heloisehow alix will scold i heard her step on the stairs and i fairly ran but i did not lose my lecture elaine cried alixs shrill voice where are you alix might be a perfect stranger for the way in which she always calls me you i came out i knew it was utterly useless to try to hide where have you put those new maccaroons they are not made alix i said trying to look as if i did not care not made saint martin of tours help us what can you have been doing i was silent i say what were you doing demanded alix with a stamp of her foot never mind i forgot the maccaroons if i had been speaking to any one but alix i should have added that i was sorry but she is always so angry that it seems to dry up any regret on my part you naughty girl alix blazed out you very very naughty girl there is no possibility of relying on you for one instant you go dreaming away and forget everything one tells you you are silly silly the tone that alix put into that last word it was enough to provoke all the saints in the calendar there will be plenty without them said i hold your tongue and dont give me any impudence retorted alix i thought i might have said the same if alix would speak more kindly i am sure i should not get so vexed i cant imagine what she would say if i were to do something really wicked for she exhausts her whole vocabulary on my gathering the wrong flowers or forgetting to make cakes dont be cross alix i said trying to keep the peace i really did forget them oh dear yes i never doubted it answered alix in that way of hers which always tries my patience life is sacred to the memory of guy but my trouble and umberges likings are of no consequence at all and it does not matter that the baron de montbeillard and his lady will be here and that we shall have a dish too little on the table not in the least well really alix i dont think it does much matter said i of course not and the lady de montbeillard will not go home and tell everybody what a bad housekeeper i am and how little i care to have things nice for my guestsoh dear no if you treat her kindly i should think her very ungrateful if she did said i alix flounced away withi wish you were gone after guy and so did i but at night just before i dropped asleep a new idea came to mean idea that never occurred to me before do i try alix as much as she tries me oh dear i hope not it cannot be i dont think it is possible is it i wish i had not forgotten those cakes alix did seem so put out and i suppose it was rather annoyingperhaps i did not like her saying that i was not to be trusted i dont think that was fair and i cannot bear injustice still i did forget the cakes and if she had trusted me it was only reasonable that she should feel disappointed but she did not need to have been so angry and have said such disagreeable things well i suppose i was angry too but i show my anger in a different way from alix i do not know which of us was more wrong i think it was alix yes i am sure it was she treats me abominably it is enough to make anybody angry those limes seem to come up and look reproachfully at me when i say that i was not at all wellit might be three years ago rather feverish and very cross and two travelling pedlars came to the castle gate one sold rare and costly fruits and the other silken stuffs now i know that alix had been saving up her money for a goldcoloured ribbon for which she had a great fancy and there was a lovely one in that pedlars stockin fact i have never since seen one quite so pretty alix had just enough to buy it she could not get any more because the treasurer was away with monseigneur at the hawking but she saw my wistful glances at the limes in the other pedlars panniers and she bought some for me they were delicious but alix went without her goldcoloured ribbon she had no other chance of it for the pedlar was on his way to the great whitsuntide fair at poictiers and he would not stay even one night at the period of this story shops were nearly unknown except in the largest towns country familiesnoble gentle or peasanthad to rely on laying in a stock of goods at the great fairs held at easter whitsuntide michaelmas and christmas and for anything wanted between those periods recourse was had to travelling pedlars who also served as carriers and postmen when occasion demanded it i wonder if it be possible that alix really loves mejust one little bit and i wonder if we could give over rasping one another as we do it would be very difficult but if i ever do follow guy i will bring back from byzantium or damascus something beautiful for alix to make up for that gold ribbon it was good of her and i do wish i had remembered those maccaroons chapter ii two surprises for elaine i feel within me a mind above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience shakspere i should like to know if i could find out what it is that makes alix have such a fancy for lady isabeau de montbeillard i think she is just abominable she finishes off every sentence with a little crackling laugh which it drives me wild to hear it makes no difference what it is about whether it be dear damoiselle how kind you are or do you not think my lord looks but poorly they all end up with ha ha ha sometimes i feel as though i could shake her like lovel does the rats if lady isabeau were like alix in her ways i would understand it better but they are totally unlike and yet they seem to have a fancy for each other as for the baron i dont care a bit about him any way he is like umberge in that respectthere is nothing in him either to like or dislike and if there can be still less of anything than in him i think it is in his brother messire raymond who sits with his mouth a little open staring at one as if one were a curiosity in a show alix told me this morning that i was too censorious i am afraid that last sentence looks rather like it perhaps i had better stop the baron and his lady went with us to the hawking and so did messire raymond but he never caught so much as a sparrow then after we came back i had to try on my new dress which marguerite had just finished it really is a beauty the undertunic is of crimson velvet the supertunic of blue samite embroidered in silver the mantle of reddish tawny with a rich border of gold i shall wear my blue kerchief with it which monseigneur gave me last new years day and my golden girdle studded with sapphires the sleeves are the narrowest i have yet had for the lady de montbeillard told alix that last time she was at the court the sleeves were much tighter at the wrist than they used to be and she thinks in another twenty years or so the pocketing sleeve may be quite out of fashion it would be odd if sleeves were to be made the same width all the way down but the lady de montbeillard saw queen marguerite when she was at poictiers and she says that the queen wore a tunic of the most beautiful pale green and her sleeves were the closest worn by any lady there one of the most uncomely and inconvenient vagaries of fashion the sleeve was moderately tight from shoulder to elbow and just below the elbow it went off in a wide pendant sweep reaching almost to the knee the pendant part was used as a pocket daughter of louis vii king of france and constanca of castilla wife of henry eldest son of henry ii of england her husband was crowned during his fathers life and by our mediaeval chroniclers is always styled henry the third i wish i were a queen it is not because i think it would be grand but because queens and princesses wear their coronets over their kerchiefs instead of under and it is such a piece of business to fasten ones kerchief every morning with the coronet underneath marguerite has less trouble than i have with it as she has nothing to fasten but the kerchief and if it is not done to perfection i am sure to hear of it from alix when marguerite was braiding my hair this morning i asked her if she knew why she was made she was ready enough with her answer to serve you damoiselle without doubt and why was i made dost thou think marguerite to be served by theeor to serve some one else of course while the damoiselle is young and at home she will serve monseigneur then when the cavalier comes who pleases monseigneur and the good god he will serve the damoiselle and afterwardsit is the duty of a good wife to serve her lord and of course all nobles and villeins must serve the good god well thou hast settled it easier than i could do it said i but margot dost thou never become tired of all this serving not now damoiselle what dost thou mean by that ah there was a time said marguerite and i thought a blush burned on her dear old face when i was a young silly maiden and very very foolish damoiselle dost thou think all maidens silly margot very few wise damoiselle my foolish head was full of envious thoughts i know thatvain wishes that i had been born a noble lady instead of a villein maiden i thought scorn to serve and would fain have been born to rule how very funny said i i never knew villeins had any notions of that sort i thought they were quite content is the noble damoiselle always quite content pardon me why no said i but then margot i am noble and nobles may rightfully aspire villeins ought to be satisfied with the lot which the good god has marked out for them and with the honour of serving a noble house ha damoiselle the damoiselle has used a deep strong word satisfy i believe nothing will satisfy any living heart of man or womanexcept that one thing what one thing i am an ignorant villein my damoiselle i do not know the holy latin tongue as ladies do but now and then father eudes will render some words of the blessed evangel into french in his sermon and he did so that daywhen i was satisfied what was it that satisfied thee then margot they were words father eudes said of the good god himself when he walked on middle earth among us men come unto me he said all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest but i do not understand marguerite how did those words satisfy thee the words did not damoiselle but the thing did i just took the blessed lord at his word and went to him and thanks be to his holy name he gave me rest what dost thou mean margot will the dear damoiselle not come and try she will want rest some day had i not better wait till i am tired said i laughingly ah yes we never want rest till we are tiredbut not wait to come to the merciful lord oh no no nay i cannot comprehend thee margot no my damoiselle she is not likely to know how to come until she wants to do it when she does want it the good god will hear the damoiselle for he heard her servant didst thou entreat the intercession of saint marguerite ah no i am but an ignorant old woman the dear lord said come unto me and i thought perhaps he meant it so i just went but how couldst thou margot if it please my damoiselle i did it and if he had been angry i suppose he would not have heard me but how dost thou know he did hear thee when the damoiselle entreats monseigneur to give her a silver mark and he opens his purse and gives it is it possible for her to doubt that he has heard her the good god must have heard me because he gave me rest i do not understand margot what thou meanest by rest and i want to know all about it have things given over puzzling thee is there some light come upon them it seems to me damoiselle if i be not too bold in speaking my poor thoughts go on said i i want to know them then my damoiselle it seems to me that there are two great lights in which we may see every thing in this world the first is a fierce light like the sun but it blinds and dazzles us the holy angels perchance can bear it for it streams from the throne of god and they stand before that throne but we cannot our mortal eyes must be hidden in that dread and unapproachable light and if i mistake not it is by this light that the damoiselle has hitherto tried to see things and no wonder that her eyes are dazzled but the other light soothes and enlightens it is soft and clear like the moonlight and it streams from the cross of calvary there the good god paid down in the red gold of his own blood the price of our redemption it must have been because he thought it worth while and if he paid such a price for a poor villein woman like me he must have wanted me the damoiselle would not cast a pearl into the vienne for which she had paid a thousand crowns and if he cared enough about me to give his life for me then he must care enough to be concerned about my welfare in this lower world the damoiselle would not refuse a cup of water to him to whom she was willing to give a precious gem herein lies rest what the good god who thus loves me wills for me i will for myself also but marguerite it might be something that would break thine heart would the blessed lord not know that but i do not think he breaks hearts that are willing to be his he melts them it is the hearts that harden themselves like a rock which have to be broken but thou wouldst not like something which hurt thee not enjoy itno no did the damoiselle enjoy the verdigris plaster which the apothecary put on her when she was ill three years ago yet she did not think him her enemy but her friend ah the good god has his medicinechest and it holds smarting plasters and bitter drugs but they are better than to be ill damoiselle marguerite i had no idea thou wert such a philosopher ah the noble damoiselle is pleased to laugh at her servant who does not know what that hard word means no there is nothing old marguerite knows only how to come to the blessed lord and ask him for rest he gave the rest and he knew how to do it i wonder if old marguerite is not the truest philosopher of us all it is evident that things do not puzzle her just because she lets them alone and leaves them with god still that is not knowing and i want to know oh i wish i could tell if it is wicked to want to know i wonder if the truth be that there are things which we cannot knowthings which the good god does not tell us not because he wishes us to be ignorant but because he could not possibly make us comprehend them but then why did he not make us wiseror why does he let questions perplex us to which we can find no answer i think it must be that he does not wish us to find the answer and why i will see what idea marguerite has about that she seems to get hold of wise notions in some unintelligible way for of course she is only a villein and cannot have as much sense as a noble there was that tiresome messire raymond in the hall when i went down he is noble enough for his mothers mother was a princess of the carlovingian blood but i am sure he has no more sense than he needs the way in which he says ah when i tell him anything just exasperates me the baron his brother is a shade better though he will never wear a laurel crown still he does not say ah a descendant of charlemagne the prize of intellect i dont like younger brothers in fact i dont think i like men of any sort except guy of courseand monseigneur but then other men are not like them guillot and amaury and raoul rank with the other men i wonder if women are very much better i dont think they are if i am to look upon alix and the lady de montbeillard as samples oh dear i wonder why i hate people so it must be because they are hateful does anybody think me hateful how queer it would be if they did i really do feel tonight as if i did not know whether i was standing on my feet or on my head i cannot realise it one bit alix going to be married alix going away from the castle and iito be the only mistress there monseigneur called me down into the hall as i stood picking the dead leaves from my rosebushes for a potpourri there was no one in the hall but himself well of course there were a quantity of servitors and retainers but they never count for anything i mean there was nobody that is anybody he bade me come up to him and he drew me close kissed me on the forehead and stroked down my hair what will my cabbage say to what i have to tell her said he is it something pleasant monseigneur said i now there thou posest me he answered yesin one light noin another and in which of the two lights thou wilt see it i do not yet know i looked up into his face and waited dost thou like messire raymond de montbeillard no monseigneur i answered no ha then perchance thou wilt not like my news messire raymond has something to do with it every thing well said i i am afraid rather saucily so long as he does not want to marry me i do not much care what he does monseigneur pinched my ear kissed me and seemed extremely amused thee no no not just yet my little cabbage not just yet but suppose he wanted to marry alix does he want to marry alix he does and under your good leave monseigneur well yes i see no good reason to the contrary my little cat he is a brave knight and has a fine castle and is a real carlovingian throughout france in the middle ages the carlovingian blood was rated at an extravagant value he is a donkey said i real too ha hush then replied monseigneur yet laughing and patting my cheek well wellperhaps not overburdened with brainshow sharp thou art child to be sure no want of brains in that direction but a good worthy man my cabbage and a stalwart knight and when is it to be monseigneur i asked in a hurry to see the fine dresses demanded my gracious lord and laughed again nay i think not till after christmas time enough then i am in no hurry to lose my housekeeper canst thou keep house my rabbitha ha will there be anything for dinner ha ha ha ha i was half frightened and yet half delighted of course i thought if alix goes away umberge will come and reign here nobody is likely to think me old enough or good enough under your nobilitys good leave i will see to that said i monseigneur answered by a peal of laughter ha ha ha showing her talons is she wants to rule my cabbagedoes she a true woman on my troth ha ha ha if it please you monseigneur why should you come short of dinner because i see about it my gracious lord laughed more than ever no reason at all my little rabbitno reason at all try thy hand by all meansby all means so umberge does not need to come ha ha ha ha certainly not for me said i rather piqued seriously my little cat said he and his face grew grave wouldst thou rather umberge did not come art thou not friends with her oh as to friends soso lala said i but i think i should get along quite as well without her middling but wouldst thou not weary for a womans company i never weary for any company but guys i answered and i think the tears came into my eyes is it still guy said he smiling but very kindly now always guy well well when the time comesi promised the boy thou shouldst go out to him we must wait till he writes to say he is ready to receive thee so guy stands first does he i nodded for my heart was too full to speak he patted my head again and let me go but i thought he looked a little troubled and i could not tell why when i came to undress the same evening i asked marguerite if she had heard the news the damoiselle alix was so gracious as to inform me said she dost thou like it margot ha my damoiselle what does it matter what a villein old woman likes it matters to me or i should not have asked thee said i i trust it will be for the noble damoiselles welfare said she and i could get her to say no more now margot tell me something else said i why does the good god not make all things clear to everybody what sayest thou he has not told me why damoiselle perhaps to teach my damoiselle to trust him there could be no trust if we always knew but is not knowing better than trusting i replied is it responded marguerite does monseigneur always take my damoiselle into his secrets and never require her to trust him god is the great king of all the world kings always have secret matters surely the king of kings must have his state secrets too this seemed putting it on a new footing i sat and considered the matter while marguerite took off my dove cote and unbound my hair the rich network which confined the hair often of gold and precious stones still i dont see why we may not know everything i said at last does my damoiselle remember what stood in the midst of the beautiful garden of god wherein adam and eva were put to dwell the tree of knowledge said i true but that does not help me to the why why might adam and eva not eat it will my damoiselle pardon me i think it does help to the why but not to the why of the whywhich is what she always wants to see why adam and eva might not eat it i suppose was because the good god forbade it but why margueritewhy ha i am not the good god i do not see it one bit said i surely knowledge is a good thing knowledge of good aywhich is knowledge of god the good lord never forbids us that he commands it but let me entreat my damoiselle to remember that this was the tree of knowledge of good and evil that we should know evil cannot be good i do not understand why the good god ever let satan be at all said i and i do not see how satan came to be satan to begin with the blessed lord knows all about it said marguerite when my damoiselle was a little child i am sure she did not understand why we gave her bitter medicines but the apothecary knew can my damoiselle not leave all her questions with the good lord i want them answered margot i cried impatiently if i knew that i should understand when i am dead i would not so much mind waiting but i dont know any thing and i dont like it well i do not know even that much she replied it may be so i cannot tell but the good lord knowsand he loves me how knowest thou that marguerite people dont die for a man damoiselle unless they love him very much indeed but how dost thou know that it was for thee it was for sinners and i am one but not for all sinners margot a great many sinners will go to perdition father eudes says how canst thou tell if thou art one of them or not ah that did perplex me at first but one day father eudes read out of the holy gospel that all who believed in our lord should have life eternal so that settled it the sinners that are lost must be those who do not believe in our lord marguerite dont we all believe in him let the damoiselle forgive me if i speak foolishly but there are two brothers among the varlets in the hallphilippe and robert now i quite believe that they both exist i know a good deal about them i know their father and mother pierrot and arlette and i know that philippe has a large nose and black hair and he is fond of porpoise while robert has brown hair and limps a little and he likes quinces yet if i wanted to send a crown to my niece perette i should feel quite satisfied that robert would carry it straight to her while i should not dare to give it to philippe lest he should go to the next cabaret and spend it in wine now dont i believe in robert in a very different way from that in which i believe in philippe why thou meanest that robert may be trusted but philippe cannot be said i but what has it to do with the matter let the damoiselle think a moment does she simply believe that the good god is or does she trust him trust himwith what said i with yourself my damoiselle with myself i exclaimed nay margot what dost thou mean now how does the damoiselle trust monseigneur has she any care lest he should fail to provide her with food and clothing suitable to her rank does it not seem to her a matter of course that so long as he lives he will always love her and care for her and never forget nor neglect her has she ever lain awake at night fretting over the idea that monseigneur might give over providing for her or being concerned about her welfare what a ridiculous notion i cried why margot i simply could not do it he is my father and what does my damoiselle read in the holy psalter is it not like as a father pitieth his children even so the lord pitieth them that fear him is he not our father yes of course we expect the good god to take care of us i replied but then margot it is a different thing and thou knowest he does not always take care of us in that way he lets all sorts of things happen to hurt and grieve us then when my damoiselle is ill and monseigneur sends off in hot haste for messire denys to come and bleed her in the foot he is not taking care of her it hurts her i think oh that has to be margot as thou saidst it is better than being ill andlet my damoiselle bear with her servantis there no must be with the good god but i dont see why margot he could make us well all in a minute monseigneur cannot yet suppose it is better that my damoiselle should not be made well all in a minute but should learn by suffering to be patient in sickness and thankful for her usual good health did not monseigneur saint david say it is good for me that i have been afflicted oh what a queer idea said i is it quietly answered marguerite i once heard a young noble lady say about three years ago that it was so delightful to feel well again after being ill that it really was worth while going through the pain to reach it and i thinkif i may be pardoned the allusioni think they called her the damoiselle elaine de lusignan i could not help laughing well i dare say i did say something like it but margot it is only when i am getting well that i think so when i am well to begin with i dont want to go through the pain again when my damoiselle is truly well of the mortal disease of sin she will never need to go through the pain again but that will not be till the sin and the body are laid down together till we diedost thou mean that till we die o margot dont i hate to think of dying yes it is pleasanter to think of living they are well for whom all the dying comes first and the life is hereafter well i suppose i shall be all right said i jumping into bed monseigneur pays my church dues and i hear the holy mass sung every day i say my prayers night and morning and in all my life i never was so wicked as to touch meat on a fastday i think on the whole i am a very good girl will my damoiselle be angry if i ask her whether the good lord thinks the same o marguerite how can i know because if father eudes read it right we do know there is none that doeth good no not one margot how thou must listen to father eudes i hear him mumbling away but i never bother my head with what he is saying he has got to say it and i have got to sit there till he has done that is all i amuse myself in all sorts of wayscount the bits of glass in the window or watch the effect of the crimson and blue light creeping over the stalls and pillars or think how saint agatha would look in a green robe instead of a purple one what makes thee listen to all the stuff he says my damoiselle sees thatsaving her presencei am a little like her i want to know but father eudes never tells us anything worth knowing surely ha pardon me my damoiselle he reads the true words of the good god from the holy evangels commonly they are in the holy latin tongue and then i can only stand and listen reverently to the strange sounds the good god understands not i but now and then i suppose the blessed lord whispers to father eudes to put it into french for a moment and that is what i am listening for all the time then i treasure the words up like some costly gem and say them to myself a hundred times over so that i may never forget them any more oh it is a glad day for me when father eudes says those dear words in french but how thou dost care about it margot i suppose thou hast so few things to think of and delight ini have more to occupy me ah my damoiselle the blessed lord said that his good word was choked up and brought no fruit when the cares of other things entered into the heart no i have not much to think of but my work andthree graves in a village churchyard and oneand i have not much to delight in save the words of the blessed lord yetlet my damoiselle bear with mei am better off than she o margot and i laughed till the tears came into my eyes it was so excessively absurd marguerite took up the lamp may the good god and his angels watch over my sweet damoiselle she said and then she tucked the silken coverlet round me and put out the lamp that the light should not keep me awake and quietly undressed herself and got into the trundlebed and i was asleep almost before she lay down but oh dear how ridiculous marguerite better off than i am there is no harm in her fancying it dear old thing but the comicality of the idea why i dress in velvet and diaper and she in unshorn wool and i lie on a featherbed under fustian blankets and satin coverlets and she sleeps on straw with a woollen rug over her and i ride and hawk and sing and dance and embroiderand she is hard at all sorts of rough work from morning to night why she cannot wear a jewel nor a bit of gold nor have any sort of pleasure except singing and dancing and she is too old for both of course such things as nobles amuse themselves with are not fit for villeins but that a villein should fancy for a moment that she is better off than a nobleoh it is too absurd for any thing well reallybetter off than i am chapter iii all is not gold that glitters all things that can satisfy having jesus those have i so all is over and alix is really gone it was a grand wedding the bride was in blue velvet embroidered in gold with golden girdle fermail and aumoniere her mantle was of goldcoloured satin and her undertunic of black damask i thought she chose her colours with very good taste more than alix generally does but one should look nice on ones weddingday if one ever is to do and she did look nice in her gemmed coronal and no hood and all her hair flowing over her shoulders as for messire raymond i nearly went into fits when i caught sight of him the creature had dressed himself in a yellow tunic with a brickred supertunic and fleshcoloured hose then he had green boots striped in gold and a skyblue mantle studded with golden stars raoul said he must fancy that he was jupiter since he had clad himself with the firmament but amaury replied that with all that flamecolour he must be vulcan if he were a pagan deity of any kind father eudes sang the mass and father gilbert the lord of montbeillards chaplain gave the nuptial benediction i was dressed in pale green and dark violet and lady isabeau in rosecoloured satin brooch the costume restricted to brides or to queens at their coronation then came the weddingfeast in the great hall for which alix and i had been preparing a week beforehand and after all i am certain heloise forgot to put any more sugar in the placentae and then the hall was cleared and we danced till suppertime then after supper the minstrels played and lady isabeau and i with all the other ladies there went up and put the bride to bed and after throwing the stocking and all the other ceremoniesand i am glad to say it did not hit me but that ugly elise de la puissayewe came back into the hall and danced again till it was time to take up the posset oh i was tired when i did get to bed at last i should not like to be at another wedding next week cheesecakes the girl hit by the stocking was expected to be married next this serving of a posset to the newlymarried pair in the night was a purely french custom well it really is a very good thing that alix is gone i have had some peace these last two days and there if the very last thing she did before going was not to do me an ill turn she went and persuaded monseigneur to invite umberge to come and take the reins oh of course i could not be expected to understand anythingwhat sort of a compliment was that to her teachingi was a mere baby full of nonsenseand all on in that way and when monseigneur was so good as to say that i did not like the idea of umberges coming and he thought he would try what i could do alix fairly laughed in his face as if i were fit to decidethe baby that i wasshe said thank you very much dame alix de montbeillard perhaps i have more sense than you suppose at any rate i am very glad of one thingthat we have got rid of you oh dear i wonder whether any body ever thinks that it would be nice to get rid of me but then i am not disagreeable like alix i am sure i am not now why is it that when one gets something one has been wishing for a long while one does not feel satisfied with it i have been fancying for months how pleasant it would be when alix was gone and there would be no one to find fault with me yet it is not pleasant at all i thought it would be peaceful and it is dull and only this afternoon raoul was as cross with me as he could be monseigneur took my part as he well might because of course i was right but still it was disagreeable why dont i feel more happy i thought i would see what marguerite would say and i asked her what she thought about it she only smiled and saidsuch is the way of the world my damoiselle since men forsook the peaceful paths of god but why do things look so much more delightful beforehand than when they come said i the damoiselle has a vivid fancy does she never find that things look more unpleasant at a distance well i dont knowperhaps sometimes i said but disagreeable things are always disagreeable i suppose something in my face made marguerite answer is the coming of the lady umberge disagreeable to my damoiselle oh as to that i dont care much about it said i but i do want to hear from guy ay that is coming to be the cry in my heart now i want to hear from guy i want to know where he is and what he is doing and whether he is made a count yet andoh dear dearwhether that dreadful beautiful lady whom he is to like so much better than me has appeared that could not happen to me i could never love any body better than guy i should so like a confidante of my own rank and age umberge would never do at all and she is quite fifteen years older than i am if i had had a sister a year older or younger than myself that would have been about the right thing nobody ever was my confidante except guy and i wander about his chamber very much as level does and feel i should imagine very much like him when he holds up one paw and looks up at me and plainly says with his dogfacewhere is heand is he never coming back and i can only put my cheek down on his great soft head and stroke his velvet ears and feel with him for i know so little more than he does it must be dreadful for dogs if they want to know here is umberge at last she came last night and guillot with her and valence and aline they are nice playthings or would be if i might have my own way buti cannot quite understand itthe umberge who has come to live here seems quite a different woman from the umberge who used to come for an afternoon she used to kiss me and call me darling and praise my maccaroons but this umberge has kept me running about the house all morning while she sits in a curule chair with a bit of embroidery and says young feet do not tire and you know where everything is and you are accustomed to the maids it looks as if she thought i was a superior sort of maid then when our gracious lord comes in she is all velvet and dear elaines me and tells him i am such a sweet creatureready to run about and do any thing for any body if there is one thing i do despise it is that sort of woman alix never served me like that she was sharp but she was honest if monseigneur praised the placentae she always told him when i had made them and would not take praise for what was not her work i shall never be able to get along with umberge if this morning is to be a specimen of every day oh dear i wish alix had not gone and i wish i wish we could hear from guy things do not go on as smoothly as they used to do i think monseigneur himself sees it now umberge is not fond of trouble and instead of superintending every thing as alix did always seeing after the maids up early and down late she just takes her ease and expects things to go right without any trouble on her part why she never rises in the morning before six and she spends a couple of hours in dressing it is no good to tell her of any thing that is wanted for she seems to expect every thing to mend itself yesterday morning one of the jacinths dropped out of the sheet on my bed and i told umbergealix was always particular about any thing of that kind being reported to her directlybut she only said indeed well i suppose you can sleep as well without it but it was last night that monseigneur seemed vexed we had guests to supper and i am sure i did my best to have things nice but every thing seemed to go wrong umberge apparently thought the supper would order itself in the first place and cook itself in the second for beyond telling me to see that all was right she took no care about it at all but sat embroidering the diningroom was only just ready in time and the minstrels were half an hour behind time the pastry was overbaked and the bread quite cold there was no subtlety with the third course and the fresh rushes would have been forgotten if i had not asked robert about them i was vexed for alix was there herself and i knew what she would thinkto say nothing of the other guests i do think it is too bad of umberge to leave me all the cares and responsibilities of mistress while she calmly appropriates the position and the credit and then scolds me if every thing is not perfection why i must go and dress some time and was it my fault if denise left the pies in too long while i was dressing or did not attend to my order to have the bread hot at the last minute i cannot be every where how jewels were set in linen sheets is a mystery but there is abundant evidence of the fact ornamental centrepiece it was considered of consequence that the bread at a feast should be as new as possible my gracious lord did not blame me he asked umberge and me together how it happened that all these things were wrong and i declare if umberge did not say elaine had the ordering of it monseigneur will please to ask her i am afraid i lost my temper for i said yes monseigneur i had the ordering of it for my fair sister took no care of any thing and if i could have had three pairs of hands and been in six places at once perhaps things might have been right monseigneur only laughed and patted my head but this evening i heard him say to guillot just as i was entering the hall fair son thy fair wife puts too much on the child elaine guillot laughed rubbed his forehead and answeredfair father it will take more than me to stop her what canst thou not rule thine own wife demanded our gracious lord never tried monseigneur said guillot too late to begin and monseigneur only said with a sighi wonder when we shall hear from guy guillot looked relieved and seeing me i think they went on to talk of something else but everything seems changed since they came except for my gracious lord and amaury and raoul it does not feel like home alix rode over this afternoon i took her to my bower in the turret and almost directly she asked mehow do you get on with our fair sister and i saido alix i wish thou wouldst come back she laughed and repliedwhat would my lord say child i thought you were not very comfortable what made thee think so alix was it tuesday night tuesday nightthe supper i guessed you had seen to it whywas it so very bad said i penitently badit was carelessness and neglect beyond endurance she said no i saw the maids wanted the mistresss eye and umberge evidently had not given it and i thought you had tried to throw yourself into the gap andas such an inexperienced young thing wouldhad failed i really was pleased when alix said that then thou wert not vexed with me alix not i you did your best i was vexed enough with umberge i knew she was lazy but i did not expect her to discredit the house like that she seems quite altered since she came here i said ah you never can tell how people will turn out till you come to live with them said alix so you are not so very glad after all to lose me little one i was startled for i never supposed that alix had guessed that i did not know what to say why child did you think i had no eyes she added you know you were glad i did what i generally dohesitated for a moment and then came out bluntly with the truth well alix i was glad but i am not now alix laughed that is right she said always tell the plain truth elaine you will find many a time as you go through life child that the prettiest pasties are not always the best flavoured nor the plainest say the worst to wear a common quality of silk i suppose it is so but i never should have guessed that i should be wishing for alix to come back marguerite i said one morning as i was dressing dost thou think it would be wrong if i were to pray for a letter from guy i cannot think it wrong to pray for anything she answered provided we are willing that the good god should choose for us in the end well but i am not sure that i am willing to have that is my damoiselle as wise as the good lord oh no of course not but still but still my damoiselle would like always to have her own way yes i should margot well if there be one thing for which i am thankful it is that the good lord has not given me much of my own way it would have been very bad for me perhaps for a villein it might said i but nobles are different possibly even for the nobles said marguerite the good lord might be the best chooser but it seems to me if we left everything in that way we should never pray at all let my damoiselle pardon me that we have full trust in a friends wisdom is scarcely a reason why we should not ask his counsel but the friend cannot know what advice you need the lord knows all about it does my damoiselle never tell her thoughts to monseigneur guy because he knows that she is likely to think this or that oh but it is such pleasure to tell ones thoughts to guy i replied he generally thinks as i do and when he does not he talks the thing over with me and it usually ends in my thinking as he does then if i am sad he comforts me and if i am rejoicing he rejoices with me ando margot it is like talking to another me my damoiselle said marguerite with a peculiar smile which i have seen on her lips before and never could understandit is so glad and sunny yet quiet and deep as if she were rejoicing over some hidden treasure which she had all to herselfmy damoiselle has said well he that is joined to the lord is one spirit if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another my damoiselle does not yet know what it is to speak out freely all her thoughts to one who is infinitely high and wise and who loves her with an infinite love i am but a poor ignorant villein woman i know very little about any thing well i take my ignorant mind to him who knows all things and who can foresee the end from the beginning i do not know any grand words to pray with i just say sir god i am very much puzzled i do not know what to do for the best put the best thing into my head thou knowest every night before i go to sleep the last thing i say in my heart sir god i do not know what is good and what is evil for me thou knowest give me the good things tonight and keep the evil ones away i suppose if i were very wise and clever i should not make such poor ignorant prayers i should know then what would be best to do yet i do not think i should be any better off for then i should see so much less of the good lord i would rather have more of the good god and less of the quick wit and the ready tongue though this title will certainly sound strange if not irreverent to modern ears it was meant as the most reverent epithet known to those who used it it would be nice to feel as margot does i cannot think where she got it but it would never do for me who am noble to take pattern from a poor villein i suppose such thoughts are good for low ignorant people what should i have done if i had been born a villein i cannot imagine what it would feel like i am very glad i was not but of course i cannot tell what it would feel like because nobles have thoughts and feelings of quite a different sort to common people i suppose guy would say that was one of my queer notions he always says more queer ideas come into my head than any one elses o guy guywhen shall i see thee again two whole years and not a word from thee art thou languishing in some paynim dungeon hast thou fallen in some battle or has the beautiful lady come and thy little lynette is forgotten i have been asking father eudes to tell me something about the holy land for i want to be able to picture to myself the place where guy is and of course father eudes can tell for he knows all about every thing and he had an uncle who was a holy palmer and visited the blessed sepulchre and used to tell most beautiful legends he says about the holy land beside which his own father fought for the sepulchre in the second crusade and dwelt in that country for several years father eudes says it is nearly a hundred years since the kingdom of jerusalem was founded for it was in the year of our lord at the time of the first crusade the first king was the gallant count godefroy of boulogne who was unanimously chosen by all the christian warriors after the holy city was taken but he would never call himself king but only defender of the holy sepulchre but alasthe good king godefroy only reigned one year and on his death the princes all assembled in the church of the holy sepulchre which they also call the temple to elect a successor and because there were great contentions among them they resolved to decide the choice by lot and they stood around the tomb of our lord each holding a long taper and earnestly besought the good god that he would cause the taper held by him who ought to be king of jerusalem to be lighted by miracle and when the prayer was ended one of the tapers was found to be burning it was that held by duke robert the courthose son of lord william the norman who conquered england but to the horror of all the princes duke robert blew out the taper and refused to be king he said that he was not worthy to wear a crown of gold in that place where for his sins our lord had worn a crown of thorns and i really have always felt puzzled to know whether he acted very piously or very impiously so in the end the brother of king godefroy was chosen but he also left no child though he reigned eighteen years but the lady ida his sister who was a very wise and preux lady had a son and he reigned after his uncle for thirteen years yet at his death he left four daughters and no son and father eudes thinks that this showed the displeasure of our lord who had willed that the kingdom of jerusalem should belong to our lords the kings of england and they wickedly refused to receive it brave noble chivalrous for of course it is the bounden duty of all christian men to rescue the holy land out of the hands of paynims jews and such horrible heretics who all worship the devil and bow down to stocks and stones since this land belonged to our lord jesus christ who was king of it by holy mary his mother and he died seised of the same for which reason all christian men who are the right heirs of our said lord ought to recover their inheritance in that land and not leave it in the hands of wicked heretics who have no right to it at all since they are not the children and right heirs of jesus christ our lord this singular reasoning is borrowed from sir john mandeville well when king beaudouin ii was dead the holy land fell to the eldest of his four daughters who was named the lady melisende and she wedded count foulques of anjou and from her all the kings since then have come so now it seems settled in the line of anjou i suppose our lords the kings of england therefore have no right to it any more i cannot help feeling sorry that duke robert blew out the taper i would not have done it if it had been mine i think to be the queen of jerusalem would be the grandest thing in all the worldeven better than to be the empress of monseigneur the caesar is it not the land of god a letter at lasta letter from guy and he is high in the kings favour and has won booty to the amount of eighteen thousand golden crowns and he wants amaury and me to go to him at once i keep dancing about and singing i am so delighted and not one word of the beautiful lady that is best of all guy says the king is a mesel and dwells in chambers to himself and he has never been married so there is no queen except the widow of the late king his father and she is of the high blood of messeigneurs the caesars but is not the mother of the king he is like guy for his own mother who was the damoiselle de courtenay died when he was very young and he has one sister of the whole blood who is called the lady sybil and one sister of the half blood who is called the lady isabel the lady sybil is a widow though she is younger than alix for she was the wife of monseigneur guillaume the marquis of montferrat who died about the time guy reached the holy land and she has one child monseigneur beaudouin named after the king his uncle the lady isabel is not yet married and she is about fourteen years old guy writes that the king and the ladies his sisters and the old queen are all very good to him and he is prospering marvellously leper she was maria daughter some writers say niece of the emperor manuel comnemus guys letter was brought by a holy palmer late last night i am sure the palmer must be a very holy man for he had scallops fastened to his shovelhat and crosskeys embroidered on his bosom and bells upon his sleeve and the holy cross upon his shoulder his cross was green so he must be a fleming and whenever i came near him there was such a disagreeable smell that he must i am sure be very holy indeed he told robert and marguerite told me that he had not changed his clothes for three whole years what a holy man he must be i was very glad when he gave me his benediction though i did try to keep as much to windward of him as i could and i put a sprig of lavender in my handkerchief before i asked for it i am rather afraid father eudes would say it was wicked of me to put that sprig of lavender in my handkerchief but really i think i should have felt quite disgusted if i had not done so and why should it be holy not to wash ones self why dont they always leave babies unwashed if it be that they might grow up to be holy men and women the scallopshell denoted a pilgrim to the shrine of st james of compostella the crosskeys to rome the bells to canterbury hence the canterbury bell and the cross to the holy sepulchre the flemings wore a green cross the french a red the english a white one the proverbial red cross knight therefore strictly speaking could not be an englishman i wonder if the angels like smells which we think disagreeable if they do of course that would account for it yet one cannot imagine an angel with soiled feathers i suppose guy would say that was another of my queer ideas oh i am so delighted that we have heard from guy monseigneur says i must have lots of new dresses to take with me i have been wishing ever so long for a fine mantle of black cloth lined with minever and he says i shall have it and i want a golden girdle and a new aumoniere i should like a diaper gown toored and black and a shot silk blue one way and gold the other the bag which depended from the girdle this term seems to have indicated stuff woven in any small regular pattern not flowers my gracious lord asked me what gems i would best like oh agate or cornelian if it please your nobility said i because they make people amiable he pinched my ear and said he thought i was amiable enough he would give me a set of jacinths these gems were believed to possess the properties in question what to send me to sleep said i laughing just so he answered thou art somewhat too wideawake what do you please to mean monseigneur he smiled but then sighed heavily and stroked my head ah my little lynette he said if thy blessed mother had but lived i know nottruly i know notwhether i act for thy real welfare or not the good god forgive our blunders poor blindlings that we are and he rose and went away but of course it must be for my welfare that i should go to guy and get some appointment in the household of one of the princesses and see life andwell i dont know about getting married i might not have so much of my own way and i like that dearly besides if i were married i could not be always with guy i think i wont on the whole i asked marguerite tonight if she could tell why holy people did not wash and she said she thought they did well said i but yonder holy palmer had not taken his clothes off for three years and i am sure margot he did not smell nice i think said marguerite under leave of my damoiselle he would have been at least as holy if he had changed them once a month o margot is not that heterodoxy asked i laughing let my damoiselle pardon her servantno did not monseigneur saint paul himself say that men should wash their bodies with pure water i am sure i dont know said i i always thought the holier you were and the dirtier and that is one reason why i always thought too that i could never be holy i should want my hands and face clean at least did my damoiselle think she could never be holy yes i did margot and do wherefore let her forgive her poor servant oh holiness seems to mean all sorts of unpleasant things said i you must not wash nor lie on a comfortable bed nor wear anything nice nor dance nor sing nor have any pleasure i dont want to be holy i really could not do with it margot under my damoiselles leave all those things she has mentioned seem to me to be outside things andunless i mistake for i am but an ignorant creatureholiness must be something inside my soul is inside of me and to clean my soul i must have something that will go inside to it the inside principle will be sure to put all the outside things straight will it not but i do not see what the outside things can do to the insideexcept that sometimes they make us cross but then it is we who are wrong not they dost thou suppose it is wicked to be cross margot damoiselle father eudes once read a list of the good things that a true christian ought to have in his heartthere were nine of them love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance i think one cannot have many of them when one is cross and peevish then thou dost not think it sinful to delight in fine clothes and jewels and lie in a soft bed and have dainties for dinnerfor all those are outside ha yes my damoiselle those are the worlds substitute for happiness now what dost thou mean margot laughed i have i not all these good thingsand am i not happy all theseah yes but happy no no my damoiselle is not happy why what wilt thou say next cried i will my damoiselle permit her poor servant to ask her a question oh yesanything thou wilt then is my damoiselle quite certainsafely happily certainwhat will become of her when she shall die o margot what an ugly question i hate to think of it why i suppose i shall go to heavenwhy should i not dont all nobles go there except those who are very very wicked ha she hates to think of it wherefore why everybody does of course let my damoiselle pardon me not i oh thou art an old woman and hast outlived thy youth and its pleasures no wonder my damoiselle will find as life goes on that the older she grows the more distasteful that thought becomes to her that is unless she should learn to be happy which may the good god grant i could not help laughing heartily for a young noble maiden like me to take lessons of a forlorn old creature like margot in the art of being happy did seem so very ridiculous ah my damoiselle may laugh now said marguerite in her quiet way but i have told the sober truth oh dear said i i think i had better sleep on itmargot art thou not very much pleased at the thought of going to the holy land ah yes my damoiselle very much i would dearly like to behold the earth which the feet of the blessed lord have troddenthe lake on which he walked and the hill from which he went up ah he shall so comethis same jesus i looked at her in astonishment the worn old face and sunken eyes seemed alight with some hidden rapture i could not understand her and the holy sepulchre i said for that is holiest of all the holy places as everybody knows well i should not so much care to see that answered marguerite to my surprise he is not there he is risen if a dear friend of mine had gone on a journey i should not make a pet of the saddle on which he rode away i should rather want not to see it for it would always remind me that he was gone marguerite exclaimed i dost thou not know that a neuvaine offered at the holy sepulchre is of more efficacy than ten offered at any other altar will my damoiselle give me leave to wait till i see it of course if the good god choose to have it so there is an end of the matter but i think i would rather be sure for me i should like to pray in the church of the nativity to thank him for coming as a little babe into this weary world and in the church of the ascension to beg him to hasten his coming again ah the church of the ascension said i there are pillars in that church nearly close to the wall and the man who can creep between the wall and the pillar has full remission of all his sins is that in the holy evangel asked marguerite but i could not tell her i fancy there may be some mistake about that she added of course if it be in the holy evangel but it does not look quite of a piece with what father eudes reads he read one day out of the writing of monseigneur saint john that the blood of jesus christ the blessed lord cleansed us from all sin and another timei think he said it was from the evangel of monseigneur saint matthewhe read that if a man did but ask the good god for salvation it should be given him well i asked and he gave it me could he give me anything moreor would he be likely to do it because i crept between a wall and a pillar why marguerite hast thou been listening to some of those wicked lyonnese that go preaching up and down dost thou not know that king henry the father hath strictly forbidden any man to harbour one of that rabble if it please my damoiselle i know nothing at all about them why it is a merchant of lyons named pierre waldo and a lot more with him they go up and down the country preaching and corrupting people from the pure catholic faith hast thou listened to any such preachers margot ha my damoiselle what know i there was a grey friar at the cross a few weeks since oh of course the holy brethren of saint augustine are all right said i well and last sunday there was a man there not exactly in a friars robe but clad in sackcloth as if he were in mourning but he said none but very good words they were just like the holy evangel which father eudes reads very comforting words they were too he said the good lord cared even for the sparrows poor little thingsand very much more for us that trusted him i should like to hear him preach again take care how thou dost said i as i lay down in bed i am afraid margot he is one of those lyonnese serpents well said marguerite as she tucked me up he had no sting if he were no the sting comes afterwards said i and thou art but a poor villein and ignorant and quite unable to judge which is the true doctrine of holy church and which the wicked heresy that we must shut our ears against true my damoiselle said old marguerite meekly but to say that the dear blessed lord cares for his poor servantsno nothat is no heresy what is heresy said i and what is truth oh dear if one might know ones own self ah pilatus asked that of the good god when he stood before his judgmentseat but he did not wait for the answer i wish he had done i answered then we might have known it but i suppose the good lord would have told him to submit himself to the church so we should not have been much better off because we do know that we are better off my damoiselle said old marguerite for though the good god did not answer pilatusmaybe he was not worthyhe did answer the same question asked by monseigneur saint thomas did not my damoiselle hear father eudes read that in french it was only a few weeks ago i shook my head i cannot imagine when or how marguerite does hear all these things i never do but she went on it was one day when the good lord had told messeigneurs the apostles that he was going to ascend to heaven and he said the way ye know but monseigneur saint thomasah he was rather like my damoiselle he wanted to knowhe replied that they did not know the way if he had not been a holy apostle i should not have thought it very civil to contradict his seigneur let alone the good lord but the good god was not angry he saw i suppose that monseigneur saint thomas did not mean anything wrong but he wanted to know like a damoiselle of the house of lusignan so he said i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me but i do not see what that means said i truth cannot be a persona man cannot be a way of course it is a figure of speech but still i do not see what it means i was very sleepy and i fancy rather cross marguerite stooped and kissed my hand and then turned and put out the light rest my fair damoiselle she said tenderly and may the good god show my darling what it means chapter iv a journeyand the end of it a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky wordsworth bound for the east countrie ay we are fairly off at last amaury and iwith old marguerite and her niece perette and bertrade roberts daughter and robert himself to wait upon me and an escort of armed men and amaurys attendants yet it was not all brightness when we came to leave the castle alix and messire raymond were there to take leave of us and i really fanciedit must have been fancythat there were tears in alixs eyes when she kissed me there were none in umberges nor in guillots but raoul cried honestly though amaury said afterwards that he believed threequarters of raouls tears were due to his having to stay behind father eudes gave me his blessing and he wept too poor old man i dare say he was sorry he was here before i was born then the maidens and servants came forward the women kissing my hand and the men my robe and last of all i came to monseigneur our father he folded me close in his arms and bent his head down upon mine and i felt two or three hot tears on my brow my little lynette he said my little little girl the one bud of my one love must i let thee go ha wellit is for thy welfare the good god bless thee mignonne and messeigneurs and mesdames the saints please god little maiden we shall meet in jerusalem meet in jerusalem i said in surprise this was news to methat monseigneur meant to take the cross ay said he softly in the syon aurea ut clarior oro there is an upper city my child which is fairer than the lower jesu of his mercy bring us both there amen said father eudes dame mary pray for us poor sinners there was a great bustle after that and noise and clashing and i do not remember much distinctly till i got into the litter with bertrade and then first amaury set forth on his charger with his squires after him and then marguerite behind robert on horseback and perette behind amaurys varlet who is a cousin of hers and then my litter moved forward with the armed men around and behind i just saw them all clearly for one momentalix with her lips set looking at us as if she were determined not to say a word and messire raymond smoothing his moustache and guillot with an old shoe poised in the air which hit my fore postilion the next minute and umberge with that fair false smile with which she deludes every one at first sight and monseigneur with his arms folded and the tears fairly running down his cheeks and his lips working as if he were deeply grieved just for one minute there they all stood and i think they will make a picture in my eyes till the end of time for me and then my litter was drawn out of the castle gate and the horses tramped across the drawbridge and down the slope below and i drew the curtain of the litter aside and looked back to see my dear old home the fair strong castle of lusignan growing less and less behind me every moment till at last it faded into a more dim speck in the distance and i felt that my long and venturesome journey had begun oh why do people never let us know how much they love us until just as we unclasp hands and part do they always know it themselves and i wonder whether dying is anything like this do men go a long journey to god with an armed escort of angels and do they see the world go less and less behind them as they mount i will ask margot what she thinks she is but a villein in truth but then she has such curious fancies i have asked marguerite and she shakes her head ha no my damoiselle it can be no long journey to god father eudes said but last sunday reading from the breviary in his sermon that he is not far from every one of us and the good thief ditmas that was crucified with god was there in half a day it can only be a little way to heaven ah much less than half a day it must be for did not monseigneur saint gabriel the holy archangel begin to fly when monseigneur saint daniel began to prayand he was there before he had finished his beads it is a long while since father eudes told us that and i thought it so comforting because it showed that heaven was not far and also that the good lord listens so quickly when we call ah i have to say wait heloisei am listening to perette but the good lord does not need to do that he can hear my lady the queen and the lady alix and monseigneur guy and my damoiselle and her servant marguerite all at once yes i suppose it must be so though i cannot understand it one has to believe so many things that one cannot understand do we even know how we live from day to day of course it is known that we have certain organs in our bodies by which we breathe and speak and walk and digest food but can any one tell how all they do goes to make up what we call life i do not believe it we took our way by poictiers across the duchies of berry and burgundy and through franchecomte crossing some terrible mountains between besancon and neufchatel then we travelled across switzerlandoh how beautiful it is i felt as though i should have been content to stay there and never go any farther but amaury said that was just like a silly girl what man said hewith such an accent on the manever wanted to stop away from gorgeous pageants and gallant deeds of arms just to stare at a big hill with some snow on it or a pool of water with some trees round it how could any body make a name in that foolish waysaid messire amaury but old marguerite thought with me damoiselle she said i am very thankful i came on this journey methinks i have a better notion what heaven will be like than i had before we left poitou i did not know the good god was so rich there seems to be no end to the beautiful things he can make oh how beautiful he himself must be and we shall see his face father eudes read it whatever one says to marguerite she always finds something to say in answer about the good god surely she should have been a nun we came into italy through two great passesone over the julier mountain so called from julius caesar the great emperor who made the road by help of the black art and set up two pillars on the summit to commemorate his deeds and then passing through a beautiful valley where all flowers of the year were out together and there was a lovely chain of lakeswhich naughty amaury scornfully called crocuses and dirty waterwe wound up hill after hill until at last it really seemed as if we must have reached the top of the world here were two small lakes at the foot of a drear slope of ice which in these parts they call a glacier and they call them the black lake and the white lake we had two sturdy peasants as guides over the mountains and i should have liked dearly to talk with them about their country but of course it would not have been seemly in a damsel of my rank noblesse oblige but i got marguerite to ask them several questions for their language is sufficiently like the langue doc for us to understand them though they speak very thickly and indistinctly they told marguerite that their beautiful valley is named the val engiadina and they were originally a colony from italy who fled from a persecution of the saracens this pass is called the bernina for berne in their tongue signifies a bear and there are many bears about here in winter and they say this mountain is the top of the world for here the waters separate on the one side flowing far away into asia near the place where adam dwelt in paradise and on the other into the great western sea which we shall shortly have to cross and here on the very summit of this mountain dwelt a holy hermit who gave me a shelter in his hut while the men camped outside round great fires for though it was august yet at this great height it was quite cold and so through the pass we wound slowly down into italy two cognate languages were at this time spoken in france north of the loire the langue doil and south the langue doc both words meaning yes in the respective languages the more northern language was the harsher ch being sounded as k just as church in england becomes kirk in scotland cher chaise chien therefore were pronounced ker kaise kien in the langue doil the engadine all the evil done or doing in the world was at this time attributed to the saracens the colony is supposed to have arisen from the flight of a group of christians in the persecution under diocletian the black sea the mediterranean marguerite and perette were both full of the beauty they had seen in the great glacier on which they went with the guides but it would not have done for a damsel of my rank and really i saw no beauty in it from across the lake it looked like a quantity of very dirty ice with ashes scattered over it but they said it was full of deep cracks or fissures in which were the loveliest colours that human eye could see or heart imagine ah i can guess now said marguerite i could not think what monseigneur saint john meant when he said the city was gold like clear crystal i know now damoiselle in the glacier there are walls of light the sweetest green shading into blue that my damoiselle can possibly imagine they must be like that but golden ha if my damoiselle had seen it the great nobles have not all the good things it is well not to be so high up that one cannot see the riches of the good god she has the queerest notions wellwe travelled on through lombardy and tarried a few days at milan whence we journeyed to venice which is the strangest place i ever saw or dreamed of for all the streets are canals and one calls for ones boat where other people order their horses the duke of venice who is called the doge was very kind to us he told us at supper a comical story of a duchess of venice who lived about a hundred years ago she so dearly loved ease and luxury that she thought it too much trouble to eat with her fingers like everybody else and she actually caused her attendants to cut her meat into little pieces like dice and then she had a curious instrument with two prongs made of gold with which she picked up the bits and put them in her dainty mouth only fancy the first fork on record at venice we embarked and sailed to messina where most of the pilgrims for the holy land assemble as it is the most convenient port we did not go overland as some pilgrims do through the dominions of the byzantine caesar but we sailed thence to crete i was rather sorry to miss byzantium both on account of the beautiful stuffs which are sold there and the holy relics but since i have seen a spine of the crown of thorns which the lady de montbeillard hasshe gave seven hundred crowns for it to monseigneur de rheimsi did not care so much about the relics as i might otherwise have done perhaps i shall meet with the same kind of stuffs in palestine and certainly there will be relics enough the eastern emperor his dominions in europe extended over greece and turkey constantinople the archbishop from crete we sailed to rhodes and thence to cyprus they all say that i am an excellent sailor for i feel no illness nor inconvenience at all but poor bertrade has been dreadfully ill and marguerite and perette say they both feel very uncomfortable on the water at cyprus is an abbey of monks on the hill of the holy cross and here amaury and his men were housed for the night and i and my women at a convent of nuns not far off at the abbey they have a cross which they say is the very cross on which our lord suffered but some say it is only the cross of ditmas the good thief i was rather puzzled to know whether there being a doubt whether it really is the holy cross it ought to be worshipped if it be only a piece of common wood i suppose it would be idolatry so i thought it more right and seemly to profess to have a bad headache and decline to mount the hill i asked amaury what he had done oh worshipped it of course said he but how if it were not the true cross i asked my sister wouldst thou have a knight thus discourteous the monks believe it true it would have hurt their feelings to show any doubt but amaury it would be idolatry ha bah he answered the angels will see it put to the right accountno doubt of that dear meif one is to be for ever considering little scruples like that why there would be no end to themone would never do any thing then i asked marguerite if she went up to worship the holy cross no damoiselle said she the grey friar said we worship not the cross but the good god that died thereon and i suppose he is as near to us at the bottom of the hill as at the top well it does look reasonable i must say but it must be one of marguerites queer notions there would be no good in relics and holy places if that were always true this island of cyprus is large and fair it was of old time dedicated by the paynims to venus their goddess of beauty but when it fell into christian hands it was consecrated anew to mary the holy mother from cyprus we sailed again a day and a half to tyre but we did not land there but coasted southwards to the great city of acre and there at last we took land in palestine here we were lodged in the castle which is very strong and we found already here some friends of amaury the baron de montluc and his two sons who had landed about three weeks before us hence we despatched a letter to guy i was the writer of course for amaury can write nothing but his name but he signed the letter with me messire renaud de montluc who was setting out for the holy city undertook to see the letter safe we were to follow more slowly we remained at acre about ten days then we set forth amaury and i the baron de montluc and his son messire tristan and several other knights who were waiting for a company with our respective trains and the governor of acre lent us an additional convoy of armed men to see us safe to the holy city this was my first experience of tent life and very strange it felt and horribly insecure i accustomed to dwell within walls several feet thick with portcullis and doors guarded by bolts and bars in a chamber opening on an inner court to have no more than one fold of goats hair canvas between me and the outside world true the menatarms were camped outside but that was no more than a castle garrison and where was the castle margot said i dost thou not feel horribly frightened for of course she a villein would be more accessible to fear than a noble oh no my damoiselle she said very quietly is it not in the holy psalter that the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them we are as safe as in the castle of lusignan it is a very good thing for marguerite and the maidens that i am here because of course the holy angels who are of high rank would never think of taking care of mere villeins it must mean persons of noble blood we journeyed on southwards slowly pausing at the holy placescapernaum where messeigneurs saint peter and saint andrew dwelt before they followed our lord and where monseigneur saint peter left madame his wife and his daughter madame saint petronilla when he became our lords disciple of course he was obliged to leave them behind for a holy apostle could not have a wife marguerite says that man in sackcloth who preached at the cross at lusignan said that in the early ages of the church priests and even bishops used to be married men and that it would have been better if they had continued to be so i am afraid he must be a very wicked person and one of those heretical waldenses we also tarried a while at caesarea where our lord gave the keys to monseigneur saint peter and appointed him the first bishop of rome and nazareth where our lady was born and spent her early life not far from neapolis anciently called sychem they show the ruins of a palace where dwelt king ahab who was a very wicked paynim and had a saracen to his wife at neapolis is the well of monseigneur saint jacob on which our lord once sat when he was weary this was the only holy place we passed which old marguerite had the curiosity to go and see nablous now what made thee care more for that than any other i asked her of course it was a holy place but there was nothing to look at save a stone well in a valley our ladys fountain at nazareth was much prettier ah my damoiselle is young and blithe she said and smiled it is long long since i was a young mother like our lady and longer still since i was a little child but the bare old well in the stony valleythat came home to me he was weary yet he was god he is rested now on the throne of his glory yet he cares for me that am weary still so i just knelt down at the old well and i said to him in my ignorant wayfair father jesu christ i thank thee that thou wert weary and that by thy weariness thou hast given me rest it felt to rest mea visit to the place where he sat tired and hungry but my damoiselle cannot understand bel pereone of the invocations then usual no margot i dont at all said i ah no it takes a tired man to know the sweetness of rest three days journey through the val de luna which used to be called the vale of ajalon brought us to the city of gran david which was of old named gibeon the valley is styled de luna because it was here that monseigneur saint joshua commanded the sun and moon to stand still while he vanquished the paynims from gran david it is only one days journey to the holy city tomorrow margot said i in great glee only tomorrow we shall see the holy sepulchre ha thanks be to the good god and we need not wait till tomorrow to see him that rose from it why marguerite dost thou ever have visions visions oh no those are for the holy saints not for a poor ignorant villein woman like me then what didst thou mean just now ah my damoiselle cannot understand margot i dont like that thou art always saying it i want to understand then she must ask the good god to show her and that is all i can get out of her short of a league from the holy city is the little hill called mont joie because from it the palmers catch the first glimpse of the blessed jerusalem we were mounting as it seemed to me a low hillock when amaury rode up beside me and parting the curtains said now elaine look out for we are on the mont joie wilt thou light down certainly i answered so amaury stopped the litter and gave me his hand and i jumped out he took me to the place where the palmers kneel in thanksgiving for being brought thus far on their journey and here i had my first sight of the holy city it is but a small city yet strongly fortified having three walls no paynim is permitted to enter it nor of course any heathen jew i cannot imagine how it was that the good god ever suffered the holy city even for an hour to be in the hands of those wicked people yet last night in the tent if marguerite did not ask me whether monseigneur saint paul was not a jew i was shocked oh dear no said i i heard somebody say so she replied i should think it was some paynim said i why of course none of the holy apostles were jews that miscreant judas iscariot and pontius pilatus and all those wicked people i suppose were jews but not the holy apostles and the saints it is quite shocking to think of such a thing then what were they if my damoiselle pleases said marguerite oh they were of some other nation said i for really i do not know of what nation they wereonly that they could never have been jews amaury said that we must first visit the holy sepulchre so though i was dying to have news of guy i comforted myself with the thought that i should hereby acquire so much more merit than if i had not cared about it we entered the holy city by the west gate just as the dusk was beginning and passing in single file along the streets we descended the hill of zion to the holy sepulchre in this church are kept many holy relics in the courtyard is the prison where our lord was confined after his betrayal and the pillar to which he was bound when scourged and in the portico the lance which pierced his side the stone which the angel rolled away from the sepulchre is now broken in two here our lady died and was buried in the church of saint mary close by in this church is kept the cup of our lord out of which he habitually drank it is of silver with a handle on each side and holds about a quart here also is the sponge which was held to his mouth and the crown of thorns by a miracle of the good god one half of the crown is also at byzantium the tomb of our lord is seven feet long and rises three palms from the floor fifteen golden lamps burn before it day and night i told the whole rosary at the holy tomb or should have done for i felt that the longer i waited to see guy the more merit i should heap up but amaury became impatient and insisted on my coming when a pater and eight aves were still to say then we mounted the hill of zion again passing the church built in honour of the prince of the apostles on the spot where he denied our lord and so we reached the kings palace at last amaury sprang from his horse and motioned my postilion to draw up in front of the chief gate i heard him say to the porter is sir guy de lusignan here my gracious lord the count of joppa and ascalon is here if it like you noble sir replied the porter he is at this moment in audience of my lady the queen i was so glad to hear it then guy had really been created a count he must be in high favour one half of his prophecy was fulfilled but what about the other pray you said amaury to the porter do my lord count to wit that his brother sir amaury de lusignan and his sister the lady elaine are before the gate i hardly know how i got through the next ten minutes then came quick steps a sound of speech a laugh and then my curtains were pushed aside and the voice i loved best in all the world said lynette lynette my darling ay it was my own guy who came back to me changedno not really changed at all a little older a little more bronzed a little longer and fuller in the beardthat was all but it was my guy himself come jump out he said holding his hand and let me present thee to the lady queen i long to see my lynette the fairest ornament of her court and how goes it with monseigneur our fair father so talking all the way i walked with guy hand in hand up the stairs and into the very bower of the imperial lady who bears the crown of all the world since it is the flower of all the crowns i can assure thee said guy the lady queen has often talked of thee and is prepared to welcome thee it was a beautiful room though small decorated with carved and fragrant cedarwork and hung with blue and gold round the walls were blue and gold settles and three curule chairs in the midst there were only three ladies therebut i must describe them the queen who sat in one of the curule chairs was rather short and stout with a pleasant motherly sort of look she appeared to be between forty and fifty years of age her daughter the lady isabel who sat in another chair busied with some embroidery was apparently about eighteen but guy told me afterwards that she is only fifteen for women ripen early in these eastern lands and grow old fast she has luxuriant black hair and dark shining eyes on the settle was a damsel a little older than the princess not quite so dark nor so handsome she as i afterwards found was the damoiselle melisende de courtenay a distant relative of the king who dwells with the princesses guy led me up to the queen a fictitious person millicent is the modern version of this old gothic name it comes from amalasuinde and signifies heavenlywisdom madam said he your highness has heard me often speak of my younger sister ha the little damoiselle helena replied the queen smiling very kindly be welcome my child i have indeed heard much of you this brother of yours thinks nobody like you in the worldnot even one eh sir countisabel i desire thee to make much of the damoiselle and let her feel herself at home andmelisende i pray thee give order for her lodging and let her women be seen to ahhere comes another who will be glad to be acquainted with you helen is really quite distinct from ellen of which lost elaine is the older form the former is a greek name signifying attractive captivating the latter is the feminine of the celtic name alainmore generally written alan or allanand means brighthaired eleanor it is a mistake as regards philology to write elinor is simply an amplification of ellen by the addition of or gold it denotes therefore hair bright as gold annora is a corruption of eleanor and nora or norah a further contraction of annora i turned round to see at whom the queen was looking an inner door of the chamber had just opened and two ladies were coming into the room at the one i scarcely looked save to see that she was old and wore the garb of a nun the other fixed my eyes in an instant shall i say she was beautiful i do not know she has a face about which one never thinks whether it is beautiful or not she is so sweet so sweet her hair is long of a glossy golden hue her eyes are dark grey and all her soul shines out in them her age seemed about twenty and guy said behind me in a whisper the lady sybil of montferrat something in guys tone made me glance suddenly at his face my heart felt for a moment as if it stopped beating the thing that i feared was come upon me the whole prophecy was fulfilled the beautiful lady stood before me i should be first with guy no longer but i did not feel so grieved as i expected and when lady sybil put her arms round me and kissed me and told me i should be her dear little sisterthough i felt that matters must have gone very far indeed yet somehow i was almost glad that guy had found a heart to love him in this strange land the old nun proved to be a cousin of the queen whom they call lady judith she is an eremitess and dwells in her cell in the very palace itself i notice that lady sybil seems very fond of her a fictitious person damoiselle melisende showed me a nice bedchamber where i and my three women were to lodge i was very tired and the queen saw it and in her motherly way insisted on my having some supper and going to bed at once so i did not even wait to see amaury again and guy went to look for him and bring him up to the queen the king being a mesel dwells alone in his own rooms and receives none when guy has to communicate with him he tells me that he talks with him through a lattice and a fire of aromatic woods burns between them but i can see that guy is a very great man here and has the affairs of the state almost in his own hands i said to marguerite as i was undressingmargot i think count guy is going to marry somebody why if it please my damoiselle from the way he looks at lady sybil andother things your gracious pardon butis he less loving to my damoiselle oh nomore loving and tender than ever if that be possible then it is all right said marguerite he loves her what dost thou mean margot when a man marries my damoiselle one of three things happens either he weds from policy and has no love for his lady but monseigneur guy loves to look at her so it is not that or he loves himself and she is merely a toy which ministers to his pleasure then he would be absorbed in himself and her and not notice whether any other were happy or unhappy but if he loves her with that true faithful honourable love which is one of gods best gifts then he will be courteous and tender towards all women because she is one and especially to his own relatives being women who love him he will be very loving indeed that is why i asked o margot margot i said laughing where on earth dost thou find all thy queer notions not all on earth my damoiselle but for many of them all that is wanted is just to keep ones eyes open are my eyes open margot my damoiselle had better shut them now replied marguerite a little drily she can open them again tomorrow so i went to sleep and dreamed that guy married lady judith in her nuns attire and that i was in great distress at the sacrilege and could do nothing to avert it chapter v curious notions the soul doubtless is immortalwhere a soul can be discerned robert browning for the last few weeks since we reached jerusalem i have been very busy going about with the damoiselle melisende and sometimes the lady isabel with amaury as escort we have now visited all the holy places within one days journey i commanded marguerite to attend me for it amuses me afterwards to hear what she has to say we went to the church of saint mary in the valley of jehoshaphat which is built in a round form and in it is the empty tomb in which our lady was buried so some say and that the angels carried her body away in the night but other some say that while the holy apostles were carrying her to her burial the angels came down and bore her away to paradise i asked margot as she always listens if she had heard father eudes read about it from the holy evangel but she said he had never read the story of that at least in french in this church there is a stone in the wall on which our lord knelt to pray on the night of his betrayal and on it is the impression of his knees as if the stone were wax there is no roof to the church but by miraculous provision of the good god the rain never falls on it here also our lords body when taken down from the cross was wrapped and anointed we also visited the church of the holy ghost where is the marble table at which our lord and the holy apostles ate the last supper and they received the holy sacrament at his hands there is also a chapel with an altar whereat our lord heard mass sung by the angels and here is kept the vessel wherein our lord washed the feet of his disciples all these are on mount zion marguerite was very much interested in the vessel in which the holy apostles feet were washed but she wanted to know which of them had put it by and kept it so carefully this of course i could not tell her perhaps it was revealed by miracle that this was the vessel ah well she said turning away at last with a contented face it does not much matter if only the good god wash our feet but that cannot be margot said i lady judith was with us that day and she laid her hand on my arm child said she gently if he wash thee not thou hast no part with him and said marguerite my lady will pardon meif he wash us we have part with him ay answered lady judith heirs of god jointheirs with christ thou knowest it my sisterthou hast washed ay we believers enter into rest i wondered what they were talking about lady judithof the caesars purple blood and born in a palace at constantinople and old margueritea villein born in a hovel in poitoumarvel to relate they understood each other perfectly they have seemed quite friendly ever since it can hardly be because they are both old there must be some mystery i do not understand it at all another day we went to the church of the ascension which is on the summit of mount olivet this also has an open roof when our lord ascended he left the impression of his feet in the dust and though palmers are constantly carrying the holy dust away by basketsful yet the impression never changes this seemed to me so wonderful that i told marguerite expecting that it would very much astonish her but she did not seem to think much about it her mind was full of something else ah my damoiselle she said they did well that built this church and put no roof on it for he is not here he is gone up and he will come again thank god he will come again this same jesusthe same that wore the crown of thorns and endured the agony of the crossthe same that said weep not to the bereaved mother and go in peace to the woman that was a sinnerthe very same himself and none other i marvel if it will be just here i would like to live and die here if it were o margot said i laughing thou dost not fancy it will be while thou art alive only the good god knows that she said still looking up intently through the roof of the churchor where the roof should have beeninto the sky but i would it might if i could find it in my heart to envy any mortal creature it would be them who shall look up maybe with eyes dimmed by tears and see him coming i cannot comprehend thee margot said i i think it would be just dreadful i can hardly imagine a greater shock suppose at this moment my damoiselle were to look behind her and see monseigneur count guy standing there smiling on herwould she think it a dreadful shock margot how can the two be compared only love can compare them answered the old woman softly marguerite dost thoucanst thoulove our lord as much as i love guy it is not possible a thousand times more my damoiselle your nobility i know loves monseigneur very dearly yet you have other interests apart from him i have no interest apart from my lord all my griefs all my joys i take to him and until he has laid his hand on them and blessed them i can neither endure the one nor enjoy the other i wonder if lady judith feels like that i should like to ask her if i could take the liberty marguerite was looking up again into the sky only think what it will be she said to look up from the cradle of your dying child with the anguish of helplessness pressing tight upon your heartand see him to look up from your own sick bed faint and weary beyond measureand see him from the bitter sense of sin and failurefrom cruel words and unkind looksfrom loneliness and desolationfrom hunger and cold and homelessnessto look up and see him there will be some suffering all these things when he comes oh why are his chariotwheels so long in coming does not he long for it even more than we i was silent she lookedthis old villein womanalmost like one inspired he knows she added softly he knows he can wait then we can surely i come quickly amen come lord jesus amaury called me and i left her there he wanted to creep through the columns and wished me to try first as i am slimmer than he i managed it pretty wellso now all my sins are remitted and i do feel so good and nice lady isabel could hardly do it and amaury who has been growing fatter of late could not get through at all he was much disappointed and very cross in consequence damoiselle melisende would not try she said laughing that she was quite sure she could not push through and she must get her sins forgiven some other way but she mischievously ran and fetched old marguerite and putting on a grave face proposed to her to try the feat now i am quite certain marguerite could never have done it for though she is not stout she is a largebuilt woman but she looked at the place for a moment and then said to melisende if the damoiselle pleases what will follow oh thou wilt have all thy sins forgiven said she i thank the damoiselle answered marguerite and turned quietly away then it would be to no good for my sins are forgiven what a strange old woman exclaimed lady isabel oh marguerite is very queer said i she amuses me exceedingly is she quite right in her head do you think demanded the princess eyeing margot with rather a doubtful expression i laughed and amaury said oh yes as bright as a new besant she is only comical then we went into the church of saint john where a piece of marble is kept on which our lord wrote when the heathen jews desired to know his judgment on a wicked woman marguerite seemed puzzled with this she said she had heard father eudes read the story and the holy evangel said that our lord wrote on the ground how did the writing get on that marble oh said i the marble must have been down below and it pleased the good god that it should receive the impress the good god can do all things assented margot butwell i am an ignorant woman coming down on the slope of olivet the place is shown where our lady appeared to monseigneur saint thomas who refused to believe her assumption and gave him her girdle as a token of it this girdle is kept in an abbey in england and is famous for easing pain that same afternoon at the spice in the queens presencechamber were messire de montluc and his sons and we fell in talki remember not howupon certain opinions of the schoolmen messire renaud would have it that nothing is but all things only seem to be nay truly messire said i laughing i am sure i am pardon menot at all he answered and that cedarwood fire is said damoiselle melisende by no means replied messire renaud it exists but in your fancy there is no such thing as matteronly mind my imagination sees a fire there your imagination sees a firebut there is no firesuch a thing does not exist put your finger into this fire which does not exist if you please messire remarked the queen who seemed much amused i expect you will come to a different conclusion within five minutes i humbly crave your highness pardon my finger is an imagination it does not really exist and the pain of the burnwould that be imagination also she inquired undoubtedly lady said he but what is to prevent your imagining that there is no pain pursued her highness nothing he answered if i did imagine that there would be none there is no such thing as matter mindsoulis the only existence lady what nonsense is the boy talking growled the baron but i pray you messire renaud said i if i do not exist how does the idea that i do exist get into my head how do i have a head for it to get into added guy stuff and nonsensical rubbish said the baron under leave of my lady queenlad thou hast lost thy senses no such thing as matter quotha why there is nothing but matter that is in reality what men call the soul is simply the brain give over thy fanciful stuff you are a realist messire asked guy call me what name you will sir count returned the baron i am no such fool as yon lanky lad of mine i believe what i see and hear and there i begin and end so does every wise man is it not a little odd inquired guy that everybody should think all the wise men must believe as he does odd no said the baron dont you think so yourself sir count guy laughed but there is one thing i should like to know said he i have heard much of realists and nominalists but i never before met one of either i wish to ask each of you messiresin your system what becomes of the soul after death nay if there be no soul what can become of it put in damoiselle melisende pure foy cried the baron i concern myself about nothing of that sort holy church teaches that the soul survives the body and it were unseemly to gainsay her teaching butha what know i for me said messire renaud a little grandiloquently i believe that death is simply the dissolution of that which seems and leaves only the pure essence of that which is the modicum of spiritof that essencewhich i call my soul will then be absorbed into the great soul of the universethe unknowable the unknown we have a name for that messire said guy reverently we call itgod precisely answered messire renaud youweholy churchpersonify this unknowable essence which is the fountain of all essence the parablefor a parable it isis most beautiful but ithename it as you willis none the less the unknown and the unknowable the boy must have a fever and the delirium is on him said the baron get a leech lad let out a little of that hot blood which mystifies thy foolish brains there was silence for a minute and it was broken by the low quiet voice of lady judith who sat next to the lady queen with a spindle in her hand and this is life eternal that they should know thee she added no more beautiful words truly responded messire renaud but you will permit me to observe lady that they arelike all similar phrasessymbolical the soul that has risen the nearest to this ineffable essencethat is most free from the shell of that which seemsmay in a certain typical sense be said to know this essence now there never was a soul more free from the seeming than that of him whom we call our lord accordingly he tells us thatemploying one of the loveliest of all typeshe knew the father it is perfectly charming to an enlightened mind to recognise the force the beauty the hidden meaning of these exquisite types lad what is the length of thine ears growled the baron what crouched ass crammed all this nonsense into thee enlightened mindexquisite typescharming symbolism i am not at all sure that i understand thee thou exquisite gander but if i do what thou meanest put in plain language is simply that there is no god eh fair father under your good leave i would choose other words godwhat we call godis the unknowable essence therefore undoubtedly there is god and in a symbolic sense he is the creator of all things this essence being the source out of which all other essences are evolved therefore parabolically speaking ill lay my stick about thy back thou parabolical mudpuddle cried the baron let me be served up for saladins supper if i understand a word of thy foolery art thou a true son of holy church or not that is what i want to know undoubtedly fair sir said messire renaud god forbid that i should be a heretic our holy mother the church has never banned the nominalists then it is high time she did retorted the baron i reckon she thinks they will do nobody much harm because no mortal being can understand them but where in the name of all the seven wonders of the world thou gattest such moonshine sticking in thy brains shoot me if i know it was not from my lady thy fair mother and i am sure it was not from me messire renaud made no answer beyond a laugh and the lady queen quickly introduced a different subject i fancy she saw that the baron was losing his temper but when messire renaud was about to take leave lady judith arose as quietly as she does everything and glided to his side fair sir she said gently i pray you pardon one word from an old woman you know years should teach wisdom trust me lady to listen with all respect said he courteously fair sir she said when you stand face to face with death you will find it does not satisfy your need you will want him you are not a thing but a person how can the thing produced be greater than that which produces it your pardon fair lady and holy mother interposed messire renaud quickly i do not object to designate the unknowable essence as him far from it i do but say as the highest minds have saidwe cannot know it maybe him it themwe cannot know we can but bow in illimitable adoration and strive to perfect to purify and enlighten our minds so that they shall grow nearer and nearer to that ineffable possibility a very sad look passed over lady judiths face my son she said if the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness these are not my words but his that died for thee and without another word she glided back to her seat margot said i when she came to undress me is my body or my soul me to fall and bruise yourself damoiselle would tell you the one said she and to receive some news that grieved you bitterly would show you the other messire renaud de montluc says that only my soul is me and that my body does not exist at allit only seems to be does he say the same of his own body oh yes of all wait till he has fleshed his maiden sword said margot if he come into my damoiselles hands for surgery with a broken leg and a swordcut on the shoulder let her ask him when she has dressed them whether his body be himself or not all ladies were taught surgery and practised it at this date oh he says that pain is only imagination said i if he chose to imagine that he had no pain it would stop very good said marguerite then let him set his broken leg with his beautiful imagination if he can cure his pain by imagining he has none what must he be if he do not well i know what i should think him but his father the baron de montluc will have it just the oppositethat there is no soul nor anything but what we can see and hear ah they will both find out their mistakes when they come to die said margot poor blind things the good god grant that they may find them out a little sooner i asked guy if he did not think the barons notion a very dangerous one but while he said yes he added that he thought messire renauds much more so it is so much more difficult to disprove said he it may look more absurd on the surface but it is more subtle to deal with and much more profound they both look to me very silly said i i wish they were no worse was guys answer today we have been to the church of the nativity at bethlehem this is a little city nearly two leagues from jerusalem that is half a days ride the way thither is very fair by pleasant plains and woods the city is long and narrow and well walled and enclosed with good ditches on all sides between the city and the church lies the field floridus where of old time a certain maiden was brought to the burning being falsely accused but she knowing her innocence prayed to our lord and he by miracle caused the lighted faggots to turn into red roses and the unlighted into white roses which were the first roses that were ever in the world the place where our lord was born is near the choir of the church down sixteen steps made of marble and richly painted and under the cloister down eighteen steps is the charnelhouse of the holy innocents the tomb of saint jerome is before the holy place here are kept a marble table on which our lady ate with the three kings that came from the east to worship our lord and the cistern into which the star fell that guided them the church as is meet is dedicated to our lady marguerite wanted to know if i were sure that the table was marble because she said our lady was a poor womanonly imagine such a fancybut she insisted upon it that she had heard father eudes read something about it as if the queen of heaven who was moreover queen of the land could have been poor i told marguerite i was sure she must be mistaken for our lady was a princess born that may be of blood said she but she was poor our lord himself when on earth was but a villein i was dreadfully shocked o marguerite i cried what horrible sacrilege art thou not afraid of the church falling on thee it would not alter that if it did said she drily our lord a villein exclaimed i how is such a thing possible he was the king of kings he is the king of kings said marguerite so reverently that i was sure she could mean no ill and he was of the royal blood of monseigneur saint david that is the evangel of the nobles but he was by station a villein and wrought as a carpenter and had no house and no wealth that is the evangel of the villeins and the villeins need their evangel damoiselle for they have nothing else i could not tell what to answer it is rather puzzling i suppose it is true that our lord was reputed the son of a carpenter and he must have wrought as suchmonseigneur saint joseph i meanfor the lady de montbeillard who is fond of picking up relics has a splinter of wood from a cabinet that he made but i always thought that it was to teach religious persons a lesson of humility and voluntary poverty it could not be that he was poor by this term a romanist does not mean what a protestant does the only religious persons in the eyes of the former are priests or monks then our ladyi have seen a scrap of her tunic and it was as fine stuff as it could be and i have heard though i never saw it that her weddingring is set with gems i said this to marguerite how could our lady be poor all that may be she replied with quiet perverseness but i know for all that father eudes read that our lord was born in a cratch or laid in one because there was no room in the inn and they do not behave in that way to kings and nobles that is the lot of the villein and he chose the villeins lot and i a villein have been giving him thanks for it and nothing that i could say would disturb her calm conviction damoiselle melisende told me some interesting things as we rode back to the holy city asthat jerusalem is very badly supplied with water and the villeins collect and drink only rainwater of course this does not affect the nobles who drink wine about two leagues from jerusalem towards the north is a little village called jericho where the walls of the house of madame saint rahab are still standing she was a great lady who received into her house certain spies sent by monseigneur saint joshua and hid them behind the arras now there againif that stupid old marguerite would not have it that madame saint rahab kept a cabaret how could a great lady keep a cabaret i wish she would give over listening if it makes her take such fancies damoiselle melisende also told me that adam our first father was buried in the place where our lord was crucified and our lords blood fell upon him and he came to life again and so did many others and adam wept for his son abel one hundred years moreover there is a rock still standing in the place where the wicked jews had their temple which was in the holiest place of all and here our lord was wont to repose whilst his disciples confessed themselves to him all these legends may be found in the travels of sir john mandeville coming home we passed by the golden gate which is the gate whereby our lord entered the holy city on the ass and the gate opened to him of its own accord damoiselle melisende bade me observe three marks in the stone where the ass had set his feet the marks i certainly saw but i could not have told that they were the print of an asss hoofs i suppose i was not worthy to behold them quite distinctly guy called me to him this evening little lynette he said i have something to tell thee let me spare thee the pains guy answered i mischievously dost thou think i have no eyes i saw it the first night we came saw what asked guy with an astonished look that thy beautiful lady had appeared i replied thou art going to wed with lady sybil what fairy whispered it to thee little witch said guy laughing thou art right lynette the king hath bestowed on me the regency of the kingdom and the hand of his fair sister tomorrow in presence of the nobles i am to be solemnly appointed regent and a month hence in the church of the holy sepulchre i wed with the lady sybil if thou art happy guy i am very glad said i and i said it honestly happy i should think so cried he to be regent of the land of all lands and she lynetteshe is a gem and a treasure i am sure of that guy said i and now my news is not finished little sister said he the king has given amaury a wife oh poor thingwho is it said i guy laughed till his eyes were full of tears poor thingwho said he amaury or his bride oh the bride of course said i amaury wont care a straw for her and she will be worried out of her life if she does not dress to please him let us hope that she will then answered guy still laughing it is the damoiselle eschine dibellin daughter of messire de rames thou dost not know her dost thouwhat is she like oh most women are like one another said guywhat a falsehood except my fair lady and thee little lynette and the lady clemence thy fair mothera woman is a woman and that is all oh indeed said i rather indignantly a man is a man i suppose and that is all guy i am astonished at thee if amaury had said such a thing i should not have wondered men are different of course answered guy but a womans business is to look pretty and be attractive everybody understands that nobody expects a woman to be over wise or clever thou hadst better be quiet guy if thou dost not want thine ears boxed said i if that is not a speech enough to vex any woman i never heard one you men are the most aggravating creatures you seem to look upon us as a kind of pretty animal to be kept for a pet and plaything and if you are not too obtuse yourselves to find out that your plaything occasionally shows signs of a soul within it you cry out look here this toy of mine is actually exhibiting scintillations of something which really looks almost like human intellect let me tell you sir count we have as much humanity and sense and individuality as yourselves and rather more independence pretty phrases and courtly reverences and professions of servitude may sound very well in your ears and of those you give us plenty does it never occur to you that we should thank you a great deal more for a little genuine respect and consideration we are not toys we are not pet animals we are not pretty pictures we are human creatures with human feelings like yourselves we can put up with fewer compliments to our complexions if you please and a little more realisation of our separate consciences and intellects ha lusignan cried guy looking half ashamed and half amused sainte marguerite for poitou upon my word lynette i have had a lecture i shall not forget it in a hurry yes said i and thou feelest very much as if lady isabels pet monkey had opened its mouth and uttered some wise apothegms upon the rights of apes not that thou hast an atom more respect for the rights of apes in general but that thou art a little astonished and amused with that one ape in particular guy went off laughing and i returned to my embroidery really i never did see any thing like these men nobody expects a woman to be wise forsooth that is of course no man a woman is nobody i do not believe that men like a woman to be wise they seem to take it as a personal insultas though every spark of intellect added to our brains left theirs duller and a womans mission in life is of course to please the mennot to make the most of herself as an individual human soul that is treason usurpation impertinence they will see what they will see i can live without them and i mean to do chapter vi the perversity of people do one good is it good if i dont want it done now do let me grumble and groan it is all very well other folks should have fun but why cant they let me alone damoiselle melisende and i have been busy all morning in laying out dried herbs under the superintendence of lady judith the herbs of this land are not like those of poitou there was cassiaof which one variety lady judith says is taken as medicine to clear the system and purify the bloodand garlic which they consider an antidote to poisonand the wild gourd which is medicine for the liverand hyssop spikenard wormwood a cure for vertigo and many others two curious fruits they have here which i never heard of in poitou the one is a dark fleshy stonefruit very nice indeed which they call plums or damascenes they grow chiefly at damascus the other grows on trees around the dead sea and is the apple of sodom very lovely to the eye but as soon as you bite it you find nothing but a mouthful of ashes i was so amused with this fruit that i brought some home and showed them to marguerite senna colocynth introduced into europe by the crusaders ah the world is full of those she said when she had tried one and found out what sort of thing it was thou art quite mistaken margot said i they are found but in this country and only in one particular spot those that can be seen very likely said she but the unseen fruit my damoiselle grows all over the world and men and women are running after it all their lives then i saw what she meant they have no apples here at all but citrons and quinces which are not unlike apples the golden citron is a beautiful fruit juicy and pleasant and lady judith says some people reckon it to be the golden apples of the hesperides which were guarded by dragons and likewise the apples of gold of which monseigneur king solomon speaks in holy writ there are almonds and dates and cucumbers and large luscious figs and grapes and melons and mulberries and several kinds of nuts and olives and pomegranates quinces are here thought to make children clever they make no hay in this country oranges as for their stuffs there are new and beautiful ones here they weave byssus and a very fine transparent stuff called muslin crape comes from cyprus and damask from damascus whence it is named but the fairest of all their stuffs is the baudekyn of which we have none in europeespecially the golden baudekyn which is like golden samite i have bought two lovely pieces for alix the one goldcolour the other blue cotton some very curious customs they have here which are not common in europe instead of carrying lanterns when one walks or rides at night they hang out lanterns in the streets so that all are lighted at once it seems to me rather a good idea guy has been telling us some strange things about the saracens of course i knew before that they worship idols and deal in the black art but it seems that saladin when he marches makes known his approach by a dreadful machine produced by means of magic which roars louder than a lion and strikes terror into every christian ear that is so unhappy as to be within hearing this is of course by the machinations of the devil since it is impossible that any true catholic could be frightened of a saracen otherwise all mediaeval christians thought this the first drum on record we are all very busy preparing for the weddings there are to be three on three successive days on the saturday amaury is to be married to damoiselle eschine poor thinghow i pity her i would not marry amaury to be empress on the sunday guy weds with lady sybil and on monday lady isabel with messire homfroy de tours i think lady sybil grows sweeter and sweeter i love heroh so much she asked me if guy had told me the news i said he had and dost thou like it lynette she asked shyly very much indeed said iif you love him lady love him she said and she covered her face with her hands o lynette if thou knewest how well he is my first love i was wedded to my lord of montferrat when both of us were little children we never chose each other i hope i did my best to make him a good and dutiful wife i know i tried to do so but i never knew what love meant as concerned him never till he came hither well i am sure guy loves her butshall i own to having been the least bit disappointed with what he said the other day about women i should not have cared if amaury had said it i know he despises womeni have noticed that brainless men always doand i should not have expected any thing better but i did not look for it from guy several times in my life dearly as i love him guy has rather disappointed me why do people disappoint one in that way is it that one sets up too high a standard and they fall short of it i think i will ask lady judith what she thinks she has lived long enough to know i found an opportunity for a chat with lady judith the very next day we were busy broidering lady sybils weddingdress the supertunic of which is to be white baudekyn diapered in gold and broidered with deep red roses she wears white on account of being a widow lady isabel will be in goldcoloured baudekyn and my new sister eschine in rose damask i have said nothing about eschine though she is here it was because i had not any thing to say her eyes hair and complexion are of no colour in particular she is not beautifulnor ugly she is not agreeablenor disagreeable she talks very little i feel absolutely indifferent to her i should think she would just do for amaury wellwe were broidering the tunic lady judith doing the gold and i the red and damoiselle melisende had been with us working the green leaves but the lady queen sent for her and she went away so lady judith and i were left alone holy mother said i give me leave to ask you a question surely my child said she any one thou wilt then holy motherdo people ever disappoint you i mean when you fancy you know a man does he never surprise you by some action which you think unworthy of him and which you would not have expected from him lady judiths first answer was an amused smile who has been disappointing thee helena oh nobody in particular said i hastily for how could i accuse guy loyaute damour forbid but i mean in general generals are made of particulars helena but i have not answered thy question yes certainly i have known such a feeling and if it please you holy mother what is the reason of it said i does one set up ones standard of right truth and beauty too high that is not possible my child i should rather think thou hast set up the man too high oh said i deprecatingly hast thou ever heard a saying helena that a man sees only that which he brings eyes to see there is much truth in it no man can understand a character which is higher or broader than his own admire it he may enter into it he cannot human character is a very complicated thing then one may be too low to see a mans character true and one may be too high a single eye will never understand a double oneor they may be too far asunder a miser and a spendthrift are both in the wrong but neither of them can feel with the other but where the temperaments are alike said i for i always think guy and i were cast in the same mould they never are quite alike she replied as in a shield borne by two brothers there is always a difference pray you holy mother do you think my brother guy and me alike alike yet very different she said and smiled cast from one mouldyet he on the one side of it and thou on the other what do you think is the difference holy mother may i know wouldst thou like to know helena she said and smiled again oh i think i can bear to hear my faults said i my pride is not of that sort no she said but thou art very proud little one certainly said i i am noble lady judith looked suddenly up at me with a kind of tender look in her grey eyes which are so like and yet so unlike lady sybils eyes little maid tell me one thing is thine heart at rest i have never been at rest holy mother i do not know how to get it no dear heart thy shoulder is not under the yoke listen to the words of the masterthy lord and mine take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls little maiden wilt thou not come and learn of him he is the only one in heaven or earth who will never disappoint thee rather bitter tears were filling my eyes i dont know how i said no dear heart he knows how said lady judith only tell him thou art willing to learn of himif thou art willing helena i have had some thoughts of going into the cloister said i buti could not leave guy dear child canst thou not learn the lessons of god without going into the cloister i thought not said i one cannot serve the good god and remain in the worldcan one ah what is the world said lady judith walls will not shut it out its root is in thine own heart little one butyour pardon holy motheryou yourself have chosen the cloister nay my child i do not say i might not have done so but in fact it was chosen for me this veil has been upon my head helena since i was five years old yet you would not deny holy mother that a nun is better than a wife i trust that i shall not be misunderstood or supposed to express any approbation of conventual life at the date of this story an unmarried woman who was not a nun was a phenomenon never seen and no woman who preferred single life had any choice but to be a nun in these early times also nuns had more liberty and monasticism as well as religion in general was free from some corruptions introduced in later years the original nunneries were simply houses where single women could live together in comfort and safety and were always seminaries of learning and charitable institutions most of them were very different places at the date of the dissolution better i am not so sure happieryes i think so most people would say just the opposite would they not said i laughing most men and some women she answered with a smile but monseigneur saint paul thought a woman happier who abode without marriage that is what i should like best but how can i without being a nun perhaps if i were an eremitess like your nobility i might still get leave from my superiors to live with guy it is always guy with thee remarked lady judith smiling does guy never disappoint thee my child it was on my lips to say oh nobut i felt my cheeks grow hot and i did not quite like to tell a downright lie i am sure lady judith saw it but she kindly took no notice however at this point damoiselle melisende came back to her leaves and we began to talk of something else i asked marguerite at night if people disappointed her did my damoiselle expect never to be disappointed she answered turning the question on myself at once old people do they seem to think one always means ones self however careful one may be then i am afraid she will be disappointed but why said i why dont people do right as one expects them to do does one always know what is right as to whythere are the world the flesh and the devil against it and if it were not for the grace of the good god any one of them would be more than enough the world the flesh and the devil the worldthat is other people and they do provoke one and make one do wrong terribly sometimes but the fleshwhy that is me i dont prevent myself doing right marguerite must be mistaken then what is grace one hears a great deal about it but i never properly understood what it was it certainly is no gift that one can see and handle i suppose it must be something which the good god puts into our minds but what is it i will ask lady judith and marguerite being old they seem to know things and marguerite has a great deal of sense for a villein then having been my nurse and always dwelt with nobles she is not quite like a common villein though of course the blood must remain the same i wonder what it is about lady isabel which i do not like i have been puzzling over it and i am no nearer it feels to me as if there were something slippery about her she is very gracious and affable but i should never think of calling her sweetat least not sweet like her sister she seems just the opposite of lady judith who never stops to think whether it is her place to do any thing but just does it because it wants doing lady isabel on the contrary seems to me to do only what she wants doing in some inexplicable manner she slides out of every thing which she does not fancy and yet she so manages it that one never sees she is doing it at the time i never can fathom people of that sort but i do not like them as for darling lady sybil i love her better and better every day i do not wonder at guy of guy himself i see very little he is regent of the kingdom and too busy to attend to any thing marguerite i said what is grace does my damoiselle mean the grace of the good god i nodded i think it is help she answered but what sort of help the sort we need at the minute but i do not quite understand said i we get grace when we receive the good lord but we do not get help help for what if my damoiselle does not feel that she needs help perhaps that is the reason why she does not get it ah but we do get it in the holy mass can we receive our lord and not receive grace do we always and all receive our lord margot is not that heresy ha i do not know if it be truth it can hardly be but does not holy church teach that whenever we eat the holy bread the presence of our lord comes down into our hearts holy church had gone no further than this in bare transubstantiation was not adopted by authority till about thirty years later i suppose he will come if we want him said marguerite thoughtfully but scarcely i should think if we ate that bread with our hearts set on something else and not caring whether he came or not i was rather afraid to pursue the question with margot for i keep feeling afraid every now and then when she says things of that sort whether she has not received some strange heretical notion from that man in sackcloth who preached at the cross at lusignan i cannot help fancying that he must be one of those heretics who lately crept into england and king henry the father had them whipped and turned out of doors forbidding any man to receive them or give them aid it was a very bitter winter and they soon perished of hunger and cold as i suppose such caitiffs ought yet some of them were women and i could not but feel pity for the poor innocent babes that one or two had in their arms and the people who saw them said they never spoke a bitter word but as soon as they understood their penalty and the punishment that would follow harbouring them they begged no more but wandered up and down the snowy streets in company singingonly fancy singing and first one and then another dropped and died and the rest heaped snow over them with their hands which was the only burial they could give and then they went on singingalways singing i asked damoiselle elisinde de ferrersit was she who told mewhat they sang she said they sang always the holy psalter or else the nativity song of the angelsglory to god in the higheston earth peace towards men of goodwill and at last they were all dead under the snow but oneone poor old man who survived last and he went on alone singing he tottered out of the towni think it was lincoln but i am not sureand as far as mens ears could follow they caught his thin quavering voice still singingglory to god in the highest and the next morning they found him laid in a ditch not singingdead but on his face was such a smile as a saint might have worn at his martyrdom and his eyes gazing straight up into heaven as if the angels themselves had come down to help him to finish his song vulgate version this is the first persecution on record in england of professing christians by professing christians oh i cannot understand if this is heresy and wickedness wherein lies the difference from truth and holiness i must ask lady judith oh dear why will peoplei do think it is too bad i never thought of such a thing if it had been amaury nowbut that guy of all people in all this world come i had better tell my story straight i was coming down the long gallery after dinner to the bower of the lady queen where i meant to go on with my embroidery and i thought i might perhaps get a quiet talk with lady judith all at once i felt myself pulled back by one of my sleeves and i guessed directly who had caught me why guyon i have not seen thee for an age and i want to see thee for a small age answered he laughing how many weddings are there to be next week lynette why three said i thou wist as well as i what wouldst thou say to four wish them good fortune so i am not the bride ah but suppose thou wert cry my eyes out i think hitherto guy had spoken as if he were jesting now he changed his tone seriously elaine i am thinking of it thou knowest thou camest hither for that object i came hither for that cried i in hot indignation thou wert sent hither then answered guy half laughing at my tone do not be so hot little one monseigneur expects it i can assure thee art thou going to wed me against my will o guy i never thought it of thee exclaimed i pitifully for that was the bitterest dropthat guy should be willing to part with me no no my darling lynette said guy taking my hands in his thou shalt not be wed against thy will i do assure thee if thou dost not like the knight i had chosen i will never force him upon thee but it would be an excellent matchand of course i should be glad to see thee comfortably settled thou mightest guess that might i that is just what i never should have guessed do men ever understand women settled guy i said what dost thou mean by settled what is there about me that is unsettled now that is one of thy queer notions answered guy of course no woman is considered settled till she marries i should think it was just the most unsettling thing in the world said i lynette thou wert born in the wrong age said guy i do not know in what age thou wert born but certainly not this and thou wouldst be glad to lose me guy nay not glad to lose thee little onei think guy saw that had hurt mebut glad for thine own sake why lynette crying for what dear foolish child i could hardly have told him only the world had gone dark and dreary i know he never meant to be unkind oh no i suppose people dont generally they do not find out that they have hurt you unless you scream nor perhaps then if they are making a noise themselves my dear little sister said guy againand very lovingly he said itwhy are all these tears no man shall marry thee without thy leave i am surprised i thought women were always ready to be married ah that was it he did not understand and thou art not even curious to hear whom it should have been what would that matter said i trying to crush back a few more hundreds of tears which would have liked to come but tell me if thou wilt messire tristan de montluc he said it flashed on me all at once that messire tristan had tried to take the bridle of my horse when we came from the church of the nativity i might have guessed what was coming then a tacit declaration of love to a lady does that make any difference asked guy smiling no said i none and the poor fellow is to break his heart i dare say it will piece again said i guy laughed and patted me on the shoulder come dry all those tears there is nothing to cry about farewell and away he went whistling a troubadour song nothing to cry about yes that was all he knew i went to my own chamber sent bertrade out of it and finished my cry then i washed my face and when i thought all traces were gone i went down to my embroidery lady judith was alone in the bower she looked up with her usual kind smile as i took the seat opposite but the smile gave way in an instant to a graver look ah she saw all was not right i was silent and went on working but in a minute without any warning lady judith was softly singing the words struck me art thou weary art thou languid art thou sore distressed come to me saith one and coming be at rest hath he marks to lead me to him if he be my guide in his feet and hands are woundprints and his side is there diadem as monarch that his brow adorns yea a crown in very surety but of thorns if i find him if i follow what his guerdon here many a sorrow many a labour many a tear if i still hold closely to him what hath he at last sorrow vanquished labour ended jordan past if i ask him to receive me will he say me nay not till earth and not till heaven pass away oh your pardon holy mother for interrupting you said damoiselle melisende coming in some haste but the lady queen sent me to ask when the lady sybils tunic will be finished her leaves are finished but not my roses nor lady judiths gold diapering i felt much obliged to her for something in the hymn had so touched me that the tears were very near my eyes again lady judith answered that she thought it would be done tomorrow and melisende ran off again hast thou heard that hymn before helena said lady judith busy with the diaper never holy mother said i as well as i could did it please thee now it brought the tears into my eyes said i not sorry for the excuse they had not far to come had they little one i looked up and met her soft grey eyes andit was very silly of me buti burst into tears once more it is always best to have a fit of weeping out said she thou wilt feel better for it my child but i hadhad it outonce sobbed i ah not quite answered lady judith there was more to come little one it seems so foolish i said wiping my eyes at last i do not exactly know why i was crying those tears are often bitter ones said lady judith for sometimes it means that we dare not look and see why i thought that was rather my position for indeed the bitter ingredient in my pain at that moment was one which i did not like to put into words even to myself it was not that guy did not love me oh no i knew he did it was not even that i did not stand first in his love i was ready to yield that place to lady sybil perhaps i should not have been quite so ready had it been to any one else butthere was the stinghe did not love me as i loved him he could do without me and i could have no comfort from sympathy because in the first place the only person whose sympathy would have been a comfort to me was the very one who had distressed me and in the second place i had a vague idea underlying my grief that i had no business to feel any that every body if they knew would tell me i was exceedingly sillythat it was only what i ought to have expectedand all sorts of uncomfortable consolations of that kind was i a foolish baby crying for the moonor was i a grand heroine of romance whose feelings were so exquisitely delicate and sensitive that the common clay of which other people were made could not be expected to understand me i could not tell oh why must we come out of that sweet old world where we walked hand in hand and were all in all to each other why must we grow up and drift asunder and never be the same to one another any more was i wickedor was i only miserable about the last item at any rate there was no doubt i sat thinking sad thoughts and trying to see my work through halfdimmed eyes when lady judith spoke again helena she said grief has two voices and many only hear the upper and louder one i shall be sorry to see thee miss that lower stiller voice which is by far the more important of the two what do you mean holy mother i asked dear heart she said the louder voice which all must hear chants in a minor key this world is not your rest it is a sad sad song more especially to those who have heard little of it before but many miss the soft sweet music of the undertone which iscome unto me and i will give you rest yet it is always thereif we will only listen but a thing which is done cannot be undone said i no she answered it cannot but can it not be compensated if thou lose a necklace of gilt copper and one give thee a gold carcanet instead hast thou really sustained any loss yes i answered almost astonished at my own boldness if the copper carcanet were a lovegift from the dead what gold could make up to me for that ah my child she replied with a quick change in her tone it was almost as if she had saidi did not understand thee to mean thatfor those losses of the heart there is but one remedy but there is one costly and farfetched methinks said i sighing costly ay in truth she replied but farfetched no it is close to thee if thou wilt but stretch forth thine hand and grasp it what holy mother her voice sank to a low and very reverent tone nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt i cannot i sobbed no thou couldst not she said quietly until thou lovest the will of him that died for thee better than thou lovest the will of helene de lusignan o holy mother i cried i could not set up my will against the good god couldst thou not was all she said have i done that i faltered ask thine own conscience replied lady judith dear child he loved not his will when he came down from heaven to do the will of god his father that will was to save his church little helena was it to save thee how can i know holy mother it is worth knowing she said yes it is worth knowing said i but how can we know what wouldst thou give to know it not that it can be bought but what is it worth in thine eyes i thought and thought but i could not tell wherewith to measure any thing so intangible wouldst thou give up having thine own will for one year she asked i know not what might happen in it said i with a rather frightened feeling why i might marry or be ill or die or guy might give over loving me altogether in that year oh i could not could not will that and a year is such a long long time no i could notfor such a time as thatlet myself slip into nothing as it were helena she said suppose at this moment god were to send an angel down to thee from heaven suppose he brought to thee a message from god himself that if thou wouldst be content to leave all things to his ordering for one year and to have no will at all in the matter he would see that nothing was done which should really harm thee in the least what wouldst thou say oh then i should dare to leave it said i my child if thou art of his redeemed he has said itnot for one short year but for all thy life if helena ahif i said with a sigh lady judith wrought at her gold diapering and i at my roses and we were both silent for a season then the lady queen and the lady isabel came in and there was no further opportunity for quiet conversation chapter vii a little cloud out of the sea coming events cast their shadows before campbell it is monday night and i amoh so tired the three grand weddings are over very beautiful sights they were and very pleasant the feasts and the dances but all is done now and if messire renaud feels any doubt tonight about his body being himself i have none about mine eschine made a capital bride in the sense in which a man would use the words that is she looked very nice and she stood like a statue i do not believe she had an idea in her head beyond these that she was going to be married that it was a very delightful thing and that she must look well and behave becomingly is that the sort of woman that men like it is the sort that some men seem to think all women are but amaury if ever i did see a creature more absurd than he i do not know who it was he fidgetted over eschines bridal dress precisely as if he had been her milliner at the very last minute the garland had to be altered because it did not suit him most charming of all the weddings was guys dear lady sybil was so beautiful and behaved so perfectly as i should judge of a brides behavioura little soft moisture dimming her dark eyes and a little gentle tremulousness in her sweet lips her dress was simply enchantingsoft and white perhaps lady isabel made the most splendidlooking bride of the three for her dress was gorgeous and while lady sybils style of beauty is by far the more artistic and poetical lady isabels is certainly the more showy so far as i could judge the three brides regarded their bridegrooms with very different eyes to eschine he was an accident of the rite a portion of the ceremony which it would spoil the show to leave out to lady isabel he was a new horse just mounted interesting to try and a pleasant triumph to subdue but to lady sybil he was the sun and centre of all and every thing deserved attention just in proportion as it concerned him i almost hope that eschine does not love amaury for i feel sure she will be very unhappy if she do as to messire homfroy de tours i do not think lady isabel will find him a pleasant charger he is any thing but spirited and seems to me to have a little of the mule about hima creature who would be given at times to taking the bit in his teeth and absolutely refusing to go a yard further and now it is all overthe pageants and the feasts and the dancing and i cannot tell why i am sad how is it or why is it that after one has enjoyed any thing very much one always does feel sad i think except to the bride and bridegroom a wedding is a very sorrowful thing i suppose guy would say that was one of my queer notions but it looks to me so terribly like a funeral there is a bustle and a show and then you wake up and miss one out of your life it is true the one can come back still but does he come back to be yours any more i think the instances must be very very few in which it is so and only where both are to you very near and dear i think marguerite saw i looked tired and sad there have been light hearts today she said and there have been heavy ones but the light of today may be the heavy of tomorrow and the sorrow of tonight may turn to joy in the morning i do feel sorrowful margot but i do not know why my damoiselle is weary and all great joy brings a dull tired feeling after it i suppose it is the infirmity of earth the angels do not feel so i should like to be an angel said i it must be so nice to fly and i said marguerite but not for that reason i should like to have no sin and to see the good god oh dear said i that is just what i should not like in the sense of never doing wrong it might be all very well but i should not want never to have any amusement which i suppose thou meanest and seeing the good god would frighten me dreadfully does my damoiselle remember the time when little jacquot bertrades brother set fire to the hayrick by playing with lighted straws oh yes very well why what has that to do with it does she recollect how he shrieked and struggled when robert and pierre took him and carried him into the hall for monseigneur himself to judge him for his naughtiness oh yes margot i really felt sorry for the child he was so terrified and yet it was half ludicrousmonseigneur did not even have him whipped yet if i remember rightly my damoiselle was standing by monseigneurs side at the very time and she did not look frightened in the least will she allow her servant to ask why why should i margot i had done nothing wrong and why is my damoiselle more like jacquot than herself when she comes to think of seeing the good god ahthou wouldst like me to say because i have done wrong i suppose yes but i think there was another reason as well what was that margot my damoiselle is monseigneurs own child she knows him he loves her and she knows it but we are all children of the good god margot will my damoiselle pardon me we are all his creatures not all his children oh no no o margot said i suddenly didst thou note that tall dark handsome knight who stood on count guys left handcount raymond of tripoli he in the mantle lined with black sable and goldbarred scarlet hose that is the man i mean i saw him why if it please my damoiselle didst thou like him my damoiselle did not like him marguerite is very fond of answering one question by another i did not and i could not tell why nor i but i could then tell me margot my damoiselle every man has a mark upon his brow which the good god and his angels can see but few men see it and in some it is not easy to see many foreheads look blank to our eyes but sooner or later one of the two marks is certain to shine fortheither the holy cross of our lord or the badge of the great enemy the star that fell from heaven and what i saw on that mans lofty brow was not the cross of christ but the star of satan margot thy queer fancies said i laughing now tell me prithee on whose forehead in this house thou seest the cross the lady judith she answered without the least hesitation and i think the lady sybil let my damoiselle pardon me if i cannot name any other with certainty i have weak eyes for such sights i have hope of monseigneur count guy margot margot cried i thou uncharitable old creature only three what not the lady queen nor the lady isabel nor the holy patriarch oh fie let my damoiselle pardon her servant the lady queenah i have no right to say she looks blank to me the cross may be there and i may be blind but the patriarchno and the lady isabelthe good god forgive me if i sin but i believe i see the star on her and on me said i laughing to hide a curious sensation which i felt much akin to mortification yet what did old marguerites foolish fancies matter i was surprised to see her worn old eyes suddenly fill with tears my sweet damoiselle she said the good god bring out the holy cross on the brow that i love so well but as yetif i speak at all i must speak truthi have not seen it there i could not make out why i did not like the count of tripoli he is a very handsome maneven my partial eyes must admit handsomer than guy but there is a strange look in his eyes as if you only saw the lid of a coffer and beneath inside the coffer there might be something dark and dangerous guy says he is a splendid fellow but guy always was given to making sudden friendships and to imagining all his friends to be angels until he discovered they were men i very much doubt the angelic nature of count raymond i do not like him but what a queer fancy this is of old margueritesthat satan puts marks on some people yet i cannot help wishing she had not said that about me and i do not think it was very respectful she might have said something more civil whatever she thought marguerite always will speak just as she thinks that is like a villein it would never do for us nobles guy has now been regent of the holy land for half a year some people seem to fancy that he is rather too stern such a comical ideaand of guy of all people i think i know how it is guy is very impulsive in enterprise and very impetuous in pursuing it and he sees that during the kings illness every thing has gone wrong and fallen into disorder and of course it will not do to let things go on so people must be governed and kept in their places of course they must why if there were no order kept the nobles and the villeins would be all mixed up with each other and some of the more intelligent and ambitious of the villeins might even begin to fancy themselves on a par with the nobles for there is a sort of intelligence in some of those people though it must be of quite a different order from the intellect of the nobles i used to think villeins never were ambitious but i have learned lately that some of them do entertain some such feeling it must be a most dangerous idea to get into a villeins headthough of course right and proper enough for a noble but i cannot imagine why villeins cannot be contented with their place did not providence make them villeinsand if they have plenty of food and clothing and shelter and fire and a good dance now and then on the village green and an extra holiday when the seigneurs daughter is married or when his son comes of agewhat can they possibly want more i said so to marguerite ah that is all the nobles know she answered quietly enough but with some fire in the old eyes they do not realise that we are men just as they are god sent us into his world with just as much body and soul as he did them we have intellects and hearts and consciences just like them just likeonly fancy i trust the good god may not have to teach it them through pain but they ought to be satisfied said i i am perfectly content with my place in the world why are they not contented it is easier to be content with velvet than duffle said marguerite more calmly it looks better and feels softer too if my damoiselle were to try the duffle for a day perhaps she would complain that it felt harsh to me very likely said i but a villein would not have a fine skin like mine the finest skin does not always cover the finest feelings said marguerite in her dry way what a very silly idea of course those people cannot have such feelings as i have it would be quite absurd to think so i do think however that what vexed me most of any thing was that amaurythat silly little boyshould take it into his head to lecture guy on the way he chose to govern as if he could know anything about it why he is two whole years younger than guy i told him so feeling really vexed at his impudence and what should he say but that i was seven years younger than he i know that but i am a woman and women have always more sense than men at least i have more sense than amaury i should be an idiot if i had not i have made a discovery today which has astonished me lady judith has a whole bible and psalter too of her own not written in latin but in her own tongue in which she was bornthat is greek and she says that a great part of the bibleall the holy evangels and the writings of messeigneurs the holy apostleswere originally written in greek i always thought that holy scripture had been written in latin i asked her if latin were not the language the holy angels spoke and our lord when he was upon earth she answered that she did not think we knew what language the holy angels spoke and she should doubt if it were any tongue spoken on earth but that the good god and messeigneurs the holy apostles she had no doubt at all spoke greek it sounds very strange lady isabel has had a violent quarrel with her lord and goes about with set lips and her head erect as if she were angry with every one i almost think eschine improves upon acquaintance not that i find her any cleverer than i expected but i think she is goodnatured and seems to have no malice in her if amaury stormsas he does sometimesshe just lets the whirlwind blow over her and never gives him a cross word i could not do that i suppose that is why i admire it in eschine a young nun came this morning to visit lady judithone of her own order i could not quite understand their conversation sister eudoxiafor that is her namestruck me as being the holiest religious person i have ever seen she spoke so beautifully i thought about the perfection one could attain to in this life how ones whole heart and soul might be so permeated with god that one might pass through life without committing any deed of sin or thinking any evil thought not of course that i could ever attain to such perfection but it sounded very beautiful and holy i was quite surprised to see how constrained and even cool lady judith was it was only yesterday that she assented warmly to old marguerites saying that no one who served god could love any kind of sin but with sister eudoxiawho spoke so much more charmingly on the same subjectshe sat almost silent and when she did speak it seemed to be rather in dissent than assent it puzzled me when sister eudoxia was gone lady sybil said oh what happiness if one could attain to the perfection of living absolutely without sin we shall answered lady judith but it will not be in this world but sister eudoxia says it might be ah my poor sister eudoxia said lady judith sadly she has taken up with a heresy nearly as old as christianity itself and worse than than that of messire renaud de montluc because it has so much more truth in it ay so much mixture of truth and so much apparent loveliness that it can be no wonder if it almost deceive the very elect beware of being entangled in it my children heresy holy mother cried lady sybil with a shocked look i thought i had never heard any one ascribe more of the glory of our salvation to god than she did for she said that every thing was done for us by the good lord and that even our perfection was wrought by him for us and not by him in us said lady judith the very point of the heresy my child eudoxia sees no distinction between the righteousness done for us which is our ground of justification before god and the holiness wrought in us which is our conformity to his image the first was finished on the rood eleven centuries ago the second goes on in the heart of every child of god here and now she is one of those who without intending it or even knowing that they do it do yet sadly fail to realise the work of the holy ghost but how much she spoke of the blessed spirit objected lady sybil my daughter said lady judith with a smile hast thou not yet found out the difference between names and things there are many men who worship god most devoutly but it is a god they have made to themselves every man on earth is ready to love and serve god with his whole heartif he may set up god after his own pattern and what that really means is a god as like as possible to himself who will look with perfect complacency on the darling sins which he cherishes and may then be allowed to condemn with the utmost sternness all evil passions to which he is not addicted that sounds very shocking holy mother said lady sybil we are all liable to the temptation replied lady judith and are apt to slide into it ere we know it we all wrought for a little time in silence when lady sybil said what do you call that heresy holy mother into which you say that sister eudoxia has fallen if thou wilt look into the vision of the apostle blessed john called the apocalypse answered lady judith thou wilt see what christ our lord calls it this thou hast that thou rejectest the teaching of the nicolaitanes which i hate but i thought said lady sybil looking rather surprised that those nicolaitanes who were heretics in the early church held some very horrible doctrines and led extremely wicked lives the holy patriarch was speaking of them not long ago ah my child said lady judith men do not leap but grow into great wickedness dost thou not see how the doctrine works first it is possible to live and do no sin secondly i can live and do no sin thirdly i do live and not sin lastly when this point is reachedwhatever my spiritual instinct does not condemni being thus perfectcannot be sin therefore i may do what i please if i lie murder stealwhich would be dreadful sins in anotherthey are no sins in me because of my perfection and is this following christ assuredly not but does sister eudoxia really imagine that oh no responded lady judith she has not reached that point comparatively few get so far on the road as that but that is whither the road is leading them then what is the root of the heresy that which i believe lies at the root of every heresyrejecting gods word that we may keep our own traditions the stem may perhaps consist of two things the want of sufficient lowliness and the want of a right knowledge of sin it is not enough realised that a mans conscience like all else in him has been injured by the fall but conscience is looked on as a heavenly judge still in its original purity this as thou mayest guess leads to depreciation of the word of god and exaltation of the conscience over the word and also it is not properly seen that while a man lives the flesh shall live with him and the flesh and the renewed spirit must be in perpetual warfare to the end but we know said lady sybiland there she paused we know repeated lady judith with a smile ah my child we think we know a great deal and we are like children playing on the seashore who fancy that they know all that is in the sea because they have scooped up a little seawater in their hands there are heights and depths in gods word and in gods purposes which you and i have never reached yetwhich perhaps we shall never reach for as the heaven is high above the earth so are his ways higher than our ways and his thoughts than our thoughts i was curious to know what marguerite would say she always agrees so strangely with lady judith even when they have not talked the matter over at all so i said when i went up to change my dress margot dost thou commit sin my damoiselle thinks me so perfect then said she with a rather comical look i could not help laughing well not quite when thou opposest my will said i but dost thou know there are some people who say that they live without sin that may be when to contradict the holy evangels is a mark of perfection said marguerite drily well what hast thou heard about that in thy listening margot said i laughing the first thing i heard perplexed me said she it was of monseigneur saint john who said that he that is born of god doth not commit sin and it troubled me sorely for a time since i knew i did sin and feared lest i was therefore not born of god but one day father eudes read again from the very same writing that if any man sin we have an advocate with the father and likewise that if we say we have no sin we are liars so then i thought well how is this monseigneur the holy apostle would not contradict himself but still i could not see how to reconcile them though i thought and thought till my brain felt nearly cracked and all at once father eudes readthanks be to the good godsomething from monseigneur saint paul which put it all right what was that ah i could not get it by heart it was too difficult and very long but it was something like this that in a christian man there are two hearts of which the one which is from god does not sin at all and the other which is the evil heart born in us is always committing sin but margot which of thy two hearts is thyself ha i cannot answer such questions the good god will know but art thou sure those are not wicked people certainly no monseigneur saint paul said i and me all through oh but margothe could not have meant himself if he had not meant what he said i should think he would have mentioned it said marguerite in her dry quaint style well a holy apostle is different of course said i but it looks very odd to me that anybody living now should fancy he never does wrong ah the poor soul said marguerite the good god knows better if he do not chapter viii as good as most people the best way to see divine light is to put out your own candle this morning the lady princess of antioch visited the lady queen and remained for the day taking her departure only just before the gates were closed for she preferred to camp out at night she is quite young and is a niece of the lady queen after she was gone we were talking about her in the bower and from her we came to speak of the late princess her lords mother pray do not talk of her said lady isabel she made herself a byeword by her shameless behaviour only thoughtless remonstrated lady sybil gently i never thought she deserved what was said of her oh noyou never think anybody does sneered her sister i could not have associated with such a woman she must have known what was said of her i wonder that she was brazen enough to show herself in public at all but think isabel i do not believe she did know you know she was not at all clever she was halfwitted or not much better was the answer oh yes i know that but she must have known i do not think she did said lady sybil earnestly then she ought to have known sharply replied lady isabel i wonder they did not shut her up she was a pest to society o isabel deprecated her sister she was very goodnatured sybil i never saw any one like you you would have found a good word for judas iscariot hardly said lady sybil just as gently as before but perhaps i might have helped finding evil ones there are pearlgatherers and dirtgatherers quietly remarked lady judith who had hitherto listened in silence the latter have by far the larger cargo but the handful of the former outweighs it in value what do you mean holy mother inquired lady isabel turning quickly to herrather too sharply i thought to be altogether respectful only let her that thinketh she standeth take heed lest she fall said lady judith with a quiet smile i said lady isabel with a world of meaning in her tone my child was the reply they that undertake to censure the cleanness of their neighbours robes should be very careful to avoid any spot on the purity of their own dost thou not remember our lords saying about the mote and the beam well said lady isabel bringing her scissors together with a good deal of snap i think that those who associate with such people as the princess constantia bring a reflection on their own characters snow and soot do not go well together the soot defiles the snow responded lady judith but it does not affect the sunbeam i do not understand you said lady isabel bluntly those who confide in their own strength and goodness isabel are like the snowvery fair until sullied but liable to be sullied by the least speck but those who take hold of gods strength which is christ our lord are the sunbeam a heavenly emanation which cannot be sullied art thou the snow or the sunbeam my child oh dear i cannot deal with tropes and figures in that style answered she rising and my work is finished i am going now i fancied she did not look very sorry for it great events are happening the lord king finding his malady grows rather worse than better has resolved to abdicate in favour of his nephew lady sybils baby son so tomorrow beaudouin v is to be proclaimed throughout the holy city and on the day of saint edmund the king he will be crowned in the church of the holy sepulchre they say the lord king was a very wise man before he became a mesel and he will still give counsel when needed the young king being but three years old nov i do not quite see what difference the abdication will make guy must still remain regent for several years and the only change is that he will govern for his stepson instead of his brotherinlaw and i feel a little jealous that lady sybil should be passed by she not her son is the next heir of the crown why must she be the subject of her own child who ought to be hers i really feel vexed about it and so does guy i am sure though he says nothingat least to me as to lady sybil herself she is so meek and gentle that if a beggar in the street were put over her head i believe she would kneel to do her homage without a cloud on her sweet face however i felt at liberty to say what i thought to amaury though i seldom do it without being annoyed by his answer and certainly i was now she shes a woman said messire amaury what does a woman know about governing what does a baby know said i oh but he will be a man some day answered amaury but guy will govern in either case i replied trying not to be angry with him he is so silly and he thinks himself so supremely wise i do believe the more foolish people are the wiser they think themselves ha said he saving your presence damoiselle elaine i am not so sure that guy knows much about it amaury thou art an idiot cried i quite unable to bear any longer i believe thou hast told me that before he returned with provoking coolness i dashed away for i knew i might as well talk to damoiselle melisendes pet weasel i do not like the count of tripoli the more i see of him the less i like him and i do not like his fawning professions of friendship for guy guy does not see through it a bit i believe he only means to use guy as a ladder by which to climb himself and as soon as he is at the top he will kick the ladder down behind him did i not say that amaury was an idiot and is it not true here is our sister eschine the mother of a pretty little baby and instead of being thankful that eschine and the infant are doing well there goes amaury growling and grumbling about the house because his child is a girl nay he does more for he snarls at eschine as if it were her fault poor thing she knows i wanted a boy he said this morning men are such selfish simpletons to see how coolly eschine takes it is the strangest thing of all i was afraid he would be disappointed she said calmly you see men dont think much of girls men are all donkeys said i and amaury deserves to be king of the donkeys eschine seemed to think that very funny come elaine i cannot let thee say that of my lord and sit silent and i think messire homfroy de tours quite as well qualified for the position ah said i but lady isabel keeps her curb much tighter than thou i really feel almost sorry for him sometimes when she treats him like a baby before all the world she may do that once too often said eschine amaury means to call the baby heloisefor a reason which would never have occurred to any one but himselfbecause we have not had that name in the family before and eschine smilingly accepts it as i believe she would nebuchadnezzar if he ordered her today the little king was crowned in the church of the holy sepulchre at noon and in the evening the damoiselle heloise de lusignan was baptized into the fold of christ the king was very good i think he inherits much of his mothers sweet disposition i cannot say as much for my small niece for she cried with all her heart when the holy patriarch took her in his arms and he said it showed that satan must have taken strong possession of her and was very hard to dislodge but no sooner had the holy cross been signed on her and the holy patriarch gave her back into the arms of her nurse than by the power of our lord she was quite another creature and did not utter a single cry so wonderful and effectual a thing is the grace of holy baptism much effect it took on thee then growled amaury to whom i said this for thou didst wait until the water touched thy face and then didst set up such screams as never were heard from mortal babe before what dost thou know about it said i ha dont i answered he provokingly i have been amused to hear the different ideas of various people when they first see the baby the lady queen stroked its little face and said pitifullyah poor little child thou art come into a disagreeable world lady judith took it in her arms and after rocking it a little she saidwhat possibilities lie hidden here lady sybil saidlittle darling what a treasure thou art lady isabels comment for which i shall never forgive her waswhat an ugly little spectacle are young babies no prettier damoiselle melisende danced it up and down and sang it a lively nursery song guy like a man said with an amused look well that is a funny little article heloisethat means hidden wisdom does it not very much hidden just now i should think amaury that stupid piece of goodswretched little creature do keep it from crying and lastly old marguerite came to see her nurslings nurslings nursling i wondered what she would say she took it in her arms and looked at it for some time without speaking and then she said softly little child he that was once a little child bless thee and may he give thee what he sees best that will most likely be something different from what we see o marguerite said i that may be an early death that would be the best of all my damoiselle ah the eyes of a noble maiden of seventeen years see not so far as the eyes of a villein woman of seventy there are good things in this worldi do not deny it but the best thing is surely to be safe above this worldsafe with the good lord it would have been well for heloise who bears a spotted reputation in history i do not want to lose my baby margot said eschine with a rather sad smile ah no dame you do not replied marguerite answering the smile with a brighter one but if the good lord should call her it is best to let her rise and go to him again we hear something more of those strange rumours as though the people were not content under guys government but what does it signify they are only villeins yet villeins can insult nobles no doubt sister eudoxia who was here again yesterday says they actually talk of a petition to the king to entreat him to displace guy and set some one else in his stead the thought of their presuming to have an idea on the question as if they could understand anything about government discontented under guy my guy they are nothing better than rebels they ought to be put down and kept down the lady queen has received a letter from her kindred at byzantium from which she hears that the young byzantine caesar who is but a child has been wedded to a daughter of the lord king of france dame agnes is her name and she is but eight years old i wonder if it is very very wicked to hate people old marguerite will have it that it is just as bad as murder and that the holy evangel says so i am sure she must have listened wrong for i do hate count raymond of tripoli and i cant help it i must and will hate him he has won guys ear completely and guy sees through his eyes i cannot bear him the fawning handsome scoundreli am sure he is one they say too that he is not over good to his wife for i am sorry to say he has a wife i pity her poor creature lady judith asked me when i repeated this who they were i do not know holy mother said i every body i suppose i would not put too much faith in them helena she said they often say a great deal that is not true but one must attend to it holy mother i answered why replied she oh because it would never do what would never do to despise the opinion of society why she gently persisted really i found it rather difficult to say why methinks helena i have seen thee despise the opinion of society when it contradicted thy will is it not more reasonable to despise it when it contradicts gods will holy mother i pray you tell meis that the world said i because my nurse old marguerite says that monseigneur saint john bade us beware of the world and the flesh as well as the devil and i am not quite sure what it means except that the world is other people and the flesh is me but how can i be inimical to my own salvation my child said lady judith gently when some duty is brought to thy remembrance is there nothing within thee which feels as if it rose up and said oh but i do not want to do thatnever helena oh yes very often said i that is the flesh said she and they that are of christ the flesh have crucified with its passions and its lusts oh dear i exclaimed almost involuntarily very unpleasant is it not said lady judith smiling ah dear child the flesh takes long in dying crucifixion is a very slow process and a very painful process they that are not willing to endure hardness had better not enlist in the army of jesus christ ah that is what i always thought said i religious persons cannot be very happy of course it would not be right for them they wait till the next world and yetold marguerite always seems happy i do not quite understand it child lady judith dropped her broidering and the deep sweet grey eyes looked earnestly into mine what dost thou know of happiness helena following christ is not a hardship it is a luxury the happinessor rather the mirthof this world is often incompatible with it but it is because the one is so far above the other that it extinguishes it as the light of the sun extinguishes the lamp yet who would prefer the lamp before the sunlight tell me helena hast thou any wish to go to heaven certainly holy mother and what dost thou expect to find there i should be glad to know i could hardly tell where to begin well i said after a moments thought i expect to fly and to enjoy myself intensely and never to have another pain nor shed a tear and to see all whom i love and be always with them and love them and be loved by them for ever and ever and there will be all manner of delights and pleasures i cannot think of anything else and that is thy heaven said lady judith with a smile in which i thought the chief ingredient was tender compassion though i could not see why ah child it would be no heaven at all to me verily as a man thinketh in his heart so is he pleasure and ease and earthly lovethese are thy treasures helena for where thy treasure is there shall thine heart be but what is the matter with my heaven said i feeling a little aggrieved why my child thou hast left out the central figure what were a coronation if there were no king or a wedding where there were no bride why what was left would be equivalent to nothing ask thine old nurse and see if thy heaven would satisfy her ah whom have we in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that we desire in comparison of thee old marguerite understands that dost thou my maiden i shook my head i felt too mortified to speak to have a poor ignorant villein woman held up to me as knowing more than i knew and being happier than i really was humiliating yet i could not resent it from one so high as lady judith lady judith would have said more i fancy but melisende came in and she quietly dropped the matter as she generally does if any third person enters but the next morning as marguerite was dressing my hair i asked her what her notion of heaven was inside with the blessed lord and the devil and all the sins and evil things left outside she said ah it will be rest to be rid of evil but it will be glory to be with the lord and the pleasures and the flying and all the delightful things margot said i ah yes that will be very nice she admitted and to meet those whom we have lostthat will be the very next best thing to seeing the good lord hast thou lost many whom thou hast loved margot ah novery few compared with some my mother and my husband and my two childrenthat is all i never knew my father and i was an only child but it may be the fewer one has to love the more one loves them an only child said i but perette calls thee aunt ah yes she is my husbands niecethe same thing i think marguerite seems to agree with lady judith though of course she does not express herself so well and i cannot help wondering how they arrange in heaven i suppose there will be thrones nearest the good lord for the kings and the princes who will be there and below that velvet settles for the nobles and beneath again the crowd of common people i should think that would be the arrangement because of course no one could expect them to mingle all together that would be really shocking yet i cannot altogether make it out if messeigneurs the holy apostles were originally fishermen and worked for their livingit is very queer i do not understand it but i suppose the holy angels will take care to put it right and have a proper barrier between the apostles and the nobles and the poor villeins who are admitted of special grace through their own good deeds and the superabundant merits of the holy saints in the afternoon when guy was in audience of the lord king and the lady queen and lady isabel and melisende were riding forth with messire homfroy and amaury as their cavaliers i found lady judith and lady sybil busy spinning and i brought my broidery and sat down with them we did not talk much for a whileonly a few words now and then when all at once lady judith said helena wilt thou try this needle for thy work i took the needle and threaded it and set to work again but i found to my surprise that i could not get on at all the needle would hardly go through the silk and it left an ugly hole when it did lady judith went on with her spinning for a few minutes but at length she looked up and said well helena how dost thou like that needle not at all holy mother if it please you said i for i cannot get on with it she selected another and gave it me oh this is beautiful for broidery i said so fine and sharp it is the answer to a question thou wert asking me yesterday said lady judith and i gave thee no reply canst thou guess what the question was i could not and said so i did not remember asking anything that had to do with needles and i never thought of any hidden meaning thy question was what is the worldand what harm does the world do to us that needle that i first gave thee has its point blunted and that is what the world does to a child of god it blunts his point i do not understand said i little helena said lady judith before a point can be blunted there must be one to blunt thou couldst not sew with a wooden post so before the world can injure thy spiritual life there must be spiritual life to injure there is no poison that will harm a dead man but holy mother are there two worlds said i for religious persons give up the world my child thine heart is a citadel which the foe can never enter unless there be a traitor within the walls to open the postern gate but there is such a traitor helena and he is always on the watch be thou ever on the watch too yet another matter stands firstwho reigns in thy citadel hast thou ever given thine heart to god maiden can i give my heart holy mother it seems to me that love is rather like a plant that grows than like a treasure that is given thou art right but the planting must be sometime hast thou ever asked god to take thine heart for as a holy man of old hath saidif thou leave me to myself i shall not give it thee i shook my head it all sounded strange to me if the usurper is in the citadel dear child he will hold the gates against the rightful king and helena there are no traitors in his camp thou art not a sword nor a shield which can do nothing of itself but a human creature with a living will which can choose either to open the gates to the king or to shut them against his trumpeter when he sends thee summons to surrender nay thou not only canst choose thou must at this moment at every moment thou art choosing what message hast thou sent back to thy rightful lord both by right and purchase is it come thou and reign over me or is it go back to thy place for i will have none of thee i would willingly not have answered but i felt it would be to fail in respect to lady judiths age and position i stammered out something about hoping that i should make my salvation some time my child didst thou ever do any thing at any time but now said lady judith i suppose that is true for it is always now when we actually come to do it but holy mother there is so much to give up if one becomes religious said i what is there to give up that thou couldst take with thee into heaven but there will be things in heaven to compensate said i and is there nothing in christ to compensate she replied with a momentary flash in the grey eyes what is heaven but god the city had no need of the sun for the glory of god did lighten her and temple i saw none in her for the lord god the almighty is temple to her and the lamb lady sybil seemed interested but i must confess that i thought the conversation had assumed a very disagreeable tone and i wondered how it was that both lady judith and my old marguerite spoke to me as if they thought i did not serve god it is very strange when i hear the holy mass sung every morning and i have only just offered another neuvaine at the holy sepulchre however easter will soon be here and i mean to be very attentive to my devotions throughout the holy week and see if that will satisfy lady judith i dont want her to think ill of me i like her too well for that though i do wish she would not talk as if she fancied i did not serve god i am sure i am quite as good as most people and that is saying a great deal no it can never be wrong to hate people it cant be and it shant and i just wish i could roast that count of tripoli before the fire in the palace kitchen till he was done to a cinder i am whitehot angry and like jonah the prophet i do well to be angry the mean fawning sneaking interloping rascal i knew what he meant by his professions of love and friendship guys eyes were shut but not mine the wicked cruel abominable scoundrelto climb up with guys help to within an inch of the top where he sat and then to leap the inch and thrust him out of his seat i cannot find words ugly enough for him i hate hate hate him to have supplanted my guy after worming himself into the confidence of the lord king through guys friendshipay there is the stingto have carried to the king all the complaints that he heard against guy until he poor helpless seigneur i dont feel nearly so vexed with him really was induced to believe guy harsh and incapable and to take out of his hands the government of the kingdom and then he put in that serpent that false judas that courtly hypocriteoh dear i cannot find words to describe such wickednessand he is regent of the holy land and guy must kneel to him i could cut him in slices and enjoy doing it i am angry with melisende who can find nothing to say butah the fortune of courtsone down today another up tomorrow and i am almost angry with marguerite who says softlyhush then my damoiselle is it not the good god no it is not it is the devil who sends sorrow upon us and makes us hate people and makes people be hateful i am sure the good god never made count raymond do such wicked things instead of casting adam and eva out of paradiseoh why why did the good god not cast out the devil is my damoiselle so much wiser than the lord quietly asks marguerite i cannot understand it the old cry comes up to me againoh if i could know why cannot i understand and then lady judith lays her soft hand on my head and says words which i know come from the holy evangelwhat i do thou knowest not now ay i know not i must not know i can only stretch forth appealing hands into the darkness and feel nothing not like her and marguerite they too stretch forth helpless hands into the darkness but they find god it must be a very different thing why cannot i do the same is he not willing that i should find him tooor am i not worthy i suppose it must be my fault it seems as if things were always ones own fault but i do not think they are any better on that account especially when you cannot make out where your fault lies guy behaves like a saint he does not see any fault in count raymond i believe he wont lady sybil poor darling looks very grieved but not one word of complaint can i get her to utter as to amaury when i have quite finished slicing up the count if he does not mind i shall begin with him what does he say butwell a great deal of it is guys own fault why wasnt he more careful surely if he has any sense he might expect to be envied and supplanted when he had climbed to such a height if he has any sense pretty well for messire amaury chapter ix elaine finds more than she expected and when i know not what thou dost ill wait the light above doddridge both guy and lady sybil are in a state of the highest ecstasy and say that they are abundantly recompensed for all their past disappointments and this is because they are disappointed just like amaury but they bear it in as different a style as possible i think if i were they i should consider i had more right to be troubled of the two for little heloise is a strong child enough and is growing almost pretty while dear lady sybils baby girl is a little delicate thing that the wind might blow away of course i shall love her far better just because she is guys and sybils and she crept into the warmest corner of my heart when she showed me her eyesnot lady sybils gentle grey but those lovely flashing dark eyes of guys the most beautiful eyes i think that were ever seen marguerite is not she charming i cried ah the little children always are said the old woman i dont agree with herlittle children can be great teases but marguerite had more to say my damoiselle sees they are yet innocent of actual sin therefore they are among the best things in gods world i may be wrong but i think the good god must have been the loveliest babe ever seen how i should have liked to be thereif the holy mother would have allowed me to hold him in my arms ah i suppose only the holiest saints would be allowed to touch him said i i am not so sure if my damoiselle will pardon me she was no saint surely that crept into the pharisees house to break the castingbottle on his feet yet the hardest word she had from him was go in peace ah i thank the good god that his bidding is not come unto me all ye that are holy there are few of us would come if it were but come unto me all ye that are wearythat takes us all in for we are all weary some time the lot of a woman is a weary lot at the best used to sprinkle perfumes well it may be among the villeins said i my damoiselle i never saw more bitter tears than those of the old lady de chatelheraultmother of the lady de lusignanwhen her fairhaired boy was brought in to her in the bower with the green weeds in his long bright hair and the gold broidery of his velvet tunic tarnished by the thick stagnant water early that morning he had been dancing by her with the lovelight in his beautiful blue eyes and now when the dusk fell they laid him down at her feet drowned and dead with the light gone out of the blue eyes for ever ah i have seen no little sorrow amongst men and women in my seventy yearsbut i never saw a woman look more than she did as if she had lost the light of life the villeins have a hard lot as the good god knows but all the sorrow of life is not for the villeinsno no how oddly she puts things i should never have thought of supposing that the villeins had any sorrow a certain dull kind of coarse grief or tired feeling perhaps they may have at times like animals but sorrow surely is a higher and finer thing and is reserved for the nobles as to old marguerite herself i never do quite think of her as a villein she has dwelt with nobles all her life so to speak and is not of exactly the same common sort of stuff that they are yesterday afternoon lady sybil and i were alone in the bower and she had the baby in her arms the little creature is to be made a christian on sunday i asked her what name it was to have i expected her to say either marie which is the lady queens name or eustacie the name of guys mother but she said neither she answered agnes and she spoke in that hushed reverent voice in which one instinctively utters the names of the beloved dead i could not think whose it could be the name has never been in our house to my knowledge and i was not aware of it in lady sybils line dost thou not know whose name it is helena asked lady sybil i fancy she answered my look no said i my dear lord has been very good to me she said he made not the least objection it was my mothers name helena oh said i enlightened lady sybil do tell me can you remember the lady queen your mother how old were you when she died she did not answer me for an instant when i looked up i saw tears dropping slowly on the infants robes when shedied there was a moments pause ay there are more graves than men dig in the churchyard when shediedhelena i was six years old then you can remember her i said eagerly oh i wish i could remember mine ay memory may be intense bliss she answered or it may be terrible torture i can remember a fair face bent down over mine soft brooding arms folded round me loving kisses from gentle lips and theno helena did my lord tell thee she was dead it was kind of him for he knows i trust it will not be imagined from this that i think lightly of white lies romanists as a rule are very lenient towards them lady sybil was sobbing then she is not dead i said in a low voice i do not know she replied no one knows she is dead to us oh why why does holy church permit such terrible thingswhat am i saying may the good lord pardon me if i speak against himbut i cannot understand why it must be they had been wedded nearly ten years helenai mean my parentswhen it was discovered that they were within the prohibited degrees why cannot dispensations be given when such things occur they knew nothing of it why must they be parted and she be driven into loneliness and obscurity and i well it was done a decree of holy church parted them and she went back to her people we have never heard another word about her but those who saw her depart from jerusalem said she seemed like one whose very heart was broken and she never came back i said pityingly is it much wonder answered lady sybil in a low voice rocking the child gently in her arms it would have been much i think for the crowned and anointed queen of jerusalem to steal into her capital as damoiselle de courtenay but it would have been far more for the wife and mother to come suing to her supplanter for a sight of her own children no i cannot wonder that she never never came back i was silent for a little while then i said was the lord king as grieved as she i cannot understand if so why they should not have obtained a dispensation and have been married over again lady sybil shook her head and i saw another tear drop on the babys robe no helena she said hardly above a whisper i do not think he was he had the opportunity of allying himself with the caesars and there are men to whom a woman is a woman and one woman is just as good as another or very nearly so do men selling a horse stop to consider whether it will be as happy with the new master as the old they do not care and very often they cannot understand ay amaury is one of that sort and you thinkif she be alivethat she will never come i asked i hope she might but i think she will not ah how i have hoped it helena hast thou wondered how it is that nothing short of absolute impossibility will suffer me to depute to another the daily distribution of the dole at the postern gate to those poor women that come for alms canst thou not guess that amongst all the faces i look but for onefor the one that might creep in there unrecognised to look on me and that must never never go away with a soreness at her heart saying she was not there every loaf that i give to a stranger i say pray for the soul of agnes of anjou and then if some day she should creep in among the rest and i should not know herah but i think i should if it were only by the motherhunger in the eyesbut if she should and hear that and yet not speak she will say in her heart sybil loves me yet and if she could only creep one step furthergod loves me yet for he does helena maybe he has comforted her long ago but if she should not have found it out and be still stretching forth numb hands in the darknessand if i could say it to her now thou knowest why i call the babe by her name i know not where she is nor indeed if she is on earth but he knows and he may let her hear it if she come to know that i have called my child by her name she may not feel quite so lost and lonely i have no other way to say to heri have not forgotten thee nor has god i love thee i would fain help thee he loves thee and is ready to save thee who can tellshe may hear oh dear this is a bad world said i why are people so hard on each other we are all fellowsinners i suppose ah helena said lady sybil with a sorrowful smile hast thou not found dear that the greater sinner a man is himself very generally the harder he will be on other sinnersespecially when their sins are of a different type from his own the holier a man is the more he hates sin and yet the more tenderly will he deal with the sinner for as sin means going away from god so holiness must mean coming near god and god is more merciful than men to all who come to him for mercy lady judith came in while the last words were being spoken i never can quite tell said i what sin is why should some things be sin and other things not be sin go on helena said lady judith turning round with a smile why should so many things be wrong which i like and so many things be right which i do not like well holy mother it is something like that said i laughing will you please to tell me why because my child thou hast inherited a sinful nature but i do not like sinas sin said i then temptation has no power over thee is it so art thou never drawn away of thine own lust and enticed well i am not perfect said i i suppose nobody expects to be yet without absolute perfection helena thou canst never enter heaven o holy mother cried i where art thou about to get it said she i am sure i do not know i replied blankly thou shouldst know my child she responded gently think about it i cannot guess what she means i am sure i may think about that for a year and be no nearer when i have done i have had a great pleasure today in the shape of a letter from monseigneur our father addressed to guy but meant for us all three he wrote about six months after we set out and i should hope he has before now received my letter which i sent off on the first opportunity after our arrival in the holy city every body seems to be well and alix has a baby boy whom she means to call after monseigneurgeoffrey there is no other special news level he says misses us sorely and lies at my door with his nose between his paws as if he were considering what it could all mean i wonder whether he thinks he comes to any satisfactory solution the lord king i hear has been more indisposed for some days past the lady queen is very attentive to him lady isabel and her lord have gone through another tremendous quarrelabout what i do not know early yesterday morning our sister eschines second baby was announced and in the afternoon the holy patriarch baptized it by guys name amaury was in ecstasies with his boy but alas in the evening the poor little thing fell into convulsions and barely lived to see the dawn of another day amaury passed from the climax of triumph to the depths of despair he growled and snarled at every body and snapped at eschine in particular as though he thought she had let her child die on purpose to vex him that she could be in as much distress as himself did not seem to occur to him if anything could have provoked me more than amaurys unreasonableness it would have been the calm patience with which eschine took it there he stalked about grumbling and growling why did you all let the child die he wanted to knowas if we could have helped it there is not one of you has any senseas if he had alixs boy manages to live she knows how to treat him women are all idiots alix apparently not being a woman poor eschine lay still a few tears now and then making their way down her white cheeks and meekly begging her lord and masters pardon for what she had not done when he was gone she saidi think to anticipate what she saw on the tip of my tongue thou knowest elaine dear he is not angry with me men do set such store by a son it is only natural he should be very much distressed she will persist in making excuses for him distressedwell said i but he does not need to be so silly and angry naturalwell yesi think it is natural to amaury to be an idiot i always did think so o lynette dont dear pleaded eschine i am beginning to think i have been rather unjust to eschine when i said there was nothing in her but it has taken a long while to come out and it seems to come rather in the form of doing and bearing than of thinking and saying but that amaury is a most profound donkey no mortal man can doubtor at any rate no mortal woman i was awfully startled this morning when marguerite undrew my curtains and told me that our lord king beaudouin had been commanded to god it seems now that for some time past he has been more ill than any one knew except the lady queen his stepmother what that wicked count of tripoli may have known of course i cannot say but i am sure he has had a hand in the late kings will the crown is left to the little king beaudouin v and our sweet sybil is disinherited what that really means i suppose is that the count is jealous of guys influence over his lady and imagines that he can sway the child better than the mother there are to be various changes in consequence of the lord kings death the lady queen returns to her own family at byzantium i do hope lady judith will not go with her but i am very much afraid she may guy talks about retiring to his city of ascalon but though i am sure lady sybil will submit to his will i can see she does not want to leave her boy though i do not believe she distrusts that wicked tripoli as i do i asked marguerite if she did not feel very angry no she said quietly is my damoiselle very angry indeed i am said i does my damoiselle know what are the good lords purposes for monseigneur count guy it is more than old marguerite does of course not but i see what has happened and not what will happen ah that is not seeing much but what can happen to put things right again margot ha do i know i no better than monseigneur saint jacob when his son monseigneur saint joseph sent for his little brother and refused to send the meal until he came that is so beautiful a historyand so many times repeated in this world the poor old fatherhe thought all these things were against him he did not know what the good god was making ready for him he did not know and the good god will never be hurried it is we that are in a hurry poor children of timewe want every thing to happen today but he who has eternity to work in can afford to let things take their time my damoiselle does not know what old helweh said to me yesterday no who is helweh said i she is an arab woman who serves in the kitchen a paynim o marguerite what can a paynim say worth hearing or is she a christian if to be baptized is to be a christian as people always say then helweh is a christian but if to be a christian is really to know and follow the lord christand it seems to me as if the evangel always meant thatthen i do not know i am afraid helweh does not understand much about that oh if she has been christened she must be a christian said i well what did she say she saidall things come to him who knows how to wait it is a saracen proverb well i do not believe it ah let my damoiselle pardon me but it is true well said i half laughing then i suppose i do not know how to wait i do not think my damoiselle does answered marguerite quietly wilt thou teach me margot ha it takes the good god to teach that i should not think it wanted much teaching let my damoiselle bear with her servant the good god has been teaching it to me for seventy years and i dare not make so bold as to say i have learned it yet why margot thou art as quiet and calm and patient as a stone ah not here she said laying her hand upon her bosom perhaps hereand heretouching her eyes and lips but down thereno but for what or for whom art thou waiting margot i asked rather amused hait ought to be only whom but it is too often what we are like the little children waiting for the father to come home but thinking more of the toys and bonbons he may bring than of himself and then there is another thing before we can learn to wait we must learn to trust to trust what margot i believe we all trust in something if my damoiselle pleases a great many trust in themselves and a great many more trust in circumstancesfate or chance or luckas they call it some few trust in other human creatures and their waking is often the saddest of all but it seems as if the one thing we found it hardest to do was to trust the good god he has to drive us away often from every other trust before we will learn to trust him oh how we must grieve his heart when he has done so much for us and yet we will not trust him i wonder what she means i feel as if i should like to know and could not tell how to begin the lady queen is gone back to her people and i am so gladlady judith is not gone with her i was sadly afraid she would do but melisende is gone and messire renaud de montluc for whom the lady queen trusts to obtain some high position at the court of the byzantine caesar i am not at all sorry that messire renaud is gone he made me feel uncomfortable whenever i looked at him i cannot well express my feeling in words but he gave me a sensation as if nothing stood on any thing and every thing was misty and uncertain i fancy some people like that sort of feeling i detest it i like figures though amaury says it is a very unladylike taste because they are so definite and certain two and two make four and they will make four do what you please with them no twisting and turning will persuade them to be either three or five now i like thatfar better than some arts more interesting in themselves such as music painting or embroidery of which people say yes it is very fairvery goodbut of course it might be better i like a thing that could not be better guy says that is very shortsighted and argues a want of ambition in me i do not quite see that if a thing be the best it can possibly be why should i want it to be better oh but one wants an aim says guy one must have a mark to shoot at if i were besieging a castle and knew beforehand that i could not possibly take it it would deprive me of all energy and object there is nothing so devoid of interest as doing something which leads to nothing and is worth nothing when done well i say then i think if sieges and wars were done away with it would be no bad thing just think what misery they cause but such an outcry comes upon me then amaury informs me that he is incomparably astonished at me is not war the grandest of all employments what on earth could the nobles do if there were no wars would i have them till the earth like peasants or read and write like monks or sew and dress wounds like women and guy says goodnaturedlyoh one of elaines curious notions she never thinks like other people but think i say of the suffering which comes from warthe bereft widows and fatherless children and human pain and sorrow does a woman weeping over her husbands corpse think war grand do you suppose stuff says amaury cant she get another would he say if eschine were to dienever mind i can get another well i should not much wonder if he would once after a rather keen contest of this sort i asked old marguerite if she liked war i saw her eyes kindle damoiselle she said my husband followed his seigneur to the war and left me ill at home in my cot he had no power to choose as my damoiselle must know the night fell and the seigneur came home with banners flying and along the village street there were bonfires and rejoicings for a great victory but my husband did not come i rose from my sickbed and wrapped myself in a sheepskin and went out to the fatal field like a candle in the sunlight the pain of the heart put out the pain of the body what i saw that night my damoiselle will not ask it were not meet to rehearse in the ears of a young noble lady i do not know how i bore it only that i did beargoing from one to another in the moonlight and turning my lantern on the dead still faces ever looking for that face which i feared to find and at last i found him my piers the one love of my young lifewhere the fight had been the most terrible and the dead lay thickest i knew that he had acquitted himself right well for his face was to the foe and the broken shaft of his seigneurs pennon was still grasped tightly in his hand damoiselle there was no funeral pageant no table tomb no heralds cry for him strangers hands buried him where he lay as they might have buried the seigneurs horse if need were and there were no white weeds and seclusion for me his young widow who knelt by my babys cradle too miserable for tears but may be in those halls where all souls are alike before the king of kings the voice from the throne said to him well done and the voice did verily say to me fear not come unto me and i will give thee restah my damoiselle knows now what her old nurse thinks of war oh why must there be such things how else could a knight win his spurs indignantly demands amaury but surely the winning of amaurys spurs is not the only thing of any consequence in the world does the good god himself take no account of widows tears and orphans wails if only the knights win their spurs could not some other way be contrived for the spurs which would leave people alive when it was finished now elaine dont be such a simpleton says amaury so at last as nobody else except marguerite who is nobody seems to understand me i ask lady judith what she thinks my child she says he maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth he breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder and burneth the chariot in the fire the father of the age to come the prince of peace it is one of his fairest titles but not till he comes helena till then earth will be red with the blood of her sons and moistened with the tears of her daughters let us pray for his coming but holy mother that is ages off said i is it she made answer has the lord told thee so much helena ah it may bei know not but i see nothing else to keep himit may be that if all the earth would come to him today he would come to us tomorrow holy mother i do not know what you mean by coming to him dear helena she said gently thou wilt not know till thou art ready to come but i do not understand that said i how am i to get ready if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink if thou knewest the gift of god thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given to thee water of life art thou not athirst and dost thou not know the gift of god dear maiden then ask him to bestow on thee the thirst and the knowledge i really do not know whether it was right or wrong but that night after i had finished my credo and paters and the holy angelical salutation i ventured to say in my own wordsfair father jesu christ give me what lady judith and marguerite talk about i hope it was not very wicked i did so tremble and i do not properly know what this thing is only that it seems to make them happy and why should i not be happy too i suppose the good god will know all about it and as he appears to be so condescending as to listen to marguerite who is but a villein surely he will hear me who am noble it is so odd that amaury who is such a simpleton himself should be perpetually calling me a simpleton i do think the more foolish people are the more fond they are of exhorting others not to be silly it is very funny but this world is a queer place it is indeed lynette says guy with mock gravity when i make the remark to him the queerest place i have been in these thirty years as guy is scarcely twentyseven it may be supposed i cannot help laughing but there is another queer thing it does really seem as if villeinsat least some villeinshad genuine feelings just like us nobles i have always thought that it was because marguerite had associated so much with nobles that she seemed a little differentjust as you might impart the rosescent to a handkerchief if you shut it in a drawer with roseleaves but i know she did not become my mothers nurse until after her husband was dead so she must have had feelings before that while she was no better off than any other villein it is very incomprehensible and i suppose too when one comes to think about it we are all children of adam and eva how did the difference come to begin with it is very difficult to tell how things began it is a great deal easier to see how they end who would suppose if men had never found out that the great river danube which rolls into the black sea almost like a sea itself in volume came from the meltings of the ice and snow upon the hills of switzerland ha says marguerite when i repeat my thoughts to her the great god is so rich that he can bring the large things out of the small we others we can only bring the small out of the large that sounds like spoiling things said i men are very apt to spoil what they touch she answered the good lord never touches anything that he does not leave more beautiful has he not blessed childhood and manhood by becoming child and man is not the earth fairer since he dwelt on it and the little children dearer since he took them in his arms and blessed them ah he might have cared for me and felt with me just as much if he had never been a man but it would not have been the same thing to me and he knew it when we love one very much damoiselle we love what he has touched and if he touch us ourselves it sends a delicious thrill through us the good lord knew that when he took on him our nature with all its sufferings and infirmitieswhen he touched us every wherein sorrow and weariness and poverty and hunger and pain and death we can suffer nothing which he has not suffered firston which he has not laid his hand and blessed it for his chosen thanks be to his name it is like honey sweetening everything and the things that are bitter and acid want the most sweetening so the good lord chose poverty and pain ease and riches are sweet of themselves i have heard father eudes read of one or two feasts where he was he blessed joy as well as sorrowperhaps lest we should fancy that there was something holy in pain and poverty in themselves and something wicked in being comfortable and happy some people do think so after all but i have heard father eudes read a great deal more of funerals than feasts where the blessed lord was he seemed to go where people wanted comforting much oftener than where they were comfortable he knew that many more would sorrow than rejoice what strange eyes marguerite has she can look at nothing but she sees the good god and the strangest thing is that it seems to make her happy it always makes me miserable to think of god when i am bright and joyous is like dropping a black curtain over the brightness why cannot i be like marguerite i ought to be a great deal happier than she there is something wrong somewhere then of course there must be something holy in povertyvoluntary poverty that isor why do monks and nuns take the vow of poverty i suppose there is nothing holy in simply being poor like a villein and if our lord really were poor when he was on earth that must have been voluntary poverty i said as much to margot damoiselle said she every man who follows our lord must carry his cross his own crossnot somebody elses and that means i think the cross which the good god lays on his shoulders the blessed christ himself did not cut his own cross but we others we are very fond of cutting our crosses for ourselves instead of leaving the good god to lay them on us and we always cut them of the wrong wood we like them very light and pretty with plenty of carving and gilding but when the good lord makes the crosses he puts no carving on them and he often hews out very rough and heavy ones at least he does so for the strong he makes them light sometimes for the weak but there is no gildingonly the pure gold of his own smile and that is not in the cross itself but in the sunlight which he sends upon it but my damoiselle will find when men sort out the crosses the strong walk away with the light ones and the rough and heavy fall to the weak the good lord knows better than that but we dont all carry crosses margot said i only religious persons marguerite shook her head decidedly damoiselle all that learn of the good lord must bear the cross he said so if any man serve me let him follow meand again if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me father eudes read them both my damoiselle seesany man that must mean all men well i cannot understand it i only feel more puzzled than ever i am sure it would not make me happier to carry a heavy cross yet lady judith and marguerite are happy i can see they are religion and good people seem to be full of contradictions how is one to understand them chapter x preparing for the struggle he that hath a thousand friends hath not a friend to spare and he that hath one enemy shall find him every where i have thought and thought about lady judiths question concerning perfection and as i expected i cannot see my way through it at all and what is more i do not see how to reconcile it with what she said herself of sister eudoxia so this morning i took the liberty of asking her what she meant lady judith smiled and replied wert thou puzzled helena yes holy mother said i very much i am glad of it she answered i wanted to puzzle thee and make thee think i have been thinking a great deal i said but i cannot think my way out of the labyrinth we must take counsel of holy writ to find our way out answered lady judith and she laid her hand on her greek bible which is a very handsome book bound in carved wood and locked with a golden clasp she unlocked it with the little key which hangs from her girdle and said now listen helena in the days when our lord dwelt on middle earth there were certain men amongst the jews called pharisees who were deemed exceedingly holy persons so exact were they in the fulfilment of all duties that they did not reckon their tithes paid unless they taxed the very potherbs in their gardens yet our lord said to his disciplesif your righteousness surpass not that of the pharisees ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven likely enough said i surely any christened man could easily be better than heathen jews but he said more helena be ye then perfect even as your father he in the heavens is perfect perfect as the good god is perfect i exclaimed that is our standard she responded we are not to rest short of that but we cannot you yourself said it holy mother when we were talking of sister eudoxia i did my child let us take two more passages from holy writ and see if they cast any light upon it the end of the law is christ unto righteousness to every believer and ye are in him complete i do not understand them holy mother i have heard thee speak helena of thy favourite legend of the two good knights of greece what was it that sir pythias agreed to do for sir damon to suffer death in his stead if he did not return home at the appointed time suppose that sir pythias had suffered death before sir damons return and that when sir damon came back the lord king had put him to death also what wouldst thou call that oh that would never have been just said i but why sir damon had been sentenced to die yes but when another had died for himoh it would be cruelly unfair in other words sir damon would be reckoned to have died so far as the law was concerned in the person of his friend exactly said i and this friend remember had voluntarily given his life now this is the point to which i want to bring thee the death of sir pythias would have been reckoned to sir damon and this last would have been accounted to have paid the full penalty to which he was sentenced and to be thenceforward a free and blameless man of course said i there could have been no other result now helena dear this is what christ has done for all believers his death is reckoned to them and they are thenceforward free and blamelessperfect as he is perfect complete in him not in themselves mind never in themselves they are sinners to the last hour of life but in him on account of his atoning death and holy obedience gods holy law reckons them perfect as himself so that in one sense they are perfect for ever in another sense they are utterly imperfect so long as they live for by one offering he hath perfected in perpetuity the hallowed ones but holy mother i asked what do you mean by in him my child she answered i doubt if any but god knows all that is meant by that deep word and what man knows cannot be told to anotherit can only be felt but it means light and life and joy helena the very light that god is the life of all the ages the joy with which no stranger intermeddleth only taste it and see no draught of sin can be truly sweet to thee again after one drop of that wine of heaven i am quite delighted to find that messire tristan de montluc who has exasperated me for nearly two years past by playing the brokenhearted lover has got his heart mended again i was beginning to entertain a desperate wish that he would take the cowl for it made me feel a perfect wretch whenever i looked at him and yet what could i have said to guy but what i did i feel indescribably relieved to hear that he is going after his brother to byzantium and intensely delighted to find that he is privately engaged to melisende de courtenay i believe she will make him a good wife which i never could have done and it is such a comfort to know that he has given over caring about me it does seem not unlikely that we may have war there are flying rumours of saladins drawing nearer may the good god avert it i believe amaury would tell me that i was a simpleton if he heard me say so the holy patriarch heraclius and the lord roger master of the temple have set forth on a pilgrimage to the shrines of the west they intend to visit compostella and canterbury amongst others count raymond has been behaving rather better latelythat is we have not seen quite so much of him a letter from alix came to hand last week but there is nothing of interest in it except that every one is well she says her child begins to walk and can already prattle fluently which called forth a growl from amaury who wants to know why every bodys children thrive but his it is not true for little heloise is really an engaging child and has excellent health ahbut then says guy aside to me with arched eyebrows she is only a girl poor little goodfornothing i know guy does not think so for he is devoted to his little agnes and heloise is certainly the prettier child but neither of them is equal to the little king who is a most beautiful boy and has the quaintest sayings ever heard from a child there now did any body ever see any thing like these men messire tristan set forth yesterday morning and what should he say to guy who told me with his eyes full of fun but damoiselle elaine will find out that it does not do to trifle with a mans heart she will doubtless be angry at my defection but i have borne long enough with her caprice and have now transferred my affections to one who can be truer was ever mortal creature so misrepresented why the man must have thought i did not mean what i said my caprice indeed trifle with a mans heart and as if affection could be transferred at will from one person to another guy seemed excessively amused with my exclamations what a conceited set of people you men must be said i well we are rather a bad set answered guy laughing o little elaine thou art so funny pray what is there funny about me said i and please to tell me guy why men always seem to fancy that women do not know their own minds well they dont said guy only the silly ones who have no minds to know i replied just so answered he but those thou seest are the generality of women rubies are scarce pebbles are common only among women said i possibly not responded guy looking very much amused poor de montluc appears to be a ruby in his own eyes and i presume he is only a pebble in thine let us hope that damoiselle melisende will consider him a gem of priceless value well i am sure i have no objection to that but another idea occurs to me which is by no means so pleasant since other people are always misunderstanding me can it be possible that i am constantly misunderstanding other people i do think i have misunderstood eschine and i am sorry for it i like her a great deal better now than i ever expected to do and i almost admire that quiet endurance of herspartly because i feel amaury so trying and partly i suspect because i have so little of the quality myself but is itcan it bepossible that i am misunderstanding count raymond i do not think so why should i think of a beautiful serpent whenever i look at him why should i feel a sensation of which i cannot get rid as if that dark handsome face of his covered something repugnant and perilous it is not reason that tells me this it is something more like instinct is it a true warning to beware of the man or only a foolish baseless fancy of which i ought to be ashamed andi cannot tell whyit has lately assumed a more definite and dreadful form a terror besets me that he has some design on lady sybil he knows that she is the rightful heir of the crown and thati do believe through his machinationsshe has been set aside for her own son if his wife were to diethe holy saints defend iti believe him capable of poisoning guy in order to marry sybil and to make himself king of jerusalem am i very wicked that such ideas come into my head yet i do not know how to keep them out i do not invite them yet they come and in the counts manner to lady sybil there is a sort of admiring flattering deference which i do not like to seesomething quite different from his manner towards her sister i do not think she is conscious of it and i fancy guy sees nothing oh dear dear there is something very wrong in this world altogether and i cannot see how it is to be set right i asked lady judith this evening if she believed in presentiments she answered yes when they come from god ahbut how is one to know ask him to remove the feeling if it be not true i will try the plan but if it should not answer the heats of summer are so great and the holy city is considered so very unhealthy that the regent proposes to remove the lord king to the city of acre until the hot weather is over guy and lady sybil are going to stay at ascalon a city which is guys own and close to the coast though not actually a seaport like acre i cannot help being glad to hear that there will be something like a weeks journey between guy and count raymond i may be unjust buti do not know i have offered seven paters every evening that the good god might take the thought out of my heart if it be wicked but it seems to me that it only grows stronger i told lady judith that her plan did not answer that is that the presentiment did not go what is this thought which troubles thee little one said she holy mother said i do you ever utterly mistrust and feel afraid of some particular person without precisely having a reason for doing so lady judith laid down her work and looked earnestly at me i generally have a reason helena but i can quite imaginewho is it my child do not fear my repeating what thou mayest tell me it is the lord regent said i i feel afraid of him as i might of a tamed tiger lest the subdued nature should break out i do not believe in his professions of friendship for guy and i do not at all like his manner to lady sybil lady judiths eyes were fixed on me i did not know helena how sharp thine eyes were thou wert a child when thou camest here but i see thou art one no longer so thou hast seen that i thought i was the only one it struck me with a sensation as of sickening fear to find that my suspicions were shared and by lady judith what is to be done i said in a whisper shall i speak to guyor lady sybil lady judiths uplifted hand said unmistakably no watch she said watch and pray and wait oh no speakingat least not yet but till when i asked i should say till you all return hereunless something happen in the interim but if thou dost speak little onedo not be surprised if nobody believe thee very impulsive men like thy brother rarely indulge suspicion or mistrust and sybil is most unsuspicious they are likely enough to think thee fanciful and unjust it would be too bad said i it would be very probable she responded holy mother said i what do you think he aims at doing i wanted to know yet scarcely dared to ask if the same dread had occurred to her as to me i think she said unhesitatingly he aims at making himself king by marriage either with sybil or with isabel but he would have to murder his own wife and the ladys husband cried i no need in the first case the lady countess suffers under some internal and incurable disorder which must be fatal sooner or later it is only a question of time her physicians think she may live about two years but not longer and so long as she lives thy brothers life is safe but if she were to die then it might be well to warn him but we know not helena what may happen ere then the lord reigneth my child it is best to put what we love into his hands and leave it there but how do i know what he would do with it said i fearfully he knows and that is enough for one who knows him it is not enough for me said i sadly because thou dost not know him helena art thou as much afraid of the good god as of the lord regent not in the same way of course holy mother i replied because i think the lord regent a wicked man no but to the same extent i dont know i think so said i in a low voice of christ that died and that intercedeth for us afraid of him helena o holy mother i dont know i said bursting into tears i am afraid it is so and i cannot help it i cannot tell how to alter it i want to be more like you and old marguerite but i dont know how to begin wilt thou not ask the lord to show thee how to begin i have done but he has not done it lady judith laid her hand on my bowed head as if to bless me dear helena she said do not get the idea into thine head that thou wilt have to persuade god to save thee he wishes it a great deal more than thou but he sometimes keeps his penitents waiting in the dark basilica outside to teach them some lesson which they could not learn if they were admitted at once into the lighted church trust him to let thee in as soon as the right time comes only be sure not to get weary of knocking and go away but what does he want to teach me holy mother i do not know my child he knows he will see to it that thou art taught the right lesson if only thou wilt have the patience to wait and learn does god teach every body patience said i sighing indeed he does and perhaps there is scarcely a lesson which we are more slow to learn i shall be slow enough to learn that lesson i am sure said i lady judith smiled inattentive children are generally those that complain most of the hardness of their tasks said she we were both silent for a while when lady judith said quietly helena what is christ our lord to thee i am not sure that i understand you holy mother said i christ our lord is god good but what is he to thee i felt puzzled i did not know that he was any thing more to me than to every body else dost thou not understand then tell me what is monseigneur the count of ascalon to thee guy asked i in a little surprise he is my own dear brotherthe dearest being to me in all the world then that is something different from what he is to others of course i said rather indignantly guy could never be to strangers what he is to me why holy mother with all deference you yourself know that he is not that to you thou hast spoken the very truth said she but helena that which he is to thee and not to methat dearest in all the world ay in all the universemy child christ is that to me i looked at her and i saw the soft radiant light in the grey eyes and i could not understand it again that strange mortified feeling took possession of me lady judith knew something i did not she had something i had not and it was something which made her happier than any thing had yet made me there was a gulf between us and i was on the rocky barren side of it and she on the one waving with corn and verdant with pasture it was not at all a pleasant feeling and i could see no bridge across the gulf you are a religious person holy mother said i i suppose that makes the difference yet i did not believe that though i said so old marguerite was no nun and she was on the flowery side of that great gulf as well as lady judith and if lady sybil were there also she was no nun that was not the difference no maiden was lady judiths quiet answer nor dost thou think so i hung my head and felt more mortified than ever dost thou want to know it helena holy mother so much i said bursting into tears you and marguerite seem to me in a safe walled garden guarded with men and towers and i am outside in the open champaign where the wolves are and the robbers and i do not know how to get in to you i have been round and round the walls and i can see no gate dear child said lady judith jesus christ is the gate of the garden of god and he is not a god afar off but close by hast thou asked him and doth it seem as though he would not hear before thou say so much make very sure that nothing is stopping the way on thy side there is nothing but love and wisdom and faithfulness on his what can stop the way i said some form of selflove she replied it has as many heads as the hydra pride indolence covetousness passionbut above all unbelief some sort of indulged sin thou must empty thine heart helena if christ is to come in or else he will have to empty it for thee and i advise thee not to wait for that for the process is very painful yet i sometimes fear it will have to be the case with thee well said i there is nobody in there but guy and lady sybil and a few more a good deal nearer the gate does our lord want me to empty my heart of them i thought that of course being religious she would say yes and then i should respond that i could not do it but she said dear the one whom our lord wants deposed from the throne of thy heart is helene de lusignan what myself thyself said lady judith in the same quiet way i made an excuse to fetch some gold thread for i did not like that one bit and when i came back things were even better than i hoped for lady isabel was in the room and though lady judith will talk of religious matters freely enough when lady sybil is present yet she never does so before her sister lady judith is entirely mistaken i am quite sure of that i dont love me better than any one else i should think myself perfectly despicable amaury does i believe but i dont no indeed she is quite mistaken i scarcely think i shall be quite so glad as i expected that lady judith is going to stay in the holy city i do like her but i dont like her to say things of that kind marguerite i said an hour or two later dost thou think i love myself my damoiselle does not think herself a fool quietly answered the old woman no of course not said i i know i have brains how can i help it but dost thou think i love myselfbetter than i love other people we all love either ourselves or the good god but we can love both marguerite shook her head hano that would be serving two masters and the good god himself says no one can do that i did not like this much better so after i finished my beads i kissed the crucifix and i saidsir god show me whether i love myself becausethough i do not like ityet perhaps if i do it is best to know it we reached ascalon a week ago making three short days journey of it so as not to overfatigue the little ones those of us who have come are guy and lady sybil myself amaury and eschine and the little girls agnes and heloise i brought marguerite and bertrade only to wait on me lady isabel prefers to stay at hebron which is only one days journey from the holy city she and messire homfroy quarrelled violently about it for he wished to go to acre and wanted her to accompany him but in the end as usual she had her own way and he will go to acre and she to hebron the night before we set forth as i was passing lady judiths door her low voice said helena my child wilt thou come in here i want a word with thee so i went into her cell which is perfectly plain having no hangings of any sort either to the walls or the bed only a benitier of red pottery and a bare wooden cross affixed to the wall she invited me to sit on her bed and then she said holy water vessel helena unless thou seest some very strong reason do not speak to the count touching the count of tripoli until we meet again well i thought i should not said i but holy mother will you tell me why we may be mistaken she answered and if not i am very doubtful whether it would not do more harm than good after all dear maiden the shortest cut is round by heaven whenever i feel doubtful how far it is wise to speak i like to lay the matter before the lord and ask him to speak for me if he sees good he will make no mistake as i might and he can tell secrets without doing harm as probably i should it is the safest way helena and the surest i should be afraid said i but of course holy mother for you yes she said answering my halfexpressed thought it is a hard matter to ask a favour of a stranger especially if he be a king but where he is thy fatherdost thou understand me maiden ay only too well well enough to make me feel sick at heart as if the gulf between grew wider than ever should i never find the bridge across we lead such a quiet peaceful life here some time ago i should have called it dull but i am tired of pageants and skirmishes and quarrels and so it is rather a relieffor a little while lady sybil i can see enjoys it she likes quiet amaury fumes and frets i believe eschine likes it but wont say so because she knows amaury does not i never saw the equal of eschine for calm contentedness all rightnever mind itit does not signifyare the style of her stock phrases when any thing goes wrong and wont it be all the same a hundred years hence that is a favourite reflection with her oh dear eschine i could not help saying one day i do hate that pet phrase of thine a hundred years hence that will be the year of our lord why thou and i will be nowhere then nay i suppose we shall be somewhere was eschines grave answer oh well dont moralise said i but thou knowest if we were always to look at things in that style nothing would ever signify any thing it makes me feel as queer as messire renauds notionsas if all the world and i in it had gone into a jelly and nothing was any thing eschine laughed but eschines laughter is always quiet i think thou dost not quite understand me elaine said she i do not use such phrases of things that do matter but of those that do not i should not say such words respecting real troubles however small but are there not a great many events in life of which you can make troubles or not as you choose an illdressed disha disappointment about the colour of a tunica misunderstanding about the pattern of a trimminga cut in ones fingerand such as theseis it not very foolish to make ones self miserable about them what can be more silly than to spend half an hour in fretting over an inconvenience which did not last a quarter my dear eschine it sounds very grand said i why dost thou not teach amaury to look at things in that charming way he frets over mistakes and inconveniences far more than guy and i do eschines smile had more patience than amusement in it for the same reason elaine that i do not teach yonder crane to sing like a nightingale i can guess that parable it would be mere waste of time and labour guy did not forget my birthday yesterday he gave me a beautiful coral necklace which one knows is good against poison i will take care to wear it whenever count raymond is present lady sybil gave me a lovely ring set with an opal and if i were at acre and had a bayleaf to wrap round it i would go into the counts chamber invisible and listen to him eschines gift was a silver pomander with a chain to hang it by amaury just like him forgot all about it till this morning and then gave me a very pretty gold filagree case containing the holy evangel of saint luke to hang round my neck for an amulet am i really nineteen years of age i begin to feel so oldand yet i am the youngest of us i do think that nothing really nice ever lasts in this world the baron de montluc arrived here last night from byzantium with all sorts of bad news in the first place saladin with his paynim army has reentered the holy land and is marching as men fear upon neapolis if he do this he will cut off acre from the holy city and the young lord king cannot reach his capital the baron sent a trusty messenger back to acre to count raymond urging him to hasten to the holy city with the king and lose not an hour in doing it the coast road is still clear or he could come by sea to jaffa messire de montluc sent his own signet as a token to count raymondwhich ring the count knows well guy has ordered us all to pack up and return without loss of time to the holy city where he will take the command till count raymond arrives now elainehow wouldst thou like a siege triumphantly asks amaury may all the holy saints avert such a calamity but there is if possible even worse behind inasmuch as a foe without the gates is less formidable than a traitor within them the patriarch i will not call him holy this time and the lord roger had returned as far as byzantium a few days before messire de montluc left that city and it comes out now what all their fine talk of pilgrimage meant they have been at the court of england on purpose to offer the crown of jerusalem to king henry the father seeing say they the distracted state of the kingdom the peril of paynim war and the fact that king henry is the nearest heir of king foulques of anjou well upon my word as if the crown of jerusalem were theirs to offer it seems to me toobut every body even guy says that is only one of my queer unaccountable notionsthat since king foulques of anjou had no right to the crown except as the husband of queen melisende so long as her heirs remain in existence they should be preferred to his heirs by another wife but amaury laughs at me for saying this he says of course when count foulques married queen melisende and became king all her right passed to him and she was thenceforth simply his consort his children having as much right as hers it does not seem just and fair to me but every one only laughs and says i have such absurd fancies why what would be the good of marrying an heiress at all says amaury if you had to give up her property when she died before you still i do not see that it is just and i wonder if sometimes the queer ideas of one century do not become the common ideas of the next but amaury seems to think that notion exquisitely ridiculous nonsense elaine says he it was a simple matter of family arrangement dont go and fancy thyself the wisest woman in the world thou hast the silliest ideas i ever heard well i dont amaury said i any more than i fancy thee the wisest man guy laughed and told amaury he had a roland for his oliver chapter xi the calm before the storm it was but unity of place which made me dream i ranked with him tennyson here we are safe in the holy city after a hurried and most uncomfortable journey all the quiet is assuredly gone now for the holy city is full of tumultcries and marchings and musters and clashing of armsfrom morning till night lady judith looking as calm as ever received us with a blessing and a soft glad light in her eyes which told that she was pleased to have us back the patriarch and the master of the temple have not yet arrived guy thinks they may tarry at acre with count raymond and come on in his train the lord de clifford has come from england by way of jaffa with the answer of king henry the father it seems that the patriarch actually took with him the keys of the holy city and the blessed sepulchre i am astonished that count raymond should have entrusted them to him more than this they travelled by way of rome and through their wicked misrepresentations obtained letters from the holy father urging king henry to take on himself this charge king henry was holding court at reading when they came to him and the patriarch says he was moved to tears at their account of the miserable state of the holy land well i am not going to deny the misery but i do say it is count raymonds fault and that if matters had been left in guys hands they would never have come to this pass king henry however would not give his answer at once but bade them wait till he had convoked his great council which sat at clerkenwell on the eighteenth of march in last year the decision of the parliament was that in the interests of england the offer ought to be refused well said guy as a mere question of political wisdom that is doubtless right for apart from the pleasure of god it would be the ruin of england to have the holy land clinging round her neck like a millstone yet remember lord robert the courthose never prospered after he had refused this crown of the world he impiously blew out the taper which had been lighted by miracle and think what his end was but dost thou think my lord asked lady sybil looking up that he meant it impiously i have always thought his words so beautifulthat he was not worthy to wear a crown of gold in the place where our lord had worn for us the crown of thorns very beautiful lady said guy a little drily if he had not heard just before the conference of the death of his brother king william the red wellwhen king henry gave his answer what did the patriarch but ask that one of his sons might be substitutedand guy thinks he specially indicated the count of poitou guy says there are great possibilities in our young count but amaury sneers at the idea however the king and the parliament alike declined to accept in the name of any of the princes seeing none of themselves were present and the patriarch had to content himself with a promise of aid alone king henry took him in his train to normandy and after celebrating the holy easter at rouen they had an interview with the french king at vaudreuil both the kings promised help swearing on the souls of each other and many nobles both french and english took the holy cross it is hoped that the king of france and the count of poitou may lead an army hither in a few months richard coeurdelion whose reputation was yet to be made the usual oath of monarchs in solemn form if we can manage to conclude a truce meanwhile and they do not come here to find us all slaughtered or prisoners to the paynim says guy great bodies move slowly and kings and armies are of that description saladin has taken neapolis our scouts bring us word that he is ravaging and burning all the land as he marches and he has turned towards the holy city almost any morning we may be awoke from sleep with his dreadful magic engine sounding in our ears holy mary and all the saints pray to the good god for his poor servants and not a word comes from the regent four several messengers guy has sent by as many different routes in the hope that at least one of them may reach acre earnestly urging him to send instructions we do not even know the condition of matters at acre the king and the regent may themselves be prisoners oh what is to be done guy says that whatever may become of him the kingdom must not be lost and if ten days more pass without news of the regent he will parley with saladin and if possible conclude a truce on his own responsibility i feel so afraid for guy i believe if count raymond could find a handle he would destroy him without mercy guy himself seems to perceive that the responsibility he is ready to assume involves serious peril nevertheless my ladys inheritance must not be lost he says i asked lady judith this morning if she were not dreadfully frightened of saladin they say he eats christian children and sometimes maidens when the children run short if i felt no alarm i should scarcely be a woman helena said she but i took my fear to the lord as king david did what time i am afraid he says i will trust in thee and i had my answer last night oh said i what was it if it please you holy mother she lifted her head with a light in the grey eyes i am i am thy comforter know whom thou art afraid of a dying man and of a son of men who wither like grass and thou forgettest god thy maker the maker of the heaven and foundationlayer of the earth and fearest ever every day the face of the fury of thine oppressor and now where is the fury of thine oppressor did the good god speak to you in vision holy mother no helena he spake to me as he does to theein his word i thought it would have been a great deal more satisfactory if she had been told in vision but how do you know holy mother i ventured to say that words written in holy scripture ever so long ago have something to do with you now gods word is living my child she said it is not like all other books a dead book his word who is alive for evermore endureth for ever moreover there is a special promise that the holy spirit shall bring gods words to the remembrance of his servants as they need and when they come from him they come living and with power then you think holy mother that the paynim will be driven back i do not say that my child but i think that the god who turned back sennacherib is alive yet and the angel who smote the camp of the assyrians can do it again if his lord command him and if notno real mischief helenano real harmcan happen to him or her who abideth under the shadow of god but we might be killed holy mother we might she said so quietly that i looked at her in amazement holy mother i exclaimed thou dost not understand our lords words helenaand they shall kill some of you and a hair from the head of you shall not be lost indeed i do not said i bluntly and i cannot make thee do so she added gently god must do it but why does he not do it have i not asked him over and over again to make me understand i suppose something is in the way and something which is my fault but how am i to get rid of it when i do not even know what it is the ten days are over and no word comes from the regent guy has assumed as viceregent the command of the holy city of course he is the person to do it as lady sybils husband our scouts report that saladin is marching through the pass of gerizim guy has sent out a trumpeter with a suitable armed escort to sound a parley and invite the paynim to meet with him and arrange for a truce at lebonah until the trumpeter returns we do not know whether this effort will succeed lady sybil i can see is excessively anxious and very uneasy lest if guy go to parley with saladin the wicked paynim should use some treachery towards him it is gods will she said but i saw tears in her sweet eyes the battle and the toil and the triumph for the men the waiting and weeping and praying for the women perhaps in their way the humble bedeswomen do gods will as much as the warrior knights the trumpeter returned last night with a message from saladin almost worthy of a christian knight it seems very strange that paynims should be capable of courtesy a most expressive word in the middle ages not restricted as now civility but including honourable sentiments and generous conduct saladin is willing to conclude a truce and will meet guy at lebonah to do so but it is to be for six months only and guy says the terms are somewhat hard however it is the best thing he can do and as the regent maintains his obstinate silence something must be done so far as our envoys could learn the paynim army has not been near acre and only crossed the jordan some thirty miles lower down it appears clear therefore that the regent might have answered if he would guy and amaury set out yesterday morning for lebonah to meet saladin it is two or three days journey from the holy city and allowing three days more for conference it must be ten days at least ere they can return i wander about the house and can settle to nothing lady sybil sits at work but i believe she weeps more than she works eschines embroidery grows quietly i have discovered that she carries her heart out of sight we were talking this morningi hardly know how the subject came upabout selfishness lady isabel said with a toss of her head that she was sure no reasonable being could call her selfish now i could not agree with her for i have always thought her very much so lady judith quietly asked her in what she thought selfishness consisted in being stingy and miserly of course said she well but stingy of what responded lady judith i think people make a great mistake when they restrict selfishness merely to being miserly with money i should say that the man is unselfish who will give willingly that which he counts precious but that means very different things to different people i wonder what it means to us five said i lady judith looked round with a smile i almost think i could tell you said she oh do we all said but lady isabel well to me answered lady judith it means submittingbecause some one wishes it who has a right to my submission or else as a matter of christian loveto do any thing in a way which i think inferior absurd or not calculated to effect the end proposed in other words my ruling sin is selfsatisfaction we all exclaimed against this conclusion but she maintained that it was so then she continued to sybil it means depriving herself of her lords society either for his advantage or for that of some one else lady sybil smiled and blushed then my ruling sin she said interrogatively nay i did not undertake to draw that inference in any case but my own said lady judith with an answering smile we allexcept lady isabelbegged that she would do it for us she seemed i thought to assent rather reluctantly you will not like it said she and if you drew the inference for yourselves you would be more likely to attend to the lesson conveyed oh but we might do it wrong i said lady judith laughed am i then so infallible that i cannot do it wrong said she well sybil my dear if thou wouldst know i think thy tendencyi do not say thy passion but thy tendencyis to idolatry oh cried lady sybil looking quite distressed but now misunderstand me not pursued lady judith love is not necessarily idolatry when we love the creature more than the creatorwhen for instance thou shalt care more to please thy lord than to please the lordthen only is it idolatry therefore i use the word tendency i trust it is not more with theewell then with isabel lady isabel gave a toss of her heada gesture to which she is very much addicted with isabel continued lady judith unselfishness would take the form of resigning her own ease or pleasure to suit the convenience of another her temptation therefore is to indolence and selfpleasing with helena i pricked up my ears what was i going to hear with helena said she smiling on me it would be i think to fulfil some duty though those whom she loved might misunderstand her and think her silly for it then what is my besetting sin holy mother pride of intellect i think she answered very nearly the same as my own holy mother you have left out dame eschine said lady isabel rather sharply have i said lady judith well my children you must ask the lord wherein eschines selfishness lies for i cannot tell i dare not deny its existence i believe all sinners have it in some form only in this case i cannot detect it eschine looked up with an expression of utter amazement holy mother she exclaimed it seemed to me as you went on that i had every one of those you mentioned lady judiths smile was very expressive dear child she said these are not my wordsblessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens does she think eschine the best of us all is she dear me i never should have thought it well said lady isabel with a sort of snort and another toss i am quite sure that i have not one of those faults you mentioned ah my child responded lady judith take heed of the pharisee spiriteschine what wouldst thou say was thy besetting sin i really cannot tell i have so many answered eschine modestly but i sometimes think that it may beperhapsa want of meekness and patience i stared at her in astonishment well thank the saints i am in no want of patience said lady isabel and if any one knew all i have to try it i turned and looked at her if possible in astonishment still greater really how very very little people do know themselves if there be a patient creature in this world it is eschine and if there be an impatient one it is lady isabel i wonder whether i know myself i do not think i should have set myself down as proud of my intellect but we lusignans always have had brainsexcept amaury he has stepped out of the ranks and i dont like people to disagree with me and contradict me nor to behave as if they thought i had no sense that is true enough i suppose i must be proud and yet it cannot be wrong to know that one has brains what is pride where does the knowledge end and the sin begin oh dear how is one ever to know if two and two would only make four in every thing or is it that one makes mistakes ones self in the addingup lady judith asked me this morning if i was vexed with her yesterday for what she said of me oh no i answered at once but i did not know that i was proud of my intellect i think i knew that i was proud of my rank thou art right there my child she said yet i fear the pride of intellect is more likely to harm thee just because thou art less conscious of it holy mother said i do you think my sister eschine the best of us we human creatures helena are poor judges of each other but if thou wouldst knowso far as i am able to judgei think the two holiest persons in all this palace are eschine and thine old margarita better than lady sybil i cried i do not undervalue sybil she is good and true and i believe she does earnestly desire to serve god but it seems to me that the most christlike spirit i know is not sybil but eschine i must think about it and study eschine i certainly made a sad mistake when i thought there was nothing in her but the holiest person in the house that seems very strange to me i believe now that what i took for absence of feeling is a mixture of great humility and profound selfcontrol but the queerest thing is that i think she really loves amaury and how any creature can love amaury is a puzzle to me for no being with an atom of brains can look up to him and how can you love one whom you cannot respect besides which he evidently despises eschinei believe he does all womenand he scolds and snubs her from morning to night for everything she does or does not do such treatment as that would wear my love in holesif it were possible for me ever to feel any for such an animal as amaury if i were eschine i should be anxious to get as far away from him as i could and should be delighted when he relieved me of his company yet i do think eschine really misses him and will be honestly glad when he comes back it is very unaccountable our anxieties are all turned to rejoicing at once guy and amaury returned last night having concluded a six months truce with saladin and eschine had the pleasurei am sure she felt it a very great onewhen amaury entered her chamber of placing in his arms the boy for whom he had so fervently longed who was born three days before they came back little huguesamaury says that must be his nameseems as fine a child as heloise and as likely to live amaury was about as pleased as it is in his nature to be but he always seems to have his eyes fixed on the wormwood of life rather than the honey thou hast shown some sense at last he said and eschine received this very doubtful commendation as if it had been the most delightful compliment then amaury turned round and snapped at me because i could not help laughing at his absurdity i asked marguerite this evening what she thought was her chief fault hathe good god knows she said it is very difficult to tell which of ones faults is the worst but what dost thou think said i well she answered i think that my chief fault iswith all deferencethe same as that of my damoiselle and that is pride only that we are proud of different things and of what art thou proud margot asked i laughingly but rather struck to find that she had hit on the same failing in me as lady judith ha my damoiselle may well ask and i cannot tell her what is or has an old villein woman ignorant and foolish to provoke pride i only know it is there it does not fasten on one thing more than another but there it is and pride is a very subtle sin if it please my damoiselle if i had nothing in the world to be proud of but that i was the ugliest woman in it i believe i could be proud of that i laughed well and wherein lies my pride margot said i wishful to see whether she altogether agreed with lady judith can i see into the inmost heart of my damoiselle it is like a shutup coffer this human heart i can only look on the outside i but on the outside i see two things my damoiselle is noble and she is clever and she knows both which is the worse margot ha both are bad enough to make pride but this i think that even a king can never fancy himself so noble as the good god yet a good many of us think ourselves quite as wise o margotwho could think that does my damoiselle herself never think that she could arrange matters better than the good god is ordering them what is that but to say in our hearts i am the wiser it is very queer how lady judith and marguerite always do think alike margot who wouldst thou say was the holiest woman in this house the answer was unhesitating i do not know i can only guess but if my damoiselle wishes me to guessthe noble lady judith and dame eschine how very odd when i asked thee once before margot thou didst not mention eschine at all let my damoiselle pardon me i did not know enough of her then and she is not one to know in a minute some are like an open book quickly read and others are like a book in a strange tongue of which one knows but little and they have to be spelt out and some again are like a locked book which you cannot read at all without the key dame eschine if my damoiselle pleases is the book in the strange tongue but the book is very good and quite worth the trouble to learn it where didst thou find such a comparison margot thou canst not read i hano but i can see others do it and what kind of book am i margot hamy damoiselle is wide wide open and the lady sybil asked i feeling much amused usually open but she can turn the key if she will i was rather surprised and count guy quite as wide open as my damoiselle then where dost thou find thy locked book margot i was still more astonished at the answer if my damoiselle pleasesthe lady isabel o margot i think she is quite easy to read i am mistaken said marguerite with quiet persistence if my damoiselle has yet read one page of that volume now i should have called the regent a locked book said i hardly if my damoiselle pleases there is a loose leaf which peeps out well that romance is not a pleasant one said i pleasant hano but it is long and one cannot see the end of the story before one comes to it at last a letter has come from the regent it is quite different to what i expected he approves of all that guy has done and morehe actually thanks him for acting so promptly are we misjudging the man the king is in good health and the regent thinks he will very shortly do well to return to the holy city as soon as the autumn rains are well over the lady countess he says is suffering greatly and he fears the damp weather increases her malady he speaks quite feelingly about it as though he really loved her early this morning was born dear lady sybils second babystill like agnes a little frail thing and still a daughter but guy seems just as pleased with his child as if it were a healthy boy he is so different from amaury both guy and lady sybil wish the infant to bear my name so this evening the patriarch is to christen her helenathus placing her under the safe protection of the blessed saint helena mother of the lord constantine the emperor and also of the holy queen of adiabene who bestowed such toil and money on the holy shrines as if to show that joys as well as misfortunes do not come single this afternoon arrived a courier with letters from lusignanone from monseigneur to guy another from raoul for amaury and one from alix for me all are well thank the saintsand alix has now three children of whom two are boys raoul is about to make a grand match with one of the richest heiresses in normandythe lady alix countess of eu little valence guillots elder child has been betrothed to the young seigneur de parthenay i am rather surprised that guillot did not look higher especially after guys marriage and raouls guy asked me today when i meant to be married oh please guy dont talk about it said i i would so much rather not dost thou mean to be a nun then asked he i think he hardly expected it well said i if i must i must but i want to know why i could not go on living quietly without either ah one of the original notions of the damoiselle de lusignan said he because my eccentric elaine nobody ever does but why does nobody said i and why should not i begin it every thing must begin some time and with somebody but guy seemed so much amused that i did not pursue the topic please thyself said he when he had finished laughing but why dost thou prefer single life for various reasons said i for one i like to have my own way well now women are queer folks said guy oh my most rational sister wilt thou not have to obey thine abbess and how much better will that be than obeying thine husband it will be better in two respects i answered in the first place an abbess is a woman and would therefore be more reasonable than a man and in oh dear i did not understand that said guy i am rather ignorant and stupid thou art said i and in the second i should try as soon as possible to be an abbess myself my best wishes attend thy speedy promotion most holy mother said guy bowing low but laughing i perceive i was very stupid but thou seest i really did not know that women were such extremely reasonable beings i fancied that just now and then they were slightly unreasonable now guy give over said i but can i not wait a while must i decide at once of course not if that be thy wish said guy but thou art past the usual age for profession then i shall be all the more likely to receive promotion quickly i replied fairest of nuns here is my sword said guy kneeling and offering me the hilt i surrender myself a vanquished prisoner to thy superior wisdom so the matter passed off in a good laugh now that the truce is concluded all is peaceful and happy it is so nice after the tumult and suspense and anxiety to have nothing to think of but what robe one shall wear to this feast and how one shall arrange ones jewels for that dance i wish it would last for everif only one did not get tired even of pleasant things when they have gone on for a while if one could get hold of some pleasure of which one never got tired i want to introduce our national dance of poitou the minuet i have taught it to lady isabel and two or three of the damsels in waiting and perette and bertrade will help lady isabel admires it very much she says it is a grand stately dance and fit for a princess it seems very odd to me that the ladies of this country look upon it as beneath them to superintend the cooking and leave it all to their servants how strange it would be if we did that in poitou they order what is to be done but they never put their own hands to the work i know what alix would look like if i told her the first banquet was to have been on monday but it is an unlucky day as the moon will be in opposition to mars so it had to be deferred we heard yesterday that the countess of edessa actually gave a banquet last week on a vigil and what should she do but invite just enough to make thirteen i suppose she never thought about either she is the most thoughtless woman i ever saw messire de montluc was one of the guests and when he perceived the calamity he feigned to bleed at the nose and asked leave to retire i suppose he did not wish to run the risk of dying within a year and a day how can people be so careless why it is almost as bad as murder chapter xii will she give him up elminawe can bear all things gonsalezcan ye bear disgrace ximenawe were not born for this felicia hemans i suppose it is only about thirty hours yet it looks as if it might be as many weeks since i sat in the bower with lady judith broidering a mantle of cramoisie for lady sybil we were talking of different things carrying on no special train of conversation lady sybil had been with us but a few minutes before guy had called her into the hall to assist in receiving a messenger just arrived with letters from the regent something which lady judith said amused me and i was making a playful reply when all at once there broke on us from the hall such a bitter wailing cry as instantly told us that something terrible must have happened the mantle was dropped upon the rushes and lady judith and i were both in the hall in an instant the messenger a young knight stood at the further side of the dais where were guy and lady sybil she had apparently fainted or was very near it and he was holding her in his arms and endeavouring to whisper comfort oh what is the matter broke from me as my eyes sought first guy and then the messenger guy did not answer i am not sure that he heard me it was the young knight who replied damoiselle if it please your nobility our young lord beaudouin the king has been commanded to the lord i never wished i was not noble until that minute had i been a villein he would have told me without considering the pleasure of my nobility and i should have been out of suspense one second sooner lady judiths one thought seemed to be for the poor mother who was utterly overcome by the sudden news of her firstborns death she actually opened the casement with her own hands though there were plenty of damsels and squires in the hall whom she might have called to do it one she sent for water and sprinkled a few drops on lady sybils face entreating her to drink some wine which a squire brought in haste she appeared to swallow with difficulty but it seemed to revive her and her voice came back oh my boy my boy she cried piteously and i was not there it was not in my arms he died my firstborn my darling i was not there ay that seemed the climax of her miseryshe was not there i was very very sorry both for her and for the child but another thought soon darted into my brain and it was too hard for me to solve who was the king of jerusalem now when i thought it meet i whispered the question to guy he made me no answer in words but his quick downward glance at the golden head still bowed upon his arm told me what he thought and all at once the full significance of that death flashed upon me lady sybil was the queen of the world and might have to do battle for her glorious heritage there was no doubt concerning the right only two remained of the house of anjou and there could be no question as to whether the elder or younger sister should succeed lady sybils right had been originally set aside and now it had come back to her in an instant i saw as by a flash of lightning that the idea had occurred to others for the squire had offered the wine upon the knee but the regent would he acquiesce meekly in a change which would drive him back to his original insignificance and restore guy to his place of supreme honour lady sybil is no child but a woman of full age there might in a mans eyes be an excuse in putting her aside for her son but there could be none for her sister or her daughter it was not for some hours that i saw the regents letter not till lady sybils bitter wailing had died down to peace and we were able to turn our eyes from the past to the future then guy showed it me i was astonished at the quiet matteroffact way in which count raymond recognised lady sybils right and deferred to guy as the person to decide upon every thing i asked lady judith this morning what she thought it meant was this man better than we had supposed had we been unjust to him i cannot tell yet helena she said but i think we shall know now very soon it either bodes great good to sybilor else most serious mischief he says no word about his lady countess i suggested no said lady judith i should have liked it better if he had done then what can we do i asked wait and pray responded she wait oh dear meit is always waiting i detest it why cant things happen in a lump and get done with themselves count raymondfor i must give over calling him the regentand dear me i must learn to call lady sybil the queen as soon as she is crownedhowever shall i do itcount raymond says in the end of his letter that he will reach the holy city if it please the saints about ten days hence with the coffin of the young lord king that he may be laid with his fathers in the church of the holy sepulchre so i suppose for these ten days we shall know nothing i would scratch them out of the calendar if i had pumicestone of the right quality and yetit comes over me though i do hate to think itsuppose these ten days should be the last days of peace which we are to know holy mother how can you wait to know things i asked lady judith how canst thou said she with a little laugh why i must said i but as to doing it patiently it is easier to wait patiently than impatiently my child o holy mother cried i it is she gently persisted but that patience helena is only to be had from god but can you help longing to know said i rebelliously and feverishly thirsting to know i can but it is only in gods strength that i can do it certainly i cannot help feeling that i shall be relieved when his time is come i should be more or less than woman if i could but how said i do you keep yourself patient he keeps me patient helena i cannot keep myself he knows he is at the helm he will guide me to the haven where i would be ah my child thou hast yet to learn what that meanethwhen he giveth quietness who shall then condemn indeed i have and i do not know how to begin we have been very busy after all during the terrible interval and it hardly seems ten days since the news came all the mourning robes were to be made of sackclothbah how rough and coarse it isone need be a villein to stand itand the hoods of cloth of cyprus i never remember being in mourning before amaurys poor little baby was born and died in one day and i did hope then that i should never need it again it is so abominable to wear such stuffand how it smellsand to have to lay aside ones gloves just like a bourgeoise count raymond is expected tonight i did not properly guess what a dreadful scene it would be when the coffin was borne into the hall by four knights and laid down on the dais and the lid opened and the embalmed body of the fair child brought to view clad in the cowl of the holy brethren of saint benedict which was put on him just before he died the holy patriarchi suppose he is holy being a patriarchheld the holy censer which he swung to and fro by the head of the coffin and a royal chaplain at his side bore the benitier from which each of us coming forward took the asperge and sprinkled the still face with holy water it was lady sybils turn last of course but she the poor mother broke down utterly and dropped the asperge and if guy had not sprung forward and caught her i think she would have fainted and fallen on the coffin of her child oh it was terrible later in the evening there was a family council at which count raymond suggestedand guy said it was an excellent ideathat lady sybil should convene a council of all the nobles when her title should be solemnly recognised and no room be left for any dissension about it in future the council therefore will meet on midsummer day next and at the same time it will be decided what to do after the truce with saladin has expired i tapped at lady judiths door as i went up to bed well holy mother said i when i was inside and the door shut what think you now of the count of tripoli what thinkest thou helena answered she truly i hardly know what to think i said he speaks fair ay she said he speaks fair i thought i detected the slightest possible emphasis on the verb i think you mean something holy mother said i bluntly helena when the lord count was proposing the convention of the council and all that was to follow and count guy assented and said he thought it a good ideadidst thou happen to look at count raymonds face no holy mother i did not i did and at the instant when count guy assented to his proposal i caught one triumphant flash in his eyes from that hour i was certain he meant mischief my heart fellfell what sort of mischief i asked fearfully the lord knoweth quietly said she and the lord reigneth helena wonderful are the ragings of the sea wonderful in the heights is the lord and that seems to comfort her i wish it would comfort me the council is holding its sitting and so serious are its deliberations considered that only one woman beside lady sybil herself is permitted to attend it of course it was not meet she should be without any lady or damsel but she chose lady judith with a pretty little apology to me lest i should fancy myself slighted lady judith is old and very wise she said i should like her to hear the deliberations of the nobles that i may have if need be the benefit of her counsel afterwards i suppose it is the swearing of allegiance that takes such a long time they have been four hours already sir god have mercy upon me i never dreamed of the anguish that was in store for me i do not know how to bear it o fair father jesu christ by the memory of thine own cross and passion help me if it be only to live through it i wondered why when the council broke up lady sybil shut herself up and refused to admit any one and guy was nowhere to be found i felt a vague sort of uneasiness but no more till a soft hand was laid upon my shoulder and i looked up in lady judiths face and then in an instant the vague uneasiness changed to acute terror her look was one of such deep overwhelming compassion that i knew at once she had that to tell me which she justly feared might break my heart what i gasped come here with me she said and she took me into her own cell and barred the door helena dear child there is something to tell thee which thou wilt find very bitter and thy brother and sybil think best that i should tell it go on if you please holy mother any thing but suspense the council of nobles she said are agreed to admit sybils right and to pay their homage to her as queen if she on her part will accept one condition dictated by them but if she refuse the condition they refuse the allegiance and will raise against her the banner of isabel who was called into the council and declared herself ready to accept it andthe condition that she shall divorce count guy and wed with one of themselves it seemed to me as though my head went round but my heart stood still and then a cry broke from me which was a mixture of fear and indignation and disdain and cruel cruel anguish sybil to divorce guy our sweeteyed silvervoiced sybil whom we so loved to divorce my guy my king of men to be willing to do itto purchase her fair proud inheritance at the price of the heart which loved her and which she loved my heart and brain alike cried out impossible was i dreaming this thing could not beshould not be holy saints let me wake and know it it is not possible i shrieked she will notshe cannot did she not say so her first words said lady judith were utterly and indignantly to refuse compliance welland then then several of the nobles pressed it upon her endeavouring to show her the advantages to be derived from the divorce advantages i cried to the country dear said lady judith gently but for four hours she held out no word was to be wrung from her but i could not dream of such a thing then lady said the lord count of edessa you can no longer be our queen and did that sway her i cried indignantly nothing seemed to sway her till count guy rose himself and though with faltering lips earnestly entreated her assent then she gave way so far as to promise to consider the question that was like guy if he thought it for her good i am sure he would urge it upon her though it broke his own heart but for her to give way then holy mother tell me she will not do it i cried she has locked herself up to think and pray said lady judith but it is well to know the worst at oncei think she will helena holy mother you must have gone mad i did not mean to be rude i was only in too great agony to see any thing but itself and lady judith seemed to understand who proposed it i demanded ah i knew what the answer would be count raymond of tripoli well he cannot be the one she weds said i grinding my teeth he can helena the countess has been dead these four months he says he wrote to tell us and his letter must have miscarried and is satan to have it all his own way i cried no assuredly dear child christ is stronger than he holy mother can you see one speck of light in this thick and horrible darkness i never see but one light in any darkness she said god is light and darkness in him there is none at all dear helena wilt thou not put thine hand in his and let him lead thee to the light could the good god not have prevented all this i wailed perhaps not for thy sake she said softly oh she will not she will not i moaned holy mother tell me she never will i cannot dear on the contrary i think she will i never could have believed it of lady sybil lady judith made no reply but i thought the expression of pain deepened in her face dear helena was her gentle answer sometimes we misunderstand our friends and very often we misunderstand our father she tried to comfort me but i was past comfort i was past food sleepevery thing i went to bedit was a miserable relief to get away from the daylight but i could not sleep and no tears would come only one exceeding bitter cry help me jesu christ would he help me what had i ever been to him or done for him that he should he had shed his lifeblood on the holy rood for me and i had barely ever so much as thanked him for it i had never cared about him where was the good of asking him yet i must cry to him for who else was there of course there were mary mother and the holy saints butoh i hope it was not wickedit seemed as if in my agony i pushed them all aside and went straight up to him to whom all prayer must come at last help me jesu christ where was guyfeeling in his darkened chamber as if his heart were breaking where was sybilawake perhaps with a lighted lamp wrestling between the one love of her heart and the pride of life and where was god did he hear me would he hear and the cry came again wrung from my very life as if i must have help help me jesu christ i have no help i can do nothing i can even think of nothing i can bear no more help me not because i deserve help but because i want thee and the darkness went on and the quiet beats of the waterclock and the low musical cry of the watchmen outside and the clang of arms as they changed guard but no holy angel came down from heaven to tell me that my prayer was heard and that it should be to me even as i would was there no helpwas there no hopewas there no god in heaven oh it cannot cannot be that she will decide against him yet lady judith thinks she will i cannot imagine why our own sweet sybil to whom he has seemed like the very life of her life no it can never be true she will never never give him up chapter xiii waiting for the inevitable oh hard to watch the shorelights and yet no signal make hardest to him the back on love for loves own blessed sake for me the darkness riseth but not for me the light i breast the waters heaving foam for love of love tonight she has given him upmy guy my hero my king of men no i could never have believed it one short month ago if all the prophets and wise women and holy monks in palestine had come in a body and told me this thing i should have laughed them to scorni should have thought the dead would rise first ah this is not our sybil who has played this part the sybil whom i loved next to guy himself has vanished into nothingness and in her stead has come a creature that wears her face and speaks with her voicecold calculating false it was again lady judith who told me i thought i was prepared for this but i found that i was not by the crushing pain which struck me i knew that i had not really believed it would be thusthat i had clung like a drowning man to the rope which failed me in this extremitythat i had honestly thought that the god to whom i had cried all night long would have come and saved me that sybil should fail was bitterness enough but what was i to do when christ failed me either he could not hear at all or he would not hear me and i did not see that it was of much consequence which it was since so far as i was concerned both came to the same thing the comfort lady judith tried to offer me sounded like cruel mockery even the soft pressure of her hand upon my head rasped my heart like a file poor dear child she said it is so hard to walk in the dark if the lord have marked thee for his ownas by the strivings of his spirit with thee i trust he hashow sorry he must be for thee just now sorry then why did he do it when i am sorry for one i love i do not give him bitter pain i felt as if i should sink and die if i did not get relief by pouring out my heart i broke from lady judithshe tried in vain to stop meand i dashed into lady sybils chamber queen or villein it was all one to me then i was far past any considerations of that sort if she had ordered me to be instantly beheaded i should not have thought it signified a straw i found her seated on the settle in the window oh how white and worn and weary she looked dark rings were round her eyes worn by pain and weeping and watching through that dreadful night but i heeded not the signs of her woe she deserved them guys wrong burned in my heart and consumed every thing but itself she rose hastily when she saw me and a faint flush came to her white cheek ahhelena she spoke in a hesitating tone as if she scarcely knew what to say she might well tremble before guys sister what a strange thing it is that when our hearts are specially wrung with distress our eyes seem opened to notice all sorts of insignificant minutiae which we should never see at another time or should never remember if we did see them i perceived that one of the buttons of lady sybils robe had caught her chatelaine and that a bow of ribbon on her supertunic was coming loose may it please your grace i saidand i heard a hard metallic ring in my own voicehave i heard the truth just now from lady judith what hast thou heard helena i did not spare her for the crushing clasp of her hands for the slight quiver of the under lip let her suffer had she not wronged my guy i have heard that your grace means to give way before the vulgar clamour of your inferiors and to repudiate your wedded lord at their dictation no i would not spare her so much as one adjective she pressed her lips close and a sort of shudder went over her from head to foot but she said in a calm even voice like a child repeating some formal lesson thou hast heard the truth if she would have warmed into anger and have resented my words i think i might have kept more within bounds but she was as cold as ice and it infuriated me and you call yourself a christian and a catholic cried i raising my voice the lord knoweth was her cool answer the lord look upon it and avenge us i cried do you know how i loved you next to my love for guy himselfbetter than i loved any other save you two in earth or heaven youwas it you i loved my sister sybil loved guy and would have died rather than sacrifice him to a mob of parvenu nobles she is gone and you are come in her stead the saints know how you are not the sybil whom i loved but a strangera cold calculating politic falsehearted woman heartless ungenerous faithless false i sweep you out of my heart this day as if you had never entered it you are false to guy and false to god i will never never never forgive you from this hour you are no more to me than the meanest paynim idolatress whom i would think scorn to touch i do not know whence my words came but they poured out of me like the rain in a tempest i noted without one spark of relenting the shudder which shook her again from head to foot when i named guythe trembling of lips and eyesthe pitiful appealing look no i would not spare one atom of misery to the woman who had broken my guys heart perhaps i was half mad i do not know when i stopped at last she only said it must look so to thee but trust me helena trust you lady sybilhow to trust you i cried have i not trusted you these four years before i knew you for what you are and you say trust mehear her holy saints ay when i have done trusting the scorpions of this land and the wolves of my owntrust me i will trust you she rose and came to me holding out both hands with a look of piteous appeal in those fair grey eyes that i used to love so much i know she saidi know thou must think so yettrust me helena i broke from her and fled i felt as if i could not bear to touch herto look at her another moment to my own chamber i ran and casting myself on the bed i buried my face in the pillow and lay there motionless i did not weep my eyes were dry and hard as stones i did not pray there was no good in it without god without hope without any thing but crushing agony and a sense of cruel wrongi think in that hour i was as near hell as i could be and live it was thus that marguerite found me i heard her enter the room i heard the halfexclamation instantly checked which came to her lips i heard her move quietly about the chamber arranging various little things and at last come and stand beside my bed damoiselle i turned just enough to let her see my face is satan tempting my damoiselle very hard just now what made her ask that question no margot i said sitting up and pushing the hair off my forehead god is very very cruel to me ah let my damoiselle hush there cried the old woman in a tone of positive pain no no never she does not mean to cut her old nurse to the heart who loves her so dearly but she will do it if she says such things of the gracious lord now margot listen to me i thought something was going to happen which would wring my heart to its very core all night long i lay awake praying and crying to god to stay it and he has not heard me he has let it happenknowing what it would be to me and dost thou not call that cruel ah i guessed right satan is tempting my damoiselle very very hard i thought so from her facedamoiselle the good lord cannot be cruel it is not in his nature no no dost thou know what has happened margot i hano the lady sybil incited by her nobles has consented to divorce count guy and wed with another i saw astonishment grief indignation chase one another over old marguerites face followed by a look of extreme perplexity for a few moments she stood thus and did not speak then she put her hands together like a child at prayer and lifted her eyes upward sir god she said i cannot understand it i do not at all see why this is good lord it puzzles poor old marguerite very much but thou knowest thou knowest all things and thou canst not be hard nor cruel whatever things may look like thou art love have patience with us sir god when we are puzzled and when it looks to us as if things were going all wrong and teach the child for she does not know my poor lamb is quite lost in the wilderness and the great wolf is very near her gentle jesu christ leave the ninety and nine safe locked in the good fold and come and look for this little lamb if thou dost not come the great wolf will get her and she is thy little lamb it is very cold in the wilderness and very dark oh do make haste thou seemest to think that god almighty is sure to hear thee margot said i wearily yet i could not help feeling touched by that simple prayer for me hear me she said ah no my damoiselle i cannot expect god almighty to hear me but he will hear the blessed christ he always hears him and he will ask for me what i really need which is far better than hearing me because my damoiselle sees i make so many blunders but he makes none what blunders didst thou make just now margot ha do i know i when he translated it into the holy language of heaven the blessed christ would put them all right maybe where i said be quick he would say be slow i am sure that would be a blunder said i bitterly ha does it not seem so to my damoiselle and her servant but the good god knows if my damoiselle would only trust him trust cried i thinking of sybil ah margot i have had enough of trusting i feel as if i could never trust man againnor woman only one man said marguerite softly and he died for us after saying that she went away and left me i lay still her last words making a kind of refrain in my head mingling with the one thought that seemed to fill every corner he died for us surely then he cannot hate us he is not trying to give us as much suffering as we can bear i rose at last and went to seek guy but i had to search the house almost through for him i found him at length in the base court gazing through one of the narrow windows through which the archers shoot the moment i saw his face i perceived that though we might be one in sorrow we were emphatically two in our respective ways of bearing it the quiet patient grief in that faraway look which i saw in his eyes was dictated by a very different spirit from that which actuated me and he found it too not a word would he hear against sybil he nearly maddened me by calmly assuming that her sufferings were beyond ours and entreating me not to let any words of mine add to her burden it was so like guyalways himself last and when i said passionately that god was cruel cruelhe hushed me with the only flash of the old impetuosity that i saw in him no elaine no let me never hear that again i was silent but the raging of the sea went on within i think said guy quietly that it is either in a great sorrow or a serious illness that a man really sees himself as he is if it please god to give him leave i have thought until today in a vague way that i loved god i begin to wonder this morning whether i ever did at all his words struck cold on me guy no true christianmy brave generous noble unselfish guy then what was i likely to be guy i saidwill she i could bear the torture no longer and i knew he would need no more i think so elaine was his quiet answer i hope so hope so it is her only chance for the kingdom the nobles are quite right dear i am a foreigner i am an adventurer i am not a scion of any royal house it would very much consolidate her position to get rid of me and canst thou speak so calmly i want to curse them all round if i cannot consume them i am past that elaine said guy in a low voice not quite so firmly as before once i did may the good lord pardon me his thunders are not for mortal hands and i am thankful that it is so i suppose nobody is wicked except me i said bitterly every body else seems to be so terribly resigned and so shockingly good and so every thing else that he ought to be andi will go if thou hast no objection guy i shall be saying something naughty if i dont guy put his arm round me and kissed my forehead my poor little lynette he said we can go home to poitou dear and be once more all in all to each other as we used to be long ago monseigneur will be glad to see us but i could not stand that partly guys dreadful calm and partly that allusion to the long ago when we were so much to each other broke me down and laying my head down upon guys arm i burst into a passionate flood of tears oh what good they did me i could scarcely have believed how much quieted and lightened i should feel for them though there was no real change yet the most distressing part of the weight seemed gone i actually caught myself fancying what monseigneur would say to us when we came home guy said he would go with me to my chamber i was glad that we met no one below but as we entered the corridor at the head of the stairs little agnes came running to us holding up for admiration a string of small blue beads see babasee tangood these are her names for guy and me every thing satisfactory is good with agnesit is her expressive word which includes beautiful amiable precious and all other varieties i felt as if my heart were too sore to notice her and i saw a spasm of pain cross guys face but he lifted the child in his arms kissed her and admired her treasure to her baby hearts content if i were but half as selfless as he and who gave thee this little one amma good it was the childs name for her mother ah little agnes i cannot agree with thee amma and good must no longer go into one sentence how could she play today with guys children yet i suppose children must be fed and cared for and trained and amusedeven though their elders hearts are breaking oh if i might lie down somewhere and sleep and awake eighteen years ago when i was a little sorrowless child like agnes the coronation is fixed for holy cross day and lady sybil has undertaken as soon as she is crowned to select her future husband one condition she has insisted on herself every noble on the coronation day is to take a solemn oath that he will be satisfied with and abide by her decision and will serve the king of her choice for ever this seems to me a very wise and politic move as it will prevent any future disputes every body appears to have no doubt on whom her choice will fall all expect the count of tripoli guy has requested permission to retire to ascalon and she has accorded it but with the express stipulation that he is to be in his place with the rest of her peers at the coronation it does seem to me a piece of needless cruelty surely she might have spared him this i also have asked permission to retire from court of course i go with guy whoever forsakes him the little sister shall be true for about the first time in my life i am thoroughly pleased with amaury he is nearly as angry as i amwhich is saying a great deal and he is the only person in whose presence i dare relieve my feelings by saying what i think of sybil for guy will not hear a word eschine has the most extraordinary idea she thinks that sybils heart is true and that only her head is wrong it is all nonsense heart and head go together the worst item of the agony is overthe divorce the ceremony was short enough a speechfrom count raymondstating to the public the necessities of the case a declaration from both parties that they acted of their own free will a solemn sentence from the holy patriarchand all was over and guy and sybil were both free to wed again i did think sybil would have fainted before she could get through the few words she had to speak but guy was as calm and quiet as if he were making some knightly speech i cannot understand him it seems so unnatural for guy i expressed some surprise afterwards o lynette how could i make it harder for her that was his answer it was all for her he seems to think himself not worth considering we leave for ascalon very early tomorrow and as this was my last night i went to lady judiths cell to say farewell to her on my way i met count raymond returning from an audience of lady sybil with triumph flashing in his eyes as he met mine he evidently agrees with the multitude that he has a good chance of the crown my heart swelled against him but i managed to return his bow with courtesy and passing on tapped at lady judiths door helena dear childcome in she said i am come to bid you goodbye holy mother lady judith silently motioned me to a seat on her bed and sat down beside me is it quite as dark my child yes quite i said sighing poor child i would give much to be able to comfort thee but please god thou wilt be comforted one day the day seems a long way off holy mother it seemed a long way off dear to the holy jacob the very day before the waggons arrived to carry him down to his son joseph yet it was very near helena i listened with respect of course but i could not see what that had to do with me the waggons were not coming for methat one thing was certain wilt thou be here for the coronation my child i shall be where guy is i said shortly buto holy mother she might have spared him that lady judiths look was very pitiful yet she said perhaps not my child why of course she might if she would what was to hinder her but i did not say so for it would have been discourteous even between me and my dear old lady judith there seemed a miserable constraint was it any marvel i rose to go almost noiselessly the door opened and before i could exclaim or escape sybil stood before me and wert thou going without any farewellmelittle sister helena i stood up frozen into stone i ask your graces pardon we are not sisters now she turned aside and covered her face with her hands o lynette thou makest it so hard so hard so hard said i coldly i hope i do if your heart had not been harder than the nether millstone lady sybil you would never never have required our presence at your coronation god give you what you deserve that is a terrible prayer in general she said turning and meeting my eyes and yet lynette in this one thing i dare to echo it ay god render unto me what i deserve how could she oh how could she lady judith kissed me and i went away i believe sybil would have kissed me too but i would not have it from her it was easy after that to say farewell to the rest i wish i were going too growled amaury then why does he not he might if he chose just like amaury farewell dear said eschine i shall miss thee elaine and nobody else yes i know that so we go forth driven out of our paradise like adam and eva but the flaming sword is held by no angel of god i always thought it such a dreadful thing that our first parents should be driven out of paradise why could not god have let them stay it was not as if he had wanted it for the angels if he had meant to use it for any thing it would be on the earth now i cannot understand oh why why why are all these terrible things i cannot understand either says old marguerite but i can trust the good god and i can wait till he tells me i am happier than my damoisellealways wanting to know well i see that i marvel if there is any maiden upon earth much more miserable than i am last night only i caught myself wishinghonestly wishingthat i could change with marguerite old and poor as she is it must be such a comfort to think of god as she does it seems to answer for every thing the sultry quiet here is something almost unendurable to me there is nothing in the world to see or hear but the watercarriers crying the gift of god and strings of camels passing through the gateway and women washing or grinding corn in the courts and there is nothing to do but wait and bear and prepare after a rather sluggish fashion for our return home when the coronation is over here again old marguerite is better off than i am for she has constantly things which she must do i do not think it likely that amaury will come with us things never take hold of him long if he be furiously exasperated on monday he is calmly disgusted on tuesday supremely content on wednesday and by thursday has forgotten that he was ever otherwise and he seems disposed to make his home here to me it looks as though my life divided itself naturally into two portions and the four years i have passed here were the larger half of it i seem to have been a woman only since i came here three months to waitand all the time we are waiting for a dreadful ordeal which we know must come why does lady sybil give us this suffering and far more why why does the good god give it to us if i could only understand i could bear it better ha says marguerite with a rather pitying smile if my damoiselle could but know every thing she would be content not to know more well i suppose i am unreasonable yet it will be such a relief when the worst is over but how can i wish the worst to come chapter xiv sybils choice gifts cried the friend he took and holding it high towards the heavens as though to meet his star exclaimedthis too i owe to thee giafar leigh hunt it came at lastneither sooner for my dreading it nor later for my wishing itholy cross day the coronation morning guy and i reached the holy city the night before and took up our quarters with the holy patriarch and his lady irene we were just opposite the palace we could see lights flashing through the loopholes and now and then a shadow pass behind them it was hard to know that that house held all that we loved and we were the only ones that dared not enter it the patriarch was most disagreeably loquacious he told us every thing he might have been cooking the banquet and broidering the robes for all the minute details he seemed to know the queen he told us was to be arrayed in golden baudekyn and the lady isabel in rose and silver both the princesses would be present attired in gold and blue poor little agnes and helena how little they would understand of their mothers actions as little perhaps as any of us could understand of gods dealings in this matter the officers of state were to surround the throne which was to be placed on the highest step of the choir the nobles of the council were to stand in order according to the date of their creation round the nave below lady irene was as silent as her lord was talkative but at night when she brought me up to the chamber she had prepared for me she told me the one thing i did care to know a place had been specially reserved for me in the nave immediately behind guy and the lady irenes own place was next to me i am obliged to the master of the ceremonies said i for that was just where i wished to be nay quietly said lady irene as she took up her lamp the damoiselle is obliged to the lady sybil had sybil thought of my fancy what a strange compound she wasattending to ones insignificant likings yet crushing ones very heart to dust i did not sleep till very late and i was aroused in the early morning by a flourish of trumpets announcing that the grand day had dawned i dressed myself putting off my mourning for a suit of leafgreen baudekyn for i knew that guy would not be pleased if i wore any thing sombre though it would have suited my feelings well enough a golden undertunic and kerchief with my best coronet were the remainder of my attire i found guy himself flashing in golden armour and wearing his beautiful embroidered surcoat which sybil herself wrought for him with the arms of lusignan this phrase was used of steel armour ornamented with gold how could she bear to see that existing token of her own dead love the surcoat had worn better than the heart we took our appointed placeslady irene guy and iand watched the nobles arrivenow an odd one now halfadozen together the patriarch of course left us as he was to officiate he told us last night that eighty out of every hundred felt no doubt at all that the count of tripoli would be the future king that patriarch is the queerest mortal it never seemed to enter his head that such information would not be highly entertaining to guy and me now was the time to discern our enemies from our friends those who did notice us risked court favour but messire de montluc came all the way from the choir to salute us and i felt a throb of gratitude to him in my heart the count of edessa was not able to see us and count raymondo serpent demon that he islooked straight at us as if he had never met us before it was an additional pang that the order of precedence placed count raymond the very next to guy i sincerely wished him at the other end of the nave though it would have placed him close to the throne and now the important persons began to arrive lady judith in the quiet brown habit of her order stopped and scanned the groups all round till her eyes reached us and then she gave us a full smile so rich in love and peace that my heart throbbed with sympathy and yet ached with envy then came a lovely vision of rich rose and gleaming silver which did not look for us and i felt that was lady isabel and then two sweet little fairy forms in blue and gold and i saw guy crush his underlip as his eyes fell upon his children last came the queen that was to bea glorious ray of gold four pages bearing her train and her long fair hair no less golden than her robes streaming down them to her feet she took her seat by lady isabel on the velvet settle near the throne then the patriarch came forward into the midst of the church to a faldstool set there and announced in loud tones that all the nobles of the council of sybil shortly to be crowned queen of jerusalem should come forward in rotation to the faldstool and swear between his hands to bear true and faithful allegiance as to his king to that one of them all whom it should please her to choose for her lord homage was always performed in this manner the joined hands of the inferior or oathtaker being held between the hands of the superior lord or person who administered the oath one by one they came forward but i saw only two count raymond knelt down with an air of triumphant command as though he felt himself king already guy with an aspect of the most perfect quietness as if he were thinking how he could spare sybil when all the nobles were sworn the patriarch went back to the choir and sybil rising came and stood just before the throne the coronation ceremony followed but i was not sufficiently at ease to enter into it there were prayers in sonorous greek and incense and the holy mass and i cannot properly tell what else the last item was the actual setting of the crownthe crown of all the worldon the head of sybil of anjou and then came a gentle rush of intense expectation as sybil lifted the crown royal from her head and prepared to descend the steps of the throne her choice was to be made now down the damask carpeting of the nave she came very very slowly carrying the crown in both hands the holy patriarch following and swinging the holy censer behind her her eyes were cast down it was evident that she knew perfectly well where he stood who was to wear that crown slowly slowly all along the nave past one eligible noble after another face after face gathering blankness as she went at last she turned ever so little to the right i could bear no more i covered my face with my mantle let who would gaze on melet who would sneer she was comingno doubt any longer nowstraight towards count raymond of tripoli and neverwith the faint flush in her cheeks and the sweet downcast eyeshad i seen her look so beautiful and all at once athwart my anger my indignation my sense of bitter wrong came one fervent gush of that old deep love which had been mine for sybil and i felt as though i could have laid down my life that hour to save not guy but her from the dreadful consequences of her own follyfrom that man who had crushed guys heart as he might have crushed a moth then came a dead hush in which a butterflys wing might almost have been heard to beat then a low murmur half assent half dissent then suddenly bursting forth a cheer that went pealing to the roof and died away in reverberations along the triforium the choice was made and theni had not dared to look upi heard sybils voice she was close close beside me sir guy de lusignan she said i choose thee as my lord and as lord of the land of jerusalem for and a slight quiver came into the triumphant ringing voicewhom god hath joined together let not man put asunder then i looked up and saw on my guys head the crown of the world and in sybils dear eyes the tender passionate lovelight which she had locked out of them for months for loves own sake and i knew her at last for the queen of women that she is and theni heard somebody speak my name and felt lady irenes arms close round me and darkness came upon me and i knew no more when i came to myself i was lying in my own old chamber in the palace and beside me were old marguerite fanning me with a handkerchief and lady judith bending over me helena darlingall is well she said is all well i said sadly when i could speak it is well with guy and therefore all else matters little but i wonder if i shall ever be forgiven by whom asked lady judith god and sybil i answered in a low voice ask them both she said softly sybil is coming to thee as soon as ever the banquet is over and there is no need to wait to ask god did you guess holy mother how it would end no helena she answered with a smile i knew all along yes from the first i lay still and thought dost thou marvel why i did not tell thee dear and perhaps think it cruel ask sybil why she made me her sole confidante i think thou wilt be satisfied when thou hast heard her reason but though i did not guess sybils purpose and she turned with a smile to margueritehere i fancy is one who did ay very soon said margot quietly but not quite at first lady thou wicked old marguerite cried i and never to tell me suppose i had been mistaken she replied would my damoiselle have thanked me for telling her then i felt quite sufficiently restored to go down to the bower though not able to bear the banquet so lady judith and i went down she told me all that had taken place after i fainted how messire de montluc and lady irene had taken care of me that the patriarch had immediately bestowed the nuptial benediction upon sybil and guy and had then anointed the kingthe kingthat the knights templars had escorted the king and queen to the banquet and that after the banquet homage was to be done by all the nobles guy and sybil therefore were likely to be detained late suddenly something climbed up on the settle and i felt myself seized round the neck and tumultuously caressed tantine tantinecomegood baba and tantineboth come goodoh good of course i knew who that was and alternated between returning the warm kisses and entreating agnes not to murder me by suffocation then came a much calmer kiss on my brow and i looked up at eschine and then strolled in messire amaury with his hands in the pockets of his hautde chausses talking to messire de montluc but the strangest thing you knowthat sagacious youth was observingthe strangest thingo elaine is that theethe strangest thing is that a mere simple ignorant woman could have formed and carried out such a project surely some man must have given her the idea i can hardlyoh pure foy the last exclamation was due to a smart and sudden application of my right hand to the left ear of my respected brother messire de montluc was convulsed with laughter well done damoiselle elaine you regard the honour of your sex the next time thou speakest contemptuously of women said i look first whether any overhear thee trust me i will make sure of my sister elaine said amaury still rubbing his ear on my word lynette thou art a spitfire one after another kept coming and all expressing pleasure in seeing me i could not help wondering whether all of them would have been quite so pleased to see elaine de lusignan if she had not been the kings sister lady judith and eschine would i believed nor do i think it would have made the least difference to agnes considerations of that kind do not begin to affect us till we are over three years old but time wore on and sybil was not released from her regal duties and the strain which both body and mind had had to sustain told upon me and i began to feel very tired lady judith noticed it dear helena she said do put that white face to bed sybil will come to thee i have no right to ask it of her i said huskily dost thou think she will wait till thou hast i was beginning to remonstrate that it would not be respectful when lady judith put her arm round me and said laughinglysir amaury help me to carry this wilful child to bed fair mother i dare not for all the gold in palestine said my slanderous brother my ear has not done stinging yet am i wilful said i well then i will do as i am toldas to thee amaury thou hast just thy desert then i am a very illdeserving man responded he lady judith and eschine both came with me to my chamber and the latter helped me to undress i had but just doffed my supertunic however when a slight sound made me turn round towards the door and i saw sybilsybil still in her coronation robes coming towards me with both hands held out as she had done that last sad time we met i threw myself on the ground before her and tried to kiss the hem of her golden robe but she would not let me no no my darling no and she stooped and drew me into her arms and kissed me as if we had never disagreedas if i had never uttered one of those bitter words which it now made my cheeks burn even to remember i could only sob outforgive me dear little sister forgive thee for loving guy no no i said but for not lovingfor misunderstanding and slandering and tormenting thee nay dearest helena she said at once tenderly and playfullythou didst not slander me it was that other sybil with whom thou wert so angrythe sybil who was not true to her lord and was about to forsake him and i am sure she deserved every word but that was not i helena but how my words must have tortured thee not in one light dear it was a rich ray of hope and comfort to know through all my pain how true the dear little sister was to guywhat a comfort she was likely to be to himthat whoever forsook him his lynette would never do it now finish thine undressing there is one other thing i want to say to thee but let me see thee lying at rest first she sat down on the settle just as she was while bertrade finished undressing me then they all said good night and left me alone with sybil helena darling she said as she sat beside me my hand clasped in hersthis one thing i wish thee to know i could not spare thee this pain if the faintest idea of my project had ever occurred to count raymondthough it had been but the shadow of a shadeit would have been fatal had he guessed it i could never have carried it out and he has eyes like a lynx and ears like a hare and little sisterthy face talks thou couldst not try as thou wouldst have kept that knowledge out of thine eyes and the count would have read it there with as little trouble as thou wouldst see a picture the only chance therefore to preserve my crown for my lord and him for me was to leave him and thee in ignorance trust me it cost me more than it did you the extraordinary item of this series of incidents which are historical is that count raymond did not guess it ah had she not said that once beforetrust me and i had not trusted her yet how well she deserved it i hardly know what i sobbed out i only know that i was fully and undeservedly forgiven that i was loved through all my mistrust and unworthiness and cruel angerand that sybil knew how i loved her then she left me to rest but as i lay there in the darkness a thought came to me which seemed to light up the dark wilderness of my lifeas though a lamp had been suddenly flashed into a hidden chamber what if it be just so with god and it seemed to me as if he stood there at the summit of that ladder which monseigneur saint jacob was permitted to behold and he looked down on me with a look tenderer and sweeter even than sybils and he held forth his hands to me as she had done but in these there were the prints of the cruel nailsand he said elaine i could not spare thee this pain if i had done in the end it would have been worse for thee look upon my hands and my feet and see if i spared myself and remembering that this was for thy sake say whether if it had been possible i would not have spared thee i cannot tell whether i was dreaming or awake but i crept to the foot of the ladder and i said to him who stood above it fair father jesu christ i put myself in thy mercy i see now that i was foolish and ignorant it was not that thou wert cruel it was not that thou didst not care thou dost care at every pang that rent my heart thine heart was touched too forgive me for sybil has done and i have sinned more against thee than against her teach me in future to give up my will and to wish only to do thine a rebel who returned to his allegiance unconditionally was said to put himself in the kings mercy i am afraid it was a very poor prayer there was no angelus nor confiteornot even an ave in it yet was it all a dream that a voice said to me thy sins are forgiven thee go in peace and i sank into dreamless sleep the next instant it is all settled now next week i shall be professed of lady judiths orderan order which will just suit my wants since the nuns have no abbess over them are bound only by terminable vows and with assent of the community may dwell where they think fit even in their own homes if need be lady judith thinks that she can easily obtain leave for me to dwell with monseigneur as she will kindly represent it to the order that he is now an old man and has no wife nor unmarried daughter to care for him but me i think he is my first duty now and i know he will be so glad so glad it will be hard to part with guy and sybil but i think that is where the lord is leading mehome to lusignan and i do wish to follow his leading not my own old marguerite startled me very much last night damoiselle she said the cross is shining out at last where margot said i rather puzzled where i have so longed to see it she said on my darlings brow ah the good god has not brought her through the fire for nothing where there used to be pride and mirth in her eyes there is peace he will let his old servant depart now for it was all she had to live for but i can never never do without her oh i do hope the good god will not take dear old marguerite why i am only just beginning to understand and value her but i think i am learning very slowlyoh i am so slow and stupidthat real happiness lies not in having my way but in being satisfied with hisnot in trying to make myself happy but in trying to please him i am constantly fancying that i have so learned this lesson that i shall never forget it again and then within an hour i find myself acting as though i had never heard of it and i see too what i never understood beforethat it is only by taking our lords yoke upon us and becoming meek and lowly in heart that we can find rest to our souls eschines deep humility is the source of her calm endurance pride is not peace it is its antidote in christ we have peacefirst through the purchase of his blood and secondly in growing like him which is to grow in love and lowliness and to lose ourselves in him i think i never before saw the loveliness of humility and i am sure i never saw the fair beauty of eschines character and life oh how far she rises above me and to think that i once looked down upon herdismissed her with a careless word of scorn as having nothing in herwhen the truth was that i was too low down to see her in reality oh how much the good god has had and will have to forgive and bear with me i am now only just beginning to understand him but that is a lesson which i may go on learning and enjoying for ever and how happy it will be if we all gather together in his halls aboveguy and sybil and me and old marguerite and lady judith and monseigneur and eschine and the little children and allnever again to hear paynim cry nor womans wailsafe for ever in the banquethall of god at home again at last how strangely glad they all seem to see me i do not think i ever knew how they all loved me i have lived for myself and a little for guy now with his grace i fain would live for god and in him for every one we sat round the centre fire last night in the old halli close to monseigneur with his hand upon my shoulder now and then removed to stroke my hairand we had all so much to say that it made us very silent it was alix who spoke first elaine she said i want to give a name to my baby girl that shall mean truth or fidelity and i do not like any of the french names that have those meanings they are not pretty tell me the words for them in the tongue of the holy land i did not answer that the court language of jerusalem was the langue doc and that alix would be no better off for knowing a rush of feeling came over me and i let it dictate my reply and that was only sybil historical appendix i guy de lusignan the history of guy and sybil after the story leaves them is a sad one raymond count of tripoli who had fancied himself sure of the crown matrimonial never forgave either he immediately entered into a secret alliance with saladin by which he promised to betray guy into his hands in the next battle on the fourth of july tripoli who was standardbearer so behaved himself in battle that the king was taken prisoner sybil in conjunction with the patriarch heraclius held jerusalem until the second of october when she gave up the city to saladin on terms including liberty of ransom to all who could afford it the queen now retired to ascalon within whose fortified walls she and her little daughters remained until when guys ransom was effected on the hard terms that sybil should capitulate at ascalon that guy should abdicate and that he should go beyond sea guy who had been kept in chains a whole year at damascus consulted the clergy as to the necessity of keeping faith with saladin they were all of the roman but unscriptural opinion that no faith need be kept with a paynim instead of abdicating and going abroad guy with sybil and the children marched to acre which he invested with a hundred thousand men who had flocked to his standard the queen and princesses were lodged at turon looking towards the sea in king philippe of france arrived before acre and on june king richard coeurdelion and at last on july saladin gave up the city to the allied forces but the pestilence had been very rife during the siege baldwin archbishop of canterbury and numbers of french and english nobles died in the camp and among others the heroqueen sybil of anjou and her two fragile children raymond of tripoli was dead also he died in his sleep unabsolved and evidence of his having formally apostatized to mahometanism was found after his death after thus taking last leave of all he loved guybrave rash impetuous guyappears to have become almost reckless of course by right sybil was succeeded by her sister isabel but guy still clung to his title of king and the privileges appurtenant to it and disputed with conrado of monferrato the husband of isabel the right to the customs of the port of acre conrado was an extremely quarrelsome man and guys opposition seems to have been personally directed to him for on his death which of course guy and coeurdelion were accused of forwarding guy readily acknowledged isabel and her third husband on condition of receiving the island of cyprus as compensation for all his claims king richard had sold cyprus to the templars but he coolly took it from them and gave it to guy who being apparently more honest of the two paid a hundred thousand crowns to the templars as compensation this is the last that we hear of guy de lusignan except the mere date of his death which occurred according to different authorities from one to four years after the cession of cyprus few historical characters have had less justice done them by modern writers than guy de lusignan and sybil his wife in the first place guy is accused of having in assassinated patrick earl of salisbury in returning from a pilgrimage to saint iago de compostella king henry ii we are told was greatly enraged and banished guy from poitou whereupon he assumed the cross and set out for the holy land now the truth is that in it is scarcely possible that guy could be above ten years old either it was another guy de lusignan or the outrage was committed by persons of whom the child guy was the nominal head but all the circumstances tend to show that guys arrival in the holy land was little if at all before and that at that time he was a very young man we next find guy accused of such boundless ambition that he not only induced king baldwin iv to put all the affairs of the kingdom into his hands but even to promise him the succession after his death but when baldwin had bestowed upon guy his sister and heir presumptive sybil how could he either promise him the succession or lawfully deprive him of it the reversion of the crown was hers baldwin did her a cruel injustice and committed an illegal act when he passed her over and abdicated in favour of her infant son then on the death of baldwin v we are actually told that sybil urged by her ambitious husband usurped the crown usurped it from whom surely not from her own daughterssurely not from her younger sister matthew of westminster distinctly remarks that there was none to succeed but his mother sybilla sybil merely took back her own property of which she had been unjustly deprived again with respect to her action at her coronation poor sybil comes in again for her share of blame she had no business we are assured to choose guy who had already proved himself an unsatisfactory governor and in the interest of the kingdom she ought to have married some one else in other words she ought to have committed sin in the interest of her subjects lastly a wholesale charge of poisoning is brought against both guy and sybil probabilities are thrown overboard they are accused of poisoning young baldwin v and guy is charged with the murder of his wife and children though their death entirely destroyed his claim to the royal title the truth is that in the twelfth century any death not easily to be accounted for was always set down to poison and the nearest relatives totally irrespective of character were always suspected of having administered it men of guys dispositionimpulsive rash and generous even to a fault loving and selfsacrificingare not usually in the habit of murdering those they love best and considered merely from a

into four ranks onlynobles clergy bourgeoisie and villeins two of thesenobles and villeinswere kept as distinct as caste ever kept classes in india though of course with some differences of detail all titled persons knights and landed proprietors belonged to the nobility the clergy were recruited from nobility and bourgeoisierarely from the villein class the bourgeoisie were free men without land and usually with some trade or profession and were despised by the nobles as men who had lifted themselves above their station and presumed to vie with their betters the villeins were always serfs saleable with the land on which they lived bound to the service of its owner disposable at his pleasure and esteemed by him very little superior to cattle education was restricted to clergy and noble women with a few exceptions among the male nobility but as a rule a lay gentleman who could read a book or write anything beyond his signature was rarely to be seen no kind of title was bestowed in addressing any but nobles and clergy the bourgeois was merely richard haberdasher john the clerk or william by the brookwhence come clark and brook as surnamesthe villein was barely hodge or robin without any further designation unless necessary when the masters name was added such a term as ralph walterservant namely ralph servant of walter is not uncommon on mediaeval rolls the clergy as is still the case in romish countries were addressed as father and those who had not graduated at the universities were termed sir with the surnamesir green or sir dickson it is doubtful however whether this last item stretches so far back as the twelfth century dan the epithet of chaucer certainly does not the names bestowed on the nobles consisted of three for the men and two for the women french it must be remembered was the language of england as well as of france at this time only villeins spoke english the lowest epithet was sieur gentleman which was applied to untitled landed proprietors the next sire or messire sir was the title of the knights and the king was addressed as sire only because he was the chief knight in the realm the highest seigneur lord was applied to royalty peers and all nobles in authority especially those possessing territorial power the ladies married and single were addressed as dame and damoiselle the english version of the last title damsel was used of the young nobility of both sexes among themselves nobles addressed their relatives by the title of relationship with the epithet bel prefixedwhich when english began to be spoken by the higher classes was translated fair fair father fair brother sound very odd to modern ears but for centuries they were the usual appellations in a noble family both in england and in france they were not however used between husband and wife who always ceremoniously termed each other monseigneur and madame it was only naturaland is what we ourselves do to this daythat our ancestors should address god in prayer by those terms which in their eyes were the highest titles of honour in this light though majesty is peculiar to spain yet seigneur messire and bel pere obtained currency in most civilised countries the first we have retained and though we have degraded lord into the title of our lesser nobility we still use it as the special epithet of deity it is only custom which has made the other names sound strange to our ears we no longer prefix fair to father when we address the human relative and it has also become unusual to transfer it to the divine father sir god would shock us but in our ancestors eyes it was the most reverent and honourable of all titles which was the reason why they chose it even so late as the fifteenth century the maid of orleans never spoke of god by any other term than
