under one sceptre or mortimers mission the story of the lord of the marches by emily sarah holt author of mistress margery the white rose of langley etc the gesture was heroic if his hand accomplished nothingwell it is not proved that empty hand thrown impotently out were sooner caught i think by one in heaven than many a hand that reaped a harvest in and keeps the scythes glow on it elizabeth barrett browning new edition london john f shaw and co paternoster row preface a great authority once pronounced don quixote to be the saddest book ever written the very word quixotic has come to imply not only unusual but absurd action yet what would the world be if all the quixotes secular or religious were taken out of it there are not a few of them among the ranks of those of whom the highest authority has pronounced that the world is not worthy they generally come to be understood at lastbut it is often not till the next century this is the story of a don quixote who lived fought and died five hundred years ago like his prototype he too tilted with the windmills and tried to liberate the captive lions and the windmills stood firm against his spear and the lions turned upon and tore him it usually is so the energy seems totally wastedthe heroism vain and lost yet now and then the windmill falls discovered to be really an enchanters castle revealing rotten foundations and evil things and then men remember the dead knight who gave the first stroke or more often they do not remember him he would be thought indeed quixotic who should set before him as his lifework what roger mortimer did yet who can declare it impossible some day the castle of the enchanter may fall and the free air of heaven may blow into the dark dungeons and dispel the fetid mists ireland may be free with that freedom which christ only gives and which many an english heart longs to secure to her but will any one remember the hand which was the first to strike the frowning portals of the fortress and which has been dust for five hundred years in the vaults of the abbey of wigmore it is well for him that he has won the better reward of his father which is in heaven and we know on the word of our master himself that the unfading garland will be all the fairer because no human hands wreathed earthly bays for the head which it is to crown contents chapter i the two begin their

journey o guide me through this lifes uncertain wild and for aught else beneath the circling sun so thou in thine own bosom keep thy child father thy will be done that every baby enters the world with a spoon of some metal in its mouth is an old saying which is easy of interpretation and in the ancient town of usk in monmouthshire on the first day of september were born two babies not many yards apart whose spoons were made of exceedingly diverse metal the baby who was born in the morning of that day in the castle of usk brought with him a spoon of gold beautifully embossed and exquisite in shape he found the worldas represented by the mantle in which his nurse enveloped himsoft rich velvety and furlined if he cried the sound won immediate attention and the faintest sign of illness on his part struck despair into hearts which beat with the bluest blood the baby who was born in the evening in a squalid mud hovel one of a dozen which nestled close under the castle wall was accompanied by a battered old spoon of the very rustiest iron his world was a sheepskin extremely dirty and not particularly fragrant his cries were answeredwhen they were answeredby a rough toss in the arms of his eldest sister a slipshod shockheaded girl of eleven years and the possibility of his early death neither dismayed nor grieved any one for even his mother was of opinion that he was one too many in the hovel which could scarcely find room for the nine persons who occupied it baby number one was baptized in the chapel of the castle borne in his velvet wrapper by a lady of title with the accompaniment of sweet music and joyous bells his sponsors were a bishop an abbot and a prioress he received the family name of roger for a hundred and fifty years back the heirs of that family had been rogers and edmunds alternately and it was the turn for the former roger mortimeran ominous name for this boy was the heir of the earldom of march one of the proudest coronets of england and his mother a fair girl of eighteen was a princess of the blood baby number two was christened in the parish church one of a batch of ten and might not have been christened at all if the curate had not been one who looked sharply after his baptismal fees he received the name of lawrence which was the first that occurred to his parents very naturally protesting in his baby style against a sprinkling with cold water he was tumbled with no particular care into the thin arms of mariot who rewarded him with a private shake for his vocal performance the only music which accompanied the ceremony as to surname he could not be said to have any what did the son of a serf want with a surname as he grew older however some distinction between him and other lawrences being felt desirable his neighbours took to calling him lawrence madison or son of maudhis mother being a woman with a tongue and as such a more prominent character than her quiet and silent husband the family physician master gilbert besseford carefully drew out the horoscope of the young lord it appeared from this elaborate document that he was to be a highly accomplished and intellectual youth since mercury was busy about him that he would be most fortunate in wedlock for venus was doing something that he would rise to the highest honours of the state and might possibly achieve a crown as jupiter was most benevolently disposed to him at any rate something was to happen about his twentyfifth birthday which would place him in a position that none of his fathers had equalled he would have a long life and a happy one two items of the horoscope were true he was to be indeed an intellectual and accomplished youth and in his twentyfifth year a crown was to be his to which few of his fathers had attained but those around him thought of a corruptible crown and that which god had prepared for him was an incorruptible and the happy wedlock and the long life and the rise to worldly honour were not the portion of roger mortimer but of lawrence madison in the hovel below that roger should exercise in the future considerable influence over the fortunes of lawrence was extremely probable since they would some day stand to each other in the relations of master and vassal and the former possessed absolute power over the latter but the idea that lawrence could in any sense sway the fortunes of roger would have been laughed to scorn by the household at the castle yet this was to be in a small but very prettily furnished boudoir in one of the castle turrets sat the countess dowager of march she was considered an elderly woman though we should think her only middleaged for in the days of our shorterlived forefathers who looked upon fifty as old age and sixty as advanced senility a woman of forty was some way down the hill from a father whose character stood high both as warrior and statesman and a mother whose remarkable wisdom and good sense were a proverb among her contemporaries philippa montacute had inherited a character of unusual power moral and mental her energy was tempered by her prudence while warm affections and shrewd common sense held sway together over her actions the character was not transmitted except in the affections to that handsome eloquent amiable young man of oneandtwenty who was the only one left living of her four children but it was to be reproduced in every point save one in the baby grandson for whose birth the chapel bells were ringing melodiously and in whose honour all the thralls were to have a holiday the next day alas that the omitted item was the one which should have been a girdle to all the rest warmhearted energetic to impulsiveness with plenty of good sense and fine understanding the gifts bestowed on little roger did not include prudence the countess sat alone in her bower in the september twilight and took blind mans holiday her imagination and memory scanning both the future and the past it was not quite dark when the door of the bower opened and a woman of some thirty years came forward dropping a courtesy as she approached her mistress come in wenteline said the countess for thus the medieval english pronounced the old british name guenllian is david yet back from his errand ant please your ladyship he came but now and he brings tidings agreeably to your ladyships pleasure that among the thralls be two babes today born maud the wife of nicholas in the huts hath a manchild and your ladyships goddaughter philippa wife of blumond the fishmonger a maidchild good answered the countess feeling for the gold and ivory tablet which hung by a silver chain from her girdle that she might therein enter the information for which she had sent then as born on the birthday of the heir they shall be allowed some privileges what names are the babes christened by please it your ladyship the little maid is beatriceso baptized by dan robesart this afternoon for the knave being born but an hour back he is not yet baptized but they think to call him lawrence both names went down on the countesss tablet after guenllian had lighted a candle for that purpose did david give the thralls to wit of the games and rejoicings allowed tomorrow ay my lady and he saith one and all were greatly gladded thereby my young lord shall be right welcome to all his vassals some day to be the countess drew a long breath of semiapprehension may he be none the less desired god grant when they shall lay his head beneath the mould o my maid how great and awesome a thing is the life of a man on earth madam i heard once the parson of ludgarshal dan john to say have on a good man is dan john what said he that our lord bound him to care for the childer of them that feared him and that no prayer so made should ever be lost but how answered was the lowtoned reply wenteline our prayers be sometimes heard in a manner that crusheth the heart of him that prayed them if the babe were to die very dear lady it might be elsewise that a twenty years space hereafter you should heartily wish that he had died the sooner surely it can be no evil thing for a little child to go right to god while he is yet lapped about with the white robes of his chrisom i have buried three wenteline and of them one went so the other were pretty little childer that prattled at my knee and it was like burying a piece of mine own heart to part with every one yet now my ladywould you have them back now know i what i would surely it is better for them and may gods will be done only tonight wentelinetonight holding that little babe the thought came sorrowfully of my roger and how he faded from me like a white flower of the earth or a star that goes out in the sky hand me yonder french bible wenteline let me read a little touching the city where my childer dwell and the king unto whose presence they be gone may be it shall still my yearning when i think of them as there and not here there were no bibles at that date but in french or latin seven years were yet to elapse before john wycliffe to whom guenllian had just referred was to begin the translation of the first english bible but french bibles and latin psalters were no unusual possession of noble families those families who were not noble were expected to get to heaven without any for one of the most singular medieval ideas was that which restricted all intellect to those of noble blood blood and brains went together if a man had not the former it was out of all calculation that he should possess the latter guenllian reached down from a high shelf the french bible bound in dark green velvet with golden rims and embossed corners and amethysts gleaming from every corner the countess unfastened the clasps and turned to the last chapters of the book she read to herself and guenllian of the golden city and the river of gladness and the tree of life until the world seemed to grow small and dim and the worlds conventionalities to become very poor and worthless and then turning a little further back she read of the good shepherd who calleth his flock by name and leadeth them out and they know his voice and follow him then the golden clasps were closed and the lady sat in silence for a few moments wenteline she said we have tried to follow the shepherd thou and i in the sunlit plains thinkest thou thy feet would fail if we come byandby to the arid slopes of the stony hills guenllian looked down and nervously played with her chatelaine i cannot tell an it like my lady you look not for such troubles madam they that be sure of satans enmity had best look for trouble was the pithy answer it is not hereyet but it may be and it was to be but it came not until philippa montacute was safe in the shelter of the golden city and under the shade of the tree of life then it broke fiercely on the unsheltered heads of those on the stony slope and the baby that lay that day in the velvet wrapper came in for some drops of the thunderstorm the children in the castle and in the hovel grew and thrived they were both pretty but had lawrence madison been kept as clean and dressed as nicely as the little lord he would have been the prettier of the two as he grew old enough to take note of things to tumble about on the sheepskin at the door while his mother and mariot attended to their duties within and to listen and talk a great ambition arose in his young heart he did not envy the young heir at the castle an idea so lofty and preposterous never suggested itself for an instant lawrence would as soon have thought of grumbling because he was not an archangel as because he was not my lord roger of march but he did indescribably admire and envy the fishmonger across the street he had a whole coat and a clean apron he looked like a man who always had plenty of nice things to eat and a fire to warm himself by in cold weather and the fishes were so beautiful lawrence had crept across the street and looked up at their lovely prismatic scales as they lay in the baskets level with his head he had seen blumonds wife as she came to the door with her child in her arms little beatrice was kept cleaner and nicer than he was why did not mother give him nice things to wear like hers and why that evening when she and father were talking about somethingwhat were they talking aboutdid father look across at lawrence and say with a lowered brow and a sulky tone quite unusual with him something about letting a freeman manage for himself and not be beholden to a villein now that he thought about itand lawrence was given to thinking about thingsfather did seem more cross with him than the others what had he done after many long cogitations on this and other puzzles of which nobody knew since he kept them all to himself lawrence finished by astounding his world lawrences world was very small for it was bounded by a few yards of the street at its widest extent the inner circle of this sphere namely the hovel was built of mud and wooden laths and was about fifteen feet in longitude separate rooms were an unimaginable luxury nine personslawrences father mother and grandmother his two brothers three sisters and himselfate slept and mostly worked in the one chamber which formed the whole of the hut there were also additional inhabitants in the shape of two cats three hens and a small and lively pig it was not easy to move without falling over somebody or something which was apt to resent it in a way not suggestive of polished society perhaps it was quite as well considering these circumstances that the space was not cumbered with much furniture alike of bedsteads chairs and tables the hut was entirely guiltless and the inhabitants would scarcely have known what to do with them a bundle of straw littered down in a corner with a sheepskin thrown over it was their idea of the utmost luxury in the way of sleeping accommodationa luxury which they could rarely attain and the ordinary bed was one of dry leaves from the neighbouring forest which when they were able to reach such a pitch of comfort were stuffed into a sack a long form set against the wall represented the chair element and was reserved for the elders the children squatting on the mud floor with the pig cats and hens the minds of the inhabitants had not reached the table idea nicholas the father of lawrence was by trade a tannernot a mastertanner by any means he worked for a man who in his turn worked under another and all were serfs at the earls tanpits a mile from the city maud his wife was the daughter of another serf the blacksmith who shoed the earls horses to all these the lord of usk was a sort of minor divinity almost too far above them to be thought of as a human creature like themselves and much too inaccessible for any complaints or requests to reach him except through the medium of a dozen persons at least people of this kind were not expected to have any manners beyond the indispensable one of making the most obsequious reverences to the meanest dweller in the castle or to a priest the sailors pithy description of the savages with whom he metmanners none customs nastywere in most cases only too descriptive of the medieval villein does not this manner of life among the lower orders five hundred years ago account for much of the power obtained by the priesthood and the blind obedience with which the people followed the clergy the priest was something more to the masses than he was to the aristocracy to the latter he was the man who stood between them and god to the former he was also the mediator between man and man he was the only person among the upper ranks who treated these poor downtrodden creatures not as machines out of which so much profit was to be ground but as men and women with human sins and sorrows the children saw very little of their father he went to work as soon as it was light and often did not return before they were fast asleep on the leaves they saw only too much of their mother whose tongue was never still when awake and was governed by a cross temper and a discontented mind the grandmother was an old woman bent by rheumatism and enfeebled by years of hard work and hard usage the girls mariot emmot and joan had nothing to look forward to but similar lives and after themthey hardly knew what they had a dim notion that there was a pleasant place where some people went at death and where nobody did any work this was derived from the priests they had also a notion dug up out of the natural soil of the human heart that having met with very little comfort in this life it was sure to be waiting for them in the next of god their principal idea was that he was a very great and rich man above even my lord and was in some mysterious manner connected with hearing mass the boys might expect the serfs usual lifehard work and many blows with such intervals of pleasure as an animal would be capable of appreciating chiefly connected with eating and drinking an occasional dance or game on the village green on saints days and any rough horseplay among themselves they were not badly off in respect of food for their master fed them and it was to his profit that they should be in good bodily condition they had therefore plenty of food of the coarsest kind and sufficient clothing of the same quality which they had about as much notion of keeping clean as a monkey has of writing letters wages of course were never heard of between master and serf whatever they needed had to be reported to their superior in office and they received it if and when he found it convenient is it not a singular fact that the less a man has the more contented he is often found to be the majority of these serfs thus comfortlessly situated were more contented men than their descendants who have privileges and possessions of which they never dreamed and many of whom are never satisfied with them these were the circumstances in which lawrence was placed and such were the persons whom he astonished when his time came to do so get out of the way childer said mariot one night not crossly but like the tired girl she was as she came and threw herself down on the sheepskin among them at the door i am weary as a dog there never is any pleasure in lifeour lives anywise simon have doneand emmot give oer pushing let a body have a bit of rest do and rolling one corner of the sheepskin into a bolster mariot made herself comfortableas much so that is as the circumstances admitted mariot what is a villein whats what exclaimed mariot her head coming up in astonishment lo you now if slowowords hasnt found his tongue whats a villein mariot what we all aresaving thee little plague o my life why amnt i like you said lawrence opening his eyes wide the deer knows replied simon grumpily well but i know beside the deer said mariot well what for but by reason thou wert born on the same day as the young lord up yonderthou and blumonds beattieand ye were both made free therefor whats free mariot it means do what you will does it so may i have one of those fishes then oh wellit means not do ill and thieve wait a bit lolly till thou art grown bigger and thou wilt know what free meansbetter than ever we are like to know it why isnt everybody free mariot what wot i they arent is beattie free too ay but we were made free is nobody free that isnt made lots of folks then why isnt everybody repeated little lawrence meditatively oh give oer and reive not my head cried mariot loll if thou goest about to ask questions that none can answer i shall want thee dumb again i promise thee cant nobody answer them couldnt the parson the parson in good sooth the like of thee to ask questions at the parson shut thine eyes and go to sleep im as sleepy as a squirrel in winter lawrence crept on his hands and knees to the edge of the sheepskin avoiding his brother simon who lay on his face in the middle of it amusing himself by kicks up at the atmosphere and looking out into the still summer evening saw blumonds wife philippa carrying in the baskets of fish and little beatrice trotting beside her prettiest of the three children was beatrice with dainty little ways which woke lawrences admiration and made her a perpetual attraction to him in fact he hardly knew which he liked best beatrice or the fishes as to the magnificent people in the castle lawrence barely presumed to lift his eyes to them now and then as he sat on the sheepskin some squire on horseback or messenger on foot would flash past in the earls liveryblue and gold guarded with whitewho was to the children in the huts as good as a show at whitsuntide fair but before lawrence was quite two years old the castle was deserted and the earl and all his family had removed to ludlow thence came rumours from time to time of their doings a daughter was born in honour of whom a holiday was given to the villeins and two years later a son for whom they had a great feast but immediately after that came sadder news for the royal mother yet only twentytwo survived her boys birth scarcely six weeks all the bells of usk tolled in mourning catafalques of black and silver were in every church and the chant of doleful litanies for the dead floated through the perfumed aisles and after the death of the young countess the earl and countess dowager returned no more to usk for two years later the earl was made viceroy of ireland and removed thither while his mother and children remained at wigmore the connection between england and ireland had hitherto been disastrous to both parties had the pope intended by his gift of that island to punish all the royal dynasty for their sins past and future he could not have succeeded better and had he desired to visit on the green isle the penalty for all her crimes he could scarcely have devised a sorer punishment than the infliction of such rulers as england sent her for several hundred years the conquerors and the conquered understood each other as little as celt and teuton commonly do and what was still worse they did not try to do so the english notion of governing was first to kill off the irish chieftains and then to divide the land among a quantity of norman adventurers whose capacity for landhunger was something remarkable when earl edmund of march assumed the government it was only seventeen years since the passing of the statute of kilkenny which forbade marriage between the english and the irish and commanded the use of the english language and customs on pain of death even lionel duke of clarence who was considered one of the gentlest of men had as his first step on landing in ireland forbidden any irishman to approach his camp his soninlaw was a wiser man there was irish blood in his own veinsin small proportion to the english it is true still he was the descendant of an irish king and the pedigreeloving celts were not likely to forget it he began by showing a strong hand upon the reins and in six months had ireland at his feet then he laid aside whip and spur and permitted his natural character to take its course the result was that he became exceedingly popular as a ruler usually is in celtic nations who ordinarily exhibits himself in an amiable light and yet shows that he has power and can use it when required earl edmund shut himself up from no one any irishman who pleased could have access to him at any time and his native eloquence recommended him strongly to their easily touched feelings but his beneficent reign did not last long and perhaps his short tenure of power was quite as well for his popularity human nature in all countries is apt to become accustomed to kindness and to take advantage of it and doubtless the earls popularity was partly due to the fact that he succeeded rulers harsher and less attractive than himself one great disadvantage on the part of england was that while she realised to the full the inferior civilisation of the irish she failed to discover that they possessed a faith purer than her own the true old and catholic religion implanted by st patrick and others of his type had received far less corruption from rome than the religion of england but the english were much more concerned in improving the manners of the irish nobles than in improving their own spirituality that an irish king wore no trousers and that his attendant minstrel shared his plate and glass struck them infinitely more than the condition of his morals when once they had satisfied themselves that the irish believed in the triune god and had heard of the existence of a bishop at rome who was the pontiff of western christendompoints apparently of equal importance to themthey gave themselves no further trouble on the religious question political and social questions came nearer and pressed more heavily with the usual individuality of our race they resented the use of a separate language to which the irish as individual in their way clung as for very life if instead of trying to suppress the venerable and beloved tongue england had given ireland an open bible in itif she had insisted on the study of holy writ and had left the manners to take care of themselves under its influence what a different future there might have been are we still as blind as five hundred years ago or shall we some day see that peace for ireland as for every other land and soul must come through the teaching of the spirit and the blood of the cross chapter ii watchwords then out and spake a gude auld man a gude death micht he dee whatever ye do my gude maister take god your guide to be old ballad while earl edmund was governing across the sea his little son roger grew in health and stature under the loving care of his grandmother at wigmore the earls of march had many castles and seats but wigmore castle was the family seat of the mortimers the old countess was extremely anxious that the boy should grow up a good man the rather because she recognised in him a quality beyond her own energy and activitythat passionate impetuous nature which belonged to his mothers blood she brought him up on a course of philosophy and above all of scripture in the hope of calming it down the eradication was hopeless enough but the scripture sank deep young as he was when he lost her roger mortimer never forgot those lessons at his grandmothers knee but the quiet years of holy teaching were not long in the spring of earl edmund sent letters to his mother requesting that his eldest son might be sent over to him as he wished him to make acquaintance with the tenants on his irish lands the whole province of ulster would lie one day at the pleasure of its future earl sir thomas mortimer a distant relative of the earl brought his noble kinsmans letters he was appointed the governor of little roger and was to take care of him on his perilous journey in order to impress the irish with a sense of the childs grandeur and importance he was to have a distinct establishment and the earl had suggested that the majority of the new servants had better come from his welsh estates two celtic races which centuries ago were one would as he thought be more likely to amalgamate with each other than either with the saxon perhaps he forgot that the meeting of two fires will scarcely extinguish a conflagration sir thomas therefore had come through usk where he had imparted the earls commands to the keeper of the castle ordering him to have ready by a certain day to meet him at holyhead such and such personsso many men and boys to fill so many officesmuch as he might have ordered as many garments or loaves of bread the villeins were bound to serve in the menial offices and for higher places the neighbouring gentry and their sons would only be too glad to hear of the vacancies one appointment was to be made at her sons request by the countess herself this was perhaps the most important of all for it was the choice of a woman who should look after the childs necessities and fill so far as possible the place of the dead mother and the absent grandmother the boy having passed his seventh birthday was ostensibly emancipated from the nursery yet with no lady at the head of the household the presence of some responsible woman about the child became needful the countesss choice was soon made it fell on her own waitingwoman guenllian in whom she had more confidence than in any one else it was an additional recommendation that guenllian had been about the child from his infancy so that he would feel her to be a familiar friend yet though she was sending with him the person of all others in whom she most relied the countess suffered severe anxiety in parting with her boy who after his father was her one darling in all the world what would become of him suppose he were drowned in crossing the sea and never reached his father suppose he were murdered by the wild irish who in the eyes of all english people of that date were savages of the most dreadful type or worse stillsuppose he grew up to be a monster of wickednessthat pretty little child who now lifted his pure blue eyes so honestly and confidingly to hers she thought it would break her heart and strong as that heart was to cleave to god and do the right yet as the event proved it was not one to bear much suffering very dear lady suggested guenllian tenderly can you not trust the young lord into the merciful hands of god can my young lord go whither he is not thy faith shames mine my maid may god verily go with you wenteline thou wilt surely promise me that my darling shall be bred up to prize this and she laid her hand on the french bible let the word of the lord never be out of his reach nor of his hearing rising up and lying downcoming in and going outlet him pillow his soul upon it and be made strong guenllian gave the required promise very quietly her mistress knew she might be trusted and if it should comeas we hear rumour afloatthat dan john busieth himself to render the book into the english tongue then will i send it oer so soon as may be an whole bible in english ay that day that seeth it shall be a merry day for england the french bible was the countesss parting gift to her grandson it was no mean gift for the writing of its fellow which was to remain with her had cost her more than twenty pounds to the child himself she said comparatively little she wished her words to sink deep and take root and she knew that an important means to that end was that they should be few so as her last words she gave him two mottoes in the language which was only then ceasing to be the mother tongue of english nobles fais ce que doy advienne que fourra andun dieu un roy servir je day and thus with a thousand prayers and blessings the boy left her ah when to meet again she sighed as from the castle turret she watched him go turning to kiss his hand to her as he rode away towards shropshire o my darling mine heart misgiveth me sorewhen to meet again never any more philippa mortimer till both stand in the street of the golden city and under the shade of the tree of life little roger and his suite travelled as was usual at the time on horseback the charette was reserved for short journeys in civilised places where there was some semblance of a road while the litter was the vehicle of ladies and invalids a dark roancoloured trotter or saddlehorse was selected for the little lord and fitted with a black velvet saddle embroidered in gold the harness was also black there was no saddlecloth as this was an article used on ceremonial occasions and as the horse was going on a journey which would lie chiefly upon turf he was not shod roger himself was dressed in a long robe of dark blue damask relieved by narrow stripes of white and red and over it he wore a hood of black velvet on the top of this sat a brown felt hat in shape something like a modern wideawake with one darkgreen plume standing straight up in its front and fastened to the hat by a small golden clasp a little white frill surrounded his throat beneath the hood which latter article could be cast aside if the weather were sufficiently warm the sleeves of the robe were extremely wide and full and lined with white and beneath them were closer sleeves of applegreen but these were far wider than gentlemen wear them now darkgreen boots with white buttons and spurs of gilt copper completed the young gentlemans costume his stirrups were of white metal and in his hand was an excessively long white whip much taller than himself it was the first time that roger had been allowed to ride alone on a journey and he was as proud of the distinction as might be expected this description is mainly taken from one of cretons illuminations harl ms illum ix before the convoy went two running footmen attired loosely in a costume somewhat resembling the highland kilt one of whom bore a pennon with the earls arms and the other a trumpet which was sounded whenever they drew near to any town or village every man carried a drinkingcup at his girdle and his dagger served for a knife the travellers beguiled the long day by singing songs and ballads among which was a new song just become popular of which the first line only has descended to us and that has a decidedly minor tonejay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour thus accoutred and equipped conducted by two knights eight squires fifty menatarms and a hundred archers roger set forth on his journey a pleasant ride of eight miles brought them to clun castle which belonged to rogers cousin the young lord le despenser and the keeper of the castle was delighted to show hospitality to one so nearly related to the owner here they stayed for dinner roger being seated in the place of honour at the head of the dais and all present anxious to gratify his slightest fancy eight miles more after dinner brought them to montgomery where the castle received its heir for the night in the streets of the towns but especially on the bridges and in the church porcheswhere in roman catholic countries they usually lie in waitwere always congregated a larger or smaller swarm of beggars who invariably seized upon a group of travellers with avidity and as giving of alms however indiscriminate was a good work in the eyes of the church sir thomas mortimer had provided himself with a purse full of pennies out of which he doled twopences and fourpences to every crowd of suppliants the next day was sunday but the only difference which it made in the days programme was that before the travellers set forth they attended mass in the fine old cruciform church of montgomery mass being conducted in a tongue unknown to the vulgar of all nations may be attended in any country with equal advantageor disadvantage the stage that day was rather shorter but they were now among the mountains and travelling became a slow and wearisome process they reached before night the village of languadan where they stayed the night sir thomas and his precious charge being accommodated at the village inn and the guard encamping outside in the open air a third days journey of thirteen miles brought them to kemmer abbey and a fourth long and fatiguing winding round the base of snowdon to beddgelert they made up for their extra work by riding only ten miles on the wednesday which ended at caernarvon here they returned to more civilised life and found better accommodation than they had done since leaving montgomery but the thursdays journey was again long and tedious for they had to sail across the menai and round anglesey five boats awaited them here the st mary the michael the grace dieu the margaret and the katherine their tonnage ran from sixty to a hundred and fifty tons they were simply large deep brown boats with one mast and no deck and neither cabin nor any other form of shelter sir thomas and roger embarked on the grace dieu which was the largest of the boats and the guard were packed into the other four the squires going with their betters on arrival at holyhead sir thomas was met by the deputy keeper of usk castle who presented to him two more squires three varlets and a boy who were to serve in the household of the young lord one of the squires was named reginald de pageham and his family had been in the service of the earls of ulster from time immemorial the other was named constantine byterre and was the son of a squire of the earl the varlets were villeins from usk and the boy was lawrence madison if any reader of modern ideas should desire to know how or why a child of seven years old was selected for a servant be it known that in the middle ages that was the usual period for a boy to commence service he was to fill the posts of page of the chamber and whippingboy in other words and practically he was to fetch and carry for his little master to learn and play with him and when roger was naughty and required chastisementwhich could scarcely be expected not to occurlawrence not roger was to be whipped the combination of boy with boy was a curious one roger had been most carefully brought up led by tender hands every step of the way hitherto traversed lawrence had scrambled up on hands and knees as he might with no leading at all except the rare catechising in church and the personal influence of beatrice and the fishes but these three had been for good the rev mr robesart the only one of the clergy of the parish church at usk who cared to catechise the children had been one of those rare stars among the medieval priesthood who both loved the perishing souls of men and were themselves in possession of the bread of life to break to them little beatrice had repeated her lessons to lawrence whom she was pleased to like in a funny patronising little way and they had done him at least as much good as they did to her and the fishes had also had a share in his education for their beauty had gratified his taste and their helpless condition had stirred feelings of pity which do not often find such ready entrance into a boys heart as they did into that of lawrence madison it was not on account of any intellectual or moral qualifications that lawrence had been chosen for his post of service it was simply because he was a pretty child and would look well in the earls livery his parents were only too thankful for such a chance of promotion for him he was one too many for their financial resources on lawrences part there was only one person whom he was sorry to leave and that was the little playmate over the way he had gone proudly across to the fishmongers to show himself in his new splendours and to say farewell love us sweet saint mary was philippas exclamation how fine art thou oh how pretty how pretty cried little beatrice lolly where gattest such pretty raiment tis my lord his livery child said blumond and what place hast thou lad kitchen knave this was the lowest position that a boy could have in a noble household lawrences head went up in a style which would have amused most students of human nature nay master blumond said he i am to be page of the chamber to my lords son gramercy how grand we are laughed blumond prithee good master lawrence let me beseech thee to have a favour unto me lawrence had an uneasy perception that the fishmonger was laughing at him he struggled for a moment with the new sense of dignity which sat so stiffly upon him and then speaking in his natural way said i shall never forget you master blumond nor philippa nor beattie but i wis not when i shall see you all again the little lord goeth to ireland and i withal wheres ireland asked beattie with wideopen eyes ireland having immediately presented to her imagination a large park with a castle in the middle of it that wis i not answered ignorant lawrence tis somewhere i shall see when we be there blumond was a little wiser but only a little well now ist not across seas suggested he lawrences eyes brightened and beatrices grew sorrowful wilt thou ever be back lolly she said in a mournful tone to be sure quickly responded blumond he shall come back a grand young gentleman ariding of a big black courser with a scarlet saddlecloth all broidered o gold and silver there was a general laugh at this highly improbable suggestion which was checked by philippas query if lawrence had taken leave of dan robesart nay should i so asked the boy doubtfully aye for sure haste thee up the hill for he went into the church but now and with a hasty farewell at last lawrence ran off he found the priest pacing meditatively up and down the north aisle of the church with folded arms and a very grave face didst seek me my son he inquired pausing as lawrence came up and stood rather timidly at a little distance ant please you good father i go hence as tomorrow and philippa would have me ask you of your blessing ere i went that shalt thou have right heartily and the thin white hand was laid on the childs head our lord bless thee and make thee a blessing may he be thy guide and shield and comforter yea may he cover thee with his wings all the day long and be unto thee a buckler from the face of evil lawrence my son i would fain have thy promise to a thing what thing father pass thy word to me and never forget it that in all thy life thou wilt never go any whither without asking our lord to go with thee the priest had somewhat failed to realise the extreme youth and worse ignorance of the child to whom he was talking the reply recalled him to these facts where shall i find himin the church must i hear mass every morning one of the strangest things in romanism to a protestant mind is the fancy that prayer must be offered in a consecrated building to be thoroughly acceptable of course when a man localises the presence of christ as confined to a particular piece of stone it is natural that he should fancy he must go to the stone to find him from this unscriptural notion the lollards had to a great extent emancipated themselves mr robesart therefore answered lawrence as most priests would not have done for in his eyes the presence of christ was not restricted to the altarstone and the consecrated wafer my son say in thine heartthou needest not speak it loudjesus be with me before thou dost any matter or goest any whither our lord will hear thee wilt thou so do lawrence gave the promise with a childs readiness to promise anything asked by a person whom he loved and reverenced the priest lifted his eyes lord keep him in mind he said in a low voice keep thyself in the childs heart and bear him upon thine before the fathernow my son go and god be with thee mr robesart laid his hand again on the childs head and with a slower step than before as if some awe rested upon him lawrence went down to the hovel below the hill the journey from usk to ireland was a far more new and strange experience to lawrence than it could be to roger the latter had taken various short journeys from one of his fathers castles to another or on occasional visits to friends and relatives of the family but the former had spent all his little life in the hovel at usk and his own feet were the only mode of travelling with which he had hitherto been acquainted the sea was something completely new to both lawrence was deeply interested in finding out that fishes lived in that mighty ocean which seemed alike so potent and so interminable he wanted to go down to the bottom and see the fishes alive in their own haunts and find out what was there beside them but after timidly hinting at these aspirations to an archer and a squire and perceiving that both were inclined to laugh at him lawrence locked up the remainder of his fancies in his own breast and awaited further light and future opportunities meditations of this kind did not trouble roger he found quite enough to look at in the visible world without puzzling his brain by speculations concerning the unseen his nature disposed him at all times to action rather than thought two months were consumed on the voyage to ireland not by any means an unreasonable time when that period or longer was frequently required between dover and calais they were detained previously at holyhead waiting for a southeast wind only for a fortnight which was rather a matter for congratulation as was also the fact that they were only twice in danger of their lives during the voyage perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea were much more intelligible to our forefathers than to ourselves roger was growing dreadfully tired of sea and sky long before the shore of antrim was sighted lawrence was tired of nothing but his own ignorance and incapacity to understand what he saw he wanted to knowto dive to the bottom of every thing literally and figuratively and he did not know how to get there and nobody could or would tell him surely things had an end somewhereif one could only find it out the voyage came to one at any rate and on a beautiful summer morning the keel of the grace dieu at last grated upon the shingle of ulster halfadozen of the crew jumped out into the surf and twice as many came to help from the land the great boat was dragged on shore by the help of ropes a ladder set against her side and roger carefully carried ashore by a squire lawrence was left to climb down as he best could both reached the ground in safety and found themselves in presence of a crowd of officers and retainers in the earl of ulsters livery from among whom in a moment the earl himself came forward and gave a warm fatherly welcome to his little son after mutual greetings had been sufficiently exchanged between old residents and newcomers the earl mounted his horse a superb bay caparisoned with a scarlet saddlecloth and roger having been lifted on a white pony beside him they rode away to the castle of carrickfergus ulster was in the fourteenth century as it still is in the nineteenth in a much more settled and to english eyes a more civilised condition than the milesian parts of ireland but even there that hatred of rent which seems characteristic of the irish race flourished quite as luxuriantly as now fifty years before this date maud of lancaster the girlwidow of the murdered earl of ulster and greatgrandmother of little roger had been constrained to address piteous appeals to king edward iii for his charity on the ground that while nominally possessed of large property she had really nothing to live upon since her irish tenants would not pay their rents the english mind which is apt to pride itself upon its steadygoing lawabiding tendencies was much exercised with this irish peculiarity which it could not understand at all why a man should not pay rent for land which the law affirmed was not his own and what possible objection he could have to doing so beyond a wish to keep his money in his pocket was wholly unintelligible to the saxon mind which never comprehended that passionate love for the soil that blind clinging to the homestead which are characteristic of the celt those who have those qualities among our now mixed race whatever their known pedigree be may rest assured that celtic bloodwhether british gaelic or ersehas entered their veins from some quarter the irish on their part were for ever looking back to that day when they were lords of the soil before the foot of the stranger had ever pressed the turf of the green isle it was the land which they yearned to emancipate rather than themselves in celtic eyes a monarch is king of the land and the people who dwell on it are merely adventitious coincidences in saxon eyes he is king of the people and the land is simply the piece of matter which holds the people in obedience to the law of gravitation the latter must necessarily be an emigrating and colonising race the former as certainly by the very nature of things must feel subjection to a foreign nation an intolerable yoke and exile one of the bitterest penalties that can be visited on man how are these two types of mind ever to understand each other it has been well said that there is not only one mediator between god and man but also one mediator between man and man the man christ jesus never as man was a truer patriot and yet never was a more thorough cosmopolitan than he whose eyes as god are always upon the land of israel and who hath loved zion can we not all learn of him and bear with each other till the day comes when we shall see eye to eyewhen there shall be one nation upon the mountains of israel and one king over all the earthone flock and one shepherd chapter iii cast on the world but he who feeds the ravens young lets naething pass he disna see hell some time judge o richt and wrang and aye provide for you and me james hogg would it please your good lordship to stand still but one minute no wenteline it wouldnt and little roger twisted himself out of the hands which were vainly endeavouring to smoothe down his vest of violet velvet embroidered in silver and to fasten it round the waist with a richlychased silver belt then when my gracious lord sends master constantine for your lordship am i to say you will not be donned so you cannot go down to hall thou canst say what it list thee i want to play at soldiers with lolly so shall your lordship when you be donned answered guenllian firmly little roger looked up into her face and seeing no relenting broke into a merry little laugh and resigned himself to the inevitable oh come then make haste vanity was not among rogers failings and impatience very decidedly was guenllian obeyed her little charges bidding and in a few minutes released him from bondage he rewarded her with a hurried kiss and scampered off into the antechamber calling out lolly lolly come and play at soldiers the two boys master and servant were very fond of each other this was the more remarkable since not only their temperaments but their tastes were diverse roger liked noise and show was lively impulsive ardent he had no particular love for lessons and no capacity for sitting still lawrence was grave and calm gifted with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and of a quiet almost indolent physical temperament the one point on which their tastes met was a liking for music and even in this case roger delighted in stirring martial strains while lawrence preferred soft and plaintive airs playing at soldiers therefore was rather in rogers line than in lawrences but the latter never dreamed of setting his will in antagonism to that of his master the game had gone on for about half an hour when a young man of twenty presented himself at the door of the antechamber he was clad in a blue tunic reaching nearly to the knee and girded with a black belt round the hips studded with gold a red hood encircled his neck his stockings were diverse the right being of the same shade as the hood and the left of green stripped with black low black shoes with very pointed toes completed his costume now master constantine you may go away i want nought with you shouted little roger still struggling with lawrence whom he had almost forced into a corner please it your lordship returned master constantine with an amused smile i want somewhat with you my gracious lord hath sent me to fetch you to hall o you bad man you have spoiled my fun cried little roger i had nearly won the battlecome along then lolly we will make an end at after draw off the troopsright about face march a smile broke over the somewhat weary face of the viceroy when two minutes later his little son came marching into the hall shouldering his toy spear and followed by lawrence who carried a long stick in a manner similar as to position but dissimilar as to the appearance of interest at the edge of the dalts lawrence dropped his stick made a low bow to his master and retreated among the household beneath roger bounded on the dais kissed his fathers hand and squatted himself downfor half a minuteon a hassock at the earls feet the fathers hand lingered tenderly among the fair curls on the boys head little roger he said i have somewhat to tell thee is it a battle exclaimed roger eagerly his father laughed of a truth thou art cut out for a soldier my lad nay tis not a battle it is a journey shall i take a journey not yet a while perchance some day but what sayest canst do without me for a month or twain whither go you my lord i set forth for cork this next wednesday wheres cork there shall be nigh all ireland between us little roger but musnt i go said roger in a very disappointed tone not yet a while repeated his father cork is wilder by far than antrim i must ensure me first that it shall be safe to have thee if so be i may send for thee in time but must i be all alone demanded the child in a changed tone all alonewith wenteline and master byterre and lawrencefor a little while then thou shalt either come to me or go back to my lady thy grandmother oh let me come to your lordship i love not women cried roger with the usual want of gallantry of small boys in very deed i am shocked said the earl with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes which made more impression on roger than the accompanying words howbeit we shall see thou shouldst dearly love thy grandmother roger for she loveth thee right well oh aye i love her all rightbut women wit nought of war and knighthood and such like they think you be good if you sit still and stare on a book and that is monks gear not soldiers i am a soldier art thou forsooth responded the earl with a laugh thou shalt be one day maybe now my doughty warrior run to thy nurse i have ado with these gentlemen two years had passed when this dialogue took place since little roger came from wigmore to ireland he was growing a bright boy still not particularly fond of study but less averse to it than he had been and developing a strong taste for military matters and for the lighter accomplishments he danced and sang well for his age and was learning to play the cithern or guitar he rode fearlessly was a great climber and leaper and considering his years a good archer and a firstrate player of chess football clubball cricket handtennis fives mall battledore and shuttlecock and tables or backgammon as to drawing nobody ever dreamed of teaching that to a medieval noble the three rs were also progressing fairly for a boy in the fourteenth century the small household left at carrickfergus had but a dull time of it after the earl had ridden away for cork two months and half of a third dragged wearily along and not a word came from either cork or wigmore the third month was drawing to its close when late one snowy winter night the faint sound of a horn announced the approach of visitors the saints give it maybe my lord exclaimed constantine byterre who was as weary of comparative solitude as a lively young man could well be the drawbridge was thrown across the portcullis pulled up and sir thomas mortimer rode into the courtyard followed by reginald de pageham and various other members of the earls household they had evidently ridden a long way for their horses were exceedingly jaded how does my lord roger were the first words of sir thomas and the porter perceived that he was either very tired or very sad well sweet sir in his bed as a child should be at this hour thank god bid mistress wenteline down to hall for i must speak with her quickly sweet sir i pray you of your grace is aught ill very ill indeed good alan but sir thomas did not explain himself until guenllian appeared it was necessary to rouse her gently since she slept in little rogers chamber and sir thomas had given orders that if possible he should not be disturbed fearing she knew not what guenllian wrapped herself in a thick robe and descended to the hall mistress i give you good greeting and i do you to wit right heavy tidings for lord edmund the earl lieth dead in cork castle a low cry of pain and horror broke from guenllian surely not slain of the wild men in no wise he died a less glorious death for he took ill rheum fording the lee and in five days therefrom he was no more it was as natural for a lollard as for any other to respond whose soul god pardon amen said sir thomas crossing himself i trust you mistress mine to break these tidings to the young earl have here my dead lords tokenand he held forth a chased gold ring i am bidden if it shall stand with the kings pleasure to have back his little lordship to my lady his grandmother at wigmore poor child said guenllian tremulously poor child aye tis sad news for him was the answer yet childres grief lasteth not long methought good my mistress it were as well he should not hear it until the morrow trust me sir it were cruelty to wake a child up to such news aye but i am woe for my little child mereckoneth he were not one to grow up well without a fatherand without mother belike the morrows tears shall be the least part of his sorrow ah well god must do his will replied sir thomas in a fatalistic manner to him gods will was only another term for what a heathen would have styled inevitable destiny in connection with the expression he no more thought of god as a real living loving personality than he would have thought of destiny in like manner it was simply as an impalpable but invincible law that had to take its course but on guenllians ear the expression came with a wholly different meaning that almighty being who to the one was merely the embodiment of stern fate was to the other at once god and fatherthe incarnation of all wisdom and of all love it was his will that little roger should be left fatherless then it was the best thing that he could do for him and he would be himself the childs father the very thought which was the worst part of the sorrow to the one was the greatest alleviation of it to the other little rogers grief was according to his characterintense but not abiding novelty had for him the charm which it has for all children and he soon began to look forward to the coming journey to england and the meeting with his grandmother and with his brother and sisters who had been left in her care but before the journey could be taken the royal assent and formal licence were an absolute necessity by the death of the earl the viceroyalty devolved on his successor in the earldom until a fresh appointment was made and the viceroy must not leave his post except under leave of the sovereign master richard byterre squire of the late earl was sent to england to tell the news and obtain the necessary authorisation and until his return the household at carrickfergus was occupied in quietly preparing for the change which was about to come upon it but before the return of byterre reginald de pyrpount arrived from england with the heaviest news of all the coffin of the earl had been taken by sea direct from cork to milford haven and thence to wigmore perhaps too suddenly the tidings of the death of her last child were broken to the widowed mother she came down into the hall of the castle whither the coffin had been carried the lid was lifted and she gazed long and earnestly on the face of her dead but through it all she never shed a tear when she had regained her own rooms her squire asked if it were her pleasure that the funeral should be proceeded with on the next day nay not all so soon was the answer wait but a little and ye shall bear my coffin too despite all the efforts of her anxious suite the countess philippa refused to be comforted she would go down into the grave unto her son mourning she took to her bed on the second day her confessor came to reason with her this is not well lady said he you are a rebellious subject unto your heavenly kinga child that will not kiss the fathers rod submit you to him and be at peace not a rebel father answered the low pathetic voice only a child too tired to work any more let me go to him that calleth me but there is much for you to live for lady resumed the confessor but she interrupted him i know and i would have lived if i could i would have lived for my little roger but i cannot father heart and brain and life are tired out god must have a care of my little child i am too weary to tend him let me go they had to let her go on the evening of the third day with one deep sigh as of relief in the ending of the struggle she laid down the weary weight of life and went to him who had called her the house of mortimer of march was represented by those four lonely little children of whom the eldest was only nine years old it seemed as if every vestige of a shield for the tender plants was to be taken away and they were to be exposed to the full fury of the winter blasts for a whole year little roger was detained at carrickfergus nominal viceroy of ireland with his future still undetermined this was not the fault of the king a boy only just fifteen years of age but of the commission of regency which governed in his name at the end of that time orders came from westminster sir thomas mortimer was to bring home the little viceroy to receive his exoneration from the arduous honour which had been thrust upon him and to deliver him to the earl of arundel whose ward he had been made and with whom he was to reside till his majority to sir thomas this news was indifferent he desired the childs welfare which as he understood it was likely to be well secured by this arrangement but as guenllian understood it there was fair chance of the boys ruin if there were in the world one layman more than another who hated wycliffe and lollardism from the centre of his soul it was that earl of arundel to whom rogers future education was thus entrusted and the astute statesman who was reallynot ostensiblythe ruler of england knew this quite as well as she did this was thomas duke of gloucester the youngest and cleverest of the sons of edward iii and we have now arrived at a point in our story which makes it necessary to interpose a few words upon the state of politics at that time the king as has just been said was a mere boy and the reins of power were in the hands of his three uncles of these princes the one whom nature and fortune alike pointed out as the leader was the eldest john of gaunt duke of lancaster and had he really taken the lead the disastrous reign of richard ii might humanly speaking have ended very differently his next brother edmund duke of york was so extremely weak in mind as to be little better than halfwitted and was entirely under the control of whoever chose to control him the youngest of whom i have spoken above was clever in the worst sense of that word but the only man whom he feared was his brother john and had john chosen he might have reduced the active wickedness of thomas to a point of merely nominal value he did not choose never was a finer character more completely rendered useless and inert by moral indolence never were such magnificent opportunities of serving god and man more utterly wastedthan in the case of john of gaunt the word moral is used advisedly of physical or mental indolence he had none his greatest delight on his own authority was to hear of gallant deeds of arms or to perform them and few even of royal blood were more thoroughly well educated and accomplished according to the standard of his day but all was spoiled by this moral indolencethis laissez faire which would take no trouble too much has been said of the libertinism of john of gaunt he was not a man of pure life but he was not so bad as he is usually supposed to have been yet in one point he was a perfect rehearsal of charles the secondthat socalled sauntering which i have termed moral indolence and which it is said that charles loved better than he ever loved any human being and in the case of john of gaunt it is the sadder to relate because he had more perfect knowledge of the way of righteousness than most of those around him the one instance in which he broke through the bonds of his besetting sin was in order to stand by john wycliffe in the hour of persecution oh how terrible is the reckoning for him who was not ignorant who was not even in doubt of the rightwho knew his lords will and did it not in consequence of this sad lapse the reins of power fell into the hands of gloucester and gloucester was one of those men who know how to wait to feel the pulse of circumstances and when the right moment comes to strike a decisive blow how far he ever loved any one may be doubtful but that he was a splendid hater is beyond all doubt there were a few men whom he trusted and favoured and of thesewith one exception the chief of themwas richard earl of arundel the wardship of little roger mortimer would much more naturally have been given to one of his only adult relativeshis two granduncles william earl of salisbury and sir john de montacute but in the eyes of gloucester no montacute was a person to be trusted the family were by tradition favourers of the boinhominesor in other words among the protestants of that period and gloucester was a black papist it is true that the earl of salisbury was an exception to the family rule in this particular but it did not suit gloucesters views to allow little roger to reside in his house he had a wife whose mother was one of the most prominent lollards of the day and he was himself much under the influence of the lollard princess of wales whom he had loved in her brilliant youth his surroundings therefore were dubious and deep down in gloucesters crafty brain lay a scheme in which poor little roger was to be chief actor and if he were brought up as a lollard there would be very little hope of utilising him for it he must be made the ward of somebody who would diligently cultivate any sparks of ambition latent in his mind who would give him a bias in favour of his uncle gloucester personally and against the king and who would teach him to hate lollardism so the child was consigned to the care of the earl of arundel and to make surety doubly sure was solemnly affianced to his daughter a very clever jesuit is recorded to have said let me have the education of a child till he is seven years old and you may have him for the rest of his life the child thus plotted against had passed the test age it might have been thought that his ruin was sure but graven deep down in that fervent heart below all the digging of gloucester and his myrmidons lay the mottoes of philippa montacute and no efforts of theirs would ever efface that graving un dieu un royand fais ce que doy they were a hedge of gods planting around the tender shoot he seemed to have said to the enemy behold he is in thine hand but save his moral life it was a bitter sorrow to guenllian that the earl of arundel gave her a civil conge he had not the least doubt that she would be invaluable to the younger children he could not think of depriving them of her and little roger would be amply provided with care the countess herself would see to him guenllian was not reassured the countess was one of those soft languid placid indiarubber women who would lay aside a novel deliberately if they knew that their children were in danger of drowning she was not fit to bring up guenllians darling she pleaded with the earl piteously to allow her to remain with the child she was sure the old countess would have wished it the earl inquired if she had made any actual promise to this effect in so many words guenllian could not say that she had but that the tacit understanding had existed she knew full well and she had distinctly promised that roger should read constantly and diligently in the french bible the earl assured her with an insinuating smile that there was not the least difficulty about that he had a french bible and read it just then lollardism was walking in silver slippers and the bible was ranked among fashionable literature guenllian knew well that the reading with and without her would be two very different things there would be all the difference in them between a living man and an automaton but she was powerless the matter was out of her hands she must let her darling go she lifted up her soul as she turned away lord they cannot bar thee out of arundel castle go with this child of many prayers teach him thyself and then he will be taught save him and he will be saved whatsoever the lord pleased that did hein heaven and in the earth and in the sea and in all deep places let them curse but bless thou and so having touched the hem of christs garment guenllian went in peace chapter iv what came of selfwill are not the worst things that befal us here that seem devoid of meaning or contain the least of love and beauty those from which the heavenly alchemist extracts the gold that makes us rich rev horatius bonar it was not in the old castle in sussex the ancient home of the earls of arundel that little roger mortimer found his home at first the earl was about to reside for a time in town his city residence bermondsey house was situated on fish wharf near to that delicious part of the city of london now known as billingsgate it may be safely asserted that no member of the english peerage would be likely to select this locality in the present day for the site of his town house but five hundred years ago matters were very different and the banks of the river near london bridge were pleasant and airy places this was in fact a fashionable part of the city and here the premier earl of england held his court almost rivalling that of the sovereign in costliness and magnificence little roger for the past year a comparatively lonely child found himself suddenly transported into the midst of a large and lively family liveliness was not indeed a characteristic of the countess a near relative of roger for her father and his grandfather were sons of one mother she was a calm imperturbable specimen of humanity who spoke moved and thought in a slow selfcomplacent style which would have sent an impatient person into a passion the earl was almost the antipodes of his wife the fitzalans of arundel were anything but faultless persons as a rule but too much slowness and caution were assuredly not among their failings he was an extremely clever man gifted with much originality of conception as well as talent in execution not unamiable to those whom he loved but capable of intense harshness and even cruelty where he hated energetic even to passion in everything which he did a whole man to the one thing at the one moment capable of seeing very far into that which he chose to see but of being totally blind to that which he did not richard earl of arundel was one of the last men to whom such a charge as roger mortimer ought to have been entrusted the family of this dissimilar pair amounted to five in number when little roger joined them these were richard a youth of sixteen years john aged fourteen elizabeth aged ten and already married to rogers cousin william de montacute alice aged five and joan aged three both the boys were too old for roger to feel much sympathy with them or they with him while the girls both as being younger and as being girls were in his eyes beneath his notice he therefore remained a speckled bird in the family instead of amalgamating with it a fact which drew him closer despite all inequalities of position to the one boy whom he did like lawrence madison the only one of his old acquaintances who was permitted to accompany him to bermondsey house the earl had meant to cut all the old ties but little roger pleaded hard for the retention of lawrence alleging truthfully that he played at soldiers with him it was just because this one item was so utterly insignificant that the earl permitted it to escape the general doom and thereby little as he knew it rendered inoperative all the rest of his cautionary arrangements it was lawrence who helped roger more than any one else to keep true to his grandmothers early teaching when roger went astray lawrence either refused aid altogether or went only so far as he thought right and then stood like a granite rock immovable by commands or entreaties when the former was less obstinate and more capable of being influenced the look of earnest remonstrance in lawrences eyes or even his disapproving silence were often enough to turn away the versatile and sensitive mind of roger from a project of doubtful character the little servant did not appear to care for hard epithets passionate words or even blows to which naughty roger sometimes descended when his temper got the better of him but he did care deeply to see his little master do right and grow wiser the influence of the young arundelswhich was small since roger never liked any of themwas often bad and always doubtful but lawrence could be relied upon as a force ever on the side of right or at least of that which he believed to be so it was alice the little girl of five years old who had been solemnly affianced to young roger mortimer she was the only one of the children who in character resembled her mother nor was this resemblance perfect it made her physically idle and mentally dull but it did not save her from that moral intensity which was the characteristic of the arundel family in her instead of expending itself in mental and physical energy as it did with most of them it formed a most unhappy combination with those features inherited from her mother passionate with a passion which was weakness and not strength with an energy which was destructive and not constructive with a capacity for loving which centred in herself and a perversity of will which only served to lead astray she went to wreck early a boat with no compass and no rudder it was well for roger mortimer that however men might think to order his future life god had not destined alice of arundel for him it is scarcely necessary to say that notwithstanding the unction wherewith the earl had expatiated to guenllian on his possession of a french bible he did not see the least necessity for bringing roger in contact with that volume he had indeed come upon certain passages therein which he theoretically regarded with reverence as good words but which he was nevertheless far from elevating into rules for his daily conduct it never occurred to him that his bible and his life had anything to do with one another he would have thought it as reasonable to regulate his diet by the particular clothes he wore as to guide his actions by that compilation of excellent matter upon which he looked as supremely uninteresting and hardly intended for laymen about a week had elapsed since roger became an inmate of the earls household he and lawrence slept in a small turret chamber with a young priest by name sir gerard de stanhope whom the earl had appointed governor of his youthful ward the boys who went to bed earlier than the governor very frequently employed the interval before his arrival not in sleep but in confidential conversationthe rather since it was the only time of day when they could talk together without fear of being overheard lolly said roger on the night in question he lay in a blue silk bed embroidered with red and gold griffins lawrence in a little plain trundlebed which was pushed under the larger one in the daytime my lord obediently responded lawrence how doth this place like thee please it your lordship it liketh me reasonable well answered lawrence in a tone even less decisive than the words it liketh me unreasonable ill returned roger in a voice wherein no want of decision could be traced what ails you thereat my lord lolly i like nobody here but thee that grudgeth me my lord by which lawrence meant to say that he was sorry to hear it loves not your lordship neither my lord nor my lady my lords a big lion and they sometimes bite and claw you and my ladys a hen and all she cares for is to snuggle her in the sand and cluck beside shes a woman and women be no good i would there had been some lads so there be saving your lordships pleasure they arent lads they are men my lord richard were not so ill if he were younger but he is a grown man and as to my lord john he doth nought but make mowes at me i tell thee lolly there is nobody here outtaken thyself that i would buy for a farthing grimaces except truly i am sorry your lordship is of such ill cheer lolly what was itdidst hearthat my lord spake to sir gerard mighty low when thou and i were going forth of the chamber this morrow i heard not all of it said lawrence only it was somewhat touching mistress wenteline that had desired your lordship to be well learned in the french bible doth he look to cause me learn long tasks thereout by heart asked roger with a wry face i reckoned thou shouldst hear for thou wert nearer than i in no wise my lord so far as i might hear for he bade sir gerard have a care you touched it not then ill read it right through cried roger with childish perversity that cannot be an ill deed for my lady my grandmother was set to have me do the same lawrence made no reply though nothing on earth would have drawn the confession from him yet for all his expressed contempt for women little roger sorely missed guenllian she had been his virtual mother for so long that suddenly deprived of her he felt like a chicken roughly taken from under the brooding wings of the hen he was far more inclined to respect her wishes than he would have been had she remained with him and there was also a certain zest added by the instinctive knowledge that what was good in the eyes of guenllian was not unlikely to be bad in those of my lord arundel little roger felt as if he had the pleasure of doing wrong without the conscientious reaction which usually followed the impulsive little mind was made up that he would read that french bible that it was locked up in a tall press at least four feet above his reach was rather an additional incentive than a hindrance to be always on the watch for a possible leaving about of the keys formed an object in life and the subsequent scaling of the shelves like a cat was decidedly a pleasure to be anticipated the keys were in charge of sir gerard who was the earls librarian and he put them every night beneath his pillow he need not have taken the precaution so far as roger was concerned for to possess himself of the keys by theft would have been utterly dishonourable and unchivalrous in the eyes of the future knight yet with odd inconsistencyare we not all guilty of that at timeshe had no such scruple as to possessing himself of the bible if he could only find the keys but weeks went on and this hopedfor discovery had not been made it came suddenly at last when one morning the earl had occasion to send for sir gerard in haste at a moment when that gentleman having just finished his dressing was about to put the usual contents into his pockets he left the articles lying on the table and hurriedly obeyed the summons which he had no sooner done than the small earl of march pounced upon the keys he had been watching the process with considerable fluttering of his little heart the next moment the key of the press was slipped off the ring and was safe at the bottom of his pocket lawrence looked on with very doubtful eyes the expression of which was easily read by roger now loll hold thy peace said he though lawrence had not uttered a word i must have it and i will it will easily be surmised that rogers ambition involved no particular desire of learning least of all the study of divinity the delight of outwitting the earl and sir gerard was great and the pleasure of doing something that guenllian and his grandmother had wished him to do deprived the action of all wrong in his eyes and added to it a sentimental zest had the two motives been weighed in a balance the first would have proved the heavier the press containing the bible stood in a large room which opened off the hall the expedition to secure it must remain a future gratification for the present if only sir gerard would not miss the key was it safe to carry it in rogers pocket roger consulted lawrence who agreed with him that it was a serious risk to run he advised its restoration but to that hypothesis his young master would not listen for a moment the study of the garden wall now became sensationally interesting likewise of sundry old trees within the enclosure the alternatives seemed to have equal chances of adoption when a little hole was discovered in the wall at the further end of the garden delightfully hidden by a small loose stone which just fitted nicely into the crevice the key was safely concealed and roger with the most angelic innocence of face returned to the house to repeat his latin lesson to sir gerard roger had been taught that to hide any thing from his confessor was a sin of the most deadly type conveniently for him his confessor was not his tutor sir gerard but the earls family chaplain friar thomas ashbourne a fat sleepy old priest who never inflicted a penance that he could help and was more frequently than not employed in mental woolgathering during the process of confession merely waking up to pronounce the absolution at the close it was not at all difficult to get on the blind side of this comfortable official especially if a morning could be selected when his thoughts were likely to be preoccupied with some subject interesting to himself roger having a very good idea what interested dan thomas laid a trap to catch him for the next occasion of shrift in order to do this he had first to catch the cook and for that purpose he must angle with the master of the household who happily for his object was a goodnatured man and liked children running through a gallery with the hope of discovering him he nearly fell over the person for whom he was searching nay now what make you here my lord o master wynkfeld i was alooking for you pray you let us have a capon endored this even for supper with sauce madame larded the master of the household laughed at your lordships pleasure i wist not you loved capon so dear nor did he but dan thomas did little roger stood on tiptoe and pulled down the master to whisper in his ear look you dan thomas loveth a capon thus dressed and i would have him do a thing for me that i wot of oho is that it laughed the master then be your lordship assured dan thomas shall have the capon with sauce madame look you with sauce madame good but dont you tell tell not i responded the amused and goodhumoured master and little roger scampered off an hour later my lord of march was summoned to be shriven having knelt down in the confessional and gabbled over the formal prelude to the effect that he confessed his sins not only to god but to the most blessed lady st mary to my lord st john the baptist my lords saints peter and paul and all the saints and saintesses in heaven little roger added at the conclusion all in a breath as if it were part of the confiteor father i begged master wynkfeld to have for supper a capon endored with sauce madame by reason i knew you loved it thus that shall scantly be amongst thy sins my son answered friar thomas jovially i thank thee but keep thee now to the matter in hand roger was doing that much more strictly than was ever supposed by friar thomas who was the most unsuspicious of men he proceeded at once to the catalogue of his sins satisfied that they would now receive small attention from the confessor in silence with as much rapidity and in as low a voice as he dared without exciting suspicion roger accused himself of having taken a key from the table and hidden it in the wall what key it was he was not careful to state if the confessor wished to know that he could ask him the question but at this point rogers heart gave a bound for he was asked a question thou hiddest what in the wall a key mumbled roger a pea repeated the friar misunderstanding him and not having much care to investigate no need to confess such like small matter my son didst thou name sauce madame to master wynkfeld oh yes father twice over answered roger eagerly good lad now keep thee to thy confession which roger diligently did for the rest of the time and then absolved and clean shriven ran back to lawrence in the highest glee now lolly my sins be all clean gone go thou to shrift and get rid of thine and then as soon as ever we can well have yon big book it was about a week later that the desired opportunity at last occurred the earl had carried away sir gerardfor what purpose roger neither knew nor caredand he and lawrence had been bidden to play in the presschamber and be good boys till they were called to supper no sooner were they safely shut in than roger indulged in a gleeful chuckle look lolly said he holding up the key i heard my lord say to my lady that he should not be home ere suppertime and i thought we might have luck so i ran and fetched the key now for it set me that settle under the press but your lordship cannot climb up yonder responded lawrence as he obeyed i can do what i will said roger stubbornly nay but look how the press boweth outward how shall you pass the same the press which was itself of wood was built into the wall in such a manner that the upper half projected further than the lower dost think a wooden press shall master me ill show him im his master roger sprang upon the settle set one foot upon a carved boss and climbed up with sufficient agility till he was stopped by the projection no efforts could get him any higher he returned to the settle looking considerably discomfited ill have it yet said he see lollyif i could catch yonder great brass rod that sticketh out i am sicker i could climb up by that i shall jump for it certain eh good lack do not so my lord you shall hurt yourself greatly if you have not a care thou go whistle for a fair wind here goes and little roger gathering all his forces gave a wild upward leap from the settle intent on catching the brass rod which was part of the ornamentation of the press and was not very firmly fixed to lawrences surprise he caught it but the next moment the end of the rod came out in his hand and the natural result followed down came the rod and down came roger overturning the settle and bringing his head into violent contact with the floor there he lay stunned with lawrence looking at him in a terrible fright gramercy what a todo is here said the voice of master salveyn at the door were ye not bidden be good lads til mercy saint mary my lord bleeds how happened this lawrence tremblingly replied that he had been climbing and had fallen his own nerves had received a much worse shock than those of salveyn good lack will lads ever be out of mischief demanded that gentleman shut them up in a chamber where you should think none ill could hap them short of earthmoving and ere you shall well have turned your back they shall be killing either themselves or one another run thou to call mistress grenestede while i bear my young lord to his chamber earthquake lawrence rushed off for the middleaged and useful person in question the childrens nurse governess prescriber chemist confectioner and general factotum and in a few minutes roger was laid in bed and mistress grenestede was bathing his injured head with warm water she improved the occasion by giving a lecture to lawrencewho did not need iton imprudence and rashness but when time went on and her little patient did not return to consciousness mistress grenestede began to look uneasy a whispered consultation with salveyn resulted in the sending of a varlet on some errand another halfhour elapsed without change and then lawrence standing beside his masters bed half hidden by the curtain heard somebody say he is come a step forward to enable him to see who it was and a smothered exclamation of pleasure broke from him master salveyn was ushering in a priest in long black robeall physicians were priests at that dateand though the newcomer failed to recognise lawrence the boy knew him father robesart god be thanked the priest heard him and turned towards him who art thou my son lawrences delight overcame his shyness father robesart wit you not me i am lawrence son of nicholas tanner in the huts at usk that went away these two years gone i bade you farewell in the church aisle and you blessed me and told me i should pass word to you never to go any whither that i had not first asked our lord to be with me good my son i remember thee now and will have more talk with thee anon now let me look on the sick child is it my little lord of march that is he good father how gat he this hurt mistress grenestede and master salveyn knew so little about it that lawrence was called forward to say what he knew his instinct told him that it would be best to confess the whole truth to father robesart which he did thereby calling up a look on the face of his old friend which was a mixture of amusement and pity poor child he said softly when lawrences story was toldrather astonishing mistress grenestede that one of the first nobles in england should be thought or called a poor child please it you father did my lord a wrong thing herein asked lawrence timidly i fear he did my son mr robesart said no more but proceeded to his professional duties when he had finished his examination of the patient and had given his instructions to mistress grenestedewhich involved some learned references to the occultation of certain beneficent planets by malevolent ones and hints that the herbs prescribed were to be gathered with reference to the position of the sun with respect to the zodiache called lawrence out into the antechamber chapter v a change in rogers destiny we shall be together my lord and i while the crowds around us come and go when false hearts wander and true hearts die my friend will still be mine own i know sarah doudney on the wide cushioned seat in the window mr robesart sat down and lawrence placed himself in front waiting to be questioned he had to wait in silence for a few moments while the priest seemed lost in thought then he turned back to the child now my son i would have some talk with thee i am faint to find thou hast thought on my words at parting hast thou done them lawrence madison mean you father if i have asked at our lord that he would go with me whithersoever i went that mean i my son aye nearly alway father said lawrence lifting a pair of honest eyes to his friends face and adding more shyly i forgat sometimes good lad take thou gods blessing and mineand mr robesart laid his hand on the boys head hath he been with thee lawrence lawrence looked up in some surprise mr robesarts question suggested two entirely new ideas that prayers might have some result attached to them and that the presence of god was something which he could know and feel hitherto he had always looked upon praying as something which had to be donea good work and the saying of good wordsbut a work which had no possible connection with any source or consequence as a child once said lawrence had plenty of think in him but he sadly wanted teaching how to put his thoughts to practical purpose the thoughts now came so fast that the words were slow mr robesart was wise and waited for them how many priceless opportunities have been thrown away through not waiting quite long enough at such moments for one temptation to be silent when we ought to speak are there not a score to speak when we ought to be silent father how can i know came at last if he never went with thee thou canst not know was the pithy answer that which one hath not how can he lose or miss lawrence was silent playing with one of the bright buttons of his tunic in a style which indicated that his thoughts were not on the button there is one manner my son then continued the priest wherein god goeth with all menin his providence as their creator and preserver were he not ever with thee after this fashion thou wouldst not live a moment but it is after another manner that he goeth with his belovedas their father and friend is he that to thee there be different sorts of fathers said lawrence meditatively aye alas for the human fathers that do misturn the heavenly father it is only the good true and loving my child that be in their lesser way like god pervert misrepresent like my sometime lord was to him said lawrence with brightening eyes and a nod towards the door of the inner chamber mr robesart smiled a little sadly aye lawrence take thou for example the best and truest thou hast known but remember that he must needs fall far behind lawrence went back to the button uttering his thoughts in a low voice as if he spoke to it rather than to the priest he alway loved to have my little lord at his knee he reflected in this manner and he used to lift him up and kiss him and if he were in any trouble my lord would stay and hear him even were it to his own travail and had he been hither this morrow i reckon it should have gone nigh to break his heart to see him thusfather robesart doth god almighty care for any man like that he cares like that for thee lawrence madison mr robesart paused an instant and lawrence thought the sentence was finished but it was not for one word followed it if if what said the boy quickly if thou wilt have it so if i will have it father robesart never nobody loved me never in all my life then see thou reject not the love which passeth all loves what am i to do what doth any with love take itenjoy itreturn itdo thy little best for him that giveth it but serve him how it sounded to lawrence like telling a serf child lying in the mire to rise and offer the golden cup to a king would the great nobles around the throne ever permit him to approach it a dim idea pervaded his brain that father robesart as a priest could give him a passport through the ranks of the angels but the answer brought him back to earth again my son thou servest god when thou servest any whom god loveth doth god love my lord i suppose he will being thus noble not many noble are called said mr robesart speaking rather to himself than to lawrence yet i will be a god to thee and to thy seed after thee aye little lawrence i cannot doubt it god teach thee poor child better than i can remember my son that thou servest not god in following thy little lord into sin and mischief thou wilt serve god by keeping him out thereof my lord bade me so keep himmy lord of march i would say not he of arundel i misdoubt if he care poor children repeated the priest sorrowfully tell me lawrence what would thy little lord with the bible was it wrong to get that father assuredly it was wrong to steal the key o father we never stole it we only took it when sir gerard left it behind him mr robesart smiled and shook his head ye stole it my son what is it but stealing to take a thing which he that ought it would not yield unto you but what wanted my lord with the book owned please father he desired much to read the same and my old lady his grandmother had bidden him so to do and he heardleastwise i heard and he asked at memy lord of arundel once to say that he would not have him lay finger thereon so he was set on it another very pitying smile parted the lips of mr robesart i marvel whether the bidding or the forbidding were the more tempting bait poor little child please father speak thy will my son will my lord get well again i trust if it be our lords pleasure he shall do well my son oh i am so glad and lawrences sparkling eyes by no means belied his words dost thou love thy little lord lawrence aye fatherso much please there never was any body else but him and beattie lawrence was very near adding and you a feeling of reverence restrained him but he might have done it safely who is beattie blumonds beattieat the fishmongers at usk oh i know a good child may i love beattie please father thou mayest love who so thou wilt and as much as ever thou wilt so long as thou lovest our lord first and most whoever i will certainly who dost thou think too great to be loved not great exactly butfather robesart might i love you i never thought i dare before mr robesart was more touched than he thought it well to let lawrence see but he did what nobody had ever done to the boy in all his lifehe stooped and kissed him it was an affirmative of the strongest type and lawrence felt it so rogers recovery was more rapid than any one about him had anticipated his body seemed as active and as easily impressed as his mind as much subject to ups and downs and generally either on the top of the mount or in the bottom of the valley the transition was quick from one to the other and he was never in either position for long three years more passed uneventfully until roger and lawrence were boys of twelve years old both had developed their respective characters roger was beginning to see that the lessonbooks which he had in old days unreasonably detested were machines for imparting knowledge and power if he were only a little older his own master and out in the world what could he not do the change in his case was more or less radical for he was learning to govern himself he had drawn no closer to the arundel family he disliked them every onefrom the earl to his youngest child but most especially he disliked alice his betrothed when he grew to manhood he would pay the fine and rid himself of that galling bond he did not care for girls he wanted to feel free the change which had taken place in lawrence madison was only in the direction of growth the fetters of service and etiquette pressed lightly upon him for he loved his young lord more than he had ever loved his own brothers and love makes fetters sit easily lawrence did not care for power as roger did but for knowledge his thirst was insatiable and above all he longed for the knowledge of godfor the realisation of that presence of which the priest had spoken to him like a flower shooting in the springtime he kept his face ever towards the light hoping to reach it some day sir gerard said he was not like a boy master salveyn opined that the lad had a bee in his hood mistress grenestede shook her head with an assumption of superior wisdom and murmured that such lads as lawrence madison died early outside matters went quietly enough so far as the boys were concerned till on the third of april shortly after the birth of her daughter margaret the countess of arundel died little care as she had taken of them yet the children felt a blank when she was gone not many weeks after the death of the countess when the early roses were just beginning to bud mistress grenestede came into the room where the children were studying under sir gerard in a state of some excitement give you good den sir gerard here is somewhat befallen one of your chicks for sure day take me with you good mistress explain yourself why tis him said the ungrammatical lady nodding towards roger who but my lady princess hath sent for to have him to come and speak with her at this date there was in the kingdom but one princess the daughters of the monarch did not bear that title until the accession of the house of stuart my lady princess therefore meant joan of kent widow of the black prince and mother of king richard she had been in her early youth a very giddy girl and had sobered down in later life under the instrumentality of wycliffe into the chief nursing mother of the lollard church her influence with her royal son was powerful and she was one of the three practical rulers of england at this juncture for the princess to send for roger might therefore mean something of greater import than a mere impulse of kindliness from a lady to a child is that sooth demanded sir gerard almost as excited as mistress grenestede truth true as truth i do ensure you what shall hap of it think you dear heart who wist shall it be now nay time enough tomorrow my lord bade me don him in his best array and at eight o the clock sir lewis clifford shall come for him who for demanded roger quite as ungrammatically and looking up with an eager expression in his eyes lo you now if he be not ahearkeningwhy for you fair lord at eight o the clock tomorrow who cometh for me sir lewis de clifford knight of the body to my lady princess now hark you sweet lord i trust you shall be of gentle conditionsnot too masterful nor yet abashed but with good manners tis a great thing for a young gentleman like you to be sent for to my lady the princess frightened nervous shes only a woman said roger trying to hit the inkstand with a paper pellet why did the king not send for me himself good lack sweet lord but you must never be thus masterful the king quotha the king doth what he will said sir gerard reprovingly i would if i were king responded roger aiming another pellet at the inkstand love us all the saints ejaculated mistress grenestede the cockerel crows well trow said sir gerard with a laugh look you good mistress he hath the blood in him tis no wonder but have a care my good lord that you use not over much homeliness toward my lady princess do not be too familiar what would she with me nay who wist carry yourself well and seemly and you shall see shall lolly go with me mistress grenestede was about to exclaim nay for sure but she stopped and looked at sir gerard his lordship were better have an elder servingman answered the tutor if lolly must not go i wont be good heard any ever the like then my lord must needs send word by sir lewis that your lordship is so naughty a lad you be not fit to go speak with my ladys grace sir gerard calculated rightly that this consideration would have some weight roger was sensitive to the opinions of other people and particularly of those much above him in rank i dont see why lolly could not go said he with a pout we shall see said the tutor perchance if your lordship order yourself after his will my lord may give leave that you shall choose whom you list the earl on being appealed to carelessly replied that roger might take the man in the moon if he wished it provided he were fittingly attired roger who had got over his petindeed his pets were less frequent than they used to besubmitted with nothing more than a little impatience to the tedious ceremony of his own arraying mistress grenestede was very particular for she desired roger to make a good impression on the princess upon whom she looked with very different eyes from his when the young earls attiring was over he found himself in a long robe of applegreen satin edged with cloth of gold rubycoloured hose over which the garter was clasped and a cap adorned with a very full long plume of white feathers his shoes were slatecoloured with a red diamond pattern gold buttons ran all down his sleeves a rich golden girdle set with gems clasped his waist a golden collar with diamonds and rubies was round his neck and in compliment to the princess her badge of the white hart gorged and couchant was suspended at his breast from a rich gold chain thus splendidly arrayed roger marched into the hall where three persons awaited him clad in his own livery blue and gold guarded with white these were two squires and lawrence with considerable impatience the young earl sat on the form awaiting sir lewis clifford who was punctual to his time though roger could hardly believe it the party then mounted their horses and rode away to kennington palace where the princess was at that time kennington palace was then in a neighbourhood at least as rural as hampton court is now sir lewis led his youthful charge followed by the attendants into a pleasant chamber hung with yellow say and panelled with cedar here were two ladies and a gentlemanthe former seated at work the latter standing in the window sir lewis leading roger up to one of the ladies dropped on one knee to say here is the young lord of march to wait on my ladys grace illustration here is the young lord of march to wait on my ladys grace with some curiosity roger looked up and saw a short smiling exceedingly fat woman clad in a crimson damask dress embroidered with rings of gold threads of silver were mingled with her golden hair and the remains of what had been extreme beauty could be traced in her countenance come hither little cousin said the princess affably smiling all over her plump face of a truth i am right glad to see thee i can go visit none now for i am so fat i may scarce mount mine horse didst ever behold a woman fatter than i rogers head squire who had been spending considerable pains in coaching him for this interview was horrified to hear him reply with charming candour no dame that did i never why thou sayest well laughed the princess evidently not in the least offended alway speak truth fair cousin so do i answered roger rather proudly my lady my grandmother told me ever so to do and she learned me two sayings by the which i should rule me and i so will under your pleasure dame he added in an instant with a sudden recollection of the squires instructions and those of sir gerard come tell me what they were responded the princess coaxingly thou lovest my lady thy grandmother that can i see well i did middling dame said roger coolly howbeit she were only a woman the squire was ready to sink into the earth till he was relieved by the princess leaning back in her gilded chair with a burst of the heartiest laughter gramercy little cousin but thou art right covenable i see we shall be good friends but i desire thy two sayings tell me the same agreeable amusing roger repeated them rather proudly fais ce que doy advienne que pourra un and dieu un roy servir je doy and dost mean to rule thee by them asked the princess still smiling that do i dame i will serve god and the king to my power but none other he will do trow said the princess looking up at somebody whom roger had not previously noticed his eyes followed hers and he saw standing on her right hand a young man of eighteen clad in a tunic of black baldekyn figured with red balls and purplishgray flowers above it was a white tippet the sleeves were red with gold cuffs and he wore yellow shoes with a red pattern he was of short stature and slight figure his complexion was of feminine fairness his hair flaxen tinged with gold his eyes blue and dovelike so great was his soft and pathetic beauty that artists selected his face as the model for that face which now outshines the cherubim this is king richards costume in the golden book of st albans something in the face won rogers heart what it was he did not know himself it was in truth a vague remembrance of that fair young mother who had passed away from him so early and a likeness to whom he detected without recognising it in the face before him an affectionate smile from the royal cousin completed his conquest of the heart of roger mortimer he will do in very truth said the king answering his mother first then he turned to roger be right welcome fair cousin i trust to see more of you in time coming sir asked roger looking up be you lord richard the king even so fair cousin what can i do to pleasure you natures like those of roger mortimer are always capable of intense heroworship and roger had found his hero he dropped on one knee without any prompting then sire i will live and die with you the king unfastened from his chain of rubies a golden broompod wrought with green enamel it was one of his own badges then shalt thou be mine own man by thy covenant said he smiling and attaching the badge to rogers gold chain and thereto is my token why well said interpolated the princess who seemed unable to keep silence long come hither little cousinhere set a stool for my lord of marchand tell me how it liketh thee to dwell with my lord of arundel not in no wise dame answered roger boldly not in no wise quotha why what ails thee at him i love him not dame nor he me dear heart here is a pity but thou lovest my lady alice trowthough she be but a woman the princesss fat shoulders shook with laughter our young cousins chivalry is scarce fledged methinks said the king if you will learn me sire i will do your bidding said roger who did not know what bashfulness was my lady alice said your grace good lack but i cannot abear her cannot bear her quotha nay now she is to be thy wife my lord the kings command except that shall she never said roger sturdily see you fair son was the princesss comment with a glance at the king and wouldst thou be much aggrieved little cousin if thou wert to depart thence and to dwell in another household where thou shouldst have jolly lads and lasses to pleasure and couldst see the king thy cousin wellnigh thee every day rogers eyes shone with delight please it you dame that should like me right well howbeit i hope there should be more lads than lasses the princess indulged in another hilarious convulsion thy time will come lad said she when she was able to speak till it do thou canst lake thee with tom which is scarce the younger of theeit shall do right well fair son and i pray you heartily to set the matter in train aye methinks it were well done answered the king but neither of them explained what was to be done though rogers curiosity was intense manifestly he was to be taken from the earl of arundel and given in wardship to some other nobleman that was a delightful prospect if he could only be rid of alice as well roger thought he would be in paradise and the king had offered him a favour roger turned boldly to his majesty sire your grace said you would pleasure me pray you have me rid of yon alice i love no maids and her least of all once more the princess burst out laughing the king looked quietly amused is that the dearest wish of your heart fair cousin it is so at this present my liege he shall have a dearer anon or i am no prophetess exclaimed the convulsed princess maybe said the king well fair cousin we will pleasure you in this matterthe rather seeingand he turned to his mother with a smilethat it shall pleasure your grace as well at this moment a slight noise outside preceded a scratching at the door a lifting of the arras and the announcement ofmy ladys grace of lancaster the royal hosts took leave of their little guest rather hastily yet very kindly and thus dismissed roger was reconducted to bermondsey house by sir lewis clifford there was a good deal to talk over when roger and lawrence were safely tucked up in their respective beds i say loll came from the big blue bed this is jolly i am glad your lordship is well content therewith was the response in the quieter voice from the pallet i am so fain to get rid of yon alice said unchivalrous roger and i am right fain too to be out of this dull house who is tom i marvel that she said i could lake me withal metrusteth he is a lad of some mettle and not a dull lump of stuff like yon jack arundel i would though he had been something elder than me in the stead of younger i love not laking with children master roger was beginning to consider himself above the degradation of childhood lawrence contented himself with replying that he trusted his lordship might find matters as should be to his satisfaction where shall it be loll thinkest i would it might be in the palace aye and said she not that i should see the king my cousin wellnigh every morrow i would like that best of all i could die for him lollyand shall some day i cast no doubt lawrences reply was merely a respectful intimation that he was listening he was quite as ready as roger to die for one whom he might love but not by any means so ready to talk about it o lolly i could jump up to the moon tis so jolly and roger executed a pas seul outside his bedclothes but i sayi hope they shall noy me with no more maids why can folk not leave a man be i would fain wit demanded his lordship loftily lying down again and drawing the satin coverlet over him by no means tidily i would in very sooth i were but a bit bigger howbeit i reckon we shall grow and then loll thou shalt be mine own especial knight and shalt bear mine arms and fight right behind me i thank your good lordship said lawrence dutifully though the prospect of fighting whether before or behind his master was not particularly enlivening to his mind could lawrence have chosen his lot there would have been no fighting in it i reckon we shall see went on roger not quite in so lively a tone but it shall be right jollyany how and i do noti should not roger was asleep chapter vi fair and fickle wel were hym that wyste to whom he mytte tryste beter were hym that knewe the false fro the trewe old poem of fifteenth century the hidden intentions of the princess were very soon revealed roger and his suite were transferred from bermondsey house to woking manor the seat of thomas earl of kent the eldest son of the princess and halfbrother of the king the countess of kent was a sister of the earl of arundel but of a quieter and less decided character than most of her family her children in whom roger felt more interest than in herself were six in number exclusive of two boys who had died in the cradle they were alianora aged fourteen thomas aged twelve anne aged six edmund aged three joan aged two and margaret an infant the eldest boy was of course the tom to whom the princess had alluded he was present when roger was introduced to the countess and roger was gratified to discover that tom though by a few months the younger was taller than himself all the holands of kent were tall fully developed of very fair complexion and exceedingly handsome but rogers eyes had not reached beyond tom when they lighted on some one else who was entering the room and from that moment he had eyes for no other if it be true as it has been said that the metaphorical gentleman termed cupid usually takes the severest vengeance on those who despise his power he must have been in that mind with regard to roger mortimer one instantaneous glance proved sufficient to awaken in the bosom of roger who hated and despised all girls a fervent boyish passion which reached down to his hearts core and never left him until his lifes end the girl of whom the sight proved thus potent was the lady alianora de holand eldest daughter of the earl and countess of kent though only fourteen she was so tall and stately that she had a grownup aspect she stood when roger saw her just in the doorway her arms full of flowers which she had been gathering in the garden and her abundant fair hair falling about her like a golden glory her little brother edmund had pulled it down in play and had she known of the existence of visitors in the hall the lady alianora who was quite old enough to be particular about her personal appearance would never have presented herself before them in this dishevelled guise she stopped blushed and hastily dropping her flowers on the nearest form fled to her chamber to make herself presentableleaving on rogers mind an impression of angelic loveliness no such impression was conveyed to lawrence madison roger who was in an exalted mood which disposed him knighterrantlike to insist upon all beholders instantaneous acknowledgment of the preeminence of the lady of his heart was quite put out by the cool indifferent tone in which lawrence assented to his rapturous comments on the beauty of the lady alianora accustomed as he was to sudden changes in his impulsive master yet this one took lawrence by surprise he had not expected roger to alter in that direction love to him was not a blow to be struck all at once but a plant to ripen by degrees the sudden and absorbing passion which had taken possession of rogers heart by assault was not merely unexpected to lawrence it was incomprehensible the transfer of roger from the care of the earl of arundel to that of the earl of kent was marked by one peculiarity very unusual at the time it was purely a personal transfer and did not include any change with regard to the administration of the estates which were still left in the hands of arundel except that the earls of warwick and northumberland were joined with him in the guardianship the care of the heir and of the estate so generally went together as to rouse the suspicion in this case that the severance was a fresh clever move on the part of the princess to leave the estate in the enemys hands might be intended as a hidden purchase of his acquiesence in the transfer of the boy it was a sacrifice of the casket to secure the safety of the gem perhaps the princess was also sagacious enough to divine thatas it turned outthere would be no sacrifice in the matter arundel proved in this case an honourable man and administered the estates well resigning them without difficulty into rogers hands when he was called upon to do so between roger and thomas eternal friendship was sworn without delay their characters were somewhat alike save that roger was slightly the more impulsive and considerably the more selfwilled the younger children were in rogers eyes quite beneath his contempt there was one point of the matter in respect to which lawrence was by no means indifferent the style in which the lady alianora behaved to her youthful admirer enraged him beyond words the beautiful girl was a born coquette and she treated roger to every variety of behaviour suggested by that despicable type of character one day she would lift him up to the heights of ecstacy with her notice and favour and on the next would plunge him into the lowest depths of despair it appeared to delight her to play with his feelings like a cat with a mouse that she had any of her own lawrence could not discover but as time went on and they grew older and the sentimental adoration of the boy instead of fading away blossomed into the solid and enduring love of the man the sensation of aversion on lawrences part became stronger than ever he would never have used roger as she did had he been in her place roger appeared not to perceive this blemish in his chosen idol all that she chose to do was perfection in his eyes it may perhaps strike the reader as hardly possible that a boy of rogers age could have entertained such feelings but we have abundant evidence that our fathers five hundred years ago grew up much earlier than we doprobably in part from the shorter average duration of human life and in part from the forcing nature of the life they led a boy of twelve in had attained a period of life equivalent to that of a youth of at least sixteen in the present day if it could have been whispered to roger mortimer that he was flinging away his true and faithful heart upon a worthless weed while there were modest violets to be found under the leavesthat he was bartering his priceless diamonds for glass beads which were not worth the picking upwell he would not have believed it but in truth he had met with the evil angel of his life and he was yielding unto her fair false hands the perfect trust and the passionate devotion which were only due to god would he ever awake from the dream and if he did would it be while there was yet time left to repair his blunder or only when it was too late and there remained but a long weary stretch of the wilderness before the end should come ah the good shepherd goes after his lost sheep until he find them but they are apt to lead him up arid steeps and into sunless gulfs through thorns which tear their feet as well as his and into dry places where no water is beside the stream which flows from the smitten rock reserve and reticence were not in the nature of roger mortimer the princess very soon perceived with equal amusement and delight the fulfilment of her prophecy and urged upon her royal son the desirability of at once betrothing roger and alianora the king however preferred a little delay there was time enough he said both were yet very young matters might alter before they were old enough to be married so the formal ceremony though fully intended was deferred leaving an element of uncertainty which added to rogers intermittent misery the autumn which followed the spring of rogers transference to woking witnessed some most painful events the second son of the princess sir john de holand entering into a squabble between his attendants out of which he had far better have kept himself killed sir ralph stafford the favourite squire of the young queen he was condemned to die and the princess in an agony of grief sent sir lewis clifford to the king at york earnestly beseeching for mercy to his brother she was refused and it was the first refusal which her royal son had ever given to an intercession of hers as the event proved he was ready enough to grant it as man but he could not feel it his duty as king the princess laid it so to heart that her heart broke a fortnight after the return of sir lewis from his fruitless errand she lay dead at wallingford castle in the first impulse of his anguish and remorse king richard granted a full pardon to his brother on condition of his making a pilgrimage to syria he was a man of the deepest affections and next to his wife his mother had been nearest to his heart perhaps it was the remembrance of this one rejected appeal and the agony of its result which made richard in after years so perpetual a pardoner of the transgressions of those whom he loved another result of these sorrowful circumstances was to cause the king to carry into immediate action various intentions which he knew had been his mothers wish and in pursuance of one of these on a morning in october he sent for the earl of march the royal officers conducted roger somewhat to his surprise to the kings private closet and motioned to his suite to remain in the antechamber he was to pass in alone roger found however that the interview was not to be teteatete seated in a curule chair by the side of his majesty was the uncle of both thomas duke of gloucester the most astute man in england and the evil angel of the king roger made his reverences to his royal kinsman and was directed to seat himself on a velvet settle which faced them a slight motion from the young king appeared to be a preconcerted signal at which gloucester took up the word illustration roger made his reverences to his royal kinsman and was directed to seat himself on a velvet settle which faced them methinks fair cousin said he addressing roger that you be not now to learn that your mother the lady philippa of march was daughter and heir unto my fair brother of clarence whom god assoil roger intimated that this was no news to him and you may lightly guess moreover that my said brother standing next in age to my most honoured lord the prince whom likewise may god pardon had the said prince deceased unhappily without issue him outliving my said brother your grandsire should have stood next to be king roger bowed his head he began to wonder what was coming was evil about to befall him for the crime of being a greatgrandson of king edward bear with me then my fair cousin while i recount unto you the causes of that which i am about to lay before you under command of my liege here present one of the secrets of gloucesters popularity was his exquisite veneer very few persons realised how thin the coating was or what was the material which lay beneath least likely to discover it of all was the young king in whose singleeyed nature suspicion had no place and whose warm heart was ready to take in every creature who professed a shred of devotion to himself maybe being as you are but right youthful fair cousin pursued gloucester you shall have need to be told in words that after the old custom of england it was not used that the kings son dying afore his father his childre should be held to fill his place this ancient custom howbeit was changed by my redoubted lord and father king edward of set purpose that the king our liege who here sitteth should succeed him on the throne in case therefore that our said liege should leave no issuewhich god defendhe must needs appoint him a successor after his pleasure now my said liege accounting it ill as in very sooth it should be that mens minds should be unsettled touching so weighty a matter and knowing moreover that life standeth alway at the pleasure of god and that men may not dwell on middle earth no longer than it listeth him there was a vast reservoir of piety in gloucester but it went no lower than his tongueit hath pleased my liege to make choice of him that shall succeed him if in evil case he should chance to decease without child to make an end fair cousin without further words you are he whom my lord hath chosen to sit on the throne when the pleasure of god shall be fulfilled in him roger sat dumfoundered the last conclusion he had expected was the one that had come upon him among all the suppositions as to the chosen heir which had been coursing through his thoughts while his uncle spoke the faintest idea that it might be himself had never occurred to his mind he did not know that it had been in existence nearly as long as he had in the three governing minds of england of which one had just passed away it was the only point of all their opinions in which the princess and the dukes of lancaster and gloucester were agreed the private reasons of each were utterly diverse from those of the other two the princess wished to secure two pointsthe happiness of her son and the welfare of the lollard church of which she was the nursing mother to this end the heir must entertain a personal affection for his majesty which would prevent him from coveting his position and must be brought up in an atmosphere which would dispose him toward the lollard doctrines the duke of lancasters object was the welfare of england added to which he did not want to reign himself and roger or his brother were the only persons who could reasonably be placed before him the duke of gloucesters object was almost the opposite of the last he did wish to reign but he cared more for the reality of power than for the semblance and knowing that equity would be outraged by his being preferred to his elder brothers he desired such a monarch as he would easily be able to influence this he fancied he saw in rogerwarmhearted impulsive readily swayed and not too suspicious of ulterior motives the only person at that day who had ever been able to read the true character of gloucester was the dead princess she must have been a very clever woman her feminine instinct penetrated all the joints of his closelyriveted armour and without his being in the least aware of it to her he had shown his naked heart somebody who could be trusted must be put in his way and she read roger also more accurately than he had done through all the outward impulsiveness she discerned the hearts fidelitythrough all the thorny surroundings of temptation the ever straightforward aim at the one goal of right perhaps her cleverest move of all was just that which looked on the surface the least likely to forward her intentions she had removed him from the noxious atmosphere of bermondsey house and had placed him in a family which was not marked by lollard proclivitiesa family of which in that respect even the antilollard gloucester could feel no suspicion but she saw that roger was more easily led than driven that his intensely lollard uncle john de montacute the most pestilent of all that sect was likely to have far more influence with him as an occasional and interesting visitor than as the man who decided his fate and sat in judgment on all his little peccadilloes beside which had he been consigned to the care of a distinctly lollard family gloucester would have been certain to scheme for his removal he would probably be content to leave him at woking where lollardism was something quite outside the family notionsa matter which they left to the priesthood whose business they considered it to be his suspicions of any sinister design on the part of the princess would scarcely be aroused by her very natural wish that her youngest sons chosen heir should be in the care of her eldest son roger of course had not the slightest conception of all these wheels within wheels which he now saw to his amazement were bearing him forward to the throne the result was to him the only thing apparent and that left him in a state of speechless astonishment the only two clear ideas in his confused head beyond surprise were deep devotion to the royal cousin who had marked him by such signal favour and a rapturous throb of his heart at the thought that now at least alianora was safely assured to him he knew that a prospective crown would weigh heavily with her no less than with her parents and as for him who wore it and who certainly would weigh less rogers loyal heart was content to accept the very crumbs of affection from the hand which he loved rather than a plentiful board spread by any other the kings voice broke rogers astounded silence methinks we have somewhat taken you by surprise fair cousin said he with that exquisitely sweet smile which richard knew how to give in very deed my gracious lord but you so have was the answer mefeareth my liege that your bestowal upon me is far over my dementing strive then to deserve the same fair cousin said gloucester didactically in all things submit you obeissantly to my lord his pleasure a speech which meant much more than it said since gloucester aimed at governing roger through the king like other astute persons the former scarcely comprehended a mind which had but one aim and assuredly never intended to strengthen rogers personal love for his royal cousin his real intention was to attract it to himself but rogers powers of discrimination were greater than those of king richard and he had an uneasy sense of some ulterior meaning on the part of his uncle which cooled his demeanour and lessened his words he had no intention of confiding his hearts secrets to that overclever relative i am at ease thereanent said the king answering roger with another smile and now cousin god give you good day for methinks you have food enough for thought roger could not have told whether he returned to woking through smiling valleys or barren mountains the family of the earl of kent the elder branches of which had been admitted into the secret were amused to see how silent and meditative their young ward became after the proclamation of his future brilliant destiny roger was growing up fastfaster in mind than in body very grave and thoughtful grew the young heir the radiant crown which hung before him though in a probably distant future seemed to have descended upon his head not as an ornament but as a weight the earl of kent was much surprised at it the side of rogers character which was outwardly exhibitedthe lighter and more childish side of itwas the only one which he had yet seen but the depths were there and they had been stirred at last they were stirred in more ways than one the prospective crown which had struck roger into gravity struck the lady alianora into a flutter to her it was merely the most becoming decoration which could rest upon her head the thought of any duty or responsibility in connection with it was entirely foreign to her mind but it became desirable to cultivate roger and to let him see unmistakably that he was established in her good graces to lose him now was not to be thought of for a moment but had the king changed his mind and transferred his favours to any other person what the lady alianora called her heart would have followed in their wake the doglike fidelity which characterised lawrence madison and to which it would have been of no moment whether his master sat upon a throne or a dunghill was simply inconceivable to her it was sunday evening and the churches were slowly emptying of the worshippers at vespers lawrence was making his way out at the western door when looking up he encountered a pair of bright eyes attentively regarding him they belonged to a girl of about his own age who wore a dress of blue camlet and was evidently in the middle class of life she was very pretty but apparently very shy her eyes dropped the instant they encountered his but kept returning to his face as if she found something attractive in it behind her came an older woman whom lawrence felt certain as soon as he glanced at her that he had met somewhere before as soon as they were clear of the sacred edifice lawrence saw the girl turn round to the woman behind her and address her in an earnest whisper the woman replied aloud nay child it were not like methinks but it might be will you not ask mistress wenteline the name solved lawrences difficulty in a moment in another instant he had pressed through the crowd and was by the side of his old friend mistress wenteline come you from ludlowfrom usk know you not lawrence madison well of a surety but it is cried guenllian heartily enough lad how camest thou hither the maid said it were like thee but i never thoughtis my lord hereaway my lord of arundel hath no place in this vicinage trow my lord is not now in ward to him good mistress but unto my lord of kent that dwelleth at the manor here now god be thanked therefor said guenllian warmly lawrence turned to the girl methinks i should know you likewise and in truth you be like some one that i have known but i cannot give you a name the bright eyes laughed but their owner seemed too shy to speak guenllian looked at both with an amused expression nay twain friends so dear as you were of old should not have forgot each other said she lolly dost not know thine old playfellow tis blumonds beattie beattie broke from lawrence with more warmth than usual but as soon as the greeting was over both relapsed into extreme shyness and pray you mistress wenteline how came you hither marry lad we be tarrying a twothree days under the kings gracious leave at his manor of byfleet and as tuesday we journey onward to london town beattie and i we thought we would come to church something a longer walk and two of my lords squires be with usguenllian paused and looked about for themi marvel whither they be gone in this crowd beattie canst see any whither master orewell or master chauntemarle beattie thought she saw master chauntemarles cap over yonder but lawrence interposed with a question which he was burning to ask but mistress wenteline how came you hither why look you we be now of the following of the lady de percy and the lord of these squires and of us is my lord of northumberland and the lady de percy is at byfleet me reckoneth my lord were right fain to see his sister aye and the lady elizabeth was ever his favourite but lolly i would fain see my dear child he is at the manor here trow if it like you to bide for compline mistress you shall then see him with no further travail or if you will come up to the manor i rest well assured that mistress dayrell which keepeth house shall make you right welcome beattie run thou to master orewell which i see searching us oer by yon yewtree and do him to wit of this say we will return with lawrence to the manor and ask at him if he or master chauntemarle list to come with us if not then will we leave our returning as it shall please god beatrice obeyed and in a minute returned with master orewell who intimated that his pleasure would be to accompany the ladies but master chauntemarle preferred to return to byfleet guenllian accordingly sent through the latter her excuses to lady northumberland and the party set out for the manor lawrence left his friends in charge of mistress dayrell who was well pleased with the prospect of a gossip and dashed up the stairs three at a time in search of his young master roger was playing handtennis with the other young peoplean occupation the suitability of which to sunday evening it never occurred to him or any one else to doubt the moment that he heard who was below he flung down his battledore and rushed down the stairs as quickly as lawrence had come up them guenllian had not realised the change that years could make until roger stood before her she had been unconsciously expecting to see the child of nine and when the handsome boy of thirteen who looked older than he was came into the room and welcomed her she could scarcely believe his identity but the warmth and brightness were those of the old roger and they comforted guenllian after all her fears and heartsinkings lest he should be changed and spoiled at bermondsey house mine own dear child she said lovingly verily i ask your lordships pardon but you shall seem always my child to me even when you be a man grown roger had arrived at the age when a boy is rather ashamed of being kissed and feels it a humiliation but like a true gentleman as he was in nature as well as name he put his own feelings aside and permitted his old nurse to pet him to her hearts content and now mine heart give me leave to ask you inquired guenllian in whose diction the new deference was somewhat at variance with the old familiar love if you be welsome and happy hereaway very very happy said rogers eyes no less than his voice the lady alianora had been unusually complaisant for the past week and how did your lordship like at arundel castle very ill wenteline i am rejoiced to be away thence guenllian was privately rejoiced to hear it metrusteth lawrence continueth a good lad much better than roger said the owner of the latter name with a bright laugh he alway were so and your lordship as i do hear is in right high favour with the king roger smiled and blushed slightly his honours were still fresh upon him aye wenteline i have been denounced heir of england announced proclaimed but to think of it exclaimed she well my dear child god give thee his grace thou shalt make but an ill king without it guenllian thought that rogers eyes responded but his voice was silent chapter vii roger has his wish whatever fades but fading pleasure brings sir philip sidney the paths that had joined for a moment parted again and guenllian and beatrice passed out of the sight of roger and lawrence the life which they led at woking was very quietso quiet that roger at least began to feel restless and to complain to lawrence that every thing stagnated around him but before six months were over the second political convulsion of the century had begun gloucester only awaited the removal of his brother lancaster who was the barricade against his ambitious designs to draw the bow which he was holding ready the duke of lancaster sailed from plymouth on the ninth of july by michaelmas gloucester was in london gathering his conspirators around him the one with whom he first took counsel was his nephew edward afterwards earl of rutland eldest son of the duke of york this man seems to have delighted in dissimulation and treachery not as means to an end but for their own sakes he cared not whom he joined so long as he could afterwards betray them and he was ready to agree to anything if it only involved a plot love kinship gratitude even interest were no barriers in his way this man had been one of the dearest friends of the young kingthe friendship being on the kings side and only the outward profession of it on rutlands but no sooner did gloucester lay his plans before rutland than the latter sacrificed his friend to the pleasure of a conspiracy there were four of the privy councillors of whom gloucester had resolved to get rid these were the archbishop of york the duke of ireland the earl of suffolk and sir simon burley the first and last were professed lollards the second and perhaps the third almost certainly held those doctrines though less openly than the other two there is an old proverb that if you want to hang a dog it is easy enough to find a rope and the conspirators found no difficulty in fixing on charges calculated to render the four councillors impopular the archbishop who was a neville of raby and the duke who was ninth earl of oxford could not be accused of humble origin but the earl of suffolk was open to this impeachment and they made the most of it by contemptuously addressing him as michael even in full parliament sir simon burley had been the kings tutor and an old friend of the black prince who had great confidence in him it might have been supposed difficult to find the rope in his case but who ever knew a romish priest short of an excuse to disparage the character of a heretic by whatever name he might be called behind the conspirators himself unseen but quietly pulling the strings which moved all these puppets at his pleasure stood sir thomas de arundel bishop of ely and brother of the earl who was at once the instigator the assistant and the absolver of them all the earl of arundel had been induced by his brother to unite with the conspirators who were also joined by thomas beauchamp earl of warwick a weak man who was as much a dupe as a criminal it was not till a later period that they were joined by the cautious henry of bolingbroke earl of derby and by another who ought for very shame to have held aloofthe kings favoured friend and trusted councillor thomas mowbray earl of norfolk william courtenay archbishop of canterbury was also ready to help them on account of his personal dislike to his brother archbishop who had recently received a lucrative appointment whereon courtenay had set covetous eyes of course the real causes of hatred were not paraded before that innocent deceivable creature the public the true reasons for hating the four obnoxious councillors were that they had the ear of the king while he declined to be governed by the five conspirators and their priestly guides who were accordingly much scandalised at his allowing himself to be governed by any onethemselves of course excepted this is the usual secret of complaints that a man is governed put the complainer in the place of the governor and the complaint will not be heard again the ostensible reasons were plausible the archbishop of york said the conspirators was covetous and arrogant and took liberties with the king which of course meant that equal liberties were not allowed to themselves the archbishop being in reality one of the gentlest and most unworldly of men the duke of ireland was a puppy he made the king do whatever he liked and bestow on him lands titles and offices instead of on the conspirators the earl of suffolk was a mere nobody the scum of the earth yet he took upon himself to dictate to the king and to oppose the nobles sir simon burley had proposed under colour of an expected invasion of the french to remove the shrine of st thomas from canterbury cathedral to dover castle on the pretence that canterbury was not so strong as dover of course he could only mean to pocket the rich offerings and make his own profit out of the guardianship of the shrine all of them were accused of defalcations of the crown revenues there was a further charge against ireland which has been ever since received as historical fact though it was not substantiated by a single document nor by any thing but the bare word of the conspirators and some inferences from circumstantial evidence which might or might not be true the duke had always lived unhappily with his duchess who was a cousin of the king the differences between them were partly ecclesiastical he siding with the antipope urban she with pope clement there is also reason to suspect that her temper was somewhat less than angelic the chroniclers tell us that ireland fell violently in love with a german lady in the queens suite whose name was lancerona or lancecrona a suspiciously manufactured epithet that the queen wrote a letter to pope urban entreating that he might receive a divorce that urban thereupon divorced ireland and philippa and that the duke married his german love that his mother was extremely indignant and took philippa to live with her that the sire de coucy father of the duchess and the king of france almost took up arms against england in consequence of these wicked proceedings the real truth of the matter is that no evidence whatever exists to support these alleged facts we have evidence that gloucester and others took pains to spread them as a rumour but none to show that they were true not only is the queens letter not forthcoming but there is no document to show that a divorce ever took place there is no evidenceexcept the ipse dixit of gloucester and his partisansthat ireland ever contracted a second marriage while the facts that after his banishment he was invited to visit the french court that his wife bore the title of duchess of ireland to the day of her death which followed his and that his mother ran great personal risk in warmly espousing his cause and that of king richard when both were at the lowest ebb do not took favourable to the representations of gloucester it may be added that this lancecrona who is stated to have been a lady in waiting and a laundresstwo utterly incompatible positions even more so at that time than nowdoes not appear at all as one of the royal suite in any mention of them contained in the state papers and there is cause for suspicion which almost reaches certainty that she never existed beyond the inner consciousness of my lord duke of gloucester carter one of the most accurate of our historians records his opinion that there is no reason to think that a divorce was ever granted nor even solicited between ireland and philippa ii these tales true or false were assiduously spread among the populace and gloucester very secretly but very diligently advised them to refuse any further payment of taxes the king said he would have plenty of money at his command if the wicked councillors were only forced to disgorge their illgotten booty yet with all their cleverness gloucester and his allies could not succeed in accusing suffolk of any greater covetousness than taking from the king a thousand marks a year since he was made an earlwhich was the ordinary grant from the crown to every earl in england that the animosity of these plotters was really and originally religious is shown in the fact that when the whole power in the kingdom fell into their hands they weeded the state offices and the royal household of all the lollards and let others alone they descended even to squires and ladiesso long as they were lollards the lady de poynings a princesss daughter was not too high for them to aim at nor was john calverley the queens squire too low to feel their vengeance sir bernard brocas the queens chamberlain and the lady molyneux wife of sir thomas were also swept out of her household neither prayers nor tears availed to soften them for four hours the queen herself caesars daughter knelt to the earl of arundel imploring him to spare calverley whom they had condemned to death it was all in vain arundel savagely told her to pray for herself she had cause enough sir bernard brocas was also put to death the ladies were dropped into obscurity where they were wise enough to remain the long and sad story of this persecutionit deserves no other namebelongs to general history but the end is soon told ireland suffolk and archbishop neville fled abroad and died there burley meant to have preceded them in this step but was unfortunately dissuaded by ireland at that time unable to conceive the possibility of the conspirators presuming to put any man to death he generously offered him forty thousand marks to refund in respect of the defalcations of which burley that gentle gallant and prudent knight had been falsely accused but the lords appellants as it pleased the conspirators to term themselves wanted blood not bribes nor did it suit them to accept as a gift what they meant to take with a high hand they got the king out of the way and instantly seized on his old tutor whom he was unable to deliver from their malicious hands burley died on tower hill the other less obnoxious councillors were got rid of mostly by death without the pretence of a trial and then my lords appellants having reduced their sovereign to the status of their slave courteously and in subservient language requested him to come home to obey their orders and as the first to deliver into their hands all the state records and twenty thousand pounds ten years later when the slave had resumed the status of the sovereign after a trial on which lancaster sat as judge the earl of arundel was beheaded in cheapside and modern writers regard richard as a tyrant and arundel as a murdered patriot there is one book written by truer pens than theirs wherein other appellations are probably attached to the names perhaps few households in high positions throughout england were less disturbed by the political earthquake than that at woking manor the earl of kent with whomsoever he might side in his heart practically held aloof from the entire struggle and the countess alesia though she was sister alike of the earl of arundel and the bishop of ely who with gloucester formed the soul of the conspiracy appears herself to have entertained no political bias and to have followed her husband along the quiet byepath into which he thought it prudent to turn until the storm blew over rumours however were not slow in reaching them and no one was more eager to hear all the news than roger it need hardly be said that he was a vehement partisan of his royal cousin and hotly indignant against the lords appellants the suspicions which he had entertained already concerning the fidelity of his uncle of gloucester were now confirmed to the full and beyond it those who being conscious of lollardism or knowing themselves suspected of it felt danger threatening them got out of the way or in some other manner prepared for the inevitable as best they could the prominent lollard sir john montacute rogers greatuncle made his will and then waited the event the young lord le despenser a boy of rogers age was sent off by his friends to sea being sagaciously placed under the nominal care of the earl of arundel having finished their work the lords appellants now thought it time to distribute their rewards the heaviest prize fell to gloucesters share for he granted himselfof course in the kings nameall the lands of the duke of ireland about the second man in england as to wealth and the smaller property of the earl of suffolk he also appropriated to himself the office of justice of chester which the conspirators had showed such indignation that ireland should possess to arundel was granted the marriage of the young lord poynings to edward of york was given the earldom of rutland with lands in the county and a hundred marks in money the bishop of ely received the archbishopric of york derby was more easily satisfied he coveted only the breastplate of sir john beauchamp one of the murdered lollards he was in truth not anxious to show too distinctly his status as one of the conspirators the archbishop of canterbury was made happy by a proclamation that whosoever should be found to possess any books pamphlets or handbills of master john wycliffe and others deceased in english or in latin should be arrested and put under penalty by the council norfolk and warwick it was not thought necessary to notice in the general distribution but perhaps to blind the eyes of the public perhaps to keep the king content in the menial position which they had assigned to him that suppressed gentleman was allowed to make a few insignificant grants to his own friends he was graciously permitted to restore a single manor to lady poynings their own inheritances to emma tresilian and idonia brembre and her wardrobe to joan salesbury widows of his murdered councillors he was also allowed to grant to his younger brother the castles of berkhamsted and tintagel and to the elder the constableship of the tower and the marriage of roger earl of march the widows of tresilian and brembre the two members of the attainted group who alone were not lollards received by far the best treatment of any tis an ill wind blows nobody good said mistress grenestede when this last piece of news was published ah my dear master is it good it has blown you was the silent response of lawrence madison in his inmost heart whatever were lawrences doubts none oppressed roger he arrayed himself for his bridal without a shadow of apprehension of any sort the king the queen the royal dukes and duchesses and half the nobility were bidden to the marriage of the heir of england which took place early in march in the royal chapel of the tower the bridegroom was dressed in blue golden baldekyn one of the richest silk stuffs then manufactured the cost of which when plain was about seven guineas but this was richly wrought with fleursdelis in gold embroidery which had cost three pounds more white frills of costly lace encircled his neck and wrists and closer sleeves of crimson velvet protruded from the wider sleeves of the blue gown his boots were of crimson velvet buttoned with pearls in his hand was a hat of black velvet over which swept a full plume of white ostrich feathers from a chain of massy gold about his neck depended the white hart in enamel and gold which was at once the badge of the king and that of the bride the place is not on record february or march is the probable date the lady alianora who was given away by her royal unclean uncle only about five years older than his niecewas arrayed with the utmost care and costliness that her wardrobe could afford she appeared in a long robe of crimson velvet embroidered with golden flowers in an elaborate rambling pattern and over it a cotehardie or close jacket without sleeves of the choicest miniver cut low in the neck as a bridal dress then usually was cuffs of gold filagree finished the sleeve at the wrist and a girdle formed of ten golden clasps fitted round the hips down the front of the cotehardie ran a row of gleaming jewelssapphires rubies diamonds and emeraldswhich flashed and sparkled with every motion of the wearer a golden fillet adorned her head set with similar gems and from under it flowed the golden glory of her magnificent hair which streamed almost to the ground this last item was an essential part of the brides costume at this date beneath the crimson velvet robe when she lifted it out of her way could be seen glimpses of a rich skirt of goldcoloured satin and black velvet shoes studded with gold the bride wore no gloves they were not usual except on some ceremonial occasions and then only for royal persons or for the bird to perch upon in hawking the weddingring was set with a ruby around the principal actors stood a crowd of the english nobility and on its outskirts a motley assemblage of officials then deemed necessaryseneschals heralds minstrels trumpeters and many others when the priest reached the words with all my worldly goods i thee endow it was incumbent upon the bridegroom to put a sum of money on the book in gold and silver which became the private possession of the bride roger laid down the princely sum of three marks which alianora swept composedly into her pocket pockets were comparative novelties having only existed for about forty years and ladies like gentlemen had one on each side enormous bags they were within which had it so pleased her the bride could easily have disposed of her fillet or her cotehardie immediately after the ceremony followed the massa low mass at which the wedded pair alone communicated with the priest the bride was then led between two married nobles to the banquethall where the weddingfeast was spread and the bridegroom followed led in like manner precedence even before royalty was given to them for that day they sat together in the place of honour the middle of the table on the dais the king being on the right hand of the bride and the queen on the left of the bridegroom such plate as was included in the bridal giftsand plate was more frequently given than anything elsewas used at the feast stately gold and silver hanaps or cups about the size of a chalice in all manner of diverse forms dictated by fashion or fancyswans eagles dragons rosesgold and silver ewers often matching the hanaps dishes plates porringers cups saucers saltcellars spoonsall these had been poured before the feet of alianora and all figured at her bridal festival this was above all others the era of elaborate cookery and of marvellous and unintelligible names bestowed upon it the guests were offered bouce jane and bardolfboth being of the nature of a fricasee daryalys and mon amy which may be classed under the head of custards aqua patys which was garlic broth and raynecles which somewhat resembled croquets it is however very difficult to compare these dishes with our own since the former were far more elaborate and generally involved most extraordinary mixtures of incongruous ingredients there were also oxen pigs and sheep roasted whole pies of all descriptions made of flesh fowl and fruit smaller beasts and birds of every kind many of which are now deemed inedible such as hedgehogs squirrels swans and herons and lastly two regal dishes at the top and bottom of the high table the boars head and the peacock in his pridenamely with the tail fully spread in the midst of the table at every course stood a different subtletynow a castle of silvered cardboard attacked by painted wooden knights now a bronze mill turning its wheel through a stream of gascon wine now a lady standing on a mossy bank with her cavalier kneeling at her feet while his squire held his horse ready for departure behind them finally a king seated on his throne with his court standing around this table ornament might or might not be of edible materials it was more frequently the latter after this splendid feast and when the basin of rosewater had been carried round the hall was cleared for dancing commenced by a minuet in which the wedded pair were partners how gentlemen contrived to dance with those long gowns like dressinggowns flapping about their feet may be left to themselves to explain they must have been more awkward to manage than a womans dress being open in front and therefore much more likely to entangle the legs swords were another difficulty and to fall over the sword in dancing was not an unknown calamity the simple expedient of laying it aside for the occasion appears not to have occurred to the wearers and would perhaps have been thought unknightly behaviour the bride who of course was the observed of all observers conducted herself through the whole ceremony in a composed and selfpossessed manner which the elder ladies thought extremely edifying and pointed out to their giddy or excitable daughters as a model of proper behaviour to women of alianoras type the matrimonial ceremony is the great event of lifethe ceremony rather than the fact and she was perfectly satisfied for she had obtained all she wanted she had longed for a gown of blue cloth of gold and she possessed it and many equally expensive and handsome she was now a matron which meant that she was emancipated from parental control could go where she liked and do what she pleased before her hung the glittering prospect of a queenly crown with the adornment of a rich coronet while she waited for it there was only one element in her jewelled world with which she would have been quite ready to dispense if she could have had the other items without it which was unhappily impossible and that wasroger happy is the bride the sun shines on said mistress grenestede who dealt largely in proverbs look you we could not have had a better day might we have ordered the same our own selves nay nor a jollier wedding what think you master madison forsooth methinks you be somewhat unjocund you grudge not your lord a fair and princely bride trow i grudge my lord nothing that shall be for his good nor for his pleasure was lawrences grave answer he above wist that then prithee why be you not better accommodated more at ease by reason mistress that i much question the good and i do yet more doubt the pleasure nay now heard you ever the like demanded mistress grenestede of any body who chose to answer as lawrence walked quietly away yon lad is either to presume more than him ought or elsewise can he see further into a millstone than other folk more suspicious than he should be lawrence was not so far off that he failed to hear her and he stopped for a moment to reply any man may see through a millstone mistress mine if he will but set his eye on line with the hole about the close of the king resolved to make roger viceroy of ireland he was now twenty years of ageequivalent to twentyfive in the present dayand his majesty thought it desirable that he should try his hand at that government of which so much might eventually be thrust upon him he had been married for four years and most people would have thought him fully competent to take care not only of himself but of ireland but his wise friend and fatherinlaw kent who seems to have been much attached to him was not easy to let him go alone he resolved to accompany him in person not only this but he prepared a petition to the king in council in rogers name containing the following large stipulations before roger should take the lieutenancy upon him first he requested that notwithstanding his nonage full livery should be granted to the earl of march of all his estates in england wales or ireland and of all lordships castles manors towns lands tenements rents services franchises fees and advowsons with all other appurtenances and commodities whether existing in fee or hereafter to return to the said heritage by reversion or remainder or by any other way whatever item all the revenues and profits of all the lordships and lands with all their appurtenances and commodities whatever belonging to our lord the king in all the land of ireland during the nonage of the said roger item two thousand marks in money to be paid in hand item that he have full power to charge his said heritage for one year in order to provide money for the voyage item that roger should not be obliged to take the said lieutenancy upon him before attaining his majority item that the earl of kent should accompany him with sufficient attendance specially indicating the lord lovel sir john stanley sir john sandes and sir ralph cheyne lastly that this should be done within a year from the nativity of st john next ensuing whereupon roger would assume the duties of viceroy these demands were very large but that they were perfectly reasonable is shown by the fact that not only did the king assent to them but that arundel and his cotrustees gave a ready and formal consent the entire estates of march therefore were at once resigned into rogers keeping though he was yet some months short of his full age arundel and his colleagues had done their duty well by roger in this matter the possessions handed over to him were in the best possible condition he found all his castles and houses in good repair amply stored with rich furniture his lands stocked with cattle and forty thousand marks in the treasury the king intended to have set out for ireland about the end of april but before he was able to leave shene where he was then residing the saddest loss of all his sad life fell upon him the black death that dreadful plague which had scourged england in and in returned to ravage it in one of its first victims about the th or th of april was the beloved lollard queen this is not the date usually given for her death but it is nearer the truth than the accepted one froissart who states that she died at whitsuntide which that year was june and who has been followed by all other writers contradicts himself by saying that the kings journey was deferred for two months in consequence of the queens death and that he set out about the th of june in this case she died about the th of april a date shown to be near the truth by an entry on the issue roll recording payment for the carriage of the waxen image to be borne on the coffin at her burial on the third of june there must therefore have been time before this to manufacture the wax statue which assuredly never was commenced while the queen was alive nor only this but to convey it by water from london to richmond which the entry informs us had been done it was not until after the tenth of august that roger set forth on his journey to ireland his retinue consisted of his own march herald two knights banneret eight other knights a hundred menatarms horsed archers and foot archers with him inseparable as his shadow went lawrence madison chapter viii miscalculation keep them thy gifts for them that value gold above their souls redemption

the state of affairs in ireland when roger sailed from holyhead to dublinthe fact which is supposed to underlie the enigmatical assertion of the worthy canon of chimay sir john froissart that the lords sent to govern ireland embarked from lolighet and landed at dimelinwould if in detail require a volume to itself and would be a mere list of names and battles diversified by occasional murders a short epitome of the facts is however requisite in order to make clear much that follows there were three parties at this time in ireland whom the english styled the wild irish or irishry the rebellious irish and the english the first were the unsubdued natives who had retired to the mountains bogs and forests the second who dwelt in the territory known as the english pale between the irishry and the sea were the descendants of mixed marriages between the english and irish they partially adopted the customs of both countries and were subject to the english or not as they found it convenient more frequently they did not find it so among these we find reckoned the butyllers powers gerardyns fitzgeralds bermynghams daltons barettes and dillons the last class the english proper consisted of a confused medley of soldiers merchants men of needy or desperate fortunes and those whom the english government had invested with authority they occupied the principal towns and cities and small tracts around them chiefly in leinster and on the eastern and southern coasts the rebellious english were also termed english by birth while to the obedient english was restricted the title of english by blood since the death of rogers father earl edmund of march matters had gradually been going from bad to worse until now the state of things was little removed from anarchy sometimes the septs were destroying each other at other times they were making inroads upon the english pale or joining with the great settlers in their mutual ravages the most unmanageable of all the irish chieftains at this period was arthur macmorogh of leinster who with the earl of desmond wasted the whole south of the country at intervals lesser troublers to the english but still sufficiently vexatious were the obrien in the east and the oneile in ulster the chief helper of the government was the earl of ormonde head of the great family of boteler connaught was almost entirely given up to the wild irish the appearance and tactics of king richard restored order and four kings of the wild irish submitted themselves to him rather through love and goodhumour than by battle or force and mainly through the persuasions of the earl of ormonde the four were oneile king of meath brian king of thomond contruo king of chenour which may mean the oconor and arthur macmorogh himself king of leinster who claimed to be the ardriagh or lord paramount over the whole island at dublin on the th of march these four chieftains were knighted by the king in st patricks cathedral after mass having watched the previous night in the church it may be well to note in passing that froissart gravely informs us that st john the baptist was the founder of the cathedral to instruct these four potentates in english customs in general and in the ceremonies of the forthcoming solemnity in particular the king appointed a tutor in the person of an english squire of uncertain name called in different mss of froissart and by other writers henry castide cristeed cristall and cristelle this man had long been a captive among the wild irish and had married an irish damsel his first care was to improve the chieftains table manners which in his eyes were those of savages the next to induce them to lay aside their irish cloaks and attire themselves in silken robes trimmed with fur the third to make them use saddles and stirrups both which they were very unwilling to do they appear however on this occasion to have been in a most amiable and accommodating temper what they least liked they submitted to cheerfully on being assured that it was the kings wish that while they were his guests they should conform to english customs on one point however they showed that they intended to listen to no instruction when the squire tried to investigate their religious faith they seemed so displeased that he was forced to silence we believe in god three in one said the irish kings thus far there is no difference between our creed and yours their teacher would not quit the subject until he had ascertained one point which was in his eyes of primary importance to what pope did they profess obedience was their pontiff the successor of st peter who reigned at rome or the wicked schismatic who had set himself up at avignon in fear and trembling he put the question he might have been easy for the fierce struggle between pope and antipope had not penetrated the bogs of the emerald isle the irish kings at once answered that their pope was at rome he then asked if they would like to be made knights they replied that they were knights already for every irish prince was made a knight by his royal father when he was seven years of age the squire responded rather contemptuously that the king of england would not be satisfied with that kind of childish knighthood but would create them knights in church with solemn ceremonies shortly before this solemnity the earl of ormonde paid a visit to his royal proteges he inquired if they were satisfied with castidea question which they answered like gentlemen perfectly he has prudently and wisely taught us the manners and usages of his country for which we ought to be obliged and do thank him the earl then gave them a full explanation of the honour about to be done them and the ceremonies which would attend it laying stress on the great value which they ought to set upon it the four kings seem to have behaved admirably they allowed themselves to be richly dressed of course in the english manner and let us hope that it did not include cracowes those ridiculous boots which tapered to a point and preceded their wearer by several inchesfor these must have been woful inflictions upon an irish chieftain accustomed either to wear no boots at all or to tie on simply the dun deers hide they dined at king richards table where said master castide they were much stared at by the lords and those presentnot indeed without reason for they were strange figures and differently countenanced to the english or other nations we are naturally inclined to gaze at anything strange naively added the squire and it was certainly sir john at that time a great novelty to see four irish kings castides opinion is worth record as to the reasons why the irish submitted themselves so readily he thought the rebellious english were alarmed at the blockade of their coasts which was so strict that neither provision nor merchandise could be landed but he admitted that the wild irish cared nothing for this since they lived by hunting and were strangers to commerce their reason he considered was the personal respect which they bore to king richard whom they accounted to be a prudent and conscientious man and whose reverence for the memory of edward the confessor was shared by themselvesa fact undisturbed by any inconvenient knowledge that richard if not the irish kings also had at least as much sanctity about him as edward the confessor how that most unamiable of men whose cruelty as a husband was only equalled by his irreverence as a son ever came to be canonised and honoured as saint edward must be left as one of the many insoluble enigmas which rome propounds to the crushed hearts smothered intelligences and stifled consciences of her votaries for any other reason castide remitted it to the grace of god the canon of chimay whose exquisite naive simplicity at times cuts sharply as a knife made answer with more wit than he was aware that the grace of god is good and of infinite value to those who can obtain it but we see few lords nowodays augment their territories otherwise than by force the campaign thus ended roger returned to england in company with his royal cousin and rejoined his family in london on may much to the satisfaction of both himself and lawrence madison who greatly preferred to follow his master out of battle rather than into it though he wisely kept to himself that sentiment which would only have earned him a character for cowardice on very few men had the idea then dawned that any person could love peace for other reasons than laziness and fear of being hurt the two characteristics of king richard which his uncle gloucester specially detested and despised were his religious opinions and his dislike to war and tumult it might truly be said paradox though it be that gloucester was never at peace except when he was at war during the twelve months following his return to london roger kept himself exceedingly quiet it was the only safe thing he could do it is said that an eminent man was asked how being a resident in paris he contrived to live through the reign of terror i made myself of no reputation and kept silence was the significant answer the earl of march followed the same plan the beginning of was characterised by a strong agitation against the lollard party provoked by a very bold step on their part sir john oldcastle afterwards lord cobham issued his book of conclusionsan epitome of lollard doctrines as well as a damaging attack on the opposite partywhich was presented to parliament by lord latimer and sir richard stury and posted up on the doors of st pauls cathedral and the gates of westminster abbey the two archbishops took alarm in good earnest they were strongly opposed to the new doctrineswhich were not new but as old as christianity itselfand they rightly judged that unless these views had been spreading considerably in secret they would scarcely have made this flourishing appearance in public king richard must be appealed to and entreated to put down this unwelcome manifestation with the strong arm of the law and the astute prelates well knew that only at one point like achilles was richard vulnerable on the lollard question the religious views were his own and he would listen to no diatribe against them but the political aspirations of the advanced lollards he dreaded and disliked as much as the hierarchy archbishop courtenay trusted to no tongue less skilful than his own the task of winning the king over he started for ireland without delay taking with him bishop braybroke a prelate whom the king liked and respected richard the most open and unsuspicious of men was no match for one of the wiliest priests who ever wore a mitre under his dexterous hands he was induced to believe that the political aims of the advanced section included his own depositionthe exact contrary was the truthand the beloved queen who had hitherto always guided his sceptre on this point was now beyond the fitful fever of earthly tumults never was there king of england who so easily believed what was told him says the chronicler froissart who knew richard personally the king thus influenced departed from the course approved by his own better judgment and for one moment swerved from that kindly support which he had always given hitherto to the lollard party he called before him the four most prominent lollards then in his suitelord latimer sir john montacute sir lewis clifford and sir richard sturyand sharply rebuked them for their favour shown to traitors with a threat of expulsion from the household if they did not change their political aspect latimer clifford and stury were terrified especially the last who fell upon his knees and vowed that he would never do it again all these were old men but the youngest of the groupjohn montacute who was but fourandtwentyheld his peace and promised nothing could king richard have looked forward five short years he would have seen that one young man who now refused to follow his king to evil alone of all the four giving his life for that kings sake the man who would not deny his god for fear of his sovereign was the one who was ready to die for god and him it was during this short period of glamour thrown over king richard by the astute archbishop that certain lollards were imprisoned in beaumaris castle that some recanted and that various edicts were issued in the strong language wherein gloucester and courtenay delighted against those who sowed tares among the people the complete change of tone in the royal mandates is very striking between those periods when gloucesters influence paralysed the king and the two short intervals when richard was left to himself yet to this day richard not gloucester or courtenay is assailed with all the obloquy which is due only to the two latter on this occasion richard followed the archbishops leading up to a certain point but when courtenay pressed the advantage which he had gained and urged capital punishment for the heretics the king drew back the cards had been shown a little too plainly a short term of imprisonment for obnoxious politics was consonant with richards ideas of right and justice but death as the penalty of religious opinions he would not give was it likely when the religious opinions were to some extent his own courtenay appeared to waive the matter ostensibly he deferred to the kings judgment and richard never suspected that the sentence of death had merely been by courtenay and gloucester transferred to another person and that their resolve was that if he would not permit the heretics to die richard must die himself it was during this period that earl roger kept quiet and silentso quiet that we never hear a word about him for a whole twelvemonth though circumstantial evidence tends to show that he was in london all the time his high position and his known opinions alike placed him in danger the only safe thing to do was so far as possible to reduce himself to a nonentity and hope that gloucester and his myrmidons would forget him during the last two years death had been very busy in high places the plague of had made three royal widowersthe duke of lancaster the king and the earl of derby in the summer of archbishop courtenay was also summoned to the judgment bar removed from courtenays influence the king awoke from his dream and determined to initiate a new order of things he knew at lastall but too latethat gloucester and arundel were among his worst enemies had he seen it with regard to one man morehis cousin derbythe course of english history would probably have been different there was another person awake also with the important difference that he had never been asleep gloucester was ready to act just as soon as his royal nephew sooner in fact for his plans were already matured while richards were only in process of formation the time was come when that blow was to be struck which he had foreseen so long for which he had waited so patiently and paved the way so elaborately and which for so many years past he had mentally destined roger mortimer to strike the edge of the tool must be felt to see whether the metal were sufficiently strong for the work to be done and the point sufficiently sharp the july sun streamed full into a large low chamber of a handsome house on st pauls wharf the chamber was hung with dark blue silk relieved by silver embroidery velvet settles of the same colour stood at intervals around the walls and halfadozen curule chairs of ebony inlaid with ivory and furnished with blue silk cushions were scattered about the room on one of the velvet settles with his head supported by a cushion lay the only occupant of this handsome chambera young man of twentytwo years of age faircomplexioned and very goodlooking his eyes were closed but he certainly was not asleep for he drew long sighs at intervals which were not long on a small table beside him a large book lay open bound in violet velvet and clasped with gold a soft scratch at the door without announced a visitor who was desired to come in without any change of position on the part of the occupant of the settle a middleaged man clad in blue and gold livery entered accordingly please it your lordship master westcombe is here come from fleshy from my lord duke of gloucester desiring speech of your lordship the slight contraction of his lordships brow might indicate that he could have borne to be deprived of the pleasure of an interview with mr westcombe good bring him hither he rose from the settle gave his long blue silk gown a slight shake and resting his hand on the book awaited his visitor the visitor proved to be a squire in royal livery with the badge of the duke of gloucestera golden swanfastened to his left sleeve he made a courtesyfor in those days the courtesy was the gentlemans reverenceand then with many words and some flowery expletives informed his very dear lord that his gracious lord the duke lovingly prayed him to speed with all haste to fleshy for he desired to speak with him immediately earl rogers expression of face on this communication was much like that of a man who is just on the point of swallowing a necessary but very unpalatable dose of medicine he gave a rather short reply to the effect that he would start for fleshy early the next morning and having dismissed mr westcombe courteously but quickly he made his way to another room on the same floor of the house sounds of lively conversation and laughter issued from this room as soon as the door was opened the earl in whose face the expression with which he had received his uncles behest had rather increased than disappeared from it made his way up the long narrow room filled with brilliant company pausing now to greet one and now another till he reached a lady attired in white and ruby satin who sat at the further end in a curule chair surrounded by gentle men who appeared to be paying court to her pray suffer me not to let your diversion remarked the earl with the faintest possible tone of satire under his polished accents i suppose i may have leave to speak with her ladyship among her other servitorsi came but to say my lady that my fair uncle of gloucester hath sent unto me this evening praying me to render visit unto him at fleshy as early as may stand at mine ease i think therefore to set forth with the morning light and i shall maybe not have the pleasure to see your ladyship again ere my departing the voice of the countess replied then my lord you will not be here for the dance tomorrow truly this is displeasant tidings but what her eyes said wasreally what a convenient coincidence i am delighted to hear it i dare not flatter myself that your ladyship will miss me was earl rogers answer in the same slightly ironical tone then he turned round kissed his hand to her and made his way out of the room just outside he met his children and their nurses returning from the garden they were four very pretty attractive little children the eldest not quite seven years of age and the youngest only two the earl stopped and took up the eldest in his arms god bless my nannette he said has nannette been in the garden little anne nodded and looked earnestly into her fathers eyes the expression of them distressed her children can read the expression of a face long before they can read anything else she thought in her child language that somebody had hurt him she realised that he wanted comforting and diversion of thought and her idea of administering both was to pat his cheek and to hold up her doll for him to look at somebody had indeed hurt himsomebody who was always hurting himsomebody who cared not a straw whether he was hurt or not but who that was must never be told except to the two privileged persons who had discovered it without telling and whose sympathy was ready and sure the earl kissed his little girl and set her down laid his hand on his boys head and blessed him as he turned away he said to a gentleman usher who was in waitinghas dan robesart returned home not yet my lord no matter send madison to me and the earl went on to the room he had first occupied there he sat down by the window and for a moment yielded to his own sorrowful thoughts he was not usually a man to brood over his sorrows nor to nurse grievances his feelings were more of the sharp and short order and his disposition was not only cheerful but playful but when he had just received a fresh sting the wound would smart and rankle for a moment otherwise youth and natural good spirits commonly helped him to bear his daily cross just now it pressed hard those lovely blue eyesas lovely as they were unlovinghad so plainly told him that their owner would be glad to get rid of him even for a few days that bright illusion of past days when he had fancied differently was over long ago he had woke early from his sweet dream he knew that his idol was not merely dethronedit was broken the alianora whom he had so passionately loved was a creature of his own imagination and the real being to whom he was tied for life was neither loveable nor loving there was no jealousy mixed with these feelings of disappointed loneliness it was not that he had any apprehension of her loving some one else better than himself he said to himself bitterly that she had not heart enough for that what she enjoyed in those ceaseless flirtations in which she spent her life was just their very emptiness and frivolity for anything like genuine attachmentanything which involved strength and colour and warmth and realityher nature was too light oh when will women learn that a flirt is a woman who has deliberately flung aside the very flower and glory of her womanhoodwho is preparing for herself a middle age of misery and an old age of contempt and loneliness to add to them unless gods mercy interpose to save her an eternity of remorse no type of woman is so utterly despicable as this be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap earl roger was not a man to shut his eyes to anything which he did not wish to see nor to go on hoping against hope in the face of what he knew to be facts his position was very much the same as that of another near connection of royalty just a hundred years before him but earl edmund of cornwall and earl roger of march were men of two very different types the one had sunk under his burden the other rose superior to it roger was not so utterly swallowed up in his disappointment as his predecessor had been for him his territorial affairs his children politics and other interests came in to relieve the weight only now and then as it was tonight his heart sank low and felt a yearning want of that human sympathy which he never received but from two personshis family physician mr robesart and his bodysquire lawrence madison the reader who desires to know more of this will find it in not for him he lifted his head now to bid the latter enter your lordship is not at ease i fear said the squire with an intonation of genuine interest in his master he had grown into a taller and strongerbuilt man than roger darkhaired darkeyed with a pale grave face a smile of considerable sweetness and a clear pleasant voice only the old story lad was the quiet answer aye and a little further travail thereto my lord of gloucester mine uncle hath sent for me we must needs be away toward fleshy as early as the sun tomorrow at your lordships pleasure shall it be to tarry i trow not best maybe to be prepared for a twothree days but i shall be here again in the even an i may lawrence bowed and withdrew from the chamber half an hour later mr robesart entered it and found the earl bending over the large bible i was told said he that your lordship had asked for me a short space agone metrusteth you be not indisposed not here good father i thank you answered the earl touching his head only hereand he laid a hand upon his heart methought i would fain hear somewhat of your counsel ere my departing which shall be right early on the morrow and he repeated the explanation given to lawrence your lordship responded the physician hath not as methinks overmuch trust in my lord duke fair fall he that hath that in any man returned roger with a gesture of contempt in truth father my belief in the dukes discretion not to say loyalty would go by the eye of a needle if he would but keep his plots to himself and my fair cousin of rutland which joyeth so much therein that i could not for compassion wish him thereout verily i am alway something afeard lest some day he essay to drag me in counts your lordship that his grace hath sent for you with that intent i know not wherefore he hath so done and that is the very truth and the earl passed his hand wearily over his forehead it will be well that we both ask god for wisdom for your lordship but there is more than that troubling you or i mistake more than that aye so not more than custom is father see you yon fly awalking over the page of this book if i shall say that fly is in my way and brush him thereout roughly so that he diewhat is it to me but a little matter of disease whereof i have rid me but to him it is the end of health and life and all things ah there be many flycrushers among us human creatures god help the crushed flies inconvenience does he not help them how wot i you must needs tell me what is help ere i can answer you you mind that part of the story of my lord saint john baptist when he sent them twain to our lord to ask at him if he were he that should come or no there be will tell us that he sent them for their teaching it could not be for his own methinks such have been in but few deep places where the floods overflowed them was it not that the mans heart was wrung to behold the christ his own kinsman pass him by on the other sideheal and comfort and help all that came and never turn to him ah it is evil waiting with patience and faith when christ passeth a man by and you scarce twentythree my lord said mr robesart sadly and not so inconsequently as it seemed after mens reckoning be there any years in gods eternity a man methinks may live a thousand years in one day whether they be years of happiness or of misery the earls head was lifted suddenly father tell me what means he for me it might have been so different and with the saddest of intonations the young head sank again mr robesart laid his hand on that of the earl he meansmy son give me thine heart i thought i had done so then he meansmy child come nearer to me each branch that beareth fruit he shall purge it that it bear the more fruit the earl made no reply except to say after an intervalfather i would fain find you here when i return i hope that will be tomorrow at even i will await your lordship answered mr robesart and the interview ended the journey to fleshy was hot and dusty though they arrived there before the sun had reached the meridian my lord duke kept his young kinsman waiting for him some time and when he came took him into the most secret recess of his own private room very dear cousin said heand roger felt sure from that moment that he meant mischiefi do earnestly desire to unbosom myself to thee of all the secrets of mine heart i am well assured that i need not unfold to thee the very numerous reasons which render our fair lord king richard wholly unfit to govern this realm as being neither worthy nor capable to do so roger contrived to hold his tongue and kept his amazement as much out of his eyes as he could you are well aware continued the dukepeople are apt to assume your perfect agreement when they utter opinions with which you particularly disagreeyou are well aware very dear cousin that the king cares for nothing but the pleasures of the table and the amusements of ladies what gloucester meant by this sweeping statement was that the king disliked war which his uncle regarded as the only occupation fit for a prince and preferred literature music conversation and field sports which in the eyes of his uncle were sufficiently mean to be level to the feminine intellect these words from gloucester are matter of history and were used more than once in substance at least now very dear cousin it is much communed that these things are so and hard is to know what shall be done in the matter the rather since the people are right heartily discontent and action must needs be taken talked about my lord of gloucesters language was usually as full of the people as that of any modern radical and also like some modern speakers he was greatly given to crediting the people with whatever desires he himself might entertain roger felt strongly inclined to inquire with lord melbourne cant you let it alone but he held his peace accounting it the wisest plan to let gloucester unwind his peroration every time that he found himself addressed as very dear cousin rogers sensation of distrust deepened i do you to wit very dear cousin that i am already joined by my lord of arundel your old friend and guardianhis son sir john my lord of warwick and many other prelates and barons all which be at one and busy about this matter the king shall be deposed and prisoned so long as he shall live in due state of a prince and full provision allowed for his maintenance we do desire to see you our king being fully satisfied that you shall be of very diverse liking and conditions from him that is now such and shall well content your nobles and people what say you not what he thought had roger spoken that out the solitary word scoundrel would have been sufficient to convey it but he held his peace during a few seconds of silence his thoughts rapidly revolved probabilities possibilities desirabilities gloucester watched him narrowly until at last roger looked up and spoke fair uncle and my gracious lord these matters be of weighty import and ask grave meditation it would not be possible that with so little time i should give you an answer touching a business so great rogers manner was so cautious if not cold that gloucester took the alarm have a care nevertheless most sweet cousin and this i pray you right heartily that the matter get not abroad if it be published and come to the kings ears ere the business be ripe trust me fair uncle i will take due thought and observe all secrecy and now if your grace have said so much as it list you i pray you let me be on my way home for i have urgent business in hand and it shall be late ere i win thither an hour afterwards roger and his suite set out from fleshy as he climbed the last slope whence the castle could be seen he drew bridle for an instant and looked back thank god that i have escaped from that hole with mine head on he murmured in so low a tone that he was unheard except by the safe ears of lawrence madison if my gracious lord of gloucester ever again set eyes on me within those his walls i grant him free leave to dub roger mortimer a fool very dear cousin forsooth most sweet cousin methinks the further i drew away from him the dearer and sweeter i became we will see most sweet and very dear uncle if the young cannot outrun the oldlawrence my lord we must be ready thou and i to set out for ireland as tomorrow for ireland my lord aye i shall never feel at ease till i have set the sea betwixt me and those prating traitors once at carrickfergus or trim castle and i may snap my fingers at my very dear uncle and my most sweet cousins they shall not be so foothot to fetch me from ireland as from pauls wharf the rascal crewthe vile traitors pardoned over and over again as some of them have beenraised to honours and riches by the king they are ready to betray would i be their kingthe ungrateful disloyal adders nay fair uncle of gloucester roger mortimer can lay down his life if need be but he can never sell his king and betray his friendnever break his trust nor be unfaithful to his troth un dieu un royfais ce que doy come let us hie on methinks said lawrence a little hesitatingly her ladyship shall scantly be ready to obey so unlookedfor a summons her ladyshipwill do her pleasure there was a pause between the words it may be it shall not list her to follow me thus far if she so think she can bide at which of my castles she will nothing more was said on the subject until they reached thames street when lawrence was sent to give instant notice to the servants of their masters sudden departure and warn them to be ready for him to set out at four oclock the next morning and the earl himself went to convey the intelligence to the countess bid dan robesart await me in my chamber he said to the gentleman usher as he passed chapter ix roger finds his mission and how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods lord macaulay earl roger found his countess in the same room in which he had left her when he went to fleshy hypocras and spices which constituted the void a light meal corresponding to afternoon tea were being served round as he entered roger made his way to the side of alianora declined the hypocrasa light sweet wineand sat down by her while she sipped it you are early my lord said the countess whose eyes were occupied in watching an interchange of frothy banter between a knight and a lady at a little distance i had need my lady will it meet with your wishes to follow me to ireland whether urgent cause removeth me and without delay ireland what part of ireland kilkenny at the first afterward maybe to trim and what moveth your lordship to go among those savages who should scantly wit if you ware red velvet or blue damask those savages are my kinsfolk under your ladyships leave moreover savages commonly have better sight than civil men civilised verily your lordship hath some sweet kinsfolk to wake your pride said the countess with a light laugh therein is your ladyship not deceived was the dry answer i leave behind me some most sweet ones well what saith your ladyship to my point what i go to ireland gramercy your lordship is pleasant aye when i have cause to wear up mine old gowns and ugsome headgear then will i think of following you in that direction but till it so happen under your leave i would as lief bide on pauls wharf or at ludlow ugly as your ladyship will when go you soon is itthis next week i set forth as four oclock tomorrow morning and you looked for me to go withal verily what unwitty fantasies have these men why one might scarce fold a borel cloth in the time what moveth you to be thus foothot forsooth silly a very common coarse material in hot haste there is cause dame said the earl gravely then i bid your lordship good even said the countess laughing for elsewise shall you neer have space to put on your hood i wish you a joyous meeting with those your dear kinsfolk and that they may not eat you ere i behold you again she held out her hand and he touched his lips to it may god bless my lady he said very gravely then he left her and went upstairs to say goodbye to his children as he slowly mounted the thought occurred to himwhat does blessing mean if god blessed alianora what would he do to her according to the usual ideas of men he would give her beauty talent wealth luxury and happiness but was this what god meant by the word had he no better blessings than such as these were not his sweetest fruits wrapped often in unsightly huskshis rarest gems in crusts which concealed their brilliance might he not be blessing roger himself by means of his disappointments and not blessing alianora through all the gifts he showered on her was there not something in that book which roger was beginning to know so well and to apply instinctively to every thing which happened to him about one to whom god gave corn and wine and oil and silver and gold which she prepared for baal if men turned his blessings into means of sinning was there no fear lest he should turn them into curses little anne ran to meet her father as soon as she heard his step he stooped and took her in his arms little nan he said rather sadly what wilt thou grow to be a lady said she readily with brightening eyes there be two sorts of women my little maid there be heartcomforters and there be heartbreakers which wilt thou be the question was beyond her in details she replied to its scope which was all that she understood i will be what god makes me amen answered the earl be what god makes theenot satan nor thine own foolish fantasies farewell my little one i am going a long journey my nannette will you be back soon nay i think not farewell my darlinggod go with thee and bless thee he kissed them all and gave them his blessing then he went back to his own room where he found mr robesart awaiting him father it behoveth me to set forth for ireland with the dawn and i would vain have taken you withal can you be ready a priest is always ready was the reply at what hour shall i wait upon your lordship at four of the clock i think to set out you shall find me in attendance can i serve your lordship in any other way methinks not save by taking that into your safe keeping said the earl touching the large bible i would have it go withal as well as you nought else i thank you but before mr robesart had quite reached the door his young masters voice arrested his steps father tell me ere you go what doth god when he blesseth us what do you my lord when you bless your childre i do desire all good to hap unto them but i may not ensure it and he alway ensureth it i see none other difference gods blessing is gods love every gift of god is a loving thought of gods heart toward his childre but how toward them that are not such he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good replied mr robesart his common earthly blessings he gives to all alike and what call you such gifts as beauty learning and riches be they blessings or no all things that god has made are good they are blessings when they leave his hand if we would have them abide blessings we must give them back to him if we keep them to adorn ourselves withal they become curses to us gods first and greatest blessing is himself let us keep him in his right placeon the throne of the heartand all else will fall into his right place as by the wave of a magicians wand things be sorely apt to get out of their places said the earl with a sigh i thank you father my lord when you find things out of their places look and see if you have not given leave to somewhat else to occupy his place god give you a good even a very small suite accompanied earl roger to ireland but it included his two best friends mr robesart and lawrence madison his outside friends were considerably puzzled to know why he should leave england at such a particularly awkward moment as this when the negotiations for the kings marriage were in progress the earl of kent his late guardiansince rogers majority he had ceased to be a practical one so far as any personal control was concernedwas specially perplexed and astonished at this step but he knew nothing of the interview at fleshy to all of them roger gave a general and vague explanation which had reference to the necessary care of his irish estates his own sole fervent desire was to put himself where gloucester could not find himto lose himself as far as the conspirators were concerned it was the only way that he could see just then to serve that god and that king to both of whom in his early youth he had pledged his hearts devotion rarely has any journey been taken in more feverish haste than that of roger earl of march to ireland in the summer of he felt as though he were not safe for a day until he had put the breadth of st georges channel between himself and his uncle gloucester his journey from london to haverford was almost a flight his unsuspecting suite complained bitterly of the long forced marches over the mountains of south wales which their unreasonable master obliged them to take two days delay at haverford before the wind would serve brought rogers patience to the verge of distraction i must go he said passionately to mr robesart my lord was the grave answer it ill suits the archer to wear the uniform of the general there is no must but one and it is meet but for the lips of the lord of all yet surely he knoweth my necessity soothly but i pray your lordship to remember that what is must with you may be must not with him i cannot rest till i be hence we shall rest in the life to come quietly replied mr robesart in the life that now is we have but to be and do gods will you take it calmly father but then for you there is no such need tis easy gear to counsel a man to lie still whose veins burn with fever when your own pulse is as quiet as a milltarn and roger laughed with a laugh which was not all mirth mr robesarts answering smile was rather pathetic having lived through the fever i may know your lordships feelings on the third day the wind changed and they set sail from haverford three weeksa very favourable passagelanded them at wexford and as roger set foot upon the shore of ireland he turned and looked across to the invisible mountains of wales fair fall thou my native land he said half sarcastically from henceforth is this land of my fathers mine own land and thou must serve thee without me the autumn and winter of that year found him at kilkenny spending his time in an unusual manner for a noble of the fourteenth century he summoned irish minstrels and chroniclers around him and went deep into irish history perhaps it was a natural result that irish history went deep into him he became an enthusiastic admirer of the character and annals of the nation the blood of whose kings ran in his veins his own natural impetuosity drove him along the groove which he had chosen and ere long one passionate aspiration took possession of his soul next after that un dieu un roy which had possessed and would possess it for ever england and ireland should be at peace and he would be the means of it they should live and love as sisters happy and tranquil under one sceptre having but one aim and the glory of the one should be the glory of the other to this he would give himself as long as he should live he would secure itor die in the attempt all the mortimers had entertained an affection for ireland and could never forget their irish blood king richard also had a liking for that country of which his uncle of gloucester was pleased to speak very scornfully he is a fool who thinks of conquering ireland said gloucester in his usual unwatered diction the irish are a poor and wicked people with an impoverished country and he who should conquer it one year would lose it the next this affection of the young earl for the green isle by no means increased his popularity with his english retainers saxon and celt have always mutually looked down upon each other the irish saw in the english intruding strangers none the more welcome for being conquerors the english reckoned the irish uncivilised barbarians with whom no person of refinement could be satisfied to associate they were not themselves so overrefined that they need have been particular but the halfeducated man still more woman is usually more fastidious on the score of vulgarity than the blueblooded noble there were murmurs among rogers suit that he was too accessible to the masses and that his heart was rather irish than english when the king discovered somewhat to his surprise that his chosen heir had so unexpectedly disappeared from the scene on the plea of looking after his irish property he sent him a commission of lieutenancy for ulster connaught and meatha most convenient arrangement for roger since it afforded him a full excuse for not returning to england until the state of affairs should have changed his majesty was not the only person who was puzzled by rogers proceedings but there was another person who was not puzzled at all of one point roger might safely have felt assuredthat however his sudden disappearance might surprise and perplex others his uncle gloucester at least would not fail to understand it but the fact that a particular material had proved unsuitable for his purpose was not likely to ruin the designs of so farseeing and scheming a conspirator as gloucester having convinced himself that his nephew of march was not the soft and malleable article that he had supposed him gloucester merely cast the useless thing on one side and set his busy brain to work to evolve a fresh project it proved a very different one from the last his new scheme involved a partition of the kingdom into four parts of which his brother of lancaster was to be bought off with one a matter somewhat easier said than done york who was plastic as putty in the hands of gloucester was to have another arundel was to be rewarded with the third and the fourth fell to gloucester himself march was left out altogether how long this sagacious disposition of political affairs would have lasted may be very reasonably questioned certainly not at the furthest beyond the second generation a quarter of england would never have contented derby for whose ambitious soul the world was scarcely wide enough nor could rutland have reigned an hour in his division without plotting against the other three the end was nearthe end of one phase of the political tumult on the th of july gloucester and his fellow conspirators met at arundel to perfect their plot just eight days later in full parliament at westminster that extremely honourable man my lord of rutland humbly presented a petition of impeachment against gloucester arundel and warwick five days afterwards gloucester was arrested and sent to calais and on the th of september he died in the castle of that town the king had borne with him to use his own words as long as he had been ableand no other sovereign perhaps excepting henry vi would have borne with him half so long it was asserted by the kings enemies long afterwards and is now generally believed that gloucester was murdered by being smothered between two feather beds unfortunately for the assertion this very report was spread with the view of aspersing the king while gloucester was still alive the subsequent elaborate account therefore was simply a more carefully revised version of the old slander the truth is that gloucester was either privately executed or that he died of apoplexy before the execution took place why a man under sentence of death approved as inevitable by his own brother the just and humane lancaster should not have suffered execution must be left to those modern writers of the followmyleader school who persist in terming the execution a murder how many times the penalty had been deserved it would not be easy to reckon things were not now as previously done by halvesexcept in one item and that spoiled the whole the earl of arundel was beheaded on the st of september the archbishop norfolk and warwick were banished for life if one other execution had taken place the rebellion would have been crushed and king richards life would have been safe it was entirely his own fault that it did not derby had been engaged in a multitude of plotsmore than any one knew except himselfhe had plotted the death of the king and had drawn his sword upon him in the queens presence he had been twice if not three times condemned to death by his own father the duke of bretagne had said to the king on their last interview you will never be safe while henry of lancaster lives richard knew all this but his heart failed him for all the provocation received both as monarch and as man that true and tender heart refused to condemn the old playmate and instead of it lifted him to honour he fancied this step would ensure the love and fidelity of a man who knew not what love and faithfulness were he laid this adder to warm in his bosom and like the adder that it was it stung him to death while these stirring events were passing in england earl roger of march maintained that distance and silence which he had evidently perceived to be the only safe course for himself how far was he neglecting his duties in so doing is a question which may reasonably be asked the date at which he returned to england seems to show that he was actuated not by a cowardly fear for his personal safetya supposition contradicted by every other action of his lifebut by a fear of his name being dragged into the contest on the wrong side and without his own consent as soon as he could feel sure that gloucester had laid aside the idea of making a tool of him and before any appearance of retribution had overtaken gloucester roger returned to usk the little cloud which had overhung the lollard party had been long dispersed and during the period of that shadow roger had sought safety not in flight but in silence the countess was still in london and she made no attempt to join her lord in monmouthshire he felt so hopeless of her doing so that he did not even ask her but one other thing he didhe sent for his children beyond his natural wish for their occasional company was his strong desire to rescue them from the contamination of the society into which so soon as they were old enough their mother was likely to plunge them he was anxious to accomplish a project which had occurred to him and which he did not expect her to opposeto obtain his old fostermother guenllian to take the same position with respect to his children their mother cared too little about them to care who was with them so long as it was some one who would take all responsibility off her shoulders guenllian on her part was ready enough to return to her sometime nursling whom she had always loved the best of all her charges roger was more easy when he had secured her with her came beatrice who had always been her satellite since she entered service and was considered as an indispensable appendage the following michaelmas brought a magnificent ceremony in the creation of some dozen new peers at westminster the list was headed by the traitor derby and the treacherous rutland who were respectively created dukes of hereford and aumerle but the heir presumptive of the crown kept away from both politics and pageants in his seclusion at usk and never showed himself until the ensuing january when he was summoned to the parliament at shrewsbury to take an oath which had been administered to all the peers and which march was the last of the peers to take it was a particularly useless one for a member of any party could have taken it with a clear conscience it was sworn by the body of the peers on the shrine of st edward and by march alone upon the cross of canterbury probably as being portable which the shrine was not and it bound him who took it to hold sustain and maintain well and loyally without fraud or evil intent all statutes etc made in this present parliament without ever going contrary thereto or to any part of them and never to revoke nor annul them nor never to suffer their repeal living nor dyingsaving to the king his royalty and liberty and the rights of the crown the last item annulled all the rest so far as the royalists were concerned the whole was useless as directed against the traitors roger did not remain at shrewsbury he followed the king and parliament to bristol and as soon as he was released from his parliamentary duties he came on to london he was there for a few weeks until signs appeared in the political world of another tumult it is popularly said that when thieves fall out honest men come by their own and in this instance the thieves who were hereford and norfolk fell out most decidedly they appeared together before the king each of them bringing against the other a charge of that disloyalty of which both were as guilty as any man could well be a rumour of disturbances in ireland afforded roger a chance of getting out of the way before either of these most honourable men should drag him into their toils or bring charges against him which however untrue he might find it difficult to refute once more he offered to alianora the choice of accompanying him they had been separated for nearly two years and had only met a few weeks before but the countess could not think of it in fact she declared herself quite astonished that her lord could be so unreasonable as to ask for her company her new dresses for whitsuntide were in course of preparation and had cost her a months reflection did he suppose that they could be finished in a day or if they had been finished how could he imagine that she would be satisfied to waste their resplendency on a handful of common knights and squires or a horde of irish barbarians leave town in the beginning of april it was perfectly preposterous impossible and she was quite sure he did not want herwhich last was said in a tone decidedly indicative of the companion fact that she did not want him he did not want her as he had once done his wish for the company of the real woman whom he had long seen her to be was far less than it had been erewhile for the society of the loved and loveable ideal which he was now convinced that she was not still the old love though stifled repressed and repulsed was yet alive and might have been blown into a flame had alianora cared to take the trouble roger sighed as he turned away be it so dame he answered speaking more lightly than he felt but your ladyship will scarce look for me to rest content in being utterly bereft of the company of ladies i shall take nannette withal from usk gramercy to what end demanded alianora opening her handsome eyes in astonishment a smile of rather bitter amusement played round the lips of the earl choose your ladyship the reason said he still lightly you have no grudge thereunto i good lack nay an it like your lordship to burden you with a maid of nine years you be welcome of very inwitte i shall have the lesser charge most heartily her husband might reasonably have inquired what charge she had ever taken of the children or how it was to be lessened when they were already out of her care but he passed it by wenteline will ease you thereof said he your ladyship grudgeth not methinks that she should bide hence with the childre not i forsooth have with them whom you will was the careless answer i love none of them so dear that i may not live without them roger knew as well as alianora that the pronoun included himself he sent anne into raptures and guenllian into much surprise by an order that they should be ready to accompany him his male friends were inclined to be exceedingly merry over this odd notion of the earl that he should have taken even his heir at that early age would have seemed to them amusing but to choose a girl of nine for his companion struck them as a preposterous absurdity earl roger paid no attention to them extremely sensitive to the lightest censure from lips that he loved he was now perfectly callous alike to ridicule and to anger from others of the four children anne was his special darling she and her brother roger took after himself in character while edmund and alianora were their mothers children least attractive of them was edmund in whose disposition indolence and selfishness were already manifesting themselves strongly when the children were summoned in the morning anne and roger were always up in a moment while edmund had to be dug out of bed amid a storm of grumbles all that anne owed to her mother was that graceful and gracious manner which with the mother was merely artificial polish but in the daughter was ingrained as a part of her character the childs affection for her father was intense she always shrank from her mother the instinct of her true heart discerned the utter hollowness of alianora and the two natures could never amalgamate april had almost bloomed into may when the party reached trim castle where roger meant to remain for a few weeks chapter x marcus curtius yet thy true heart and loving faith and agony of martyr death god sawand he remembereth f j palgrave what think you on thus sadly my son said mr robesart to lawrence madison whom he found standing with folded arms gazing out of an embrasure as though he were not contemplating the landscape i was thinking father was the answer in a low dreamy tone wherein success lieth what fashion of success lawrence smiled i am beginning to learn that there be more fashions thereof than one it is good to learn it early said the priest for man is apt to think that alone success which hath a gloss and a glitter about it we be too oft like childre which would rather a brass counter that did shine bravely than a gold noble that was dull and covered with dirt but what be thy thoughts thereon my son i thought father that many men did destroy their own success by being too eager to grasp thereat afore god had it ready thou hast well spoken lawrenceafore god had it ready hast thou read certain words of saint stephen the martyr touching moyses that great prophet of god he guessed that his brethren should understand that god should give to them health by the hand of him but they understood not how should they nor was it they that were lacking it was moyses that understood notunderstood not that the day of deliverance was not come by forty yearsthat forty years keeping of sheep in midian must needs be first yet god did mean to deliver them by his hand it was not undone only latered he did so when the right time camewhen he was ready and when moyses was ready and when israel was ready deferred it seemeth me answered lawrence sighing that man lacketh much training at our lords hand ere he be fit for a deliverer more than any can rightly judge outtaken our lord the fellowship of christs work may well include the fellowship of christs sufferings mark thou a stonebreaker needs no training a goldsmith must have much the finer the tool shall be the sharper must be the grinding of it what is behind thy thoughts lawrence methinks father you wit my lords earnest desire to be he that should peace ireland with englandand you know how foothot he flingeth himself soul and body into all that cometh to his hand for to be done i know said mr robesart with a smile in which amusement and pity had equal shares i was marvelling if he were ready said lawrence in the same low voice i am something feared lest he may run ere he be sent men of his disposition are prone to make that blunder that would not bring success not the brass counter of it in very sooth yet it might be a step on the way to the gold it were more like to bring a lesson to himself than success to his plan yet even there lawrence that is at times the truest success which hath most the look of failure it did not look like success when the cross was reared on the hill of calvary yet that night he was destroyed that had the power of death and the gates of the kingdom of heaven were flung open to all believers lawrence did not answer for a moment then he said in a lower tone than everthere be that seem as though they could not learn from the past let us have a care we be not of them and for others let us pray it is hard was the reply with an unsteady voice to see a life flung away and lost for the which you would give your own and count it nothing worth that is not lost was mr robesarts answer which is given to god and our neighbour the only lost lives are those that be cast away upon satan and ourselves he will not lose his life another may lawrence had no need to inquire if mr robesart were thinking of the countess and if it were as thou shouldst seem to fear resumed the priest if our young lord should fling away all even to earthly life upon this earnest burning desire that hath possessed himwho are we to say him nay this may be gods work for him it were a good work surely if it could be done it were a good work to dry up a quicksand answered lawrence significantly yet if a man flung therein all the gold of his having it should be cast away and the quicksand be no drier father it seems to me a work that cannot be done or that if it were done should cost a thousand lives as fair as his and take maybe a thousand years to do it lawrence madison said mr robesart gravely thou and i had better let the lords purposes alone for the chances be an hundred to one that we shall do them mischief it were unwisdom to stay the wheels of the world lest they should crush a fly lawrence gave a gesture of impatience almost involuntary my son continued the priest laying his hand on lawrences shoulder childre be apt to make wrong reckonings remember he that driveth the charette is the father of us all he will not crush nor noy one of his childre without good cause and mind thou that meaneth good cause for him no less than for the general matter if the master of the garden will pluck one of his flowers in the bud which of his weedinglads shall say him nay and if our father see it well to call his child to him somewhat sooner than the other childre would fain part with him is it ill for the child thus called or is it well by how rough a road it will not matter when he hath reached home yet is it so dost thou know which road should be the rougherthe short sharp climb up the steep rock or the weary winding around it i would scarce presume to say forty years in the wilderness be apt to tire a man sorely let it rest lawrence it is better only pray for him he will give his life for somewhat either by the sharp climb or the weary desert way pray that he may give it for what god means it we shall meet and rest at home god grant it be so and one other thing lawrence i will say unto thee of the which i think thou hast need be not too careful to spare pain to them thou lovest it is not the best kind of love and too ofteni would but caution thee my son to keep out of the wiles of satanwhat it truly signifieth is that we would fain spare ourselves the pain of seeing it methinks thy danger should be on that side wherefore have a care god loves us better than that aye and he only knows our hearts as he only knows those good works which he hath prepared for us to walk in it sufficeth to each day his own evil pray as much as ever thou wilt only beware of giving commands to god and when thou hast prayed and canst do nothing then is the time to stand still and see his salvation remember for him that is gods child nothing is verily ill that god doth to him nay but if it break his heart hearts take more breaking than men think said mr robesart quietly and he healeth all that have need of healing by times when we think we lack the plaster we do in very deed want the probe lawrence looked up suddenly with pained eyes the probe gives the most pain when a man shall struggle against it thy will not mine is the most wholesome medicine for all our ills my son it is a bitter one said lawrence his lip slightly trembling aye whiles we be swallowing of it but if thou wouldst make thy physic specially bitter the way is to look thereon a while aforehand and feed thy fantasy with the bitterness thereof and swallow the same grudgingly at last lawrence smiled aye me said mr robesart sadly for every time that we say to god with our lips fiat voluntas tua how many times do we say to him with our hearts fiat voluntas mea nay at times we pass a step further yet and say do thou my will may god save thee and me from that rank treason against our heavenly king we be all likely to fall therein and yet his will is for our best welfareour sanctification here our bliss hereafter and our will is but for present ease and passing pleasure lord teach us to do thy will the same evening a horn sounded without the gate and the earl of ormonde was announced in the hall of trim castle roger who was playing chess with one of his knights rose to meet his kinsman a man ten years older than himself fair fall your lordship in your light battle tonight said ormonde with a rather grim smile and a glance at the chessboard if you be of my mind we shall find somewhat heavier work tomorrow truly what mean you fair cousin the obrien is up my lord and that means work for meand for you if you will have with me have with you aye with all my heart returned the viceroy with a flash in his eyes the obrien ungrateful traitor was it for this the king knighted him in dublin cathedral howbeit you and i shall soon bring him to book and without tumult i would fain hope your pandora hath her coffer a good size answered ormonde with the same grim smile you think my hopes be overgreat trow a dram or so bigger than mine i will never fight mine own kin if i may away therewith said roger cheerfully let me but parley with the irishry myself and you shall behold somewhat come thereof truly of that doubt i nothing said ormonde in the same tone but whether that which comes thereof shall be to your gracious lordships easewell i was not bred up for a prophet whither march we down the boyne and up the blackwater the sept are gathered at kenles now called kells how much is your following all the botelers and a good parcel more of the english pale we are well enough for that i will march to meet them with the dawn said the viceroy madison order all things in good readiness for early morrow maybe i shall find my work there it was said in a cheerful almost exultant voice and roger quitted the hall leaving lawrence very very sad maybe he shall find his death there he said in a low mournful voice to mr robesart be it so my son answered the priest though his own tones were not without sorrow let him only find gods work and then he shall find also gods hire unto his servants he gives not grudgingly lawrence madison the armies met at kenles on the th of july when they were yet at a short distance the earl of march suddenly sprang from his horse and bade lawrence dismount also quick and aid me said he in his usual impulsive manner i will don the irish habit and meet them thus arrayed they will list me if i come to them in their own habit and speaking their own tongue is not the blood of their ancient kings mine own lollythe old childish epithet came back to his lips in this moment of haste and excitementwherefore standest gazing thus moonstruck make haste and help me my lord i am sore afeared lest they hurt you they hurt me am i not one of them by blood have i not learned to be one of them in language let me but don their habit and i am of them in all things quick cast thy fears and fantasies to the winds this is no time for them while roger spoke he was hastily throwing aside his english dress and arraying himself in the irish national costumethe tunic and braccae which dated from roman days the loose hood the plaid the bare foot in the stirrup and the spear in the hand thus accoutred and commanding his men to stand still until after the parley he dashed up the slope to meet the irish leaders for an instant rogers handsome face and lithe figure were seen at the summit of the knoll as he cried in irish to the advancing host god speed you my brethren what are your demands there was a moments pause for consultation among the irish leaders then two appeared to separate from the rest and to come forth towards roger at that moment came the sharp whirr of an arrow whizzing past a wild passionate cry a sudden rush forward and the next instant a prostrate figure lay on the ground at the top of the slope and over it stood lawrence madison sword in hand guarding it alike from friend and foe then a sudden word of command from the irish chieftain and down the side of the slope charged the sept of the obriens completely overwhelming the english forces let us draw a veil over the next scene the customs of the irish septs in war were very terrible the enemy who fell into their hands alive could rarely expect mercy while he who met their vengeance dead was sure of a form of wild revenge which makes the reader shudder six hours later the returned relics of the english army were reviewed and the roll called in the courtyard of trim castle ten disabled archers were answered for by others so were twentyseven wounded or captured spearmen so men spoke up for lawrence madison rescued alive almost by miracle but brought home sorely wounded and insensible and delivered into the tender care of guenllian to be nursed back to life if that might be but there was one name which won no answer of any kind except the bare bowed heads which greeted its sound and let it pass by them in solemn silence and that was roger mortimer earl of ulster and march and lord lieutenant of ireland the drawbridge was in place at trim castle the portcullis was lifted and the gates stood open in the hall was a great catafalque of black and silver where lighted tapers burned at the head and foot of the bier and into that hall now open to every comer came men of all kinds and classes and of both rival nationalitiessoldiers in uniform and squires of the neighbourhood of the english pale and barefooted irish peasantry wrapped in their tartan cloaks to gaze upon that still white face which lay so calm and quiet now the words which could be heard whispered were not all alike some of the squires and the soldiers said angrily he was too much for the irishhe was no true englishman others hushed them with nay he was englands heir or he meant well poor young gentleman but at last came one old man wrapped in the national tartan and bearing a harp upon his back who sat down and played upon the instrument a wild weird sweet keen in the softest notes it would produce and then rising he bound his harp again upon his shoulders and went up to the blackrobed priest who stood holding the sprinkler with the holy water which each one who pleased it took and sprinkled the corpse the old man took it from his hand and softly scattered the fresh drops on the calm figure lying there while he did so he spoke in irish sweet be thy sleep son of the kings of erin light lie the earth upon thy fair young face may he that reigneth in the heavens count thee among the whitewinged and the dark spirits of evil flee away from thy path to glory sleep son of una the daughter of cahil the winds whistling in thy soft hair shall not awaken thee depart on thy wings o blast of the north for thou shalt not disturb his rest long is the night that cometh but his eyes are heavy draw over him the curtain of peace and let peace be his coverlet as his murmured words ended he caught the eyes of the priest i was only blessing him father said the old man quietly didst thou think the words in my lips were reproaches or curses a bard of roscommon curse the son of cahil we could not do it father and he loved us and died for us they will not leave us his dust methinks we would enshrine it at tara where holy patrick preached or on the rock of cashel with the dust of his royal fathers ah it is not likely they do not trust us and maybe at times we have not deserved the trust but we would not have hurt him yet you killed him said mr robesart in a choked voice we was the significant answer in a pathetic tone god be judge between us you will know one daynot perchance till the great doom shall be fatherthe old man who had moved a little away suddenly stopped and fixed his eyes on mr robesart there will be some wrong things to be set right when that shall be there will was the answer in the same tone aye pursued the aged bard dreamily some false things to be made true and crooked things to be made straight and justice to be done by the great judge that day it will be a long day thatthe longest earth shall know it may well take a thousand years he turned to the corpse sleep till the morning come goldenhaired love of erin we shall all be there every one the accuser and the accused the oppressor and the oppressed the murderer and the slain there will be some of us who would be glad to change peace be on thee and god forgive us all and the old bard with the harp bound upon his back went slowly out of the hall and mr robesart looking after him murmured pax tecum in the upper chambers of trim castle the scenes were nearly as sad as in the hall beneath in the private rooms of the ladies tower the dead fathers darling had wept herself to sleep when exhausted nature could bear no more grief for the moment and in an upper chamber of the adjoining tower lawrence madison lay in fever and delirium between the two guenllian came and went with light steps and heavy heart and beatrice sat by the velvet bed watching for the child to wake and longing to comfort her there were two reasons why guenllian kept beatrice out of the sick chamber but neither of them was the one which would occur to a modern nurse our fathers at that time had little fear of contagion for they scarcely realised its existence when an infectious disease broke out they immediately thought the wells had been poisonedwhich perhaps they had though not by deliberate malice as was then imagined one of guenllians motives was a desire to keep the young girl from hearing poor lawrences perpetual repetition of the dreadful scene just enacted at kenlesthat was one of the two topics on which his fevered thoughts ran endlessly and the othermotive and topic alikewas that lawrence in his delirium had told guenllian a secret which she wanted time to consider whether it would be well to share with beatrice guenllian had entertained some suspicion of the truth already but she knew now with certainty that lawrence loved beatrice and that he felt certain she did not love him on the latter point guenllian was entirely ignorant for if beatrice had any secret feelings of this kind she confided them to no one the former was inclined to think that any partiality which beatrice might feel for lawrence was only the sisterly kindness which had always existed between them and if that were so she was very sorry for lawrence guenllian knew him well enough to be aware that his love once given would be given for ever and that there could be no second time for him but it was only now and then that beatrices name came into the passionate flood of words which were poured forth from the unguarded lips of the sufferer nearly all night through he was at kenles going over over over that awful scene butguenllian noticednever coming quite to the end when he reached the most terrible pointjust before the death of his masterhe always gave a sob and a low cry as if in pain and turned back again to the beginning this peculiarity however had not struck her as any thing remarkable until the second day when in giving a minute account of the patient she mentioned it among other items to the physician aye so asked mr robesart significantly methinks mistress guenllian that hath a meaning i would fain be here the next time that it happeth that may you with little trouble good father since i count it happeth every hour at the furthest mr robesart sat down and waited he had no need to wait long before the hour was over poor lawrence was once more pouring out his fervid and dreadful tale as though he were relating it to a listener broken constantly by disjointed words yet ever coming back to the one subject then he rade to the top of the mountprimroses grow thereno not primroseswhat call you themhe rade up in his irish habithabitmistress wenteline can you amend this rent in mine habit the irish have torn ithe called to them in the irish tonguenay i cannot tell you i wis not the irishthey be wild folk they talk alway they talked then and two of them came riding forward at aftermaster byterre look to your saddlegirth methinks there is somewhat awrymy lord bent to his saddlebow when he answered them then one of them laid his spear in restrest oh for rest mine head burnethi will give you restaye only he can give itbut methought the man were not hostile he seemed as though he held forth his hando wala wala wa help my god and with this cry not sharply and loudly delivered but in a low voice of intense anguish poor lawrence sank back upon his pillow and a cold perspiration broke out over his face lo you right this doth he alway whispered guenllian mr robesart shook his head he laid his soft cool quieting hand upon the patients brow my son lawrence dost thou hear me a lucid interval seemed to occur for lawrence looked up into his old friends face with calm weak eyes i see thou dost what came then to pass try to tell me when father answered the faint voice he had evidently no recollection of what had just happened when the irish leader came up to thy lord with his spear in rest and held forth his hand or seemed as though he should do it a look of unutterable pain came into the sick mans eyes and his tongue appeared to refuse its office tell me my son urged mr robesart with gentle firmness was it then the irish shot him lawrence tried to lift himself and looked round uneasily mr robesart helped him into a more elevated position and with a look to guenllian sent her behind the curtain under benedicite if i must whispered the patient be it so answered the priest and signed to guenllian to quit the chamber now my son here be no ears save mineand his that knoweth all things speak on father continued the low but fervent tone the irish never shot him that shot came from our own side never broke from the amazed priest lawrence my son calm thee thou art speaking i am speaking the heavy truth answered the sufferer nay father i am in good wit now whatso i may have been i tell you again the irish did it not it was his own men that slew him christ pardon him that did it i will say amen so soon as i can answered lawrence madison with a sob that is not yet the priest did not reprove him perhaps he was too shocked to say anything or perhaps he felt that in a case like this nature must have its way at first and even grace could hardly overcome it in the opening bitterness of loves agony guenllian had felt much afraid of mr robesarts making lawrence thus speak out the point which in his delirium he seemed unable to utter like a nervous horse refusing to pass a special object but the event proved the physicians judgment right from the hour that the burden was shared with another the patient began to amend who was it that slew roger mortimer and why god knoweth and men never knew the chroniclers plainly enough assert the fact of his death but they content themselves with the vaguest possible hints at the further factsthat his own men slew him and that they did it out of jealousy on account of what they deemed his irish proclivities just enough to make us guess it they suggest they were evidently afraid to say more the old bard had spoken truly for the dust of roger mortimer was not left to repose in ireland amid solemn pomp and glittering funeral gloom the coffin of the heir of england was borne over st georges channel to his ancestral home at wigmore there they laid him with the elder mortimers and not like his father with his montacute ancestors at bisham there by the side of the valiant and wise edmund mortimer and his royally descended margaret who may be termed the founders of the house by the first earl of darkened memory by the young and royal mother whom he could barely remember sleeps roger mortimer heir presumptive of england first and last lollard of the house of march england has forgotten him long ago her own chosen heir to whom her faith was sworn and from whose lips time after time the cup of success seemed snatched just as he was about to drink the sweet wine but should ireland utterly forget that scion of her ancient kings the young warmhearted gallant prince who prudently of imprudently gave his life for her and did not achieve the end in the hope of which he gave it chapter xi home to usk we buried him where he was wont to pray by the calm lakeeven hereat eventide we reared this cross in token where he lay for on the cross he said his lord had died now hath he surely reached oer mount and wave that flowery land whose green turf hides no grave felicia hemans if any further item of failure could have come into the life of roger mortimer it would have been conveyed by a royal letter dated at westminster just one week after his death and being addressed to himself before the news of the calamity at kenles had reached the king in this letter roger earl of ulster and march lord lieutenant of ireland is told that as by the advice of our council we have constituted our beloved nephew thomas duke of surrey our lieutenant in our said land from the first day of september next for one year we command that you shall not hinder the said duke from the execution of his office and we also exonerate you from the charge aforesaid from the coming of the said duke close roll ric ii part roger was supersededwhy there is no information it does not necessarily mean by any means that the king was displeased with him or desired to revoke his policy it may even have been at his own desire but there remains no evidence of this it is more probable that his royal cousin wished to have him nearer and considered that the presence of his heir presumptive would be of service to himself in that thorny and difficult path which it had been the lot of richard of bordeaux to tread from his early youth and now all that remained of roger mortimer was coming home indeed but to another home and a longer rest than those which his royal cousin had designed for him his crown was no longer a future possibility it had come he should never see evil any more it has been left on record that king richards grief and indignation at the news of rogers death were very deep and true it was indeed apart from the personal regard which he entertained for his young cousin one of the saddest calamities which could have happened for himself his heir presumptive instead of being a man who loved and honoured him was now his most implacable enemythat henry of bolingbroke who hated him worse than any other for according to the old law of england rogers reign would have been an interlude and his claim without some further distinct disposition of the crown could scarcely devolve upon his children before the funeral procession set forth there was an arrival at trim castle the lord bardolf arrived from england accompanied by his mother the lady agnes mortimer wife of that sir thomas mortimer who had played a part in rogers early life he had chosen to cast in his lot with gloucester and the lords appellants and he was now a fugitive in hiding the irish government was charged to search for him in september as he was supposed to be in that country and he was executed in england before may th close roll ric ii part patent roll ib the lady agnes mortimer who came to conduct the little lady anne back to her english friends while her son attended to the more public necessities of the case was an elderly woman of girlish character she was by birth a poynings and sisterinlaw of that lollard lady poynings who was the daughter of a princess of lancaster and who had been ejected from king richards household by the lords appellants but lady agnes was no lollard as she showed a few years later by making painful pilgrimage to cologne and rome for the good of her soul she came forward now to meet guenllian answering her deliberate and modest reverence with a shower of rapid words mistress wenteline bevan is it not so not bevan ap evan gramercy what matter ap evan is bevan and bevan is ap evantis all one i pray you mistress wenteline carry me whither i may dry me for my skirts be all sore bemired this rainy day good lack but it witteth how to rain in this country by my troth and how doth your little lady trow verily poor child she must have been moped wellnigh to death with all this doole about her young things love gleesomeness and should have it is she yet abed lady agnes paused a second for the answer and guenllian managed to glide inno madam truly i think the child hath too much sorrowed for her father to take any grief at the doole ah well we will soon have that amended said lady agnes cheerfully i will have the maid away at once and not await for aught but the bare needful we can amend all when we come to usk where my lady her mother now abideth the countess had always expressed so much dislike to usk that it rather surprised guenllian to hear that she was there lady agnes answered her look ah my lady loveth not doole no more than other folk she hath held fair court at usk trust me with a merry lot of knights and dames and in especialmark you mistress wentelinein especialmy good lord charlton of powys marry but when the news came she was aggrieved guenllian was glad to hear it the thought had lain heavy at her heart that alianora would not sorrow yet to think of her holding fair court with gay company while that terrible scene was enacting at kenles went sorely against her she might well continued the garrulous lady gramercy but i would have done the like in the same case twas but two daysnay methinks but onesithence all her michaelmas gowns were home from the tailor new fashioned and right fairand now but to think of putting all away for a lot of dreary doole dear heart but it were enough to aggrieve one if there had not been at hand my lord charlton to divert her withal methinks she should wellnigh have gone distraught we shall hear of a wedding there mistress wenteline by my troth so soon as this weary dreary doole be but got oer guenllians tongue required some hard discipline to keep it quiet could he hear it through his coffinlidthat still sleeper in the hall beneath would he not almost stir upon his satin pillow if this tale reached him of the utter apathy and heartlessness of the woman to whom he had given his hearts best love and to whom the news of his loss brought bitter regretfor the deferred wearing of her michaelmas wardrobe guenllian severely schooled her heart down and then saidas calmly as was in her warm welsh natureand as soon as a hiatus occurred in lady agness persistent rattle would it like your ladyship to tell me what manner of man is this lord charlton shall he be one that should deal gently with the childre or no for guenllians heart yearned over her darlings and especially over anne eh good lack laughed lady agnes he shall neither make nor mell with them my lord charlton is not he that should befool him alaking with childre tis the mother he loveth not them and in good sooth he is scantly the man for one of her high estate butthere you wit mistress wenteline love is a leveller love said guenllian inquiringly to her own heartnot to lady agnes ay she knew better than her companion could tell her of what material alianora was made she was likely enough to crawl to the next shrub or bramble vile though from the cedars stately arm she fell and look you pursued lady agnes breaking in upon guenllians sorrowful thoughts truly it hath been a great trouble unto my lady the coming down she looked to be one day queen of england and should have been had my sometime lord whom god pardon been more wary and witful do but think to aventure himself afore his army in an irish habitwas it not thus he did any man with his wits in his head should have wist he might as well have writ his deathwarrant and now all that lost dear dear what a misaventure verily i do think my lady of march sore to pity i warrant you to lose a crown and spoil an whole wardrobe all of a blowwell as to the losing her baron the world holdeth more than one man lady agnes had found it sobut in very deed it should sorrowfully grudge me to be in like case guenllian made no answer she only threw open the door of the lady annes apartments and motioned to the new disposer of the childs destiny to enter if she thought that both the countess and the lady agnes mortimer mistook their pearls for pebbles and their pebbles for pearls she gave no hint of doing so the funeral procession set forth and the lonely and sorrowful child who had been one of his dearest treasures followed the coffin of the dead father lady agnes mortimer had taken annes future into her own hands and being guenllians nominal superior the latter was bound to obey she was about to deliver the child into the yet more nominal care of the countess to be plunged when she grew a little older into all those pomps and vanities of this wicked world which her father had foreseen and feared for her so sorrowfully reckoned guenllian ap evan but the god of roger mortimer reckoned very differently the lot he had prepared for anne was far away from pomp and vanitya long eventless monotonous imprisonment in windsor castle with her sister and brothersthe bitter disappointment of an attempted and almost successful rescue for the lot of roger mortimer seemed to pursue his childrenan imprisonment straiter and sadder than before until that one of them whom the usurper had really cause to fear rogers bright little namesake his own true son fervent and energetic like himself died in his weary prison till a greater king than henry of bolingbroke undrew the bolts and set the prisoner free then the other three were allowed to come forth the king was not afraid of edmunddreamy indolent easeloving edmundnor of alianora who shared his character he gave to edmund to ensure his safe keeping a wife of a different type from himself a daughter of the romish house of stafford and a granddaughter of gloucester alianora was handed over to the care of the heir of courtenay ever a lancastrian house the most wary and cautious men sometimes blunder and surely it was in a moment of blunder that that wariest and coldesthearted of english kings and statesmen permitted anne mortimerthe heir of duke lionel of clarence if her brother should die issueless as he didto wed the loyal and truehearted richard of conisborough a prince of the blood in whose eyes richard of bordeaux whose godson he was was the king and henry of bolingbroke a usurper richard of conisborough was the one love of anne mortimers true heart every fibre of that sterling charactersilent shy undemonstrative but deep and loyal to the hearts corewound itself around him by whose side she dwelt in a dream of bliss for three short years and then god called her away from the evil to come he liesmurdered or rather martyredin the precincts of gods house at southampton she in the abbey church of kings langley they have met in the garden of god and if a text were to be engraven on the tomb of anne mortimer it might well be thisi will be a god to thee and to thy seed after thee she was the mother of all our kings when one grand climacteric of years had rolled round from the death of roger mortimer at kenles the lancastrian episode was over and the grandson of anne mortimer sat upon the throne of england the cup of success dashed so frequently from roger came to his childrens lips at last but the one point in which success would have been dearest to his heart has never come is it yet in reserve for some descendant of his bloodor shall the rival sister nations only see eye to eye when he shall come who is the desire of all nationswhen the lord shall bring again zion one event happened of a different character before lord bardolf and lady mortimer set forth which greatly astonished every body in trim castle and the person most concerned more than any other lawrence madison was slowly creeping back to ordinary life and was now able to sit up most of the day propped with pillows and with some difficulty and a helping arm to walk the length of the chamber lord bardolf had shown a particular wish to see him and to hear the story of the earls death from his lips and had pressed mr robesart to allow the prudence of his doing so before the physician was quite ready to admit it the latter however was overruled by his superior and lord bardolf had his wish the tale was told at what cost to lawrence he best knew and now said lord bardolf when he paused exhausted and guenllian held a cup of wine to his white weary lips methinks master madison you have scantly yet told all we heard of a young squire that in the thickest of the fight stood oer his lords body and wellnigh gave his own life that the foe should not touch the same was it thus pray you or no there was a moments flash of fiery light in the weak sunken eyes what looked you for said lawrence madison had he loved me and freed me and grown with me child and boy and man and set me so far as meetness might as his very self and should i reckon my poor worthless life as aught beside his had a thousand lives been mine i would have given them for his life and when nought but his dust was left to give them for they were at his service for that lord bardolf evidently liked the spirit of the reply so heard the kings grace said he and it liked him to issue a command to me which i must obey ere i go hence can you rise and stand a moment master madison mr robesart stepped forward and lent his aid can you kneel said lord bardolf lawrence with some difficulty contrived to do so what was going to be done to him he did not realise he was simply obeying through his messenger the command of his king he was the most astonished person in that chamber when he felt the light touch of the accolade upon his shoulder and heard lord bardolf say authoritatively rise up sir lawrence madison well verily this passeth said guenllian an hour later to her subordinate beatrice who was busy packing the few absolute necessaries which were to go with the little lady anne beattie heardest the news lawrence is made a knight guenllian received no answer except a slight sound which she failed to comprehend she looked round and saw that beatrice was in tears beattie doth aught ail thee mine heart oh nothingnotmistress wenteline would you have my ladys furred mantle or no fur mantle in august exclaimed guenllian why beattie where be thy wits dear maid the gear shall all be sent after my little lady long ere she lack her furred mantle oh aye said beatrice confusedly i only thoughtand i have not yet put up her ladyships headgear guenllian looked after her as beatrice hastily ran upstairs with a soft laugh such as had never come to her lips since the death of the earl aye i conceive you mistress beattie said she you only thought that sir lawrence madison had climbed up above blumonds beattie and was not like to reach forth an hand to help her to a seat at his side well we shall see what we shall see but if lolly be he that shall forget the old friends in the hovel for the new at the castle then is guenllian ap evan no prophetess the packing was all done and the preparations made for the long journey to wigmore abbey it had been arranged that the ladies should go no further than usk for the countess had intimated that her deep despondency would not permit her to attend the funeral her heart was so nearly broken that another ounceweight of grief would complete the catastrophe lady agnes repeated the statement to guenllian with grave lips but with a twinkle of fun in her eyes which sufficiently indicated that the real character and private intentions of this disconsolate widow were no secret to her to lady agnes this was pure amusement to guenllian it resulted in a mixture of contempt and sorrow lord bardolf of course would attend the funeral having now resigned all official duties to the new viceroy and lawrence madison had intimated that no power short of a royal command should keep him from it he would follow the friend and master whom he had loved so dearly to the last step where man can go with man his new honours had rendered lawrence his own master free to take service where he would or to refrain from it at his pleasure and to sink into the idle attitude of a hanger on the train of the lady alianora was far from lawrences conception either of happiness or duty he had now recovered his health in all senses except that physical strength was still lacking even a short walk or a slight exertion fatigued him considerably how the coming journey was to be borne he hardly knew but he said to himself that he would go through with it and in very many cases where a man will do a thing he finds that he can it was the evening before the journey and in lawrences chamber he and mr robesart sat in the oriel window enjoying the quiet of the summer evening the preceding events had drawn very closely together these two friends who alone of all the male members of the household had much in common with each other lawrence said mr robesarthe had attempted to address the new knight by his title and had been instantly entreated never to do so againlawrence what think you to make of your life now that it lieth in your own hands to make or mar it as you will if it lay in mine hands father it should surely be to mar said lawrence with much feeling i am thankful it is in gods hands to whom i have given it and he shall make thereof whatsoever he will but you must needs have desires and wishes thereunto my son aye i have so and a slight sigh accompanied the words whether they shall ever behold their fulfilment i think greatly to doubt think you to abide with my lady countess not so if our lord be served otherwise if it be his will then what mean you to enter other service or to go to the wars or what so so far as mine own liking goeth methinks neither i have alway counted you a man of peace lawrence said mr robesart with a smile which betrayed rather more amusement than was indicated by his words aye so to mine own pleasure was the reply but they which best love peace be not alway suffered to pursue it and i had thought that by your goodwill some quiet home far away from strife amid the green fields and the calm old hills should have been that which should have served you my son ah if it had been possible and another sigh followed the wish there be times howbeit when man may mistake his vocation said mr robesart in a musing tone i am something feared that is thus with one friend of oursi fear it much whom point you at asked lawrence but not in any tone of particular interest our friend beatrice that hath been speaking with me of her desire to enter the cloister the beatrice which answered the communication was in a very different tone from the last and ended in a gasp aye so replied mr robesart calmly paying no apparent attention to the tone and bestowing all his ostensible regard upon the planet venus which he was reconnoitring through an impromptu telescope made of his right hand i am greatly to doubt if the maid have any true vocation and be not rather inclined unto the veil by some other reason thereto provoking her howbeit each knoweth best his own mind but we were speaking of thyself mr robesart might try to lead the conversation back to the previous subject but lawrences interest in himself and his own future seemed suddenly extinguished he answered all further queries in a short dreamy manner which showed that his thoughts had been borne elsewhere and were likely to remain there whereby though he was not aware of it he confirmed certain impressions on the priests mind which had been formed into distinct convictions by a hint from guenllian all that mr robesart could learn from what followed was that lawrence was possessed of considerable savings which he meant on his approaching return to usk to devote to the comfort of his own relatives what other use have i for it he asked sadly and with a faint return of his former interest to his tone they are poor and need it and i never needed it nor wist what to do withal my lord furnished me with food and raiment and what other needs hath a man i never spent penny of my wage save by nows and thens in a gift to some friend and in the writing of the holy evangel that i bear ever about me i shall part the same betwixt my mother and sisters which shall wot far better than i how to lay it out to profit if any man hath not cure of his own he hath denied the faith quoted mr robesart yet bethink thee my son that very charity biddeth not that a man part with every penny of his having nor for the needs of his kinsfolk in the present empoverish his own future the lord will have a care of my future i lack but a cake and a cruse of water and he can send them by his angels when my need asketh them of him verily a man may reasonably pack his own needs in small compass but dost thou mean to remain single all thy life lawrence my lady madison may scarce be as content as thou with the cruse and the cake and in all cases two lack more provision than one mr robesart had dropped almost unconsciously into the familiar thou always used to the little lawrence of old his hearer liked it far better than the ceremonious you which he had taken up since lawrence became a man i think that is not in my future was the lowvoiced answer be not too sure said the priest some of our fathers best gifts are they which we count too good to look for yet soothly lawrence i would not wish thee a wife likelike some women be lawrence leaned forward with a glow in his eyes and spoke in a whisper wala wa father it lieth sore and heavy at mine heart that the friends he had to mourn him have been only the men and women of his meynie the one whom he loved better than all the world hath not shed one true tear for his loss my son said mr robesart tenderlywith a tenderness which was not all for lawrencehe hath seen the face of god and he is satisfied with it we loved him dear enough at least said lawrence in a choked voice lawrence canst thou not forgive herand that man that shot the arrow hast thou forgiven him dost thou know who it was i am right thankful to answer no to that last i saw not from what bow the cursed shaft came but to think that i may be speaking to that man as a friend not knowing lawrence left his sentence unfinished maybe it were meant for another said mr robesart quietly but if nomind thou my son how god dealeth with thee and me whose sins slew the son of his love and he knoweth it they set out for usk the next day taking the same route which roger had traversed in life only four months before his coffin was borne upon a bier drawn by six horses through the green valleys of kildare and carlow and wexford and at wexford haven was transferred to a boat the chanty which bore it across in the calm august sunlight to haverford two days journey took them to caermarthen where the travellers were housed in the castle and the corpse in the church of st peter watched all night by monks and four squires and sprinkled frequently with holy water three days more took them to merthyr tydvil a fourth to pontypool and on the afternoon of the fifth which was the first of september they marched in slow and solemn procession into usk before entering the town a fresh arrangement of the procession was made first came the body of archers carrying their bows unstrung in sign of mourning then two knights of the household of the deceased earl the one bearing his pennon the other his helmet with its crest then came his warhorse led by a squire bareheaded and caparisoned with all its ceremonial trappingsthe saddlecloth of blue velvet broidered with silver ostrichfeathers gold ones were peculiar to the monarch a saddlecloth which covered the horse from ears to hoofs leaving only an outlet for the nose and the eyesthe bridle being of gilded leather and the stirrup of gilt copper after the horse walked mr robesart in full canonicals bearing aloft a silver cross then came the bier borne by ten spearmen specially selected from the corpsmen whose qualifications for the office were good character and much physical strength immediately following clad in white then the colour of deepest mourning came the little lady anne on a white horsetruly the chief mourner for that father who had been her best friend in all the world her horse was led by a bareheaded squire a little behind her on the right rode lord bardolf and on the left the lady agnes the remainder of the household which included guenllian beatrice and lawrence rode after and the company of spearmen closed the funeral procession thus they bore him dead into the castle of usk which he had entered living an infant gift from god on that very morning twentyfive years before a trumpeter had been sent forward to announce the coming of the procession and when they crossed the drawbridge and filed slowly in beneath the portcullis into the courtyard they were met by a group of black monks from the neighbouring benedictine abbey the foremost swinging a censer and two others sprinkling holy water the bier was set down immediately under the portcullis and there it rested while the de profundis was chanted in presence of the garrison and of many members of the household the entire procession was meantime arrested with an irrepressible sob guenllian whispered to lawrence they that bare him stood still here is the city and there is the bier but where is he that can say arise lawrence answered by a quotation from the same book i am again rising and life he that believeth in me shall not die withouten end believest thou this it is hard to believe where man seeth not therefore the more blessed is she which hath believed nyl ye fere only believe believe what said beatrice with a dreary sigh suppressed when half drawn believe nothing mistress beatrice replied lawrence with a soft intonation which guenllian had noticed to come into his voice only when he spoke to beatrice believe in god and believe in me it is not what we must believe it is whom and whom is far easier than what to believe a thing or a doctrine taketh the head only but to believe a man and that the man that died for you this methinks taketh the heart belike trust and love be right near akin and hearts be soft while heads be hard to deal withal matters be apt to steal into the heart ere you shall wit it which should take many a weary hour to beat into the head neither come they so easy out when they be once lodged therein added guenllian you speak soothly mistress wenteline answered lawrence but now the procession moved on again and they with it into the great hall of the castle they slowly filed and there found a most effective dramatic scene prepared to meet them the countess alianora sat on the dais robed in pure white the earliest garb of widowhood which covered so much of the face that only the features were left visible in the midst but she had chosen to hide everything by an embroidered handkerchief in which her eyes were concealed there she sat the image of inconsolable woe and utter desolation while consolation in the person of the lord charlton of powys leaned over her chair and tried to gain a hearing terrible sobs were rending her breast and she seemed quite unable to speak when at last she managed to rise and approach the coffinleaning on the arm of lord powys which appeared absolutely necessary for her supportshe had scarcely taken the sprinkler from the hand of her chaplain when she dropped it and sank down in a faint of course lord powys caught her could he as a knight or a person of any humanity have permitted a lady to drop to the floor but guenllian was so misguided as to allow herself to see that her mistress took care in fainting not to entangle herself in her train and that she dropped the sprinkler in such a position that it should not damage her new velvet she hath swooned right away exclaimed beatrice in a pitying tone she did not see through the stained glass of alianoras beautiful and becoming attitudes it is not ill played was guenllians answer in a rather constrained tone that evening when guenllian and beatrice attended the coucher of the afflicted widow it fell to the lot of the latter to remove the used handkerchief from the pocket of her ladys dress and place it in the buckbasket which contained the articles ready for the wash my lady must have some whither another sudary observed she to guenllian this is full dry and she wept sore lay it in the basket beattie was guenllians quiet reply i misdoubt if thou shalt find any other chapter xii lawrences reward walking together oer the restless earth with faces set to the eternal hills rev horatius bonar lawrence madison had time given him to recover for it was november before the funeral cortege left usk for wigmore earl roger was found to have died intestate it was no wonder for how could he have anticipated that his life would end as or when it had done this fact left all the details of his burial usually so carefully provided for in the will of the deceased to the decision of the survivors the countess when appealed to replied that her unspeakable affliction could not concern itself with matters of that kind she would be obliged to lord bardolf to see that all was done properly and to leave her alone with her lifelong sorrow having said which she called for a backgammon board and was soon smilingly interested in a game with my lord powys lord powys however perceived that notwithstanding the distraction of backgammon something was really annoying the lady of his heart and after a sufficient administration of flattery and coaxing he succeeded in inducing her to confess what it was she was seriously distressed at the discovery that her husband had left no will for what that meant was that her only claim on his property was a third share in the estate had he attended properly to his conjugal duties he ought to have made a much better provision for her now when her eldest son came of age and his wardship ceased twothirds of the estate would go to him and she would be left in a position which it pleased her to regard as equivalent to destitution considering that this lamentable descent from affluence to poverty would leave her ladyship with a small balance of about a hundred and fifty thousand pounds according to the value of money at the present day it may be supposed that there was a slight twinkle in the eyes of lord powys while he condoled in a grave voice with the calamitous widow he thought her still quite sufficiently golden to be worth the trouble of wooing and she knew it he was moreover aware that a very large casket of jewels lay at her disposal and that dexterous management might squeeze a further grant out of the crown alianora was troubled by no fear of losing lord powys and had she been so would readily have comforted herself with anybody else who possessed good looks gentlemanly manners and a flattering tongue but before this little arrangement with lord powys could come to pass a licence was required from the crown and this in alianoras case would be an awkward and delicate business the king might not approveprobably would not approveof the widow of his heir presumptive throwing herself away on an obscure welsh baron and alianora was determined to marry lord powys who suited her taste much better than roger had done he was not a handsomer man but he was goodlooking and he possessed a tongue of that silvery description which to use the irishmans expression would wile a bird off a tree his tastes accorded with hers he knew how to please heran art in which roger with all his desire to do it had been much less of an adepthe was an exquisite hand at that airy smalltalk which alianora loved better than she loved her children and his supply of flattery equalled the demand which implies that it was deep and extensive indeed alianora therefore set what she called her heartnamely an obstinate unreasoning willupon edward charlton and was determined to marry him obstacles or no obstacles in order to do this a licence to marry whom she would must be procured from the crownno hint being given of whom it was to be and this could not in decency be asked for until some months had elapsed after rogers death she obtained it however before twelve months were over and having done so she instantly gave her hand to lord powys in the castle chapel to the annoyance of all her own relations and the decided displeasure of the king that did not matter to her once secure of her prize she could snap her fingers at them all she had in fact though it may be doubted if king richard knew it done the one thing which her licence bound her not to do and married one of the kings enemies lord powys was an adherent of henry of lancaster and one of the bitterest antilollards in the kingdom they both knew that they could reasonably expect no extraordinary favours at the hands of the reigning king and they contrived to bear existence on that poor pittance of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds until only four months after the granting of the licence which was one of the last acts of king richard henry of lancaster earl of derby unseated his cousin and occupied his throne he might be expected to have friendly intentions towards powys and alianora she accordingly in due time and form represented to the new king the charge she was at in maintenance of her two daughters anne and alianora the devastation of all her dowry in wales and the spoil of her late husbands lands by the welsh and prayed for relief from the crown henry answered her characteristically and in a manner which arouses an idea that his clear cold eyes saw through her dramatic craft he granted her to the value of a hundred guineas per annum all annuities forfeitures and reversions which earl roger had assigned during his lifea clever mode of making provision in name with very little solid advantage to accrue it was not for long that alianora survived this episode she died at the birth of joyce charlton the second child of her second marriage leaving her elder children in prison and going to her own placethe place she was fit for and the place she had chosen it is doubtful if he were not also to some extent an adherent of gloucester for in the previous november he had suffered eleven days imprisonment in the tower evidently on some such suspicion close roll ric ii part but this is an anticipation and we must return to that november morning on which the funeral procession quitted usk for wigmore the bier was placed on a charette and covered with a pall of black cloth surmounted by the waxen image then always carried outside the coffin the face of which was a mask taken from that of the corpse beneath two horses drew the charette until about a mile from wigmore when four more were added in order to form a more imposing spectacle lord bardolf rode behind the coffin on the right hand of the young earl who was chief mourner and whose horse was led at the leaders special request by sir lawrence madison it was usual to depute a squire to this work and it was paying the highest honour in his power to the dead and the living that lawrence should demean himself to do it the little earl seven years old behaved extremely well as was admitted and admired by everybody he really behaved so well because he felt so little the true son of alianora it was not in his nature to love any creature but edmund mortimer nor even for his own ultimate benefit was he ready to take much trouble he took the loss of a father at seven years of age as he afterwards took the loss of a crown at fourteen with the most philosophical placidity at the door of the abbey church of st james at wigmore the benedictine abbot and his canons met the coffin of the lord of the marches of wales over the coffin was a pall of cloth of gold edged with blue the colours of the house of mortimer it was borne by six squires on each side but once more sir lawrence madison stepped forward and took the place of the foremost squire his hand should be among those which performed the last offices to the brother of his lovemore than his brothers were to him when the bier was set down before the high altar twentyfive poor men clad in white according to the number of the years of the dead came forward to receive the thick wax tapers which they were to hold during the service standing about the coffin then came the solemn mass accompanied as it always is by that grandest of all funeral hymns which like the inspired hymnal of king david seems to be inimitable in translated metre recordare jesu pie quod sum causa taae viae ne me perdas ilia die quaerens me sedisti lassus redemisti crucem passus tantus labor non sit cassus when the coffin had been lowered into the vaultto which again the last office lawrence lent his handthe mourners slowly filed out of the church each as he passed the vault receiving the sprinkler from the hand of a priest in attendance and sprinkling the coffin with holy water they returned to usk not as they had come in ceremonial procession but in a quiet and orderly group considerable time elapsed and much investigation was necessary before lawrence could discover what had become of the relatives whom he had left in the hut at the foot of the castle eighteen years before the parents of beatrice his old friends blumond and philippa were dead and having been an only child she had no near relatives whose assistance could be lent in the matter for a long while all that he could ascertain with any certainty was that the present inhabitants of the hut knew nothing of the late ones and that an old woman the only person left of those who had dwelt there in lawrences childhood could tell him that his mother was dead two of his sisters married and gone and that his father and his brother simon had been removed to some other estate of their feudal ownerdown yonder said she with a nod of her head towards the north which might take in a large tract of country what had befallen the younger brother and sister she appeared to have no idea all to whom lawrence applied gave him an answer half awestruck half kindly excepting those whose brains and hearts seemed dulled by hard usage most promised to bear the matter in mind and to make such inquiries as they had opportunity lawrence had never realised the immensity of the change in himself until he attempted thus to resume the old familiar relations with that stratum of society into which he was born through constant association with educated gentlemen he had become one of them in thought and feeling but he was never aware how thoroughly until he tried to be once more that which he had ceased to be his first thought was that the people of usk had changedthey were more coldhearted and less homely and pleasant than they had been in his boyhood he discovered in time that the alteration was not in them but in himself and that all they were guilty of was the unavoidable and intuitive recognition that he belonged to the group of masters and no more to that of serfs but the discovery was not perfected until one evening when a dirty slatternly woman of about thirty years of age presented herself at the porters lodge of usk castle and demanded in a whining tone to see one lawrence madison lawrence madison forsooth returned the scandalised porter is it thus thou wouldst speak of one of the most gallant knights in england mend thy ways woman and say sir lawrence and then maybe i can find the time to answer thee eh lo you now exclaimed the woman resting a dirty hand against the stone wall ist so fine as that trow well master porter or sir porter or my lord porter as it shall like your bigness i would see sir lawrence madison if it should like you demean you to go and tell him so much and him to come hither and behold his sister his what inquired the porter in an indescribable tone reviewing the querist in a style which was scarcely flattering his sister coolly returned the unabashed young woman his fathers daughter and his mothers belike byname emmot and wife unto will sumpterman that keepeth my lord le despenser his baggage mules and hath trapesed many a weary mile to speak with my said worshipful knight canst carry so much thinkest the disgusted porter turned away without deigning a reply but his wife who had overheard the colloquy came forward and in politic wise invited emmot to enter the lodge there lawrence found her when the porter returned with him his first idea had been one of great pleasure but when he saw the dirty untidy miserablelooking creature who called him brother a mixed feeling of compassion and disgust took its place to him she was another woman and was very far from braving him as she had done the porter give you good den sir lawrence said she louting low metrusteth you shall not have forgat your sister emmot that is your own flesh and blood and right ill off with eight childre that have scarce a rag to their backs nor an handful of meal to put in their mouths i do ensure you we have heard you be come back a knight worshipful sir with a fortune in broad gold pieces and sure you would never forget your own flesh and blood mariot hath but five childre and her man was better off than mine and joan hath but two so you shall see sweet sir i cast no doubt that tis i have the most need of your bountifulness good sir lawrence lawrences awakened pity was rapidly passing into unspeakable disgust he had come home prepared to divide his savings among these relatives as being his own flesh and blood but he was not prepared to find them throwing themselves upon him like a pack of wolves intent upon nothing but the horrible emulation which of them could bite the largest piece out of him and each utterly unconcerned whether the rest got any thing at all it cost him something to say sister to this wretched creaturenot because she was poorlawrence would never have felt thatbut because she was vulgar and slovenly disgusting alike in mind and body he controlled himself however and passing by the too evident spirit of her speech asked what she could tell him of the other members of the family emmots communicativeness cooled manifestly she professed that she knew nothing of the others and lawrence had to remind her what she had just said after a little fencing she admitted that she knew where nearly all of them were mariot was living about two miles from usk and her husband had been a miner he was dead and she made a living by plaiting straw one of her sons was quite old enough to worka fact on which emmot laid great stress her husband had been a freeman and none of the family were serfs except herself which was an enormous advantage and joans husband was a serf so that she and her family were kept at their masters cost and needed nothing whateveranother enormous advantage and she had only two children and once more the eight children of the illogical emmot were paraded rhetorically before lawrence he gave her a handsome donation over which she grumbled sorely and he turned away sick at heart lawrences next work was to visit his father who lived a days journey away with his son simon and his family nicholas showed some interest in his youngest son and some slight affection for him and he did not ask for moneyan omission fully made up by simons wife simon himself proved the least changed of any of the family grim and surly as far back as lawrence could recollect him he was grim and surly still lawrence left another donation here and coming back went a little out of his way to call upon his sister joan if this lady had fewer children than her sister she supplied the gap by a larger quantity of grumbling when he left herhaving had hard work to get awaylawrence really wondered if she could have been more abusive had he refused her a penny it was with a sensation of utter disgust with the whole concern that he went to pay his last visit to his sister mariot he found a trim neat little cottage by the roadside where a clean smiling lad was cutting up a log of wood and a tidy pleasantlooking girl was sewing in the little porch and when lawrence had made known his wishes and the girl had called mother to someone in the inner roomthe cottage only held twothe woman who came forward in answer had a clean rosy face and smooth black hair neatly braided mariot dost thou mind thy youngest brother lolly eh my little lad is it thou she laid both hands on his shoulders and turned him round to the light my dear lad my own little lolly mind thee aye that do i forsooth and thou art come back to uskis it to bide there and how goes it with thee lad art wed and hast done well tell me all about thee lolly it was an entirely different welcome from any of the rest the news that lawrence was a knight and had returned possessed of a sum which in her eyes was great riches did not seem to strike mariot in any light but that of being glad for him and when he offered her the same sum which he had given to the rest and they had received so murmuringly to his surprise she refused it nay lad ill not take thy gold said mariot i want for nought god be thanked and my childre be good childre and jack hath so much as he can do and alice yonder can make a pretty penny in the straw plaiting and maud comes on well with her sewing surely it were ill done even had i need that thy brethren and sisters should strip thee of every penny little lolly i guess i was pretty nigh the only one that loved thee as a babe and now thanks be to god since i knew how he loved me i have learned to love better go thy ways lad and see to thine own welldoing and keep thy bits of savings in thy pocket i am every whit as much beholden to thee as if thou hadst given me a thousand marks but bethink thee somewhat of thine own future for when folk think not of their own selvesof the which sort there be main few by my trothother folk must think for them thou shalt wish to wed one of these days an thou dost not now and how shall that be compassed with never a plack in thy pocket go thy ways and get thee a good wife and a pleasant homethe which shall do me a much more pleasure than to have the spending of thy gold choose her by a true heart and not by a fair face and ask our lord to help thee in the choosing and then thou shalt do well and now and anon when thou hast an hour or twain to spare come down hither and drink thy fourhours with us and give me to wit of thy welfarethat shall pleasure me full greatly my lady madison trow shall be too fine to sup her fourhours with a miners widow but i would like to see thee by nows and thens she will not be my wife an she so be said lawrence but truly mariot i look for no such and it should better serve that thou wouldst leave me help thee go to said mariot with a knowing smile how many a time thinkest have i heard that saying from folks at whose wedding i have danced within the next twelvemonth thine eyes be telltales lolly an thou be heartfree mine eyes be no true men thou sayest sooth was lawrences answer in rather a sorrowful tone but one heart is not enough for a wedding my sister more than one swallow goeth to make a summer dear heart two swallows were plenty for that summer replied mariot laughing hast asked her lad she added somewhat drily lawrence confessed the negative art awaiting till she ask thee demanded mariot with an amused look scarce that methinks nay mariot she hath thought of the veil who am i that i should set me in rivalry with god go to returned mariot with a strong good sense which was not common in her era veils be for broken hearts and worndown widows and unchilded mothersfor women which have smoothed down the green turf over their hearts best love they be not for young maids fresh and bright with life opening afore them never think it yet we should give god the best said lawrence sadly give him what he asketh of thee lolly methinks that is not often the making a mans life desolate but is the cloister the only way to give to god didst learn that from the word or out of thine own heart he that trusteth his own heart is a fool why mariot art not giving me counsel to trust mine own heart in this matter never a whit i counsel thee to trust gods providence and let him choose for thee if he have not meant this maid for thee have no fear she shall say yea to thine asking do the thing that did king ezekias my dear ladspread it before the lord and ask him to lead her in accordance with his will then speak and fear not how wist thou that in her mind the choice lieth not betwixt the cloister and theeand if thy tongue be dumb she must needs choose the other shell not ask thee i reckon she loveth me not at all said lawrence id make sure was mariots quiet conclusion there be some nuts be all oer prickles o the outside which be good enough when thou hast stripped off the bur mistress wenteline said lawrence the next morning will you do me so much favour as tell me if mistress beatrice hath yet purpose to be a nun i believe answered guenllian she hath purpose to be veiled with the white ladies of limbroke if it may be this next month but as lawrence passed on she said to herself unless you can persuade her out of it a few hours later when the dusk had come as lawrence crossed the antechamber into which the moon was shining brightly he saw a dark figure standing in the recess of the window and went up to it his heart rather than his eyes told him who it was is it you mistress beatrice it is i sir lawrence the old playmates had become excessively ceremonious to each other the brotherly sort of intercourse resumed on their meeting at trim had been quite dropped and they were as distantly civil as if they had made acquaintance only a few days before you can scarce see much hence methinketh it is fair enough said beatrice absently adding after a moment fair enough for one who shall soon behold nought beyond convent walls are you well avised thereabout mistress beatrice i think so much she answered gravely thus said father robesart yet he seemed something doubtful if you have well judged therein as methought it were grave matter to blunder over mistress beatrice there is no coming forth howsoeer one may desire it no she saidand said no more lawrence took another step and dropped a little of his ceremoniousness to do it beatrice dear old friend is this for your happiness not one other word will i speak if you ensure me thereof happiness is not the only thing she said in a constrained voice not so maybe for you to think on yet methinks you might allow for your friends to concern them touching the same beatrice made no reply are you well assured that our lord calls you to that life dear beatrice might it not be better for you no less than for other that you should make happy some home and heart rather than bury yourself in the cloister think well of it ere you cast die that can never be recalled i have thought of it said beatrice in rather a hard tone i am not wanted otherwhere why should i not be a nun because you were never meant for one because it is not the right life for you for whom life is but just opening because beatrice interrupted him life opening your pardon sir lawrence life has closed for me you think so much now he answered gently this time next year will you so think not wanted would you come where you were i could tell you of one who wanteth you more than words can tellto whom the world will be black gloom if you go forth of it but let that pass i meant not to speakbeattie old friend old playmate sister if i may call you so leave me plead with you this once ere you bury your youth and hope where neither hope nor gladness can enter more i know you too well beattie you would be miserable in the cloister why not make some other life happy and your own joined thereto he listened earnestly for her answer one more negative and he would let her alone to go her own way though his way would be darkness and loneliness thenceforward lawrences love was very unselfish if beatrice had loved some one who was not himself he would have given her every penny he possessed for her fortune had he thought that the want of fortune barred her from happiness but he did not think that she loved any one and himself least of all only he could not bear the thought of the cloister for blumonds beattie and he thought he knew her well enough to be sure that it would be misery in the latter end i will said beatrice in a low voice keeping her face in shadow i will if if what dear beattie if it may be yours lawrence historical appendix mortimer of march roger mortimer third earl of march eldest and only
