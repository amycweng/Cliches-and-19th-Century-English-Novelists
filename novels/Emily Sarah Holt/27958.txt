in convent walls by emily sarah holt preface the historical portion of this tale has been partially narrated in one of my previous volumes in all time of our tribulation in which the despenser story is begun and its end told from another point of view that volume left isabelle of france at the height of her ambition in the place to reach which she had been plotting so long and so unscrupulously here we see the nemesis come upon her and the chief partner of her guilt the proof that there is a god that judgeth in the earth it is surely one of the saddest stories of historysad as all stories are which tell of men and women whom god has endowed richly with gifts and who casting from them the divine hand which would fain lift them up into the light of the golden city deliberately choose the pathway of death and the blackness of darkness for ever few women have had grander opportunities given them than isabelle for serving god and making their names blessed and immortal she chose rather to serve self and thereby inscribed her name on one of the blackest pages of englands history and handed down her memory to eternal execration for life is to do the will of godthe true blessedness and glory of life here no less than the life hereafter oh the bitter shame and sorrow that a time should ever be when i let the saviours pity plead in vain and proudly answered all of self and none of thee yet he found me i beheld him bleeding on the accursed tree heard him pray forgive them father and my wistful heart said faintly some of self and some of thee day by day his tender mercy healing helping full and free sweet and strong and ah so patient brought me lower while i whispered less of self and more of thee higher than the highest heaven deeper than the deepest sea lord thy love at last hast conquered grant me now my hearts desire none of self and all of thee part one chapter wherein dame cicely de chaucombe scribeth soothliness wherein commence the annals of cicely heaven does with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves shakespeare it is of no use jack quoth i i never did love her i never can and never shall and i never bade you sissot answered he put that in belike prithee but you bade me write the story out said i ay i did so but i left you free to speak your mind of any body that should come therein from a bishop to a baalamb said he where shall i go for mine ink i made answer seeing that some part of my tale to correspond to the matter should need to be writ in vernage note and some other in verjuice keep two quills by you saith he with inkhorns of the twain and use either according to the matter ay me said i it should be the strangest and woefullest tale ever writ by woman the more need that it should be writ quoth jack by them that have lived it and can tell the soothfastness truth thereof look you sissot there are men enough will tell the tale of hearsay such as they may win of one and another and that is like to be full of guile and contrariousness and many will tell it to win favour of those in high place and so shall but the half be told thou hast lived through it and wist all the inwards thereof at least from thine own standingspot let there be one tale told just as it was of one that verily knew and had no purpose to win gold or favour but only to speak soothfastness you set me an hard task jack i said and i think i sighed easier to do maybe than to reckon on saith he in his dry tholemode note way thou needest write but one word at once and thou canst take thine own time to think what word to write but i have no parchment said i i am a little afraid i coveted not any for i fancied not the business at all it was jack who wanted the story writ out fair not i well i have saith jack calmly nor any quills said i i have saith jack after the same fashion and the ink is driedup then will we buy more but i stayed for i thought i had better hold my tongue buti have no mind to it saith jack that might have come first sissot it shows when it doth that thou hast come to an end of thine excuses nay sweet heart do but begin and the mind will have after lackadaisy said i trying to laugh though i felt somewhat irked worried irritated i reckon then i had best do mine husbands bidding without more ado there spake my sissot saith he good dame so here am i sat at this desk with a roll of parchment that jack hath cut in even leches strips for to make a book and an inkhorn of fresh ink and divers quillso me must all this be writ up well have forth i shall so content jack and if i content not myself that shall pay me it was through being one of queen isabels gentlewomen that i came to know these things and as jack saith to live through my story and i might go a step further back for i came to that dignity by reason of being daughter unto dame alice de lethegreve that was of old time nurse to king edward so long as i was a young maid i was one of the queens subdamsels but when i wedded my jack and a better jack never did maiden wed i was preferred to be damsel of the chamber and in such fashion journeyed i with the queen to france and tarried with her all the time she dwelt beyond seas and came home with her again and was with her the four years following until all brake up and she was appointed to keep house at rising castle so the whole play was played before mine own eyes i spake only soothfastness when i told jack i could never love her how can man love whom he cannot trust it would have been as easy to put faith in a snake because it had lovesome marks and colouring as in that fair fair faceay i will not deny that it was marvellous fair with the gleaming eyes which now seemed to flash with golden light and now to look like the dark depths of a stagnant pool wonderful eyes they were i am glad i never trusted them nor did i never trust her voice it was as marvellous as the eyes it could be sweet as honey and sharp as a twoedged sword soft as doves down and hard as an agate stone too soft and sweet to be soothfast she meant her words only when they were sword and agate and the kingwhat shall i say of him in good sooth i will say nothing but leave him to unfold himself in the story i was not the kings fostersister in sooth for i was ten years the younger and it was robin my brother that claimed kin with him on that hand but he was ever hendy amiable kindly courteous to me god rest his hapless soul but where shall my tale begin verily i have no mind to set forth from the creation as chroniclers are wont i was not there then and lived not through that nor of a long while after must i then begin from my creation aswhasay as who should saythat is to say as near it as my remembrance taketh me nay i think not so for then should i tell much of the reign of king edward of westminster edward the first that were right beside the real story i think i shall take date from the time of the queens first departure to france which was the year of our lord god i was a young maid of seventeen years when i entered the queens householdher own age but in another sense i was tenfold the child that she was indeed i marvel if she ever were a child i rather think she was born grownup as the old heathen fabled minerva to have been while on waiting i often used to see and hear things that i did not understand yet which i could feel were disapproved by something inside me i suppose it must have been my conscience and if at those times i looked on my mothers face i could often read disapproval in her eyes also i never loved the long secret discourses there used to be betwixt the queen and her uncle my lord of lancaster they always had to me the air of plotting mischief nor did i ever love my lord of lancaster there was no simplicity nor courtesy in him his natural manner when he let it be seen was stern and abrupt but he did very rarely allow it to be seen it was nearly always some affectation put on and i hate that and so doth jack at that time i loved and hated instinctively as i think children do and at seventeen years i was a child in all things save by the almanac i could rarely tell why i did not love peopleonly i did not love them i knew oftener why i did i never thought much of sir piers de gavaston that the king so dearly affected but i never hated him in a deadly fashion as some did that i knew i loved better sir hugh le despenser that was afterwards earl of gloucester for he sissot saith a voice behind me what is the name of that chronicle i cannot tell jack said i what wouldst have it called the annals of cicely quoth he for she is beginning middle and end of it i felt as though he had cast a pitcher of cold water over me i sat looking at my parchment read it over prithee saith he and count how many great is be therein so did i and by my troth there were seventyseven seventyseven of me and all in six leaves of parchment forsooth how many soever shall there be by the time i make an end thats an ill beginning jack said i and i felt ready to cry must i begin over again sissot quoth he nothing is ever undone in this world what mean you said i there was man died the year before thou wert born he made answer that was great friend of my father he was old when my father was young yet for all that were they right good friends he was a very learned man so wise in respect of things known but to few that most men accounted him a very magician and no good christian howbeit my father said that was but folly and slander he told my father some of the strange matters that he found in nature and amongst them one thing which hath ever stuck by me saith friar roger nothing is ever destroyed nothing that hath once had being can ever cease to be why jack cried i verily that must be folly i cast this scrap of parchment on the chafer and it burneth up it is gone see thou surely it hath ceased to be no saith he it is gone into ashes and smoke what be ashes and smoke asked i laughing why they be ashes and smoke he made answer and the smoke curleth up chimney and goeth out into the air and the air cometh up sissots nosethirls and feedeth her bodily life and sissot maketh seventyseven is to six pages of parchment now jack softly said i so it is my dame pursueth he every thing that dieth feedeth somewhat that liveth but i can go further an thou wilt friar roger thought though he had not proved it that every word spoken might as it were dwell in the air and at bidding of god hereafter all those words should return to life and be heard again by all the world i could not help but laugh why what a din said i do but think all the words in all languages buzzing about mans ears that were ever spoken since adam dwelt in the garden of eden wouldst thou like all thy words repeated thus sissot i would not mind jack wouldst not then i am worser than thou which is like enough i would not like to hear all my foolish words all my angry words all my sinful words echoed back to me from the starry walls of heaven and suppose sissotonly suppose that god should do as much with our thoughts i dare say he knows how i covered my face with mine hands that would be dreadful i whispered it will be in very deed softly said jack when the books are opened and the names read out in the light of that great white throne which shall be brighter than noonday i reckon in that day we shall not be hearkening for sir piers de gavastons name nor for sir hugh le despensers but only for those of john and cicely de chaucombe now set again to thy chronicling my sissot and do it in the light of that throne and in the expectation of that book so shall it be done well and so jack left me but to speak sooth seeing the matter thus makes me to feel as though i scarce dared do it at all howsobe i have it to do and stedfast way maketh stedfast heart there were plenty of people who hated sir hugh le despenser but i and my mother dame alice were not amongst them he had been brought up with the king from his youth but the king never loved him till after the death of sir piers de gavaston the queen loved him just so long as the king did not that was always her way the moment that she saw he cared for anything which was not herself she at once began to hate it and verily he never gave her cause for he held her ever dearest of any mortal thing sir hugh was as goodly a gentleman as mans eyes might see those who loved him not called him proudyea the very spirit of pride but the manner they thought pride seemed to me rather a kind of sternness or shortness of speech as if he wished to have done with the matter in hand some people call every thing pride if man talk much they say he loves to hear his own voice if he be silent he despises his company now it seems to me that i often speak and am silent from many other causes than pride and therefore it may be the like with other folk do those which are ever accusing other of pride do all their actions for that reason if not so how or why should they suspect it in other men i do not think sir hugh was so much prouder than other he knew his own value i dare say and very like he did not enjoy being set at noughtwho doth so other said he was ambitious and there might be some soothfastness in the accusation yet i fancy the accusers loved a slice of worldly grandeur no less than most men and some said he was wicked man that did i never believe as for his wife dame alianora i scarcely know what to say of her she was a curious mixture of qualities she clung to the king her uncle when others forsook him she was freehanded and she could feel for man in trouble those were her good points yet she seemed to feel but what she saw it was out of sight out of mind with her and she loved new faces rather too well to please me i think for one thing she was timid and that ofttimes causes man to appear what he is not but she was better woman than either of her sistersthe lady margaret audley and the lady elizabeth de clare i never saw her do nor heard her say the heartless acts and speeches whereof i knew both of them guilty i dare say as women go she was not ill woman for alas i have lived long enough to know that there be not many good ones well i saidno did ithat i would begin with the year of our lord god but lackaday there were matters afore like as there were men before agamemnon truly methinks there be a twothree i did well not to omit aswhasay the dying of queen margaret widow of king edward of westminster which deceased seven years earlier than so i shall never cease to marvel how it came to pass that two women of the same nation of the same family being aunt and niece by blood should have been so strangely diverse as those two queens all that was good wise and gentle was in queen margaret what was in queen isabel will my chronicle best tell this most reverend lady led a very retired life after her husbands death being but a rare visitor to the court dwelling as quietly and holily as any nun might dwell and winning love and respect from all that knew her very charitable was she and most devout and if it be lawful to say thus had i been pope i had sooner canonised her than a goodly number that hath been but i do ill to speak thus seeing the holy father is infallible and acts in such matters but by the leading of gods spirit as saith the church good lack but there be queer things in this world i saw once father philip screw up his mouth when one said the same in his hearing and saith he the lord pope is infallible when he speaketh ex cathedra but so only but how saith he that spake shall we know when he is sat in his chair and when he is out of it an odd look came into father philips eyes master saith he when i was a little lad my mother told me divers times that it was not seemly to ask curious questions but i guess what the good friar thought though it be not always discreet to speak out mans thoughts ah me will the time ever come when man may say what he will with no worse thereafter than a sneer or a sharp rebuke from his neighbour if so were i would i had been born in those merry daysbut i should want jack to be born then belike sissot saith a voice over my shoulder wist thou the full meaning of thy wish jack is given to coming in quietlyi never knew him make a noiseand peeping over my shoulder to see how my chronicle maketh progress for he can well read though he write not what so jack said i i reckon we should be the younger by some centuries quoth he and perchance should not be at all but allowing it dost thou perceive that such a difference should mean a change in all thingsthat no fear should in likelihood mean no reverence nor obedience and might come to mean more than that that were dread said i what manner of times should they be i think saith he those very tempora periculosa whereof saint paul speaketh when men shall love their own selves and be proud unthankful without affection peace or benignity loving their pleasures rather than god and if it serve thee i would not like to live in those times dear heart nor would i quoth i yet surely jack that seemeth a gainsaying were all men free to speak what they would and not be called to account therefor it were soothly to love their neighbours and show benignity ay if it were done for that end he made answer but the heart of man is a cage of deceits much must befall the world i take it ere that cometh to pass and while they that bring it about may be good men that mean well they that come to use it may be evil and mean ill the devil is not come to an end of his shifts be thou sure let man run as fast and far as he will satan shall wit how to keep alongside i said nought jack is very wise a deal more than i yet i cannot always see through his eyeglasses mayhap it is not always because i am wiser of the twain freedom to do good and be good is a good thing then saith he but freedom to be ill and do ill must needs be an ill thing and man being what he is how makest thou sure that he shall always use his freedom for good and not for ill why that must man chance said i a sorry chance answereth he i were liever not to chance it i thought i heard thee deny fina this last week to go to the dance at underby fair so thou didst said i she is too young and too giddy belike to trust with a bevy of idle damosels as giddy as she well we are none of us so far grownup in all wisdom that it were safe to trust us with our own reins in all things hast never heard the saw he that ruleth his own way hath a fool to his governor well said i but then let the wise men be picked out to rule us and the fools to obey excellent doctrine my sissot quoth jack smiling in his eyes at least for the fools i might somewhat pity the wise men but how to bring it about be the fools to pick out the wise men and are they wise enough to do it i sorely fear we shall have a sorry lot of governors when thy law comes to be tried i think wife thou and i had better leave god to rule the world for i suspect we should do it something worser than he let me fall back to my chronicling another matter happed in the year the which i trow i shall not lightly forget the queen abode at brotherton the king being absent the year afore had the scots made great raids on the northern parts of england had burned the outlying parts of york while the king was there and taken the earl of richmond prisoner and now hearing of the queen at brotherton but slenderly guarded down they marched into yorkshire and we suspecting nought were wellnigh caught in the trap well i mind that night when i was awoke by pebbles cast up at my casement for i lay in a turret chamber that looked outward so soon as i knew what the sound meant i rose from my bed and cast a mantle about me and opened the casement is any there said i is that thou sissot quoth a voice which i knew at once for my brother roberts lose not one moment but arouse the queen and pray her to take horse as speedily as may be or she shall be captured of the scots which come in great force by the aire valley and are nearhand nearly at mine heels and send one to bid the garrison be alert and to let me in that i may tell my news more fully i wis not whether i shut the casement or no for ere man might count ten was i in the queens antechamber and shaking of dame elizabeth by the shoulders but good lack she took it as easy as might be she was alway one to take matters easy dame elizabeth de mohun oh let be till daylight quoth she as she turned on her pillow tis but one of robin lethegreves fumes and frets ill be bound he is for ever areckoning that the scots be at hand or the house o fire and he looks for man to vault out of his warm bed that instant minute when his fearsome news be spoken go to sleep cicely and let folks be and round turned she and i warrant was asleep ere i could bring forth another word so then i fell to shaking joan de vilers that lay at tother end of the chamber but she was right as bad though of another fashion wherefore rouse me saith she i can do nought tis not my place if dame elizabeth arise not i cannot thou wert best go back abed dear heart thou shalt but set thyself in trouble well there was no time to reason with such a goose but i longed to shake her yet again howbeit i tarried no longer in the antechamber but burst into the queens own chamber where she lay abed with dame tiffany in the pallettaking no heed that joan called after me cicely cicely how darest thou come back or thou shall be mispaid or tint held in displeasure or ruined but i cared not at that moment whether for mispayment or tinsel i had my duty to do and i did it if the news were true the queen was little like to snyb blame me when she found it so and if no well i had but done as i should and i knew that dame tiffany which tended her like a hen with one chicken should hear my tidings of another fashion from the rest had dame elizabeth lain that night in the pallet and dame tiffany in the antechamber my work had been the lighter but afore i might win to the palletwhich to do i had need to cross the chamberqueen isabels own voice saith from the state bedwho is there dame said iforgetting to kneel in such a fluster was imy brother hath now brought tidings that the scots come in force by the aire valley with all speed and are nearhand at the very gate wherefore the queen heard me no further she was out of her bed and herself donning her raiment ere i might win thus far send dame elizabeth to me was all she said and thyself bid de nantoil alarm the garrison well done i count i am not perfect nor a saint else had i less relished that second shake of dame elizabeththat was fast asleepand deliverance of the queens bidding i stayed me not to hear her mingled contakes and wayments reproaches and lamentations but flew off to the outermost door and unbarring the same spake through the crack that wherewith i was charged to oliver de nantoil the usher of the queens chamber which lay that night at her outer door then was nought but bustle and stir both within and without the queen would have up robin and hearkened to his tale while alice conan combed her hair the which she bade bound up at the readiest to lose not a moment in less than an hour methinks she won to horse and all we behind and set forth for york which was the contrary way to that the scots were coming and ah me i rade with dame elizabeth that did nought but grieve over her lost nights rest and harry poor me for breaking the same i asked at her if she had better loved to be taken of the scots since if so the queens leave accorded we might have left her behind scots quoth she where be these ghostly fabulous figurative scots i will go bail they be wrapped of their foldings plaids fast asleep on some moor an hundred miles hence tis but robin the clown that is so clumst stupid with his rashness that he seeth a scot full armed under every bush and heareth a trumpeter in every corncrake and as if that were not enough he has a sister as ill as himself that must take all for gospel as if friar robert preached it mary love us but i quoke when thou gattest hold on me by the shoulders i count it was a good hour ere i might sleep again dear heart dame cried i but it was not two minutes it is scantly an hour by now then that is thy blame cicely routing like a bedel shouting like a towncrier and oncoming assaulting folks as thou dost i marvel thou canst not be peaceable i alway am canst mind the night that ever i shaked thee awake and made thee run out of thy warm bed as if a bear were after thee i trust i kept out of my voice the laughter that was in my throat as i said no dame that cannot i the self notion of dame elizabeth ever doing thus to any was so exceeding laughable well then why canstbody o me what ever is yonder flaming light master oliver was just alongside and quoth he drily burden not your ladyship tis but the scots that have reached brotherton and be firing the suburbs holy mary pray for us skraighs dame elizabeth at last verily feared cicely how canst thou ride so slow for love of all the saints let us get on then fell she to her beads and began to invoke all the calendar while she urged on her horse till his rapid trotting brake up the aves and oras into fragments that man might scarce hear and keep him sober i warrant i was well pleased for all my weariness when we rade in at micklebar of york and so i warrant was dame elizabeth for all her impassibility we tarried not long at york for hearing that the scots came on the queen removed to nottingham for safer keeping and so ended that year but no contakes had i save of dame elizabeth that for the rest of that month put on a sorrowful look at the sight of me on the contrary part robin had brave reward from the king and my lady the queen was pleased to advance me as shall now be told shortly thereafter and ever afterwards did she seem to affy her more in me as in one that had been tried and proved faithful unto trust thus far had i won when i heard a little bruit behind me and looking up as i guessed i saw jack over my shoulder dear heart jack said i but thou hast set me a merry task two days have i been awork and not yet won to the queens former journey to france yet i do thee to wit i am full disheartened at the stretch of road i see afore me must i needs tell every thing that happed for every year mary love us but i feel very nigh at my wits end but to think of it why my chronicle shall be bigger than the golden legend and the morte arthur put together and all underby common shall not furnish geese enow to keep me in quills i ended betwixt laughter and tears to say sooth i was very nigh the latter take breath sissot saith jack quietly but dost thou mean that jack i mean not to make a nief serf of my wife saith he i was something comforted to hear that as for time dear heart he pursueth take thou an hour or twain by the day so thou weary not thyself and for events i counsel thee to make a diverse form of chronicle from any ever yet written how so jack set down nothing because it should go in a chronicle but only those matters wherein thyself was interested but that jack said i laughing as i looked up on him shall be the annals of cicely over again wherewith i thought thou wert not compatient pleased satisfied the adjective of compassion nay the annals of cicely were cicelys fancies and feelings he made answer this should be what cicely heard and saw i sat and meditated thereon and afore thou wear thy fingers to the bone with thy much scribing saith he with that manner of smile of his eyes which jack hath call thou father philip to write at thy mouth good wife nay verily quoth i i would be loth to call off father philip from his godly meditations though i cast no doubt he were both fairer scribe and better chronicler than i to speak sooth it was father philip learned me to write and the master should be better than the scholar i marvel more that have leisure learn not to write jack cannot nor my mother and this it was that made my said mother desirous to have me taught for she said had she wist the same she could have kept a rare chronicle when she dwelt at the court and sith my life was like to be there also she would fain have me able to do so i prayed father philip to learn my discreet alice for i could trust her not to make an ill use thereof but i feared to trust my giddy little vivien with such edged tools as jack saith pen and ink be and in very sooth it were a dread thing if any amongst us should be entrapped into intelligence with the kings enemies or such treasonable matter and of this are wise men ever afeared when their wives or daughters learn to write for me i were little feared of such matter as that and should rather have feared for such as vivien the secret scribing of loveletters to unworthy persons howbeit jack is wiser than i and he saith it were dangerous to put such power into the hands of most men and women lo here again am i falling into the annals of cicely have back dame cicely an it like you methinks i had best win back yet how shall i get out of the said annals and forward on my journey when the very next thing that standeth to be writ is mine own marriage it was on the morrow of the epiphany that i was wedded to my jack in the chapel of york castle i have not set down the inwards of my lovetale nor shall i for good cause for then should i not only fall into the annals of cicely but should belike never make end thereof howbeit this will i saythat when king edward bestowed me on my jack i rather count he had his eyes about him and likewise that there had been a few little passages that might have justified him in so doing for jack was of the household and we had sat the one by the other at table more than once or twice and had not always held our tongues when so were so we were no strangers forsooth but pretty well to the contrary and verily i fell on my feet that morrow i am not so sure of jack and soothly it were well i should leave other folks to blow my trumpet if any care to waste his breath at that business i was appointed damsel of the chamber on my marriage and at after that saw i far more of the queen than aforetime now and again it was my turn to lie in that pallet in her chamber eh but i loved not that work i used to feel all out altogether terrified when those great dark eyes flashed their shining flashes and there were not so many nights in the seven that they did not she was as easy to put out as to shut ones eyes but to bring in againeh that was weary work i am not like to forget that july even when in the palace of westminster my lord of exeter came to the queen bearing the great seal it was a full warm eve and the queen was late abed joan de vilers was that night tirewoman and i was in waiting i mind that when one scratched on the door we thought it master oliver and instead of going to see myself i but bade one of the subdamsels in a whisper but no sooner said shedame if it shall serve you here is my lord of exeter and sir robert de aylestonthan there was a full great commotion the queen rose up with her hair yet unbound and bade them be suffered to enter and when my lord of exeter came in sheand after her all we of her followingset her on her knees afore him to pray his blessing this my lord gave but something hastily as though his thoughts were elsewhere then said he dame the king sends you the great seal to be kept of you until such time as he shall ask it again and he motioned forward sir robert de ayleston that held in his arms the great bag of white leather wherein was the great seal of gold saw i ever in all my life face change as hers changed then to judge from her look she might have been entering the gates of heaven a sorry heaven thought i that gold and white leather could make betwixt them her eyes glowed and flashed and danced all at once and she sat her down in a chair of state and received the seal in her own hands and saith she bear with you my duty to the king my lord and tell him that i will keep his great charge in safety so her words ran but her eyes saidand eyes be apt to speak truer than voicesthis day am i proudest of all the women in england and i let not go this seal so long as i can keep it then she called dame elizabeth which received the seal upon the knee and the queen bade her commit it to the great cypress coffer wherein her royal robes were kept not long after that the queen took her chamber at the tower afore the lady joan was born and the great seal was then returned to the kings wardrobe master thomas de cherleton was then comptroller of the wardrobe but he was not over careful of his office and left much in the hands of his clerks and as at that time jack was clerk in charge he was truly keeper of the great seal so long as the queen abode in the tower he told me he would be rare thankful when the charge was over for he might not sleep o nights for thinking on the same i do think folks in high place that be set in great charge should do their own work and not leave it to them beneath so that master comptroller hath all the credit when things go well and poor john clerk payeth all the wyte if things go wrong but dear heart if man set forth to amend all the crooked ways of this world when shall he ever have done maybe if i set awork to amend me cicely it shall be my best deed and more than i am like to have done in any hurry now come i to the queens journey to france in and my tale shall thereupon grow more particular the king sent her over to remonstrate with the king of france her brother for his theft of guiennefor it was no less and to conclude a treaty with him to restore the same it was in may she left england and just before that something had happened wherein i have always thought she had an hand in the august of the year before sir roger de mortimer brake prison from the tower and made good his escape to normandy where after tarrying a small season with his mothers kinsmen the seigneurs de fienles he shifted his refuge to paris where he was out of the kings jurisdiction now in regard of that matter it did seem to me that king edward was full childish and unwise had his father been on the throne no such thing had ever happed he wist how to deal with traitors but now with so slack an hand did the king rule that not only sir roger gat free of the tower by bribing one of his keepers and drugging the rest but twenty good days at the least were lost while he stale down to the coast and so won away there was indeed a hue and cry but it wrought nothing and even that was not for a week there was more diligence used to seize his lands than to seize him and at the end of all just afore the queens journey if my lady mortimer his wife that had gone down to southampton thinking to join him was not taken and had to skipton castle and the young damsels her children that were with her sent to separate convents i have ever believed that was the queens doing it was she that loved not the lady mortimer should go to france it should have interfered with her game but what weakness and folly was it that the king should hearken her well soft you now o jack how thou didst start me i very nigh let my pen fall then shouldst thou have inked thy tunic sissot and it were pity so good cologne sindon as it is but whither goest thou with thy goosequill aflying good wife who was sir roger de mortimer and what like was he who was he jack quoth i feeling somewhat took aback why he washe was sir roger de mortimer how like a woman saith jack setting his hands in the pockets of his singlet now jack said i and what was he like saidst thou why he was as like a traitor and a wastrel and every thing that was bad as ever i saw man in all my life horns belikeand cloven feetand a long tail quoth jack ill give it up sissot thou wert best write thy chronicle thine own way but it goeth about to be rarely like a woman why how should it not when a woman is she that writeth it said i laughing but jack had turned away with that comical twist of his mouth which shows him secretly diverted verily i know not who to say sir roger was only that he was lord of wigmore and ludlow and son of the lady margaret that was born a fienles and husband of the lady joan that was born a geneville and the proudest caitiff and worst man that ever was as shall be shown ere i lay down my pen he was man that caused the loss of himself and of other far his betters and that should have been the loss of england herself but for gods mercy the friend of sathanas and of all evil the foe of god and of all goodthis and no less it seemeth me was sir roger de mortimer of wigmore god pardon him as he may if such a thing be possible note a very sweet luscious wine verjuice was the most acid type of vinegar note quiet calm patient in lowland scotch to thole is still to endure and tholemood must mean calm endurance part one chapter wherein cicely begins to see tempt not the tempter he is near enough dr horatius bonar now can any man tell what it is in folks that causeth other folks to fancy them for i have ofttimes been sorely pestered to find out truly if man be very fair or have full winning ways and sweet words and so forth then may it be seen without difficulty i never was puzzled to know why sir roger or any other should have fallen o love with queen isabel but what on earth could draw her to him that puzzled me sore he was not youngabout ten years elder than she and she was now a woman of thirty years nor was he over comely as men goi have seen betterfavoured men and i have seen worser nor were his manners sweet and winning but the very contrary thereof for they were rough and rude even to women he alway seemed to me the very incarnation of pride men charged sir hugh le despenser with pride but sir roger de mortimer was worse than he tenfold one of his own sons called him the king of folly and though the charge came ill from his lips that brought it yet was it true as truth could be his pride showed every wherein his dress in the way he bore himself in his wordsyea in the very tones of his voice and his temper was furious as ever i saw verily he was one of the least lovesome men that i knew in all my life yet for him the fairest lady of that age bewrayed her own soul and sold the noblest gentleman to the death truly men and women be strange gear i had written thus far when i laid down my pen and fell ameditating on the strangeness of such things as folks be and do in this world and as i there sat i was aware of father philip in the chamber that had come in softly and unheard of me so lost in thought was i he smiled when i looked up on him how goeth the chronicle my daughter saith he diversely father i made answer some days my pen will run apace but on others it laggeth like oxen at plough when the ground is heavy with rain the ground was full heavy when i entered saith he for the plough was standing still i laughed so it was trow but i do not think i was idle father i was but meditating wise meditations that be fruitful in good works be far away from idlesse quoth he and on what wert thou thinking thus busily my daughter on the strange ways of men and women father did the list include dame cicely de chaucombe saith father philip with one of his quiet smiles no i made answer i had not reached her or philip de edyngdon perchance thou hadst not reached him why father i might never think of sitting in judgment on you no i was thinking of some i had wist long ago and in especial of dame isabel the queen and other that were about her what is it moveth folks to love one another or to hate belike there be but three things can move thee to aught my daughter god satan and thine own human heart and my conscience said i men do oftentimes set down to conscience saith he that which is either god or satan the enlightened conscience of the righteous man worketh as gods holy spirit move him the defiled conscience of the evil man listeneth to the promptings of satan and the seared conscience is as dead and moveth not at all father can a man then kill his conscience he may lay it asleep for this life daughter may so crush it with weights thereon laid that it is as though it had the sickness of palsy and cannot move limb but i count when this life is over it shall shake off the weight and wake up to a life and a torment that shall never end i marvel if she did said i rather to myself than him daughter he made answer whoso she be let her be god saith not to thee he and she but i and thou when christ knocketh at thy door if thou open not shall he take it as tideful answer that thou wert full busy watching other folks doors to see if they would open yet may we not learn father from other folks blunders hast thou so learned daughter well not much said i a little now and then maybe i never learned much saith he from the blunders of any man save philip de edyngdon what i learned from other folks evil deeds was mostly to despise and be angered with themnot to beware for myself and that lore cometh not of god thou mayest learn from such things set down in holy writ but verily it takes god to pen them so that we may indeed profit and not scornthat we may win and not lose be sure that whenever god puts in thine hand a golden coin of his realm with the kings image stamped fair thereon satan is near at hand with a goldwashed copper counterfeit stamped with his image and made so like that thou hast need to look close to make sure which is the true hold not all gold that shinetha wise saw my daughter whether it be a thing heavenly or earthly i will endeavour myself to profit by your good counsel father said i but mine husband bade me write this chronicle though sooth to say i had no list thereto and if i shall leave to deal with he and she how then may my chronicle be writ write thy chronicle my daughter he answered but write it as god hath writ his chronicles set down that which men did that which thou sawest and heardest beware only of digging into mens purposes where thou knewest them not and sawest but the half thereof and it is rarely possible for men to see the whole of that which passeth in their own day beware of setting down a man as all evil for one evil thing thou mayest see him to do we see them we live amongst something too close to judge them truly and beware most of all of imagining that thou canst get behind gods purposes and lay bare all his reasons verily the wisest saint on earth cannot reach to the thousandth part thereof god can be fully understood only of god i have set down these wise words of good father philip for though they be too high and wide for mine understanding maybe some that shall read my chronicle may have better brains than she that writ so now once again to my chronicling and let me endeavour to do the same as father philip bade me it was on the eve of saint michael that the queen and her meynie i being of them reached paris we were ferried over the seine to the gate of nully note and thence we clattered over the stones to the hotel de saint pol note where the queen was lodged in the easternmost tower next to our lady church and we her meynie above dame isabel de lapyoun and i were appointed to lie in the pallet by turns the queens bedchamber was hung with red sindon broidered in the border with golden swans and her cabinet with blue say powdered with lilyflowers in gold which is the arms of france as every man knoweth seeing they are borne by our king that now is in right of this same queen isabel his mother he that was then my lord of chester was also of the cortege having sailed from dover two days before holy cross note and joined the queen in guienne but the queen went over in march and was all that time in guienne dear heart but jackwhich loveth to be square and precise in his mattersshould say this were strange fashion wherein to write chronicles to date first september and then the march afore it i had better go back a bit it was then the th of march the queen crossed from dover to whitsand which the french call guissant she dwelt first as i said in guienne for all that summer very quiet and peaceful were we letters going to and fro betwixt our queen and her lord and likewise betwixt her and the king of france but no visitors without there were one that evening dame isabel lay in the pallet in my stead and was so late up and passed by the antechamber door with her shoes in her hands as little meliora the subdamsel would have it she saw by the keyhole and we might nearhand as well have been in nunnery for all the folks we saw that were not of the house verily i grew sick irked wearied distressed of the calm that was like a dead calm at sea when ships lie to and can win neither forward nor backward ah foolish cicely thou hadst better have given thanks for the last peace thou wert to see for many a year well my lord of chester come which was the week after holy cross we set forth with few days delay and came to paris as i said the eve of michaelmas marvellous weary was i with riding for i rade of an horse the whole way and not as dame isabel did with the queen in her char i was so ill tired that i could but eat a twothree wafers note and drink a cup of wine and then hied i to my bed which i thank the saints was not the pallet that night the king and queen of france were then at compiegne king charles having been wed that same summer to his third wife dame jeanne of evreux and a good woman i do believe was she for all as i said aforetime there be but few but i do think and ever shall that three wives be more than any mans share the next morrow they came in from compiegne to spend michaelmas in paris and then was enough noise and merriment first mass in our lady church whereto both dame isabel and i waited on the queen and by the same token she was donned of one of the fairest robes that ever she bare which was of velvet blue of malyns malines broidered with appleblossom and with diapering of gold it did not become her by reason of her dark complexion so well as it should have done s hold man spelleth not cicely with an s jack if thou start me like this any more then will i turn the key in the lock when i sit down to write cried i for verily mine heart was going pitterpatter to come up in my throat and out at my mouth for aught i know thou irksome man i went about to write some folks not cicely but wherefore saith jack looking innocent as a yearold babe when it meaneth cicely then would i put cicely but i meant not cicely man o life bless thee i thank thee for thy blessing sissot and i will fain hope thou didst mean that any way i will go bail thy pen meant not cicely good wife but if it were not in thine heart that sissots fair hair and rosered complexion and grey eyes should have gone better with that blue velvet gown than queen isabels dusky hair and brown eyes then do i know little of man or woman and i dare be bound it would belike and jack lifteth his hat to me right courteously and is gone afore i well know whether to laugh or to be angered so i ween i had better laugh where was i trow oh at mass in our lady church of paris where that day was a miracle done on two that were possessed of the devil whose names were geoffrey boder and jeanne la petite and the girdle of saint mary being shown on the high altar they were allowed to touch the same whereon they were healed straightway and the queen with her own hands gave them alms a crown and her oblation to the image of saint mary in the said church being a festival was a crown her daily oblation being sevenpence the day and to the said holy girdle a crown and to the holy relics yet another then came we home by the water of seyne for which the boatman had twelve pence note we dwelt after this full peacefully at paris for divers weeks saving that we made short journeys to towns in the neighbourhood as one day to the house of the sisters predicants of poissy and another to gods house of loure note and another to villers where tarried the queen of france and so forth and some days spent we likewise at reyns and sessouns note at paris she had her robes made of purple and colour of malbryn for the feast of all saints and they were furred with miniver and beasts ermines and to me cicely was delivered to make my robe for the same three ells rayed striped cloth and a lamb fur and an hood of budge the queen spent nigh an whole day at sessouns and another at reyns in visiting the churches and the last can i well remember by reason of that which came after first we went to the church of saint nicholas where she offered a cloth of turk price forty shillings and to saint remy she gave another price fortyfive shillings and to the high altar of the cathedral one something better and to the ampulla note and shrine of saint remy a crown and likewise a crown to the holy relics there kept then to the friars minors where at the high altar she offered a cloth of lucca bought in the town price three and an half marks note and which i had nearhand forgot to the head of saint nicasius in the cathedral a crown the last night ere we left sessouns i remember as i came into the queens lodging from vespers in the cathedraljack that went with me having tarried at the potters to see wherefore he sent not home three dozen glasses for the queens table and by the same token the knave asked fifteen pence for the same when they did come which is a price to make the hair stand on endwell as i said i was acoming in when i met one coming forth that at first sight i wist not and yet when i meditated i did know him but i could not tell his name he had taken no note of me save to hap his mantle somewhat closer about his face as though he cared not to be knownor it might be only that he felt the cold for it was sharp for the time of year up went i into the queens lodging which was then in the house of one john de gyse that was an honester man than master bolard with whom she lodged at burgette for that last charged her three shillings and sevenpence for a worser lodging than master gyse gave her for two shillings i had writ thus far when i heard behind me a little bruit that i knew well jack said i not looking up would thou wert better flyer of falcons sissot saith he dear heart what means that trow quoth i then shouldst thou know he made answer that to suffer a second quarry to turn thee from thy first is ofttimes to lose both verily jack i conceive not thy meaning why look on yon last piece it begins with thee coming home from vespers then it flieth to me to the potter and his glasses to the knavery of his charges and cometh back to the man whom thou didst meet coming forth of the doorwhom it hath no sooner touched than it is off again to the cold even then comest thou into the queens lodging and down grees degrees that is stairs once more to the landlords bill do prithee keep to one heron till thou hast bagged him ha chetife cried i must i have firstly secondly thirdly yea up to thirtyseventhly like old father edisons homilies better so saith he than to course three hares together and catch none ill catch mine hare yet as thou shall see saith i be it done gee up saith he note well up came i into the queens antechamber where were sat dame elizabeth and dame isabel de lapyoun and dame joan de vaux and little meliora and right as i came in at the door dame joan dropped her sewing off her knee and saith lackaday i am aweary of living in this world well if so saith dame elizabeth peacefully waxing her thread you had best look about for a better nay quoth she how to get there ask my lord of winchester saith dame isabel i shall lack the knowledge ill ere i trouble him she made answer is it he with the queen this even theres none with the queen quoth dame isabel as sharp as if she should have snapped her head off dame joan looked up in some astonishment dear heart said she i thought i heard voices in her chamber there was one with her answereth meliora when i passed the door some minutes gone maybe the visitor is gone said i as i came in but now i met one coming forth who were it marry quoth dame joan it was none of the household said i a tall personable man wrapped in a great cloak wherewith he hid his face but whether it were from me or from the november even that will i not say there hath been none such here saith dame elizabeth not in this chamber saith meliora meliora servelady dame isabel made answer who gave thee leave to join converse with thy betters note the subdamsel looked set down for a minute but nought ever daunted her for long she was as pert a little maid as ever i knew and but little deserved her name of meliora ah me is this another hare have back there hath been none of any sort come to the queen today said dame isabel in so angered a tone that i began at once to marvel who had come of whom she feared talk nay but there so hath makes response dame joan have you forgot master almoner that was with her this morrow nigh an hour touching his accountsand ralph richepois with his lute after dinner marry and the lady gibine prioress of oremont addeth dame elizabeth and the two beguines began meliora but she ended not for dame isabel boxed her ears ay and jack bonard that she sent with letters to the queen of france saith dame joan yea and ivo le breton came abegging yon poor old man that had served her when a child made answer dame elizabeth and ma poor meliora got no further for dame isabel gave her a buffet on the side of her head that nigh knocked her off the form i could not but think that some part of that buffet was owing to us three though meliora had it all but what so angered dame isabel that might i not know at that time came the summons to supper so the matter ended but as supper was passing dame joan de vaux by whom i sat with master almoner on mine other hand saith to me pray you dame cicely have you any guess who it were that you met coming forth i have and i have not said i there was that in his face which i knew full well yet cannot i bethink me of his name it was not master madefray trow in no wise a higher man than he and of fairer hair not a priest neither nay certes leave not to sup your soup dame cicely nor show no astonishment i pray while i ask yet a question was itsir roger the mortimer of ludlow for all dame joans warnful words i nigh dropped my spoon and i never knew how the rest of the soup tasted wala wa said i under my breath but i do believe it was he i saw him saith she quietly and take my word for it friendthat man cometh for no good marry cried i in some heat how dare he come nigh the queen at all he a banished man without soothly he came humbly to entreat her intercession with the king for his pardon but een then he might far more meetly have sent his petition by some other verily i marvel she would see him do you so saith dame joan in that low quiet voice so do not i she will see him yet again or i mistake much ha chetife i made answer it is full well we be on our road back to paris for there at least will he not dare to come not dare surely not for the king of france which himself hath banished him should never suffer it dame joan helped herself to a roasted plover with a smile when the sewer was gone quoth she i think dame cicely you know full little whether of sir roger de mortimer or of the king of france for the last he is as easily blinded a man as you may lightly see and if our queen his sister told him black was white he should but suppose that she saw better than he and for the otheris there aught in all this world whether as to bravery or as to wickedness that sir roger de mortimer would not dare dear heart cried i i made account we had done with men of that order you did dame joans tone and the somewhat dry smile which went with it said full plainly in no wise well soothly we had enough and to spare quoth i there was my lord of lancastergod rest his souland sir piers de gavaston if he were as ill man as some said he was not a saint i think she said yet could i name far worser men than he and my sometime lord of warwick said i was no saint likewise or i mistake therein saith she have you the right well pursued i all they be gone and soothly i had hoped there were no more such left then should there be no original sin left she made answer yea and sathanas should be clean gone forth of this world the rest of the converse i mind not but that last sentence tarried in my mind for many a day and hath ofttimes come back to me touching other matters we reached loure on saint martins day november th and paris the next morrow there found we the bishops of winchester and exeter stratford and stapleton whom king edward had sent over to join the queens council now i never loved overmuch neither of these reverend fathers though it were for very diverse causes of course being priests they were holy men but i misdoubt if either were perfect man apart from his priesthoodmy lord of winchester more in especial against my lord of exeter have i but little to say he was fumish irritable captious man but no worse but my lord of winchester did i never trust nor did i cease to marvel that man could as to king edward betray him to his enemies today and he should put his life in your hands again tomorrow never saw i man like to him that no experience would learn mistrust queen isabel trusted few but of them my said lord of winchester was one i have noted at times that they which be untrue themselves be little given to trust other she trusted none save them she had tried and she had tried this bishop not once nor twice he never brake faith with her but with king edward he brake it a score of times twice told and with his son that is now king belike i wis not whether at this time the queen was ready to put affiance in him i scarce think she was for she shut both bishops out of her council from the day she came to paris but not at this time nor for long after did i guess what it signified november was nigh run out when one morrow dame joan de vaux brought word that the queen being acold commanded her velvet mantle taken to her cabinet and i as the dame in waiting then on duty took the same to her i found her sat of a chair of carven wood beside the brasier and two gentlemen of the other side of the hearth behind her chair dame elizabeth waited and i gave the mantle to her to cast over the queens shoulders the gentlemen stood with their backs to the light and i paid little note to them at first save to see that one was a priest but as i went about to go forth the one that was not a priest turned his face and i perceived to mine amaze that it was sir roger de mortimer soothly it needed all my courtly selfcommand that i should not cry out when i beheld him had i followed the prompting of mine own heart i should have cried get thee gone thou banished traitor he who had returned unlicenced from scotland ere the war was over in the time of old king edward of westminster that had borne arms against his son then king under my lord of lancaster that having his life spared and being but sent to the tower had there plotted to seize three of the chief fortresses of the crownnamely the said tower and the castles of windsor and wallingfordand had thereupon been cast for death and only spared through the intercession of the queen and the bishop of hereford yet after all this had he broken prison bribing one of his keepers and drugging the rest and was now a banished felon in refuge over seas he to dare so much as to breathe the same air with the wife of his sovereign with her that had been his advocate and that knew all his treacheries could any worser insult to the queen have been devised but all at once as i passed along the gallery another thought came in upon me what of her who knowing all this and more yet gave leave for this mannot to kneel at her feet and cry her mercythat had been grace beyond any reasonable hope but suffered him to stand in her presence to appear in her privy cabinetnay to act as though he were a noble appointed of her council had she forgot all the past i travelled no further for that time the time was to come when i should perceive that forgetfulness was all too little to account for her deeds that night dame tiffany being appointed to the pallet it so fell out that dame elizabeth dame joan and i lay in the antechamber we had but began to doff ourselves and dame elizabeth was stood afore the mirror acombing of her long hairand rare long hair it was and of a fine colour but i must not pursue the same or jack shall find in the hair an harewhen i said to her dame elizabeth pray you tell me were you in waiting when sir roger de mortimer came to the queen ay saith she and combed away and said i with what excuse came he excuse quoth she marry i heard none at all none i cried tarrying in the doffing of my subtunic were you not ill angered to behold such a traitor dame cicely saith she slowly pulling the loose hairs forth of the comb if you would take pattern by me and leave troubling yourself touching your neighbours doings you should have fewer griefs to mourn over could the left sleeve of my subtunic which i was then adoffing have spoke unto me i am secure he should have plained that he met with full rough treatment at my hands good for you dame an you so can said i somewhat of a heat so long as my neighbours do well i desire not to mell meddle nor make in their matters but if they do ill why then do i desire it even less saith she for i were more like to get me into a muddle mine own troubles be enough for me and full too many dear heart had you ever any quoth i in very deed i do ensure you saith she for this comb hath one of his teeth split and he doth not only tangle mine hair but giveth me vile wrenches betimes when i look not for them and tis but a month gone at betesi bethizy that i paid halfacrown for him the rogue cheated me as my name is bess i could find in mine heart to give him a talking only a talking saith dame joan and laughed you be happy woman in good sooth if your worsest trouble be a comb that hath his teeth split do but try him quoth dame elizabeth and snorked twisted contorted up her mouth as the comb that instant moment came to a spot where her hair was louked fastened together bless the comb saith she and i guess she meant it but little wala wa dame joan think you tis matter for laughter more like than greeting weeping she made answer verily said i but i see much worser matter for tears than your comb dame elizabeth either the queen is sore illusen of her brother that such ill companions should be allowed near her or else well for me my lace snapped at that moment and i ended not the sentence when i was laid down beside dame joan it came to me like a flash of lightningor elsewhat and at that minute dame joan turned her on the pillows and set her lips to mine ear dame cicely quoth she mine heart misdoubts me it is the or else pray you govern your tongue and use your eyes in time to come trust not her in the red bed too much and her in the greenhung chamber not at all the first was dame elizabeth and the last dame isabel de lapyoun that lay in a chamber hung with green with dame tiffany i was secure she meant not the other but to make certain i whispered the name and she saith she i reckoned it not ill counsel for mine own thoughts assented thereto in especial as touched dame isabel after that day wherein sir roger de mortimer was in the queens cabinet i trow i kept mine eyes open for a few days he came and went but scarce more than a sennight had passed ere i learned that he had come to dwell in paris all out and but little more time was spent when one even dame isabel de lapyoun came into our chamber as we were about to hie us abed and saith she speaking to none in especial but to all sir roger de mortimer is made of the princes following and shall as tomorrow take up his abode in the queens hostel dear heart saith dame elizabeth making pause with one hand all wet and in the other the napkin whereon she went about to dry it well no business of mine trow i could not help to cry ha chetife dame isabel made answer to neither the one nor the other but marched forth of the door with her nose an inch higher than she came in she was appointed to the pallet for that night so we three lay all in our chamber this passeth saith dame elizabeth drying of her fingers calm enough on the napkin even as i looked for saith dame joan but her voice was not so calm there was in it a note of grief a tone of indignation i neer trouble me to look for nought quoth dame elizabeth what good trow better to leave folks come and go as they list so long as they let hinder you not to come and go likewise i knew not you were one of cains following dame bess cains following saith she drawing off her fillet who was cain trow wala wa but if my fillet be not all tarnished o this side i would things would go right so would i and so did not cain dame joan makes answer who was he quotha why he that slew his brother abel oh some of those old scripture matters i wis nought o those folks but what so i have not slain my brother nor my sister neither it looks as though your brother and your sister too might go astray and be lost ere you should soil your fingers and strain your arms apulling them forth gramercy every man for himself saith dame elizabeth apulling off her hood now heres a string come off alway my luck if a body might but bide in peace and never have no troubles nor strings come off nor buttons broke nor stitches come loose adds dame joan alaughing right soman might have a bit of piece of mans life then why look you the string is all chafen that it is not worth setting on anew and so much as a yard of red ribbon have i not i must needs don my hood of green of louvaine she said it in a voice which might have gone with the direst calamity that could befall dame elizabeth de mohun you be a full happy woman what will the woman say next that somewhat hangeth on what you may next say well what i next say is that i am full illused to have in one hour a tarnished fillet and a broken string andsaint lucy love us here be two of my buttons gone i could thole no longer and forth brake i in laughter dame joan joined with me and some ado had we to peace dame elizabeth that was sore grieved by our laughing will you leave man be quoth she they be right real silver buttons and not one more have i of this pattern i ensure you they cost me four shillings the dozen at john fairhairs in london a london goldsmith ill be bound i can never match them without i have them wrought of set purpose deary deary me well saith dame joan i may break my heart afore i die but i count it will not be over buttons not oer your buttons belike saith dame elizabeth and here this very day was hilda la vileyne at me begging and praying me that i would pay her charges for that hood of scarlet wrought with gold and pearls the which i had made last year when i was here with the queen truly i forgat the same at that time and now i have not the money to mine hand but deary me the pitiful tale she toldof her mother ill and her two poor little sisters without meet raiment for winter and never a bit of food nor fuel in the housei marvel what maids would be at to make up such tales it was not true trow true saith dame elizabeth pulling off her rings it might be true as damascus steel for aught i know but what was that to me i lacked the money for somewhat that liked me better than to buy fuel for a parcel of common folks like such they be used to lack comforts and not i and i hate to hear such stories belike forsooth man might as well let down a black curtain over the window on a sunshine day as be plagued with like tales when he would fain be jolly i sent her off in hot haste i can tell you with the money the saints be about us not i and the little maids may greet them asleep for lack of food saith dame joan how wis i there be any such i dare be bound it was all a madeup tale to win payment you went not to see i go to see i dame joan you be verily i am verily one for whom christ our lord deigned to die on the bitter rood and so is hilda la vileyne tell me but where she dwelleth and i will go to see if the tale be true good lack i carry not folks addresses in mine head o that fashion let be she shall be here again in a day or twain she hath granted me little peace these last ten days and you verily wis not where she dwelleth i wis nought thereabout and an i did i would never tell you tonight dear heart do hie you abed and sleep in peace and let other folks do the like i never harry me with other mens troubles good even and dame elizabeth laid her down and happed the coverlet about her and was fast asleep in a few minutes the next even when we came into hall for supper was sir roger de mortimer on the dais looking as though the world belonged to him maybe he thought it was soon to do the same and therein was he not deceived the first day he sat in his right place at the high table after the knights and barons of france whom the king of france had appointed to the charge of our queen but not many days were over ere he crept up above themand then above the bishops themselves until at last he sat on the left hand of queen isabel my lord of chester being at her right but this first night he kept his place note neuilly queen isabelles scribe is responsible for the orthography in this and subsequent places

second note gee this is one of the few words in our tongue directly derivable from the ancient britons note avice serueladi occurs on the close roll for part one chapter how dame elizabeths bill was paid and yet it never was in my soul to play so ill a part but evil is wrought by want of thought as well as by want of heart thomas hood as i came forth of hall after supper that even and we were entered into the long gallery whereinto the queens degrees opened i was aware of a full slender and whitefaced young maid that held by the hand a small little child of mayhap five or six years she looked as though she waited for some man the queen had tarried in hall to receive a messenger and dame joan de vaux was in waiting so dame elizabeth dame isabel dame tiffany and i were those that passed along the gallery dame isabel and dame tiffany the maid let pass with no more than a pitiful look at the former that deigned her no word but when dame elizabeth came next on the further side i being betwixt the maid stepped forward into the midst as if to stay her her thin hands were clasped over her bosom and the pitifullest look ever i saw was in her eyes dame ayez pitie was all she said and it was rather breathed than spoken bless us saint maryart thou here again quoth dame elizabeth of a testier fashion than she was wont get thee gone child i have no time to waste dear heart what a fuss is here over a crown or twain dost think thy money is lost i will pay thee when it liketh me i have not my purse to mine hand at this minute and on she walked brushing past the maid i tarried are you hilda la vileyne i said unto her dame that is my name and here is my little sister iolande she hath not tasted meat food this day nor should not yesterday had not a kindly gentleman given me a denier to buy soup but truly i do not ask for charityonly to be paid what i have honestly earned and hadst thou some soup yesterday yesnooh i am older i can wait better than the little ones the mother is sick she and the babes must not wait it does not signify for me oh how hungered were those great eyes that looked too large for the white face the very name of soup seemed to have brought the craving look therein i turned to the small tell me iolande had hilda any of the soup yesterday no said the child i and madeleine drank it every drop that our mother left and had hilda nothing there was a mouldy crust in the cupboard said the child it had dropped behind the cup and hilda found it when she took the cup down we could not see it behind we can only just reach to take the cup down and put it up again that was what hilda had and she wiped the cup with one end of it the cup that had held the soup yes surely said the child with a surprised look we only have onedoes not madame know it is an esquelle porringer a shallow bowl not a cup said hilda reddening a little the child hardly knows the difference i felt nearhand as though i could have twisted dame elizabeths neck for meat for those children and are you in good sooth so ill off as that said i no meat and only one esquelle in all the house dame said hilda meekly as in excuse our father was long ill and now is our mother likewise and many things had to be sold to pay the apothecary and also while i waited on them could i not be at work and my little sisters are not old enough to do much but truly it is only these last few weeks that we have been quite so ill off as to have no food and i have been able to earn but a few deniers now and then enough to keep us alive but no more how much oweth you dame elizabeth said i dame it is seven crowns for the hood i wrought and three more for a girdle was owing aforetime and now four for kerchiefs broidering it is fourteen crowns in all i should not need to ask charity if i could but be paid my earnings the apothecary said our mother was sick rather from sorrow and want of nourishment than from any malady and if the good dame would pay me i might not only buy fresh matter for my work but perchance get food that would make my mother wellat least well enough to sew and then we should have two pairs of hands instead of one i do not beg dame she louted low as she spoke and took her little sister again by the hand come iolande we keep madame waiting but hast thou got no money pleaded the barne thou saidst to madeleine that we should bring some supper back thou didst hilda i did darling allowed her sister looking a little ashamed i could not peace the babe else andi hoped we should i could bear no more the truth of those maids story was in the little ones bitter disappointment and in poor hildas hungry eyes eyes speak sooth though lips be false come said i i pray you tarry but one moment more you shall not lose by it we are at madames service said hilda i ran up degrees as fast as ever i could as the saints would have it that very minute i oped the door was dame elizabeth haling forth silver in her lap and afore her stood the jewellers man awaiting to be paid blame me who will i fell straight on those gold pieces and silver crowns fourteen crowns dame elizabeth quoth i all scant of breath quick give me themfor hilda la vileyneand if no may god forgive you for i never will soothly had the archangel raphael brake into the chamber and demanded fourteen crowns dame elizabeth could have gazed on him no more astonied than she did on me cicely that she had seen nearhand every day of her life for over a dozen years i gave her leave to look how it listed her from the coins in her lap i counted forth nine nobles and a french crown and was halfway down degrees again ere she well knew what i would be at if i had had to pay her back every groat out of mine own pursenay verily if i had stood to be beheaden for iti would have had that money for hilda la vileyne that night they stood where i had left them by the door of the long gallery near the portecochere but now with them was a thirdmine own jack that had but now come in from the street and the child knew him again as she well showed o hilda i heard her say as i came running down swiftlyfor i was dread afraid dame elizabeth should overtake me and snatch back the moneyand i might have spared my fears for had i harried the queens crown along with her crowns no such a thing should ever have come in her heado hilda saith the child see here the good messire who gave us the denier to buy soup i might have guessed it was jack he oerheard the child and stayed him to pat her on the head well little one was the soup good so good messire but hilda got nonenot a drop hush saith hilda but the child would go on none at all why how was that saith jack looking at hilda i answered for her the sick mother and helpless babes had the soup said i and this brave maid was content with a mouldy crust jack a word in thine ear good saith he when i had whispered to him go thy ways sweetheart and so do nay there is no need to go any ways said i for here cometh meliora down degrees and of a truth i somewhat shrink from facing dame elizabeth after my robbery of her any sooner than must bemeliora child wilt run above an instant and fetch my blue mantle and the thicker of mine hoods meliora ran up straightway for though she was something too forward and could be pert when she would yet was she goodnatured enough when kindly used i turned to hilda hold thy palm my maid said i here is the money the lady ought owed thee and i haled into her hand the gold pieces and the silver crown verily i could have greeted mine eyes sore to see what then befell the barne capered about and clapped her hands crying supper supper now we shall have meat but hilda covered her eyes with her void hand and sobbed as though her heart should break god almighty bless you kind dame said she when as she could speak again i was nearhand in utter mishope nearly in despair now my mother can have food and physic and maybe if it please god she shall recover may i be forgiven but i was beginning to think the good god cared not for poor folks like us or maybe that there was no god to care at all down came meliora with my hood and mantle which i cast all hastily about me and then said i to hilda my maid i would fain see thy mother maybe i could do her some good and mine husband here will go with us for a guard lead on god bless you she said yet again he must have heard me the last words were spoken lowly as to herself we went forth of the great gates and traversed the good streets and came into divers little alleys that skirt the road near saint denis gate in one of these hilda turned into an housea full poor hut it wasand led me up degrees into a poor chamber whither the child ran gleefully afore jack left me at the door he and i having covenanted when we whispered together what he should do whilst i visited hildas mother little iolande ran forward into the chamber crying supper supper mother and madeleine hilda has money for supper what i then beheld was a poor pallet but ill covered with a thin coverlet whereon lay a pale weak woman that seemed full ill at ease yet i thought scarce so much sick of body as sick at heart and faint with fasting and sorrow at the end of the pallet sat a child something elder than iolande but a child still there was no form in the chamber but hilda brought forward an old box whereon she cast a clean apron praying me to sit and to pardon them that this should be the best they had to offer i sat me down making no matter thereof for in very deed i was full of pity for these poor creatures the mother as was but like took me for dame elizabeth and began to thank me for having paid my debtsat long last she might have said but afore i could gainsay it hilda saith warmly oh no mother this is not the lady that ought the money madame here is goodso good and that ladyshe has no heart in her i think not very good hilda said i laughing when i fell on the dame that ought thee the money and fairly wrenched it from her whether she would or no howbeit i continued to the poor woman i will be good to you if i can by bits and scraps i pulled her story forth of her mouth it was no uncommon tale a sickly wife and a selfish husbanda deserted struggling wife and motherand then a penniless widow with no friends and poor health that could scant make shift to keep body and soul together whether for herself or the children the husband had come home at last but to be a burden and sorrowto be nursed through a twelve months sickness and then to die and what with the weariness and lack of all comfort the poor widow fell sick herself soon after and hilda the young maid had kept matters agoing as best she might ever sithence i comforted the poor thing to my little power told her that i would give hilda some work to do and pay her for it and that i would come and see her by times whilst the queen should abide in paris but that when she went away must i go likewise and it might be all suddenly that i could not give her to wit hilda had sent the children forth to buy food and there were but her and her mother mine husband was longer in return than i looked for my maid said i to hilda prithee tell me a thing what didst thou signify by saying to thyself right as we set forth from the palace that god must have heard thee a great wave of colour passed over her face and neck dame she said i will speak soothliness it was partly because i had prayed for money to buy food and physic but partly also because i was afraid of something and i had asked the good god to keep it away from me when you said that you and messire would condescend to come with me it delivered me from my fear the good god must have heard me for nobody else knew afraid said i whereof my maid was it the porters great dog he is a gentle beast as may be and would never touch thee what could harm thee in the queens palace the wave of colour came again madame does not know she said in a low voice there are men worse than brutes but such great ladies do not see it one stayed me and spoke to me the night afore i was afraid he might come again and there was no one to help me but the good lord so i called to him to be my guard for there was none else and i think he sent two of his angels with me mine own eyes were full no less than hildas may the good lord guard thee ever poor maid said i but in very sooth i am far off enough from an angel here cometh one something nearer theretofor i heard jacks voice without but tell me dost thou know who it was of whom thou wert afraid i only know she said that his squire bare a blue and white livery guarded in gold i heard not his name verily said i to myself such gentlemen be fair company for dame isabel the queen for i could have no doubt that poor hildas enemy was that bad man sir roger de mortimer howbeit i said no more for then oped the door and in came jack with a lad behind bearing a great basket jacks own arms were full of fardels parcels which he set down in a corner of the chamber and bade the lad empty the basket beside which was charged with firewood there saith he they be not like to want for a day or twain poor souls come away sissot we have earned a nights rest messire cried the faint voice of the poor woman messire is good as an angel from heaven but surely messire has not demeaned himself to carry burdensand for us she seemed nearhand frightened at the thought nay good woman saith jack merrilyno more than the angel that carried the cruse of water for the prophet elias welladay securely i can carry a fardel without tarnishing my spurs i would i might never do a worse deed amen said i for both of us we bade the woman and hilda good even and went forth followed by blessings till we were in the very street and not till then would i say jack thou art the best man ever lived but i would thou hadst a little more care for appearances suppose sir edmund or master de oxendon had seen thee well saith jack as calm as a pool in a hollow suppose they had why then should they have laughed thee to scorn suppose they did jack dost thou nothing regard folks thoughts of thee certes i regard thine full diligently but other folks that be nought to thee i would say if the folks be nought to me wherefore should the thoughts be of import securely good wife but very little i shall sleep the sweeter for those fardels and i count i should sleep none the worser if man laughed at me the blessing of the poor and the blessing of the lord be full apt to go together and dost thou reckon i would miss thatyea so much as one of themout of regard for that which is saith solomon sonitum spinarum sub olla ecclesiastes chapter seven verse ha jolife let the thorns crackle away prithee they shall not burn long jack said i thou art the best man ever lived rhyme on my fair trouvere quoth he troubadour their lays were usually legends and fictitious tales but sissot to speak sooth i will tell thee if thou list to hearken what it is keepeth my steps from running into many a byway and mine heart from going astray after many a flower sown of satan in my path do tell me jack said i there be few days in my life saith he that there cometh not up afore mine eyes that bar whereat i shall one day stand and that book out of the which all my deeds shall be read afore men and angels and i have some concern for the thoughts of them that look on that day rather than this many a timeay many a time twice toldin early morn or in evening twilight have i looked up into heaven and the thought hath swept oer me like a fiery breezewhat if our lord be coming this minute dost thou reckon sissot that man to whom such thoughts be familiar friends shall be oft found sitting in the alebooth or toying with frothy vanities i trow not but jack cried i letting all else drop is that all real to thee real sissot there is not another thing as real in life i burst forth i could not help it o jack jack dont go and be a monk go and be a monk saith jack with an hearty laugh why wife what bees be in thine hood i thought i was thine husband so thou art the saints be thanked said i but thou art so good i am sore afraid thou wilt either die or be a monk ill not be a monk i promise thee quoth he i am not half good enough nor would i lose my sissot as to dying be secure i shall not die an hour afore gods will is and the lord hath much need of good folks to keep this bad world sweet i reckon we may be as good as we can with reasonable safety ill try if thou wilt so i did and yet do but i shall never be match to jack well by this time we had won back to the queens lodging and at foot of degrees i bade goodnight to jack being that night appointed to the palleta business i never loved i was thinking on jacks last words as i went up and verily had for the nonce forgat that which went afore when all at once a voice saith in mine ear well dame cicely went you forth in such haste lest you should be clapped into prison for stealing good lack but mine hearts in my mouth yet were you wood mad or what ailed you dame elizabeth said i as all came back on me i have been to visit hildas mother dear heart and what found you was she asupping on goose and leeks that make o folks do alway feign to be as poor as job when their coffers be so full the lid cannot be shut you be young dame cicely and know not the world maybe said i but if you will hearken me i will tell you what i found go to then saith she as she followed me into our chamber whateer you found you left me too poor to pay the jeweller i would fain have had a sapphire pin more than i got but your raid on my purse disabled me thereof the rogue would give me no credit hear but my tale said i and if when it be told you regret your sapphire pin i beseech you say so so i told her in plain words neither minishing nor adding how i had found them and the story i had heard from the poor woman she listened cool enough at first but ere i made an end the water stood in her eyes ha chetife said she when i stayed me ill pay the maid another time trust me dame cicely i believed not a word if you had been cheated as oft verily i am sorry i sent not man to see how matters stood with them well i am fain you gave her the money after all but trust me you took my breath away and my own belike said i i think hilda and hers stood not in much want the rest of that winter but whenever she came with work for me either margaret my maid or jacks old groom a sober man and an ancient walked back with her meantime sir roger de mortimer played first viol in the court minstrelsy up and yet higher up he crept till he could creep no further as i writ a few leaves back on the eve of saint pancras was crowned the new queen of france in the abbey of saint denis which is to france as westminster abbey to us and there ramped my lord of mortimer in the very suite of the queen herself and in my lord of chesters own livery twicebanished traitor he appeared in the self presence of the king that had banished him and of the wife of his own natural prince to whom he had done treason of the deepest dye and not one voice said him nay thus went matters on till the beginning of september the queen abode at paris the king of france made no sign our kings trusty messager donald de athole came and went with letters and if it were not one of his letters the queen dropped into the brasier right as i came one day into her chamber i marvel greatly but nought came forth that we her ladies heard on the even of the fifth of september early came sir john de ostrevant to the palace and had privy speech of the queennone being thereat but her confessor and dame isabel de lapyoun and he was scarce gone forth when as we sat in our chamber awork the queen herself looked in and called dame elizabeth forth i thought nought of it i turned down hem and cut off some threads and laid down scissors and took up my needle to thread afreshin the hotel de saint pol at paris and that needle was not threaded but in the abbey of saint edmunds bury in suffolk twenty days after yet if man had told me it should so be i had felt ready to laugh him to scorn ah me what feathers we be that a breath from god almighty can waft hither or thither at his will never but that once did i see dame elizabeth to burst into a chamber and when she so did i was in such amaze thereat that i fair gasped to see it good lack cried i and stared on her well may you say it quoth she lay by work all of you and make you ready privily in all haste for journeying by night lose not a moment mary love us cries isabel de la helde whither whither the queens will is hold your tongues and make you ready we lay that nightand it was not till latein the town of sessouns in the same lodging the queen had before at master john de gyses house the next night we lay at peronne and the third we came to ostrevant dame isabel told us the reason of this sudden flight the queen had heard that her brother the king of francewho for some time past had been very cool and distant towards herhad a design to seize upon her and deliver her a prisoner to king edward and sir john of hainault count of ostrevant who came to bring her this news offered her a refuge in his castle of ostrevant i believed this tale when dame isabel told it i have no faith in it now what followed did away entirely therewith and gave me firm belief that it was nothing save an excuse to get away in safety and without the king of frances knowledge be it how it may sir roger de mortimer came with her we were not many days at ostrevant only long enough for the count to raise his troops and then when all was ready the queen embarked for england on the nd of september we came ashore at orwell and had full ill lodging none having any shelter save the queen herself for whom her knights ran up a shed of driftwood hung oer with carpets never had i so discomfortous a nightthe sea tossing within a few yards and the wind roaring in mine ears and the spray allto beating over me as i lay on the beach lapped in a mantle i was well pleased the next morrow when the queen whose rest had been little gave command to march forward to bury but afore we set forth come nearhand an army of peasants into the presence plaining of the queens officers that had taken their cows chickens and fruits and paid not a penny the queen had them all brought afore her and with her own hands haled forth the money due to each one bidding them bring all oppressions to her own ears and straitly commanding her officers that they should take not so much as an egg without payment by this means she won all the common people to her side and they were ready to set their lives in pledge for her truth and honour at that time i was but little aware how matters verily stood i said to dame joan de vaux that the queen showed her goodness herebyfor though i knew the mortimer by then to be ill man i wist not that she knew it and reckoned her yet as innocent and beguiled woman doth she so answered dame joan how many grapes may man gather of a bramble nay said i scarce perceiving her intent but very grapes come not of brambles soothly saith she neither do very brambles bear grapes three days the queen tarried at bury then with banners flying she marched on toward essex i thought it strange that even she should march with displayed banners seeing the king was not of her company but i reckoned she had his order and was acting as his deputy elsewise had it been dread treason note even in her i was confirmed in my thought when my lord of lancaster the kings cousin and my lord of norfolk the kings brother came to meet her and joined their troops to her company and yet more when the archbishop of dublin and the bishops of hereford lincoln and ely likewise joined them to her verily such holy men could not countenance treason truth enough but that which was untrue was not the treason but the holiness of these caiaphases and now began that woeful dolorous way which our lord king edward trod after his master christ but who knoweth whither a strange road shall lead him until he be come to the end thereof i wis well that many folk have said unto usjack and mesince all things were made plain how is it ye saw not aforetime and wherefore followed ye the queen thus long they saw not aforetime no more than we but now that all is open up come they with wagging heads and snorkilling noses andverily we were sore to blame for not seeing through the mist the mist through the which when it lay thick no man saw ha chetife i could easily fall to prophesying myself when all is over could we have seen what lay at the end of that dolorous way should any true and loyal man have gone one inch along it and who was like to think till he did see what an adder the king nursed in his bosom most men counted her a fair white dove all innocent and childlike that did i not i did see far enough for all the mist to see she was no child in that fashion yet children love mischief well enough betimes and i counted her if not white but greynot the loathly black fiend that she was at the last seen to be i saw many a thing i loved not many a thing i would not have done in her place many a thing that i but half conceived and feared to be ill deedbut there ended my seeing i thought she was caught within the meshes of a net and i was sorry she kept not thereout but i never guessed that the net was spread by her own hands my mother dame alice de lethegreve i think saw clearer than i did but it was by reason she loved moreloved him who became the sacrifice not the miserable sinner for whose hate and wickedness he was sacrificed so soon as king edward knew of the queens landing which was by michaelmas eve at latest he put forth a proclamation to all his lieges wherein he bade them resist the foreign horde about to be poured upon england only three persons were to be received with welcome and honour which was the queen herself edward her son his father in his just ire named him not his son neither as earl of chester and the kings brother the lord edmund of kent i always was sorry for my lord of kent he was so full hoodwinked by the queen and never so much as guessed for one moment that he acted a disloyal part he was a noble gentleman a kindly and a generous not maybe the wisest man in the realm and something too prone to rush after all that had the look of a noble deed ere he gave himself time enough to consider the same but if the world held no worser men at heart than he it were marvellous better world than now one other thing did king edward which showed how much he had learned he offered a great price of one thousand pounds about pounds according to modern value for the head of the mortimer and no sooner did the queen hear thereof than she offered doublenamely two thousand poundsfor the head of sir hugh le despensera man whose little finger was better worth two thousand than the mortimers head was worth one two days later the king fortified the tower and appointed the lord john of eltham governor thereof but he being only a child of ten years the true governor was the lady alianora la despenser who was left in charge of the kings said son and two days afore saint francis october nd he left the tower and set forth toward wallingford leaving the bishop of exeter to keep the city truly a thankless business for never could any man yet keep the citizens of london nor could he for a fortnight was not over ere they rose in insurrection against the kings deputies invested the tower wrenched the keys from the constable john de weston to whom the lady alianora had confided them brought her out with the young lord and carried them to the wardrobenot without honourand then returning they seized on the bishop with two of his squires and strake off their heads at the standard in chepe and this will i say for the said bishop though he were not alway pleasant to deal withal for he was very furnishyet was he honest man and loved his master ay and held to him in days when it was little profit so to do and seeing how few honest men there be that will hold on to the right when their profit lieth to the left that is much to say with the king went sir hugh le despenseri mean the younger that was create earl of gloucester by reason of his marriage for the lady alianora his wife was eldest of the three sisters that were coheirs of that earldom and thereanentwelladay how different folks do from that i should do in their place i can never tell wherefore when man doth ill the penalty thereof should be made to run over on his innocent sons because sir hugh forfeited the earldom wherefore passed it not to his son that was loyal man and true and one of the kings best councillors all his life on the contrary part it was bestowed on sir hugh de audley that wedded the lady margaret widow of sir piers de gavaston that stood next of the three coheirs and it seemeth me scarce just that sir hugh de audley that had risen up against king edward of old time and been prisoned therefor and was at best but a pardoned rebel should be singled out for one of the finest earldoms in england and not sir hugh le despenser whose it was of right and to whose chargesave the holding of the castle of caerphilly against queen isabel which was in very loyalty to his true lord king edwardno fault at all could be laid i would i had but the world to set right then should there be justice done and every wrong righted and all crooked ways put straight and every man and woman made happy dear heart what fair and good world were this when i had made an end of did man laugh behind me jack soothly i thought it must be thou what moveth thy laughter dame cicely de chaucombe saith he essaying to look soberwhich he managed but ill the annals of cicely likewise and the imaginings of cicely in especial well what now mispayeth displeases thee quoth i there was once man saith jack thought as thou dost and seeing that the hollyhocks in his garden were taller than the daisies he bade his gardener with a scythe cut short the hollyhocks that all the flowers should be but of one height well what happed said i why next day were there no hollyhocks and then the hollyhock stems and the daisies both laid plaint of the gardener both said i both they alway do but what plaint had the daisies to offer why that they had not been pulled up to the height of the hollyhocks be sure but how could they so miscontent hath no can in his hornbook not what thou canst but what he would is his measure of justice but justice is justice said inot what any man would but what is fair and even veriliest but what is fair and even if thou stand on wills haw hillock the oak on thy right hand is the largest tree if thou stand on dicks it shall be the beech on thy left and thine ellwand reacheth not how then to measure but i would be on neither side said i but right in the midst so should i see even right in the midst good wife is where god standeth and few men win there there be few matters whereof man can see both to the top and to the bottom mostly if man see the one end then he seeth not the other and that which man seeth not how shall he measure without thou lay out to follow the judge which said that he would clearly man should leave to harry him with both sides of a matter so long as he heard but the plaintiff he could tell full well where the right lay but after came the defendant and put him all out that he wist not on which side to give judgment maybe judge sissot should sit on the bench alongside of him now jack said i thou laughest at me good discipline for thee sweetheart saith he and of lesser severity than faulting thee but supposing the world lay in thine hands to set right and even that thou hadst the power thereto how long time dost think thy work should abide ha chetife cried i i neer bethought me of that the world was set right once quoth jack by means of cold water and well washed clean therein but it tarried not long as thou wist sin was not washed away and satan was not drowned in the flood and very soon thereafter were they both awork again only one stream can wash the world to last and that floweth right from the rood on calvary yet there is enough said i to wash the whole world verily but how if the world will not come and wash he that willqui vultlet him take water of life freely but he that is not athirst for the holy water shall not have it forced down his throat against his will how shall man come by the thirst jack if he hath it not for if the gift shall be given only to him that thirsteth for it it seemeth me the thirst must needs be born ere we shall come for the water nay sweetheart we all desire happiness and wealth and honour the mistake is that we be so ready to slake our thirst at the pools of muddy water which abound on every hand rather than go to the fount of living water we grasp at riches and honours and pleasures of this life lo here the blame in that we are all athirst for the muddy pool and have no desire for the holy waterfor the gold of the royal mint stamped with the kings image for the crown of everlasting life for the bliss which shall endure unto all ages we cry soothly for these things but it is aswhasay give me happiness but let it end early give me seeming gold but let it be only tinsel give me a crown but be it one that will fade away like a babe that will grip at a piece of tin whereon the sun shineth and take no note of a golden ingot that lieth by in shadow but who doth such things jack thou and i sissot unless christ anoint our eyes that we see in sooth jack cried i all suddenly as i have full many times told thee thou art better man than many a monk now scornest thou at me saith he how can i be perfect that am wedded man note thou wist well enough that perfect men be only found among the contemplative not among them that dwell in the world yet soothly i reckon man may dwell in the world and love christ or he may dwell in cloister and be none of his well i know not how that may be but this do i know that never was there any jack even to my jack and i am sore afraid that if i ever win into heaven i shall never be able to see jack for he shall be ten thousand mile nearer the throne than i cicely am ever like to be note at this time it was high treason for any subject to march with banners displayed unless he acted as the kings representative by his distinct commission note the best men then living looked on the life of idle contemplation as the highest type of christian life to which no married man could attain part one chapter the glamour of the queen hast thou beheld thyself and couldst thou stain so rare perfection even for love of thee i do profoundly hate thee lady elizabeth carew so i was got into the annals of cicely was i well then have back dear heart but what a way have i to go back ere i can find where i was in my story well the king left the tower for wallingford and with him sir hugh le despenser and hugh his young son archdeacon baldok edward de bohun the kings nephew and divers of his following i know not whether he had with him also his daughters the young ladies alianora and joan or if they were brought to him later by saint denis eve october th he had reached wallingford the queen was in march to london but hearing that the king had left she altered her course and went to oxford there tarried we one day and went to our duties in the church of saint martin note where an homily was preachen by my lord of hereford note and a strange homily it was wherein eva our mother stood for the queen and i suppose adam for the king and sir hugh le despenser save the mark was the serpent i stood it out but i will not say i goxide gaped not the next day went the queen on toward gloucester pursuing the king which had been there about ten days afore her she put forth from wallingford on her way between oxford and gloucester a letter wherein she earnestly prayed the king to return and promised that he should receive the government with all honour if he would conform him to his people i had been used to hear of the people obeying the king as in duty bound to him whom god had set over them and this talk of the king obeying the people was marvellous strange to mine ears howbeit it was talk only for what was really meant was that he should conform himself to his wife and considering how much wives be bidden of god to obey their lords that surely was as ill as the other which the king saw belike for instead of coming nearer he went further away right over the severn and strengthened himself first in the strong castle of chepstow and after in the castle of caerphilly for us we went on though not so quick as he to gloucester and thence to bristol where sir hugh de despenser the father was governor and where the citizens on the queens coming opened the gates to her and sir hugh on perceiving it retired into the castle but she summoned the castle also to surrender which was done speedily of the officers and sir hugh delivered into her hands moreover the two little ladies the kings daughters whom he had sent from gloucester on his retreat across the severn were brought to her note and she welcomed them motherly or at least seemed to do so wala wa i have no list to set down what followed and will run by the same as short as shall serve truth the morrow of saint crispin namely the th day of october the queen and her son now duke of aquitainewhom man whilome called earl of chestercame into the great hall of bristol castle and sat in state i cicely being behind the queens chair and jack in waiting on my lord the duke which done they called council of the prelates and nobles of the realm being the archbishop of dublin and five bishops the kings two brothers my lords of norfolk and kent my lord of lancaster their cousin and all the nobles then present in bristol town thus they gathered the duke on the right hand of the throne and the queen on the left the throne all empty then a marvellous strange thing happened for the queen rose up and spake in open council to the prelates and nobles of england when she first arose as afterwards i heard say were there some murmurs that a woman should so speak and divers up and down the hall rowned whispered one the other in the ear that it had been more seemly had she kept to her distaff but when she ended so great was the witchery of her fair face and the gramary magic of her silver voice that scarce man was in the hall but was ready to live and die with her ha chetife how she witched the world yet never did she witch me how can it be i marvel at times that menand women toowill suffer themselves to be thus led astray and yet follow on oft knowing whither they go after some one man or woman that casteth over them a manner of gramary there be some that can witch whom they will that god keepeth not and tis not alway a fair face that witcheth i have known full unbright plain ugly folks that have this charm with them and i note moreover that many times he that wields it doth use it for evil and not for good i dare not say no good man ever hath the same for securely i know not all folks in this world yet of them i do know i cannot call to mind a verily good man or woman that hath seemed me to possess this power over his fellows i have known some metely good folk that had a touch thereof but of such as i mean that do indeed wield it in power and draw all manner of men to them and after them nearhand whether they choose or noof such i cannot call to mind one that was true follower of our lord therefore it seems me an evil power and one that may come of satan sith it mostly is used in his service and i pray god neither of my daughters may ever show the same for at best it must be full of peril of pride to him that possesseth it indeed had it so been i think they should have shown it afore now but now to have back to the hall of bristol castle lest jack coming in to look stealthily over my shoulder as he doth betimes should say i have won again into the annals of cicely well all the prelates and nobles were full witched by dame isabel the queen and agreed unto all her plans the which came ready cut and dried as though all had been thought on and settled long afore verily i dare say it so had first they elected the duke of aquitaine to the regencywhich of course was the self thing as electing his mother since he being a mere lad was but her mouthpiece and was buxom submissive unto her in all things and all present sware to fulfil his pleasure as though he had been soothly king under his privy seal for there was no seal meet for the regency and incontinent immediately thereafter the said duke speaking doubtless the pleasure of the queen commanded sir hugh le despenser the father to be brought to his trial in the hall of the castle then was he led in an old whitehaired man see note in appendix on the despensers stately and venerable who stood up before the council as i would think none save innocent man should do and looked the queen straight in the face he was not witched with her gramary and soothly i count in all that hall he was the sole noble that escaped the spell a brave man was he of great probity prudent in council valiant in war maybe something too readily swayed by other folks the queen except where he loved them which he did not her and from this last point came all his misfortunes note now stood he up to answer the charges laid against him whereof there were nine but answer such as man looked for made he none he passed all by as of no account and went right to the heart and verity of the whole matter i could not but think of a prisoner before him who had answered nothing and i crede he knew that in like case per invidiam tradidissent eum note moreover he spake not to them that did the will of other but to her that was at the core of the whole matter ah dame quoth he bowing low his white stately head god grant us fair trial and just judge and if we may not find it in this world we look for it in another i trust he found it in that other worldnay i know he must have done but in this world did he not find it fair trial had he none it was an end foregone from the beginning and as to just judgewell she is gone now to her judgment and i will leave her there i had forgot to say in due order that my lord of arundel was he that was tried with him but he suffered not till later this appears to be the case from comparison of the best authorities he therefore was had back to prison but sir hugh was hung on the common gallows in his coat armour in strong cords and when he was cut down after four days his head was struck off and his quarters cast to the dogs on whose soul god have mercy amen in very deed i think he deserved a better fate secure am i that many men be hung on gallows which might safely be left to die abed and many more die abed that richly demerit the gallows this world is verily acrooked i reckon it shall be smoothed out and set straight one day there be that say that day shall last a thousand years and soothly taking into account all the work to be done ere the eve droppeth it were small marvel an it did so this done we tarried not long at bristol less than a month thereafter was the king taken at neath abbey in wales and all that yet obeyed him were either taken with him or dispersed the news found the queen at hereford whither she had journeyed from bristol and if i had yet a doubt left touching her very nature real character i think it had departed from me when i beheld how she received that news sir thomas le blount his steward of the household was he that betrayed him and may god pardon him easier than i could but my lord of lancaster whom i can pray god pardon with true heart seeing he afterward repented bitterly the lord zouche of ashby and rhys ap howelthese were they that took him with him they took three othersir hugh le despenser the son and archdeacon baldok and sir simon de reading the good archdeacon that was elect bishop is understood of norwich was delivered over to the tender mercies which as saith the psalmist were cruel of that priest of baal the bishop of hereford whom indeed i cannot call a priest of god for right sure am i that god should never have owned him if that a man serveth be whom he worshippeth then was sir adam de orleton bishop of hereford priest of sathanas and none other the king was had to kenilworth castle in ward of my lord of lancastera good though mistaken man that used him not ungently yet kept him straitly sir hugh and sir simon were brought to the queen at hereford and i was in waiting when they came into her presence i had but one glimmer of her face being behind her when she turned her head for a moment to bid me send oliver de nantoil to fetch my lord of lincoln to the presence but if ever i beheld pictured in human eyes the devilish passions of hate malice and furious purpose i beheld them that minute in those lovely eyes of hers ay they were lovely eyes they could gleam soft as a doves when she would and they could shoot forth flames like a lioness robbed of her prey never saw i those eyes look fiercer nor eviller than that night when sir hugh le despenser stood a captive at her feet for him he was full calm stately as his fatherhe was comelier of the twain yea the goodliest man ever mine eyes lit on but i thought not on that in that hour his chief fault man deemed was pride not the vanity that looketh for applause of man but rather the loftymindedness that is sufficient to himself and despiseth other i beheld no trace thereof as he there stood all that had beenall that was of earth and earthyseemed to have dropped away from him he was calm and tranquil as the sea on a summer eve when not a breath stirreth wala wa we have all our sins and what be we to throw the sins of another in his face sir hugh did some ill deeds belike and so god wot hath done cicely de chaucombe and whose sins of the twain were worser in his sight he knoweth not i verily it was whispered that he had taint of heresy the evillest thing that may be but i trust that dread charge were untrue and that he was but guilty of somewhat more pride and ambitious desires than other soothly pride is one of the seven deadly sins pray god save us all therefromyet is heresy as the church teacheth an eighth deadlier than all the seven and if holy church hath the words of god and is alonely guided of his spirit then must it be an awful and deadly sin to gainsay her bidding there be that take in hand to question the same whom holy church condemneth i cicely cannot presume to speak thereof not being a priest unto whom alone it appertaineth to conceive such matter tis true there be that say lay folk can as well conceive and have as much right as any priest but holy church agreeth not therewith god be merciful to us all whereinsoever we do err but now was the queen in a sore strait for that precious treasure that had once been in her keepingto wit the great sealwas no longer with her the king had the same and she was fain to coax it forth of his keeping the which she did by means of my said lord of hereford i know not if it were needful but until she had this done did not sir hugh le despenser suffer it was at hereford the eve of saint katherine that he died i thank the saints i was not there but i heard dread stories of them that were dame isabel de lapyoun was in waiting that day i think she was fittest for it i ween it was on that morrow of the eve of saint katherine that mine eyes first began to ope to what the queen was in very deed wherefore was she present at that deed of blood dame tiffany reckoned she deemed it her duty and truly to behold what man can deem his duty is of the queerest things in this queer world i never knew a cow that reckoned it duty to set her calf in peril and herself tarry thereout nor a dog that forsook his masters company by reason of his losing of worldly gear nor an horse that told falsehoods to his own profit i have wist men that would do all these things and more because forsooth it was their duty now after what manner it could be duty to dame isabel the queen to preside in her own person at the execution of sir hugh that cannot i cicely tell nay the saints love us what need was there of an execution at all sir hugh was dying fast since he was taken would he never open his lips neither to speak nor yet to eat and that eve of saint katherine had seen his end had they left him die in peace veriliest i wis not what he had done so much worser than other men that so awesome an ensample should be made of him i do trust the rumour was not true that ran of his heresy for if so then must not man pity him and yet virgo sanctissima what is heresy the good lord wot my lord of lincoln was he as i heard which brought tidings to the queen that sir thomas wager had done him to wit sir hugh would die that day would diewhether man would or no holy mary the pity of it had i been sir thomas never word would i have spoken till the breath was clean gone out of him and then if man coveted vengeance let him take it on the silent dust but no sooner was it known to the queento her a woman and a motherthan she gave command to have the scaffold run up with all speed and that dying man drawn of an hurdle through the city that all men might behold with trumpets going afore and at last hanged of the gallows till he were dead oh the pity of it the pity of it the command was obeyedso far as man could obey but ere the agony were full over god almighty stepped in and bare him away from what she would have had him suffer when they put him on the hurdle he lay as though he wist not when they twined a crown of nettles and pressed it on his brow he was as though he felt not when the torture over they made ready to drag him to the gallows they saw that he was dead god cried to them let be god assoil that dead man ay maybe he shall take less assoiling than hath done that dead woman man said that when my lord of lincoln came to tell her of this matter she was counting the silver in my lord of arundel his bags that were confiscate and had then been brought to her and but a few days later at marcle sir william de blount brought from the king the great seal in its leathern bag sealed with the privy seal and delivered it unto the queen and her keeper chancellor the bishop of norwich soothly it seemed to me as though those canvas bags that held my lord of arundels silver and the white leathern bag that held the great seal might be said to be tied together by a lace dipped in blood and somewhat later when we had reached woodstock was sir hugh le despensers plate brought to the wardrobe that had been in the tower with the lady alianora his wifefive cups and two ewers of silver and twentyseven cups and six ewers of gold and his horses and hers delivered into the keeping of adam le ferrour keeper of the queens horses and his servants either cast adrift or drafted some of them into the household of the lord john of eltham go to saith man was all this more than is usual in like case verily nay but should such things be usual in christendom was it for this our lord came to found his churchthat christian blood should thus treat his christian brother and if no what can be said of such as called themselves his priests and passed by on the other sidenay rather took into their own hands the arrows of sathanas and wounded their brother with their own fingers numquid adhaeret tibi sedes iniquitatis psalm verse might it not have been said to dame isabel the queen like as moses said to korah is it nothing to you that you have been joined to the king and set by his side on the throne and given favour in his eyes so that he suffereth you to entreat him oftener and more effectually than any other but you must needs covet the royal throne theself itself ah what good to write such words or to speak them when man hath no fear of god before his eyes what shall he regard the reasonings of men but the day of doom cometh and that sure the morrow of that awesome day to wit saint katherine departed we from hereford and came to gloucester and cirencester going back on the road we had come by woodstock where dame margery de verdon joined us from dover we came to wallingford where was the lord john of eltham that had come from london and awaited the queen his mother so by reading and chertsey came we to westminster palace on the fourth day of january and here was dame alice de lethegreve mine honoured mother whom i was full fain to see after all the long and somewhat weariful time that i had been away from england my mother would have me tell her all i had seen and heard in the which she oft stayed me by tears and lamentations and saith she i bid thee well to note cicely how much ill can come of the deeds of one woman deeds said i nay but of the thoughts and feelings for all deeds are but the flowers whereto mans thoughts be the seed and forget not daughter that there must ever be one first thought that is the beginning of it all o cis take thou heed of the first evil thought in thine heart and pray god it lead not to a second they that fear not god be prone to ask what matter for thoughts deeds be the things that signify my thoughts are mine own who shall govern me therein ah verily who shall without god doth and thou dost he that makes conscience of his thoughts men reckon a great saint i would say rather he that maketh not conscience of his thoughts cannot serve god at all pray god rule thee in thine innermost heart then shall thy deeds please him and thy life shall be a blessing to thy fellows dame said i would you signify that the queen is not ruled of god he governeth better than so cis saith she yet is she christian woman quoth i a christian woman made answer my mother is a woman that followeth christ and thou followest not jack cis when thou goest along one road and jack goeth another man may follow near or far but his face must be set the same way christs face was ever set to do the will of god if thou do thy will and i do mine our faces be set contrary then must we turn us around said i ay and flat round too she saith when thou standest without aldgate ready to pass within tis but a full little turn shall take thee up to shoreditch on the right hand or down blanche chappleton on the left thy feet shall be set scarce an inch different at beginning yet pursue the roads and the one shall land thee at york and the other at sandwich many a man hath reckoned he set forth to follow christ whose feet were scarce an inch out of the way go to quoth he what can an inch matter what difference shall it make ah me it maketh all the difference between heaven and hell for the steps lead to diverse roads be well assured of the right road and when thou so art take heed to walk straight therein many a man hath turned a score out of the way by reason that he walked acrooked himself do we know alway when we walk straight said i thou hast thy psalter and thine evangelisterium made she answer and thou hast god above make good use of the guide and the map and thou art not like to go far astray and god pardon the souls that go astray ay god forgive us all she sat and span a while and said nought cicely then quoth she i shall not abide here whither go you dame like abraham of old she saith to the land which god shall show me if i could serve my dear masterthe lad that once lay in mine armsby tarrying hither i could bear much for his sake but now can i do nought and soothly i feel as though i could not bear to stand and look on i can pray for him any whither cicely this will go on man that setteth foot on slide shall be carried down it thou mayest choose to take or let be the first step but ofttimes thou canst not choose touching the second and all that be to follow or if thou yet canst choose it shall be at an heavy cost that thou draw back thy foot one small twinge may be all the penalty today when an hours deadly anguish shall not pay the wyte tomorrow thou lookest on me aswhasay what mean you by this talk i mean dear heart that she which hath entered on this road is like to pursue it to the bitter end a bitter end it shall benot alone to her it means agony to him and all that love him what maimer of agony god wot and in his hand is the ellwand to measure and the balances to weigh lord thou wilt not blunder to give an inch too much nor wilt thou for all our greeting weigh one grain too little thou wilt not let us miss the right way for the rough stones and the steep mountainside thou hast trodden before us every foot of that weary road and we need but to plant our steps in thy footmarks which we know well from all others by their bloodmarked track o blessed jesu christ it is fair journeying to follow thee and thou leadest thy sheep safe to the fold of the holy land i mind her words well for woe is me they were nearhand the last that ever i heard of her dame said i do you bid me retreat belike nay daughter quoth she and smiled thou art no longer at my bidding ask thine husband child so i told jack what my mother had said he sat and meditated thereon afore the fire while i made ready my christmas gown of blue kaynet guarded with stranling note sissot saith he his meditation ended i think dame alice speaks wisely then wouldst thou depart the court jack said i i nay sweet heart the young king hath about him no more true men than he needeth and as i wait at his coucher betimes i can drop a word in his ear that may an it please god be to his profit he is yet tender ground and the seed may take root and thrive and i am tough gnarled old root that can thole a blow or twain and a rough wind by now and then jack cried i laughing a tough gnarled old root belike thou art not yet of sevenandthirty years though i grant thee wisdom enough for seventy i thank you heartily dame cicely for that your courtesy quoth he and made me a low reverence ay dear heart a gnarled root of crossgrained elm fit for a yule log i bide with the king sissot but thou wist that sentence argument toucheth not thee if thou desire to depart with dame alice and maybe it should be the best for thee i depart from the court jack on a pillion behind thee said i and no otherwise i say not i might not choose to dwell elsewhere the rather if place were all that were in question but to win out of ill company at the cost of thy company were to be at heavier charge than my purse can compass and seeing i am in my duty therein i trust god shall keep me from evil and out of temptation amen saith jack and kissed me we will both pray my dear heart to be kept out of temptation but let us watch likewise that we slip not therein they be safe kept that god keepeth and seeing that not our selfwill nor folly but his providence brought us to this place i reckon we have a right to ask his protection thus it came that i tarried yet in the queens household and verily they that did so those four next years had cause to seek gods protection on the first of february wasbut wala wa my pen runneth too fast i must back nearhand a month it was the seventh of january being the morrow of the epiphany and three days after we reached westminster that the queen met the kings great council the which she had called together on the eve of saint barbara december rd the duke sitting therein in state as keeper of the kingdom having opened the said parliament the duke by his spokesmen my lords of hereford and lincoln laid before them all that had taken place since they last met and bade them deliberate on what was now to be done for the safety of the realm and church of england note who at once adjudged the throne void and the king to be put down and accounted such no longer appointing certain nobles to go with the duke to show these things unto the queen well do i mind that morrow of the epiphany the queen sat in the painted chamber spinning amongst us when the nobles waited upon her she had that morrow been full furnish sharply chiding joan de vilers but a moment ere the duke entered the presence but no sooner came he in than she was all honey dame saith he divers nobles of the council pray speech of you the queen looked up she sighed and her hand trembled then pulled she forth her sudary handkerchief and wiped her cheek i am somewhat unsure of the tears thereon yet maybe they were there for verily she could weep at will dame elizabeth that sat in the casement saith to dame joan that was on the contrary side thereof i being by herwill the queen swoon think you she will come to an she do answered she i was ready at one time to reckon dame joan de vaux somewhat hard toward the queen i saw later that she had but better sight than her neighbours then came in the prelates and nobles which were deputed of the parliament to convey the news and the queen bowed her head when they did reverence my lord of winchester it was that gave her the tidings that the parliament then sitting had put down king edward and set up the duke which there stood as king all innocent stood he that had been told it was his fathers dearest wish to be free of that burden of state and himself too true and faithful to imagine falsehood or unfaithfulness in her that spake it soothly she played her part full well she greet plenteously she wrung her hands she tare off the hood from her head she gripped her hair as though to tear that yea she cast her down alow on the rushes and swooned or made believe thereto the poor young duke was full alarmed and kneeling beside her he would have cast his arms about her but she thrust him away until at the last he arose and with mien full princely told the assembled nobles that he would never consent to that which so mispaid displeased distressed his dear mother without his father should himself command the same she came to it seemed me full soon thereafter then was sent my lord of lancaster and other to the king to hear his will thereon of these was my lord of hereford one and man said he spake full sharply and poignantly to the king which swooned away thereunder somewhat more soothly as i guess and the scene said man that told me was piteous matter howbeit the king gave full assent and resigned the crown to his son who was now to be king he that had so been being thenceforth named only sir edward of caernarvon this was the eve of saint agnes january th the twentieth year of the said king note better known as carfax the exact church is not on record but it was likely to be this note adam de orleton he and henry burghersh bishop of lincoln are the two bishops whom thomas de la moor king edwards squire brands as priests of baal and caiaphases note i have here given the version of events which seems best to reconcile the accounts of the chroniclers with the testimony of contemporary documents see appendix note this is the character sketched of him by de la moor to whom he was personally known note for envy they had delivered him matthew twentyseven verse note kennet a coarse welsh cloth trimmed with stranling the fur of the squirrel taken between michaelmas and christmas note the idea of some persons that the church of england began to exist at the reformation would have astonished the medieval reckoners according to the computation of the church of england who were accustomed to hear parliaments summoned to debate concerning the welfare of the kingdom and church of england the former notion is purely modern part one chapter the reign of king roger she is no sheep who goes walking with the wolf russian proverb and now were i inditing a very chronicle should i dip my quill next in the red ink and write in full great lettershere beginneth the reign of king edward of windsor the third after the conquest but to scribe soothliness i cannot do so for not for four years thereafter did he in verity begin to reign and what i should write if i writ truth should behere beginneth the reign of king roger de mortimer the first in england now here cometh an other matter i have noted when man setteth him up to do that whereto he was not born and hath not used himself he is secure to do the same with never so much more din and outrage extravagance than he to whom it cometh of nature if man be but a bedel herald crier he shall rowt shout like a lion the first day and a princes charetter charioteer shall be a full braver finer more showy man than the prince his master sir roger made a deal more bruit than ever the king himself that during all these four years was meek and debonair humble and gentle as though he abode his time he wrought what he would which was mostly ill and bare him like those of whom the psalmist speaketh that said our lips are of us who is our lord psalm rolles translation he held up but a finger and first the king and all else after followed along his path truly i fault not the king poor lad he was in evil case and might well enough have found hard to know the way he should go but i do fault them that might have oped his eyes and instead thereof as being smoother way chose to run after king mortimer with his livery on their backs how many of them knew the man thinkest saith jack that had come in while i writ the last piece jack cried i what to see him do that he did more in especial when his pride was bolned swollen pulled up by being create earl of marchwhen he had larger following than the king himself having nine score knights at his feet when he arose from the kings table ere the king stirred as though he were lord and master of all when he suffered the king to rise on his coming into the presence all meekly and courteously yet himself when the king entered kept his seat as he micht afore a servitor when he walked even with the king and sometimes afore him when he was wont to put him down and mock at him and make him a laughingstock i have heard him myself say to the kinghold thy peace lad and the king took it as sweetly as if he had been swearing of allegiance i have eyes in mine head my fair warrior and ears belike i saw so much as thoumaybe a little more since i was something oftener in my lords company than thou but thou sawest what he was said i so did i and sorry am i to have demerited the wrath of dame cicely de chaucombe for that i oped not the king my masters even nay jack i never meant thee i have somewhat more reverence for mine husband than so then art thou a very pearl amongst women most dames husbands find not much reverence stray their wayat least from that quarter i misdoubt if viviens husband ever picks up more than should lightly slip into his pocket sir james le bretun is not so wise as thou said i but what i meant jack was such as my lord of lancaster and my lord of kent and my lord of herefordwhy did never such as these tell the king sooth touching the mortimer as for my lord of hereford saith jack i reckon he was too busied feeling of his pulse and counting his emplastures and telling his apothecary which side of his head ached worser since the last draught of camomile and mallows sir edmund de mauley was wont to say he had a grove of aspens at pleshy for to make his own populion note and that he brake his fast o dragons blood and dyachylon emplasture touching that will i not say but i reckon he thought oftener on his tamarind drink than on the public welfare he might perchance have bestirred him to speak to the king had he heard that he had a freckle of his nose for to avise him to put white ointment thereon but scarce i reckon for so small a matter as the good government of the realm now jack said i alaughing my lord of kent went he forth was he that if he thought he had hurt the feelings of a caterpillar should have risen from his warm bed the sharpest night in winter to go and pray his pardon of his bare knees god assoil him loving and gentle soul he was all unfit for this rough world and the dust that sir roger cast up at his horseheels was in my lord of kents eyes as thick as any mans he could not have warned the king for himself lacked the warning then my lord of lancasterwhy not he he did ay at long last when two years had run wherefore not long ere that the dust trow was not in his eyes good wife no mans eyes are blinder than his which casts the dust into his own my lord of lancaster had run too long with the hounds to be able all suddenly to turn him around and flee with the hare soothly i know he met the queen on her landing and likewise had the old king in his ward but i reckon sissot there were wheels within wheels we need not judge my lord of lancaster he did his duty at last and mind thou between him and his duty to king edward the father stood his brothers scaffold which never man deserved richer not a doubt thereof but man may scarce expect his brother to behold it then said i my lord zouche of mortimerbut soothly he was cousin to the traitor jack i never could conceive how it came about that he ever wedded the lady alianora one of the enemies of her own husband and she herself set prisoner in his kinsmans keeping and to wed her gaolers cousin all against the kings pleasure and without his licencecanst solve the puzzle i can tell thee why he wed her as easy as say twice two be four she was coheir of the earldom of gloucester and his sword was nearhand his fortune then wherefore wed she him kittle ticklish delicate ground sissot for man to take on him to account for the doings of woman i might win a clap to mine ears as like as not now jack thou wist well i never demean me so unbuxomly tell me thy thought then i think saith he that the lady alianora la despenser was woman of that manner that fetch their souls from the vine they must have somewhat to lean on if an oak or a cedar be nigh good but if no why then a bramble will serve their turn the one thing that they cannot do is to stand alone there be not only women of this fashion there be like men but too many god help them poor weak souls the woman that could twine round the lord zouche the tendrils torn from sir hugh le despenser must have been among the very weakest of women it is sore hard said i to keep one from despising such weakness it is full hard soothly i know but one wayto keep very near to him that never spurned the weakest that prayed his help and that tholed weakness amidst other meeknesses humiliations by reason that it behoved him to resemble his brethren in all things and some of his brethren are very weak sissot when our daughters were babes i was wont to think thou lovedst better alice than vivien and i am nearhand secure that it was by reason she was the weaker of the twain and pave thee the more thought surely said i that alway holdeth good with a mother that the barne which most needeth care is the dearest jacks answer i knew came from holy writ as by him whom his mother blandisheth thus will i comfort you the sunday after the conversion of saint paul february st was the young king crowned in westminster abbey before the high altar by walter reynolds archbishop of canterbury that had been of old a great friend of king edward the father and was carried away like the rest by the glamour of the queen but his eyes were opened afore most other and he died of a broken heart for the evil and unkindness which himself had holpen the day of saint edmund of pontigny november th next thereafter also present were nine bishops the kings uncles and many nobles yea and queen isabel likewise that caused us to array her in great doole mourning and held her sudary at her eyes nearhand all the office service through and it was no craft for she could weep when it listed hersome women have that powerand her sudary was full wet when she returned from the abbey and the young king that was but then full fourteen years of age took oath as his father and all the kings had done afore him that he would confirm to the people of england the laws and the customs to them granted by the ancient kings of england his predecessors the rights and offerings of god and particularly the laws customs and liberties granted to the clergy and people by the glorious king saint edward his predecessor he sware belike to keep unto god and holy church unto the clergy and the people entire peace and concord to his power to do equal and true justice in all his judgments and discretion in mercy and truth to keep the laws and righteous customs which the commons of his realm should have elected auera estu are the rather singular words used and to defend and enforce them to the honour of god and to his power note six sennights we tarried at westminster but lackaday what a time had we at after all suddenly the queen gave order to depart thence she controlled all things and the king her son was but a puppet in her hands how did we trapes up and down all the realm to canterbury the first round apilgrimage to saint thomas then right up as far as york where we tarried a matter of five weeks then to durham which we had scarce reached ere we were aflight again this time to auckland and a bit into that end of yorkshire back again to durham then away to york and ten days later whisked off to nottingham there a fortnight off again to lincoln i guess well now what i wist not then the meaning of all this it was to let the young king from taking thought touching his father and all that had happed of late while he was cheerful and delectable full of enjoyment she let him be but no sooner saw she his face the least downfell cast down than she plucked him away and put turn to his thoughts by sending him some other whither it paid note for a time it was while we were at lincoln where we tarried from the morrow of holy cross to michaelmas eve september th to th that donald the scots messager came from the southern parts with tidings for some timedivers weeks certesafore that had the queen been marvellous unrestful and hard to serve that which liked her yesterday was all out this morrow and each matter man named for her plesance was worser than that had gone afore i was nearhand driven out of senses that very morrow so sharp irritable was she touching her array not a gown in her wardrobe would serve the turn and when at last she chose which she would don then were her hoods all awry and then would she have no hood but only a wimple of fair cloth of linen then gramercy such pains had we to find her a fillet this was too deep and that too narrow and this set with amethysts should ill fit with her gown of rosecolour and that wrought of lilyflowers should catch in her hair i wished me at the further end of the realm from lincoln ay a dozen times twice told at long last we gat her filleted and then came the mantle first dame elizabeth brought one of black cloth of stamford lined with fox fur no that served not then brought dame joan de vaux the fair mantle of cloth of velvet grey that i ever reckoned the fairest in the queens wardrobe guarded with black budge and wrought in embroidery of rosecolour and silver she waved it away as though the very sight noyed disgusted her then fetched isabel de la helde the ray mantle with corded ground of blue red and green and the queen chid her as though she had committed one of the seven deadly sins at the last in uttermost wanhope despair ran i and brought the ugsomest of all the corded olive green with border of grey and forsooth that would she have welladay but i was fain when we had her at last arrayed when the queen had left the chamber dame elizabeth cast her on the nearest bench and panted like a coursed hare deary deary me crieth she i would i were abed abed crieth isabel de la helde abed at five oclock of a morrow ay or rather i would i had never gat out gramercy but how fractious is the queen i counted we neer should have her donned she never spoke to me so sharp in her life saith isabel i tell you i am fair dogweary quoth dame elizabeth whatever hath took the queen saith joan de vilers foolish childre all of you saith old dame tiffany looking on us with a smile when man is fractious like to this with every man and every matter either he suffereth pain or else he hath some hidden anguish or fear that hath nought to do with the matter in hand tis not with you that my lady is wrathful there is something harrying her at heart and she hath not told me in hall during dinner i cast eyes from time to time on the queen and i could not but think dame tiffany spake sooth she looked fair haggard as though some bitter care were eating out her heart i never loved her as i said at the first but that morn i felt sorry for her sorry for her ah i soon knew what sore cause there was to be sorry to the very soul for some one else it was while we were sat at supper that donald came i saw him enter from the high table where i sat and i knew in an instant that he brought some fearsome tidings i lost him in the crowd at the further end and then mereworth one of the varlets of the kings chamber came all in haste up the hall with a face that had evil news thereon writ and sir john de ros that was then seneschal saw him and guessing as i think the manner of word he brought stepped down from the dais to meet him then in an other minute i saw donald brought up to the king and to the queen i watched them both as donalds news was told the young kings face grew ashen pale and he cried full dolefully dieu eit mercie the news troubled him sore and sure enough but the queens eyes that a moment before had been full of terror and untholemodness impatience shot out one flash of triumphant gladness and the next minute she had hidden her face in her sudary and was greeting as though her heart had broke i marvelled what tidings they could be that were tene grief to the king and blisfulhed happiness to the queen sir john de gaytenby the kings confessor was sat next to me at the table and to him i said father can you guess what manner of news donald de athole shall have brought ay daughter he made answer would i were in doubt you think i asked him and left him to fill up i think he saith in a low voice somewhat sorrowful of tone that god hath delivered from all labour and sorrow one of his servants that trust in him why that were nought to lament oer i was about to say but i stayed me when half through father you mean there is man dead we call it death saith sir john de gaytenbywe of this nether world that be ever in sickness and weariness in tene and in temptation know we what they call it which have forded the rubicon and stand safe on the pavement of the golden city multo magis melius saith the apostle philippians one verse much more better to dissolve and to be with christ and the colder be the waters man hath to ford the gladder and welcomer shall be the light of the golden city they were chill i cast no doubt and all the chiller for the hand that chilled them with how sharp thorns and briers god hath to drive some of his sheep but once in the fold there shall be time to forget them all when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee isaiah verse that is enough now we can stay us upon that promise till we come through and then there shall be no more need for him to be with us in tribulation since we shall reign with him for ever and ever old sir simon de driby came up behind us as the confessor ended have you guessed sir john our dread newsand you dame cicely i have guessed and i think rightly answered sir john for dame cicely i cannot say i shook mine head and sir simon told me sir edward of caernarvon is dead deadthe king the king no longer saith sir simon sorrowfully o sir simon cried i how died he god knoweth he made answer i misdoubt if man shall know or woman quoth sir john significantly the schoolmaster learned me that man includeth woman saith sir simon smiling full grimly he learned you not i reckon that woman includeth man saith sir john somewhat after the same manner ah woe worth the day sir simon fetched an heavy sigh well god forgive us all amen sir john made answer i think few men were in the realm that did not believe the kings death was murder but nought was done to discover the murderers neither to bring them to justice it was not until after the mortimer was out of the way that any such thing was done when so it was mandate was issued for the arrest of sir thomas de gournay constable of bristol castle and william de ocle that had been keepers of the king at berkeley castle what came of ocle know i not but sir thomas fled beyond seas to the kings dominions of spain note and was afterwards taken but he came not to trial for he died on the way and there were that said he knew too much to be permitted to make defence note the next thing that happed coming under mine eyes was the young kings betrothal and marriage the lady philippa of hainault that was our young queen came over to england late in that same year to wit the first of king edward and was married the eve of the conversion of saint paul the year of our lord after the computation of the church of england note very praisable lovely and fulbright beautiful was the said lady being sanguine of complexion of a full fair face and fair hair having grey grey cyen and rosen colour of her cheeks she was the same age as the king to wit fifteen years they were wed in york minster where hast reached to sissot saith jack that was sat by the fire as i was abending the tail of my y in york right to the kings wedding said i how many more skins o parchment shall i bring thee for to set forth the gowns dear heart cried i must i do that for all that were there prithee use thy discretion i wist not a woman could write a chronicle without telling of every gown that came in her way go thy ways jack said i securely if i set down the kings and the queens and thine and mine that shall serve well enough it should serve me verily quoth he marry i hope thou mindest what manner of raiment i had on for i ensure thee i do not a whit dost thou ever the morrow thereof said i nay i wis i must pluck that out of mine own memory the king then was donned of a robe of purple velvet with a pair of sotlars of cloth of gold of nakes silk the said velvet robe wrought with the arms of england of golden broidery the queen bare a robe of green cloth of velvet with a cape thereto guarded with miniver and an hood of miniver her hair falling full sweetly over from under her golden fillet sith she put not on her hood save to leave the minster and at the feast thereafter she ware a robe of cloth of samitelle red and grey with a tunic and mantle of the same note as for jack that was then clerk of the wardrobe note he ware a tabard of the kings livery the arms of france and england of mine own broidering and hosen of black cloth his hood being of the same i had on a gown of grey cloth of northampton guarded with gris and mine hood was of rosecolour say note lined with black velvet but over the inwards of the wedding must i not linger for much is yet to write the latter end of february was the lady la despenser loosed from the tower and in april was all given back to her all to wit that could be given her little children that the queen isabel had made nuns without any leave given save her own could come back to her never more i misdoubt if she lamented it greatly she was one from whom trouble and sorrow ran lightly like the water from a ducks back and i reckon she thought more on her second marriage which had place secretly about a year after her release than she ever did for her lost children and here may i say that those sisters coheirs of gloucester did ever seem to me the queerest mothers i wist the lady margaret audley gave up her little kate a sweet child she was to the ankerage at ledbury with scarce a sigh and the lady alianora of whom i write took but little thought for her maids at sempringham or i err i would not have given up my alice after that fashion and i did sore pity those little barnes of which the eldest was not seven years old folk said it was making of gift to god and was an holy and blessed thing soothly i marvel if god setteth store by such like gifts when men do but cast at his feet that whereof they would be rid the innermost sanctuary of the temple it seemeth me is scarce the fittest place to shoot rubbish and when the rubbish is alive if it be but vermin i cannot slack to feel compassion for it methinks the lady alianora felt it sorer trouble of the twain when she suffered touching certain jewels reported to be missing from the tower during her governance thereofverily a foolish charge as though the lady of gloucester should steal jewels howbeit she was fined twenty thousand pound for the which she rendered up her welsh lands with the manors of hanley and tewkesbury being the fairest and greatest part of her heritage the king allowed her to buy back the said lands if she should in one and the same day pay ten thousand marks howbeit one half the said fine was after remitted at the intercession of the lords and commons that autumn was the insurrection of my lord of lancasterbut a bit too soon for the time was not ripe but i reckon they knew not how longer to bear the ill thewis manners conduct of the mortimer which ruled every thing at his will and allowed none not even my lord of lancaster to come nigh the king without his leave and then he had them watched of spies the parliament was held at salisbury that michaelmas whereto all men were forbidden to come in arms thither nathless came the said mortimer with a great rabble of armed men at his heels my lord of lancaster durst not come so instead thereof he put himself in arms and sent to expound matters to the king he was speedily joined by all that hated the mortimer and few did not among whom were the kings uncles the bishops of winchester and london the lord wake the lord de beaumont sir hugh de audley and many another that had stood stoutly for queen isabel aforetime some i believe did this out of repentance seeing they had been deceived other some from nought save hate and envy toward the mortimer the demands they put forth were no wise unskilwise unreasonable they were chiefly that the king should hold his revenues himself for the queen had so richly dowered herself that scarce a noble was left to the king that the queen should be dowered of the third part as queens had been aforetime and that the mortimer should live on his own lands and make no encroachments they charged him with divers evil deeds that he had avised the king to dissolve his council appointed of twelve peers he had wasted the royal treasure he had counselled the king to give up scotland and had caused the lady joan to wed beneath her dignity make no encroachments grimly quoth old sir simon when he heard of this verily an this present state of matters go on but a little longer the mortimer can make no encroachments for he shall have all england to his own the mortimer that had yet the kings ear though i think he chafed a bit against the rein by now and then avised him that the lords sought his crown causing him to ride out against them as far as bedford and that during the night peace was patched up some way through the mediating of sir simon de mepham the new archbishop of canterbury my lord of lancaster being fined eleven thousand poundsthough by the same token he never paid it note that same michaelmas was the kings uncle the lord edmund de woodstock create earl of kent marry i named him my lord of kent all through seeing he should so best be known but he was not so create until now and king roger that was such but was not socalled had avancement to the dignity of earl of march there was many a lout and courtesy and many a leg made when as my lords gracious person was in presence and when as he went forth lo brows were drawn together and lips thrust forth and words whispered beneath the breath that were not all of praise now whether it be to fall into the annals of cicely or no this must i needs sayand jack may flout me an he will but that he doth never that i do hate and contemn and full utterly despise this manner of dealing if i love a man maybe i shall be bashful to tell him so but if i love him not never will i make lout nor leg afore him for to win of him some manner of advantage i would speak a man civilly whether i loved him or no that longeth to my gentlehood not his but to blandish and losenge him coax and flatter and say i love thee well and thou art fairest and wisest of all twenty times in a day when in mine heart i wished him full far thence and accounted of him as fond and ussome foolish and uglythat could i never demean me to do an i lived to the years of methuselah and another thing do i notei trust jack shall have patience with me that right in proportion as a man is good so much doth an ill man hate him my lord of lancaster was wise man and brave as he oft showed though he had his failings belike and he did more than any other against the mortimer until the time was full ripe my lord of kent was gent good and sweet of nature and he did little against himonly to consort with my said lord of lancaster yet the mortimer hated my lord of kent far worser than my lord of lancaster and never stayed till he had undone him alas for that stately stag of ten for the cur pulled him down and worried him my lord of kent as i writ afore had dust cast in his eyes by the queen he met her on her landing and marched with her truly believing that the king as she told him was in thrall to the old and young sir hugh le despenser and that she was come to deliver him nought less than his brothers murder tare open his sealed eyes then he woke up and aswhasay looked about him as a man roughly wakened that scarce hath his full sense bitter was his lamentation and very sooth his penitence when he saw the verity of the matter now right as this was the case with him the queen and the mortimer having taken counsel thereon for they feared he should take some step that should do them a mischief resolved to entangle him they spread a rumour taking good care it should not escape his ears that king edward his brother yet lived and was a prisoner in corfe castle he hearing this quickly despatched one of his chaplains named friar thomas dunhead a predicantfor all the predicants were on the kings sideto see if the report were as it was said and sir john deveroil then keeper of the castle having before his instructions took the friar within seeming nothing loth and showed unto him the appearance of a king seated at supper in hall with his sewers waiters and other officers about him this all had been bowned prepared afore of purpose to deceive my lord of kent and one chosen to present represented the king that was like enough to him in face and stature to pass well on this hearing went my lord of kent with all speed to avignon to take counsel with pope john john twentytwo who commended him for his good purpose to deliver his brother and bade him effect the same by all means in his power moreover the said pope promised himself to bear all chargeswhich was a wise deed of the holy father for my lord of kent was he that could never keep money in his pocket but it flowed out of all sides then my lord returned back and took counsel with divers how to effect the same many an one promised him helpamong other the archbishop of york and the lord zouche of mortimer that wedded the lady alianora widow of sir hugh le despenser the lord wake which had wrought much against the king of old and was brother unto my lady of kent and sir ebulo lestrange that wedded my lady of lancaster widow of earl thomas and the young earl of arundel and others of less sort my said lady of kent was likewise awork in the matter for she was not woman to let either tongue or hand lie idle now wherefore is it that if man be rare sweet gent and tender beyond other men he shall sure as daydawn go and wed with woman that could hold castle or govern army if need were tis passing strange but i have oft noted the same and if he be rough and fierce then shall he take fantasy to some soft nesh note bashful creature that scarce dare say nay to save her life right as men of high stature do commonly wed with small women and the great women with little men such be the ways of providence i take it jack saithwhich i must not forget to set downthat he credeth not a whit that confession set forth as made of my lord of kent nor any testimony of friar dunhead but believeth the whole matter a pack of lies saving only that my lord believed the report of his brother prisoner in corfe castle howbeit my lord of kent writ a letter as to the king his brother offering his deliverance which he entrusted to sir john deveroil who incontinently carried the same to the mortimer and he to the queen she then showed it to the young king saying that herein might he see his uncle was conspiring to dethrone him and take his life and hers the king that dearly loved his mother allowed inquiry into the same pending the which my said lord was committed to prison the next morrow came the mortimer to the queen as she sat at dinner and prayed instant speech of her and that full privy and the queen arising from the table took him into her privy closet dame isabel de lapyoun alone in waiting i had learned by then to fear mischief whensoever the queen bade none follow her save dame isabel for i do verily believe she was in all the ill secrets of her mistress they were in conference maybe ten minutes and then hastened the mortimer away nor would he tarry so long as to drink one cup of wine it was not many minutes after that the young king came in and i perceived by their discourse that the queen his mother had sent for him verily all that day which was saint joseph march th she watched him as cat mouse he could not leave the chamber a moment but my lord of march crept after i reckoned some mischief was brewing but purefoy i guessed not how much that day died my lord of kent on the scaffold at winchester and so beloved was he that from noon till four of the clock they had to wait for no man would strike him till at last they persuaded one in the marshalsea that had been cast for sentenced to death to behead him as the price of his own life a little after that hour came in sir hugh de turpington that was marshal of the hall to the king sir saith he to the king i am required of the sheriff to tell you that my lord of kent hath paid wyte on the scaffold so perish all your enemies up sprang the king with a face wherein amaze and sore anguish strave for the mastery my uncle edmund is dead on scaffold cried he in voice that rang through hall mine enemies he was none what mean you i gave no mandate for such nor never should have done dieu eit mercie mine enemies be they that have murdered my fair uncle that i loved dear where and who be they will none here tell me wala wa was soul in that hall brave enough to tell him one of those two chief enemies stale softly to his side hushing the other that seemed ready to break forth by a look fair son saith the queen in her oiliest voice hold you so light your own life and your mothers was your uncle that wist full well how to beguile you dearer to you than i on whose bosom you have lain as babe and whose heart hath been rent at your smallest malady marry i marvel when for i never beheld less careful mother than dame isabel the queen but she went forth the proofs of what i say quoth she shall be laid afore you in full parliament and you shall then behold how sorely you have been deceived in reckoning on a friend in your uncle meanwhile fair son trust me who should seek your good or care for your safety more than your own mother ah verily who should but did she so i could see the king was somewhat staggered by her sweet words yet was he not peaced in a moment his anger died down but he brake forth in bitter tears and so left the hall greeting as he went once more all passed away and they that had hoped for the king to awake and discover truth found themselves beguiled order was sent to seize my lady of kent and her childre that were then in arundel castle but the officers there coming told her the dread tidings whereat she fell down all in swoon and ere the eve was born the lord john her son and baptised poor babe in such haste in the barefooted friars church that his young brother and sister no more than babes themselves were forced to stand sponsors for him with the prior of the predicants note howbeit he lived to grow to mans estate yea longer than the lord edmund his brother and died earl of kent a matter of eight years gone the castle of arundel and the lands that had been given to my lord of kent when my lord of arundel was execute were granted to queen isabel shortly after his heading i think they were given as sop to keep him true to the queen not that he was man to be bought but very like she thought all men were dear heart what strange gear are we human creatures i marvel at times whether the angels write us down greater knaves or fools note the crystallised juice of the aspen earl john of hereford seems to have been a valetudinarian note close roll edward the third part one the exact wording of the coronation oath is of some importance since it has sometimes been stated that our sovereigns have sworn to maintain religion precisely as it existed in the days of edward the confessor the examination of the oath shows that they promised no such thing they engaged only to keep and defend to the people clerical and lay the laws customs rights and liberties granted by their predecessors and by edward more especially to his power means to the best of his power note then not an unusual way of saying the king of spains dominions note in my former volume in all time of our tribulation i committed the mistake of repeating the popular error that the queen took immediate vengeance by banishment on the murderers of her husband it was only gournay and ocle who were directly charged with the murder the others who had a share in it were merely indicted for treason gournay was constable of bristol in december and the warrant for his apprehension was not issued until december after the fall of mortimer when edward the third not his mother was actually the ruler note by this phrase was meant the reckoning of the year from easter to easter subsequently fixed for convenience sake at the th of march note i have searched all the wardrobe accounts in vain for the wedding attire of this royal pair the robes described are that worn by the king for his coronation that in which the queen rode from the tower to westminster the day before her coronation and that in which she dined after the same ceremony these details are given in the wardrobe accounts and it was the fashion at this time for a brides hair to be left flowing straight from head to foot note chaucombe was in the household but of his special office i find no evidence note a coarse variety of silk used both for garments and upholstery note dr barnes tells his readers that lancaster was at this time so old as to be nearly decrepit and two years later that he was almost blind for age he was exactly fortyone having been born in inq tho com lane edward the third and years had not elapsed since the marriage of his parents we may well say after chancellor oxenstiern see with how little accuracy history is written note tender sensitive either in body or mind this word is still a provincialism in the north and west note prob aet johannis com kant edward the third compared with rot pat edward the third part and rot claus edward the third part one chapter nemesis the mills of god grind slowly but they grind exceeding small longfellow after this the queen kept the king well in hand to speak sooth i should say the old queen or queen isabel for now had we a young queen but verily all this time queen philippa was treated as of small account and she that was alway sweet and gent dwelt full peaceably content with her babe our young prince of wales that was born at woodstock at easter of the kings fourth year note and the old queen isabel ruled all she seemed fearful of letting the king out of her sight when he journeyed to the north in august she went withal and came back with him to nottingham in october it was she that writ to my lord of hereford that he should not fail to be at the colloquy note to be held in that town the fifteenth of october with her was ever my lord of march that was as her shadow my lady of march that might have required to have her share of him with some reason being left lone with her childre in ludlow castle it was the th of october that we came to nottingham my lord of hereford that was lord high constable was at that time too sick to execute his office or thought he was maybe he desired to keep him well out of a thing he foresaw howbeit he writ his excuse to the king praying that his brother sir edward de bohun might be allowed his deputy to this the king assented but my lord of march that i guess mistrusted more sir edward than his brother the one having two eyes in his head and the other as good as none counselled the queen to take into her own hand the keys of the castle which she did having them every night brought to her by sir william eland then constable thereof and she laid them under her own pillow while the morning the part of my tale to follow i tell as it was told to me in so far as matters fell not under mine eye the king the old queen the earl of march and the bishop of lincoln were lodged in the castle with their following and sir edward de bohun doing office for his brother appointed my lord of lancaster to have his lodging there likewise whereat my glorious lord of march was greatly angered that he should presume to appoint a lodging for any of the nobles so near the person of queen isabel he offered not to go forth himself sir edward smiled something grimly and appointed my lord of lancaster his lodging a mile forth of the town where my lord of hereford also was that night was dancing in the hall and a little surprised was i that sir william de montacute note should make choice of me as his partner he was one of the bravest knights in all the kings followinga young man with all his wits about him and lately wed to the lady katherine de grandison a full fair lady of much skill note and exceeding good repute it was the pavon note we danced and not many steps were taken when sir william saith dame cicely i have somewhat to say to you under your good leave say on sir william quoth i say i well dame in supposing you true of heart to the old king as dame alice de lethegreves daughter should be you do so in good sooth i made answer so i reckoned quoth he verily an i had doubted it i had held my peace but now to businessdame will you help me i could not choose but laugh to hear him talk of business that is well saith he laugh i pray you then shall man think we do but discourse of light matter but what say you to my question why i will help you with a very good will said i if you go about a good matter and if i am able and if mine husband forbid me not any more ifs quoth hethat i reckon wished to make me to laugh the which i did not at this present made i answer then hearken me saith he can you do a deed in the dark unwitting of the causeknowing only that it is for the kings honour and true good and that they which ask it be true men i meditated a moment then said iay i can so will you pass your word saith he to the endeavouring yourself to keep eye on the queen and my lord of march this even betwixt four and five o the clock will you look from time to time on sir john de molynes and if you hear either of them speak any thing as though they should go speak with the king will you rub your left eye when sir john shall look on you but be you ware you do it not elsewise what not though it itch said i yet laughing not though it itch to drive you distraught well said i tis but for a hour but what means it i pray you it means saith he that if the kings good is to be sought and his honour to be saved you be she that must help to do it then all suddenly it came on me like to a levenand lightning flash what it was that sir william and his fellows went about to do i looked full into his eyes and if ever i saw truth honour and valour writ in mans eyes i read them there i see what you purpose said i you be marvellous woman an you do answered he judge you you have chosen that hour to speak with the king and to endeavour the opening of his eyes for queen isabel or my lord of march to enter should spoil your game sir john de molynes is he that shall give you notice if such be like to befall and i am to signify the same to him right at that minute i had to take a volt jump and turn to the right round sir john neville when i returned back to my partner saith he so that sir john could hear dame cicely you vault marvellous well that was not so ill as might have been i reckon quoth i truly nay he made answer it was right well done i knew he meant to signify that i had guessed soothly will you try it yet again saith he that will i i said and i saw we were at one thereon good saith he i reckoned if any failed me at this pinch it should not be dame alices daughter that eve stood i upon tenterhooks as the saints would have it the queen was abroidering a certain work whereon dame elizabeth wrought with her and for once in my life i thanked the said hallows saints for dame elizabeths laziness dame cicely quoth she an you be not sore pressed for time pray you thread me a twothree needles i wis not how it befalleth but thread a neeld can i never i could have told her well that how for whenso she threadeth a neeld she maketh no bones of the eye but thrusteth forward the thread any whither it shall go on the chance that it shall hit which by times it doth i should not marvel an she essayed to thread the point howbeit her ill husbandry was right then mine encheson note look you said i i can bring my work to that end of the chamber then shall i be at hand to thread your neeld as it shall be voided verily you be gent therein saith she the which i fear i was little howbeit there sat i athreading dame elizabeth her neeld now with red silk and now with black as she lacked and under all having care that i rubbed not my left eye the which i felt strong desire to frote rub i marvel how it was for the hour over i had no list to touch it all the even my task turned out light enough for my lord of march was playing of tables backgammon with sir edward de bohun and never left his seat for all the hour and the queen wrought peacefully on her golden vulture and moved no more than he when i saw it was five o the clock note i cast an eye on sir john de molynes which threw a look to the clock and then winked an eye on me and i saw he took it we had finished our duty the next morrow which was saint lukes even october th came a surprise for all men it was found that the constable of the castle with sir william de montacute sir edward de bohun sir john de molynes the lord ufford the lord stafford the lord clinton and sir john neville had ridden away from the town the night afore taking no man into their counsel none could tell wherefore their departure nor what they purposed i knew only that the king was aware thereof though soothly he counterfeited surprise as well as any man what can they signify saith sir edmund de mortimer the eldest son of my lord of marcha much better man than his father though not nigh so crafty hold thy peace for a fool as thou art saith his father roughly they are afraid of me i cast no doubt at all and they do well i could sweep them away as lightly as so many flies and none should miss them he ended with a mocking laugh verily pride such as this was full ready for a fall we knew afterward what had passed in that hour the day afore the king had been hard to insense cause to understand still a northern provincialism at the first so great was his faith in his mother that he ne could ne would believe any evil of her as to the mortimer he was ready enough for even now was he achafing under the yoke be he what he maythe very foul fiend himself an you will had he said to his lords but she mine own mother my belovedoh not she not she thenfor themselves were lost an they proved not their casethey were fain to bring forth their proofs sir william de montacute told my jack it was all pitiful to see how our poor young kings heart fought full gallantly against the light as it brake on his understanding poor lad for he was but a lad and it troubled him sore but they knew they must carry the matter through oh have away your testimonies he cried more than once spare her and spare me mother my mother mine own dear lady how is this possible at the last he knew all knew who had set england in flame who had done sir hugh le despenser and his son to death who had been his own fathers murderer the scales were off his eyes and had he list to do it he could never set them on again they said he covered his face and wept like the child he nearhand was then he lifted his head the tears over and in his eyes was the light of a settled purpose and in his lips a stern avisement no latsummes backwardness reluctance was in him when once fully set take the mortimer quoth he firm enough sir quoth sir william de montacute we not being lodged in the castle shall never be able to seize him without help of the constable now surely saith the king i love you well wherefore go to the constable in my name and bid him aid you in taking of the mortimer on peril of life and limb sir then god grant us speed saith sir william so to the constable they went and brake the matter only at first bidding him in the kings name having his ring for a token to aid them in a certain enterprise which concerned the kings honour and safety the constable sware so to do and then saith sir william now surely dear friend it behoved us to win your assent in order to seize on the mortimer sith you are keeper of the castle and have the keys at your disposal then the constable having first lift his brows and made grimace of his mouth fell in therewith and quoth he sirs if it be thus you shall wit that the gates of the castle be locked with the locks that queen isabel sent hither and at night she hath all the keys thereof and layeth them under the pillow of her bed while morning and so i may not help you into the castle at the gates by any means but i know an hole that stretcheth out of the ward under earth into the castle beginning on the west side still called mortimers hole which neither the queen nor her following nor mortimer himself nor none of his company know anything of and through this passage i will lead you till you come into the castle without espial of enemies thereupon went they forth that even as though to flee away from the town none being privy thereto save the king and saint lukes day passed over quiet enough the queen went to mass in the church of the white friars and offered at the high altar five shillings her customary offering on the great feasts and chief saints days all peaceful sped the day the queen gat her abed and the keys being brought of the constables deputy i that was that night in waiting presented them unto her which she received in her own hands and laid under the pillow of her bed then went we her dames and damsels forth unto our own chambers in the upper storey of the castle and i set at the casement had unlatched the same and thrown it open being nigh as warm as summer and was hearkening to the soft flow of the waters of the leene which on that side do nearhand wash the castle wall i was but then thinking how peaceful were all things and what sore pity it were that man should bring in wrong and bitterness and anguish on that which god had made so beautifulwhen all suddenly my fair peace changed to fierce tumult and the clang of armed menthe tramp of mailclad feet and the hoarse crying of roaring voices i was as though i held my breath for i could well guess what this portended then above all the routing and bruit shouting and noise came the voice of queen isabel clear and shrill now fair sirs i pray you that you do no harm unto his body for he is a worthy knight our wellbeloved friend and our dear cousin they have him then quoth i scarce witting that i spake aloud nor who heard me have him saith dame joan de vaux beside me whom have they then suddenly a word or twain in the kings voice came up to where we stood on which hearing an anguished cry rang out from queen isabel fair son fair son have pity on the sweet mortimer note wala wa that time was past and she had shown no pity i never loved her as in mine opening words i writ yet in that dread moment i could not find in mine heart to leave her all alone in her agony i have ever found that he which brings his sorrows on his own head doth not suffer less thereby but more and let her be what she would she was a woman and in sorrow not to say mine own liege lady and signing to dame joan to follow me down degrees ran i with all haste and not staying to scratch on the door note into the chamber to the queen we found her sitting up in her bed her hands held forth and a look of agony and horror on her face cicely is it thou she shrieked joan whence come ye saw ye aught what do they to him who be the miscreants is my son there have they won him overthe coward neddirs serpents that they be speak i who be theyand what will they do ah mary mother what will they do with him her voice choked and i spake dame the king is there and divers with him what do they she wailed like a woman in her last agony there hath been sharp assault dame said i and i fear some slain for as i ran in hither i saw that which seemed me the body of a dead man at the head of degrees who she nearhand screamed dame i said i think it was sir hugh de turpington but what do they with him she moaned again an accent of anguish on that last word i save no answer what could i have given dame joan de vaux saith dame the king is there and god will be with the king we may well be ensured that no wrong shall be done to them that have done no wrong this is not the contekes quarrel of a rabble rout it is the justice of the crown upon his enemies his enemieswhose mine enemies are dead and gone all of them all i left not one who be these who be they i say cicely answer me afore i could speak word i was called by another voice i was fain enough of the reprieve leaving dame joan with the queen i ran forth into the queens closet where stood the king what change had come over him in those few hours no longer a bashful lad that was nearhand afraid to speak for himself ere he were bidden this was a young man he was now close on eighteen years of age that stood afore me a youthful warrior a budding achilles that would stand to no mans bidding but would do his will king of england was this man i louted low before my master he spake in a voice wherein was both cold constrainedness and bitterness and stern determinationyet under them all something else i think it was the sorely bruised yet living soul of that deep unutterable tenderness which had been ever his for the mother of his love but could be the same never more man is oft cold and bitter and stern when an hour before he hath dug a grave in his own heart and hath therein laid all his hopes and his affections and they that look on from afar behold the sheet of ice but they see not the grave beneath it they only see him cold and silent and they reckon he cares for nought and feels nothing dame cicely you have been with the queen sir i have so take heed she hath all things at her pleasure of such as lie in your power let my physician be sent for if need arise as well as her own and if she would see any holy father let him be fetched incontinent immediately see to it i charge you that she be served with all honour and reverence as you would have our favour he turned as if to depart then all suddenly the ice went out of his voice and the tears came in how hath she taken it saith he sir said i full hardly as yet and is sore troubled touching my lord of march fearing some ill shall be done him moreover my lady biddeth me tell her who these be is it your pleasure that i answer the same ay answer her saith he sorrowfully for it shall do no mischief now as for my lord of march no worser fate awaits him than he hath given better men he strade forth after that kingly fashion which was so new in him and yet sat so seemly upon him and i went back to the queens chamber cicely is that my son she cried in good sooth dame said i what said he to thee i told her the king had bidden me answer all her desire that if she required physician she should be tended of his chirurgeon beside her own and she should speak with any priest she would i had thought it should apay gratify her to know the same but my words had the contrariwise effect for she looked more frightened than afore nought more said he dame said i the lord king bade me to serve you with all honour and reverence and he said for my lord of march fare forth go on she cried though i scarce knew that i paused he answered that no worser should befall him than he had caused to better men than he mary mother i thought i had scarce ever heard wofuller wail than she made then she sank down in the bed clutching the coverlet with her hands and casting it over her as she buried her face in the pillows i went nigh and drew the coverlet full setely properly neatly over her let be she saith in a smothered voice it is all over life must fare forth and life is of no more worth my bird is flown from the cage and none can win him back is there so much as one of the saints will speak for me as i have wrought so hast thou paid me god not an other word spake she all the livelong day never day seemed longer than that weary eve of saint ursula october th that morrow were taken in the town the two sons of my lord of march sir edmund and sir geoffrey beside divers of his friendssir oliver byngham sir simon de bereford and sir john deveroil the chief all were sent that same day under guard to london with the mortimer himself no voice compassionated him nay my lord of march was no more but in every mans mouth the mortimer as of old time some that had seemed his greatest losengers flatterers now spake of him with the most disdain while they that while they allowed him not did not approve of him had yet never abused ne reviled him were the least wrathful against him i heard that when he was told of all my lord of lancaster flung up his cap for joy some things afterward said were not true it was false slander to say as did some that the mortimer was taken in the queens own chamber he was arrest in the bishop of lincolns chamber which had his lodging next the queen and in conference with the said bishop they took not that priest of baal i had shed no tears had they so done sir hugh de turpington and sir john monmouth creatures of the mortimer were slain sir john neville on the other side was wounded fourteen charges were set forth against the mortimer the murder of king edward was one the death of my lord of kent an other one thing was not set down but every man knew how to read betwixt the lines when the indictment writ that other articles there were against him which in respect of the kings honour were not to be drawn up in writing wala wa there was honour concerned therein beside his own but he was very tender of her his way was hard to walk and beset with snares and he walked it with cleaner feet than most men should never heard i from his lips word unreverent toward her and if other lips spake the same to his knowing they forthank regretted it that same day the king departed from nottingham for leicester on his way to london he left behind him the lord wake de lydel in whose charge he placed queen isabel commanding that she should be taken to berkhamsted castle as soon as might be i know not certainly if he spake with her afore he set forth but i think rather nay than yea october was not out when we reached berkhamsted the queens first anguish was over and she scarce spake but i could see she hearkened well if aught was said in her hearing the king sent command to seize all lands and goods of the mortimer into his hands but the lady of march he bade to be treated with all respect and kindliness and that never a jewel nor a thread of her having should be taken indeed i heard never man nor woman speak of her but tenderly and pitifully she was good woman and had borne more than many for the lady margaret her motherinlaw so much will i not say for she was a firebrand that as saith solomon scattered arrows and death but the lady joan was full gent and reverend and demerited better husband than the fates gave her nay that may i not say sith no such thing is as fate but only god that knoweth to bring good out of evil and hath comforted the lady joan in paradise these four years gone but scarce three weeks we tarried at berkhamsted and then the lord wake bore to the queen tidings that it was the kings pleasure she should remove to windsor my time of duty was then run out all but a twothree days and the queen my mistress was pleased to say i might serve me of those for mine own ease so that i should go home in the stead of journeying with her to windsor at that time my little maid vivien was not in oer good health and it paid me well to be with her so from this point mine own remembrances have an end and i serve me for the rest of the memory of dame joan de vaux mine old and dearworthy friend and of them that abode with queen isabel till she died for when her household was minished and again stablished on a new footing it liked the king of his grace to give leave to such as should desire the same to depart to their own homes and such as would were at liberty to remainone except to wit dame isabel de lapyoun to whom he gave conge with no choice i was of them that chose to depart forsooth i had seen enough and to spare of court life the which i never did much love and i desired no better than to spend the rest of my life at home with my jack and my little maids and my dear mother so long as god should grant me my brother robert of whom if i spake not much it was from no lack of lovingkindness on the contrary part chose to remain he hath ever loved a busy life i found my vivien full sick and a weariful and ugsome time had i with her ere she recovered of her malady soothly i discovered that diachylum emplasture was tenpence the pound and tamarinds fivepence and grew well weary of ringing the changes upon rosin and frankincense litharge and turpentine oil of violets and flowers of beans gratia dei camomile and mallows at long last i thank god she amended but it were a while ere mine ears were open to public matter and not full filled of the moaning of my poor little maid so now to have back to my story as the end thereof was told me by dame joan de vaux queen isabel came to windsor about saint edmund the king november th and nine days thereafter on the eve of saint andrew november th was the mortimer hanged at tyburn he was cast sentenced as commoner not as noble and was dragged at horses tail for a league outside the city of london to the elms but the penalties that commonly came after were not exacted seeing his body was not quartered nor his head set up on bridge ne gate his body was sent to the friars minors church at coventry whence one year thereafter it was at the kings command delivered to the lady joan his widow and sir edmund his son that they might bury him in the abbey of wigmore with his fathers his mother the lady margaret overlived him but four years but the lady joan his wife died four years gone the very day and month that he was taken prisoner to wit the nineteenth day of october nigh two years afore queen isabel the eve of saint andrew as i writ was the mortimer hanged without defence by him made he had allowed none to sir hugh le despenser and my lord of kent and four days hung his body in irons on the gibbet as sir hughs the father had done verily as he had done so did god apay him which is just judge over all the earth and the very next day saint andrew came his dread judgment upon one otherupon her that had wrought evil and not good and that had betrayed her own lord to his cruel death all suddenly without one instants warning came the bolt out of heaven upon isabel of france while the body of the mortimer hung upon the gibbet at the elms of tyburn god stripped that sinful woman of the light of reason which she had used so ill and she fell into a full awesome frenzy so dread that she was fain to be strapped down and her cries and shrieks were nearhand enough to drive all wood that heard her while the body hung there lasted this fearsome frenzy but the hour it was taken down came change over her she sank that same hour into the piteous thing she was for long afterward right as a little child well apaid with toys and shows a few glass beads serving her as well as costly jewels and a yard of tinsel or fringe bright coloured a precious treasure the king was sore troubled but what could he do at the first the physicians counselled that she should change the air often and first to odiham castle was she taken and thence to hertford and after to rising but nothing was to make difference to her any more for many a yearonly that by now and then for a twothree hours she hath come to her wit and then is she full gent and sad desiring ever the grace of our lord for her ill deeds and divers times saying that as she hath done so hath god requited her i have heard say that as time passed on these times of coming to her wit were something oftener and tarried longer until at last a year afore she died she came to her full wit and so abode to the end the king that dealt full well with her and had as much care of her honour as of his own and it was whispered that our holy father the pope writ unto him that he should so do did at the first appoint her to keep her estate in two of her own castles to wit hertford and rising and set forth a new household for her appointing sir john de molynes her seneschal and dame joan de vaux her chief dame in waiting seldom hath she come to town but when there she tarried in the palace of my lord of winchester at southwark on the river side and was once in presence when the king delivered the great seal to sir robert parving then she was in her wit for a short time but commonly at the kings command she hath tarried in those two her castlesto wit hertford and risingpassing from one to the other according to the counsel of her physicians the king hath many times visited her though never the queen which he ever left at norwich when he journeyed to rising and so at times have divers of his children ten years afore her death the kings adversary of france philippe de valois that now calleth him king thereof moved the king that queen isabel should come to eu to treat with his wife concerning peace and so careful is the king and hath ever been of his mothers honour that he would not answer him with the true reason contrary thereto but treated with him on that footing and only at the last moment made excuse to appoint other envoys poor soul she had no wit thereto i never saw her after i left her service saving once which was when she was at shene on cantate sunday april th an eleven years ere her death at supper in the even where were also the king the queen of scots her younger daughter and the earl of march grandson of the first earl and soothly for all the ill she wrought mine heart was woe for the caged tigress with the beautiful eyes that was wont to roam the forest wilds at her pleasure and now could only pace to and fro up and down her cage and toy with the straws upon the floor thereof it was pitiful to see her essaying like a babe as she sat at the board to cause a wafer to stand on end and when she had so done to clap her hands and laugh with childish glee and call her son and daughter to look very gent was the king unto her that looked at her bidding and lauded her skill and patience as he should have done to his own little maid that was but three years old ah me it was piteous sight the grand queenly creature that had fallen so low verily as she had done so god requited her she died at hertford castle two days afore saint bartholomew next thereafter august nd see note in appendix i heard that in her last hours her wit being returned to her as good as ever it had been she had her shriven clean and spake full meek humble and excellent words of penitence for all her sins and desired to be buried in the church of the friars minors in london town and the heart of her dead lord to be laid upon her breast they have met now in the presence above and he would forgive her there lalme de qui dieux eit mercie amen here have ending the

beneath your load i nearer to the wayside inn where toil shall cease and rest begin am weary thinking of your road longfellow hereby i promise and i truly mean to execute it to give my new green silk cloth of gold piece bordered with heads of griffins in golden broidery to the abbey of saint austin at canterbury if any that liveth man or woman will tell me certainly how evil came into this world i want to know why eva plucked that apple she must have plucked it herself for the serpent could not give it her having no hands and if manor womanwill go a step further and tell me why adam ate another he shall have my indiacoloured silk broidered with golden lions and vultures whereof i had meant to make me a new gown for this next michaelmas feast it doth seem as if none but a very idiot could have let in evil and sin and sorrow and pain all over this world for the sake of a sweet apple it must have been sweet i should think because it grew in eden but was there never another in all the garden save only on that tree or did man not know what would happen or was it that man would not think that is the way sometimes with some folks else that heedless nichola had not broken my favourite comb the question has been in my head many a score of times but it came just now because my lady my lords mother was earnest with me to write in a book what i could remember of mine early days when my lady mine own mother was carried to skipton and pomfret if those were not evil days i know not how to spell the word and i am very sure it was evil men that made them and evil women i believe bad woman is far worse than bad man so saith the lady julian my lords mother and being herself woman and having been thrice wed she should know somewhat of women and men too ay and i were ill daughter if i writ not down also that a good woman is one of gods blessedest gifts to this evil world for such is mine own mother the lady joan de geneville that was sometime wife unto the lord roger mortimer earl of march whose name men of this day know but too well welladay if a thing is to be it is best over it is never any good to sit on the brink shivering before man plunge in so if i must needs write be it done here is a dozen of parchment and a full inkhorn and grey goosequills and i need nothing else save brains whereof i thank the saints i have enough and to spare and indeed it is as well i should for in this worldi say not in this housethere be folks who have none too many but i reckon before i begin my tale i had best say who and what i am else shall those who read my book be like men that walk in a mist which is not pleasant as i found this last summer when for a time i lost my companyand thereby myselfon the top of a welsh mountain i then who write am agnes de hastings countess of pembroke and lady of leybourne and i am wife unto the lord lawrence de hastings earl and baron of the same my father and mother i have already named but i may say further that my said mother is a princess born being of that great house of joinville in francewhich men call geneville in englandthat are nobles of the foremost rank in that country these my parents had twelve children of whom i stand right in the midst being the seventh my brother edmund was the eldest of us then came margaret joan roger geoffrey isabel and katherine then stand i agnes and after me are maud john blanche and beatrice note and of them edmund and margaret have been commanded to god he died young my poor brother edmund for he set his heart on being restored to the name and lands which our father had forfeited and our lord the king thought not good to grant it so his heart broke and he died poor soul i would not say an unkind word over his grave where the treasure is there will the heart be but i would rather set my heart on worthier treasure and i think i should scarce be so weak as to die for the loss god assoil him poor soul i was born in the castle of ludlow on the morrow of the translation of saint thomas in the year of king edward of caernarvon the eleventh note so that i am now thirty years of age i am somewhat elder than my lord who was born at allesley by coventry town on saint cuthberts day in the fourteenth year of the same march th i might say i was wiser and not look forward to much penance for lying for i should be more likely to have it set me if i said that all the wits in this world were in his head howbeit there is many a worse man than he a valiant knight and courteous and of rarely gentle and gracious ways and maybe if he were wiser he would give me more trouble to rule him which is easy enough to do neverthelatter there be times when it should do me ease to take him by the shoulders and give him an hearty shake if i could thereby shake a bit more sense into him and there be times when it comes over me that he might have been better matched as our sometime lord king edward meant him to have been with the lady alianora la despenser that queen isabel packed off to a nunnery in hot haste when she came in poor soul he certainly is not matched with me unless two horses be matched whereof one is black and of sixteen handfuls and steppeth like a prince and the other is white and of twelve handfuls and ambles of a jogtrot i would he had a bit more stir in him not that he lacks knightly couragenever a whit carry him into battle and he shall quit him like a man but when all is said he is fitter for the cloister for he loveth better to sit at home with joan of his knee and a great clerkly book afore him wherein he will read by the hour which is full well for a priest but not for a noble of the kings court he never gave me an ill word veriliest truly i marvel if ever he said i wont in all his life yet for all his hendihood courtesy sweetness will he have his own way by times i can never make out how but he is a good man on the whole and doth pretty well as he is bid and i might change for a worse without taking a long journey so take it all in all there are many women have more to trouble them than i the blessed saints be thanked and our sweetest lady saint mary and my patron saint agnes in especial only i do hope jack shall have more wit than his father and i shall think the fairies have changed him if he have not my son should not be short of brains but now to have back and begin my story for i reckon i shall never make an end if i am thus lone in coming to the beginning we were all brought up in the castle of ludlow going now and then to sweeten to have the house thoroughly cleaned to the castle of wigmore of course while we were little children we knew scarce any thing of our parents as beseemed persons of our rank the people whom i verily knew were dame hilda our mistress governess and maud and ellen our damsels and master terrico our chamberlain and robert atte wardrobe our wardrobekeeper and sir philip the clerk i cry him mercy he should have had place of robert and stephen the usher of the chamber and our four nurses whose names were emelina thomasia joan and margery and little blaise the page they were my world but into this world every now and then came a sweet fair presencea vision of a gracious lady in velvet robes whose hand i knelt to kiss and who used to lay it on my head and bless me and at times she would take up one of us in her arms and sit down with the babe on her velvet lap and a look would come into her eyes which i never saw in dame hildas and she would bend her fair head and kiss the babe as if she loved her very much but that was mostly while we were babies i cannot recollect her doing that to meit was chiefly to blanche and beatrice until one day and then nay i have not come to that yet and then at times we should hear a voice belowa stern deep voice or a peal of loud laughterand in an instant the light and the joy would die out of the tender eyes of that gracious vision and instead would come a frightened look like that of a hunted hare and commonly she would rise suddenly and put down the babe and hasten away as if she had been indulging in some forbidden pleasure and was afraid of being caught i can remember wishing that the loud laugh and the stern angry voice would go away and never come back but that the gracious vision would stay always with us and not only pay us a rare visit ay and i can remember wishing that she would take me on that velvet lap and let me nestle into her soft arms and dare to lay my little head on her warm bosom i think she would have done it if she had known i used to feel in those days like a little chicken hardly feathered and longed to be under the soft brooding wings of the hen the memory of it hath caused me to pet my jack and joan a deal more than i should without it then sometimes we had a visit from a very different sort of guest that was an old ladyabout a hundred and fifty i used to fancy her dressed in velvet full as costly but how differently she wore it she never took us on her lapnot she indeed we used to have to kneel and kiss her handand roger whispered to me once that if he dared he would bite it this horrid old thing who called herself our grandmother used to be like a storm blowing through the house she never was two minutes in the room before she began to scold somebody and if she could not find reasonable fault with any body that seemed to vex her more than anything else then she scolded us all in a lump together dame hilda what an untidy chambershe usually began in that waywhy dont you make these children put their playthings tidy of course dame hilda did at the end of the day but how could we have playthings tidy while we were playing with them meg your hair is no better than a mop jack how got you that rent in your sleeve i never knew jack without a rent in some part of his clothes i should not have thought it was jack if he had come in whole garments joan how ungainly you sit pluck yourself up this minute nym take your elbows off the table maud your chaucers slippers are down at heel how dirty your hands are roger go and wash them agnes that wimple of yours is all awry who pinned it up so she went onrattle and scold scold and rattleas long as she stayed in the room jack always the saucy one asked her one day when he was very little are you really grandmother certes child said she turning to look at him why because i wish you were somebody else ha chetife did jack forget that afternoon i trow not i had a sound whipping once myself from dame hilda because i said right out that i hated the lady margaret and joanpoor delicate joan who was perpetually scolded for stoopinglooked at me as if she wished she dared say it too roger had his ears boxed because he drawled out amen i think we all said amen in our hearts sometimes the lady margaret did not come upstairs but sent for some of us down to her that was worse than ever there were generally a number of gentlemen there who seemed to think that children were only made to be teased and some of them i disliked and others i despised only of one i was terribly afraid and that wasmercy jesumine own father i should have found it difficult to say what it was in him that frightened me i used to call it fear then but when i look back on the feeling from my present state i think it was rather a kind of ungovernable antipathy he did not scold us all round as lady margaret did the worst thing i think that i remember his saying to me was a sharpget out of the way girl and i wished i only could get out of his way for ever and ever something made me feel as if i could not bear to be in the same room with him i used to shiver all over if i only heard his voice yet he never illused any of us he scarcely even looked at us it was not any thing he did which made me feel so it was just himself surely never did man dress more superbly than he i recollect thinking that the king was not half so fine yet king edward liked velvet and gold as well as most men my lord my father never wore worsted summer tunics or woollen winter cloaks like others silk velvet samite and cloth of gold were his meanest wear and his furs were budge ermine miniver and gris i can remember hearing how once when the furrier sent him in a robe of velvet guarded with hares fur he flung it on one side in a fury and ordered the poor man to be beaten cruelly he always wore much golden broidery and buttons of gems or solid gold and he never would wear a suit of any mans liverynot even the kings save once when he wore the earl of chesters at the coronation of the queen of france just to vex king edwardas it sorely did for he was then a proscribed fugitive who had no right to use it it is a hard matter when a child is frightened of its own father it is yet harder when he makes it hate him ah it is easy to say that was wicked of thee so it was and i know it but doth not sin lead to sinspring out of it like branches from a stem like leaves from a branch and when one mans act of sin creates sin in another man and that again in a third whose is the sinthe black root whereof came the rotten branches and the withered leaves are we not all our brothers and our sisters keepers well it will not answer to pursue that road for i know well i should trace up the sin too high to one of whom it were not meet for me to speak in the same breath with ugly words ay me what poor weak things we mortal creatures are little marvel little marvel for the woe that was wroughtso fair so fair she was she had the soul of a fiend with the face of an angel was it any wonder that menay and some womenwere beguiled with that angel face and fancied but too rashly that the soul must be as sweet as it god have mercy on all christian souls verily i myself only this last springtime was ready to yield to the witchs spellnever was woman such enchantress as sheand athwart all the past despite all i knew gazing on that face even yet fairer than the faces of younger women to think it possible that all the tales were false and all the past a vision of the night and that the lovely face and the sweet soft voice covered a soul white as the saints in heaven and men are easier deluded by such dreams than womenor at least i think it my poor father if only he had never seen her that haled him to his undoing he might perchance have been a better man any way he paid the bill in his hearts blood so here i leave him god forgive us all and now to my story while i was but a little child we saw little of our mother little more indeed than we did of our father i think of the two we oftener saw our grandmother and little children as god hath wisely ordered it live in the present moment and take no note of things around them which men and women see with half an eye now looking back i can recall events which then passed by me as of no import it was so and there was an end of it but i can see now why it was so and i know enough to guess the often sorrowful nature of that wherefore so it was nothing to us children unless it were a relief that after i was about four years old we missed our father almost entirely we never knew why he tarried away for months at a time we had not a notion that he was first in the prison of the tower and afterwards a refugee over seas and we saw without seeing that our mother grew thin and white and her sweet eyes were heavy with tears which we never saw her shed all we perceived was that she came oftener to the nursery and stayed longer with us and petted the babies more than had been her wont and that such matters had a meaninga deep sad terrible meaningnever entered our heads later on we knew that during those lonely years her heart was being crucified and crucifixion is a dying that lasts long but she never let us know it i think she would not damp our fresh childish glee by even the spray of that roaring cataract wherein her life was overwhelmed motherssuch mothers as sheare like a reflection of god i remember well though i was but just seven years old the night when news came to ludlow castle that my father had escaped from the tower it was a very hot night in augusttoo hot to sleepand i lay awake chattering to kate and isabel who were my bedfellows about some grand play we meant to have the next afternoon in the great gallerywhen all at once we heard a horse come dashing up to the portcullis past our chamber wall and a horn crying out into the night isabel sat up in bed and listened is it my lord coming home i said what all alone with no company answered isabel who is four years elder than i silly child it is some news for my lady my mother the saints grant it be good of course we could hear nothing of what passed at the portcullis as our window opened on the base court but in a few minutes we heard the horse come trotting into our court and the rider lighted down and isabel who lay with her head next the casement sat up again and put her head out of the curtain it was a beautiful moonlight night almost as bright as day what is it ibbot said kate it is a man in livery answered isabel but whose livery i know not it is not ours then we heard the man call to the porter and the door open and the sound of muffled voices to and fro for a minute and then master inges step which we knewhe was then castellancoming in great haste past our door as if he were going to my ladys chamber then the door of the large nursery opened and we heard dame hilda within saying to tamzine thou wert better run and see and tamzine went quickly along the gallery as if she too were going to my lady for a long long time as it seemed to usi dare say it was not many minuteswe lay and listened in vain at length tamzine came back good tidings or bad we heard dame hilda ask the saints wot whispered tamzine my lord is scaped from the tower ha chetife will he come here said dame hilda and we saw that it was bad news in her eyes forsooth nay replied tamzine there be hues and cries all over for him but man saith he is fled beyond seas amen ejaculated dame hilda he may win to cathay china by my good will and if he turn not again till mine hair be white then will i give my patron saint a measure in wax but what saith my lady her i saw not answered tamzine but mistress robergia who told me said she went white and red both at once and her breast heaved as though her very heart should come forth gramercy said dame hilda how some folks do set their best pearls in copper eh our lady love us responded tamzine thats been ever sith world began to run dame i can tell you i lack no telling lass was dame hildas answer never was there finer pearl set in poorer ore than that thou and i wot of i remember that bit of talk because i puzzled myself sorely as to what dame hilda could mean kate was puzzled too for she said to isabel what means the dame i never saw my lady wear a pearl set in copper oh let be said isabel tis but one of the dames strange sayings she is full of fantasies but whether isabel were herself perplexed or whether she understood and thought it better to shut our mouths that cannot i tell to this day well after that things were quiet again for a while a very long while it seemed to me i believe it was really about six months during that time we saw much more of our mother than we used to do she would come often into the nursery and take one of the little ones on her lapit was oftenest blancheand sit there with her sometimes she would talk with dame hilda but more frequently she was silent and sad at times looking long from the casement as if she saw somewhat that none other eyes could see jack said one day whither go mothers eyes when she looks out of the window for shame damsel note john cried dame hilda mother indeed only common children use such a word say my lady if you please she is my mother isnt she said jack stubbornly why shouldnt i call her so i should like to know but you havent answered me dame i know not what you mean damsel why when she sits down in that chair and takes blanchette on her kneeher eyes go running out of the window first thing whither wend they children like you cannot understand replied dame hilda with one of those superior smiles which used to make me feel so very naughty it seemed to say my poor little despicable insect how could you dream of supposing that your intellect was even with mine there i have writ that a capital m in red ink to have answered to dame hildas tone when she put that smile on it should have been in vermilion and gold leaf howbeit jack never cared for all the airs she put on then why dont you make us understand it said he i do not remember what dame hilda said to that but i dare say she boxed jacks ears deary me how ill doth my tale get forward little things keep acoming to my mind and i turn aside after them like a second deer crossing the path of the first that shall never serve i must keep to my quarry all this time our mother grew thinner and whiter poor soul she loved him wellbut so sure as the towel of the blessed nicodemus is in the sacristy of our lady at warwick cannot i tell for why very certain am i that he never gave her any reason we reckoned those six months dreary work there were no banquets in hall nor shows came to the castle nor even so much as a pedlar that we children saw only the same everyday round and tired enough we were of it all the music we ever heard was in our lessons from piers le sautreour and if ever child loved her music lessons her name was not agnes de mortimer all the laughter that was amongst us we made ourselves and all the shows were when jack chose to tumble somersaults or maud twisted some cold lace round her head and said now i am queen isabel dreary work in good sooth yet was it a very michaelmas show and an easter day choir to that which lay ahead and then one nightah what a night that was it was near our bedtime and jack kate and i were playing on the landing and up and down the staircase of our tower i remember jack was the stag and kate and i were the hunters and rarely did jack throw up his head to show off his branching hornswhich were divers twigs tied on his head by a lace of dame hildas for the use whereof jack paid a pretty penny when she knew it kate had just made a grab at him and should have caught him had his tunic held but it gave way and all she won was an handful of worsted and a slip of the step that grazed her shins and she was rubbing of her leg and crying lackaday and jack above well out of reach was making mowes grimaces at uswhen all at once an horn rang loud through the castle and man on little ambling nag came into the courtyard kate forgat her leg and jack his mowes and all we stag and hunters alike ran to the gallery window for to gaze i know not how long we should have tarried at the window had not emelina come and swept us afore her into the nursery with an impatientdeary me here be these children for ever in the way and jack cries you always say we are in the way but mustnt we be any where whereto she makes answergo and get you tucked into bed thats the only safe place for the like of you jack loudly resented being sent to bed before the proper time whereupon he and emelina had a fight as they had most nights and kate and i ran into the nursery to get out of the way here was margery turning down the beds but dame hilda we saw not till an halfhour after as we were doffing us for bed she came with her important face which she was wont to wear when some eventful thing had befallen her or us are the damsels abed emelina saith she the babes be dame and the elders be adoffing them dame hilda came forward into the night nursery hold you there young ladies saith she at the least i would say my three elder young ladiesdame margaret dame joan and dame isabel pray you don you once more but of your warmest gear for a journey by night are we not to go to bed asked joan in surprise but our three sisters donned themselves anew as dame hilda had said of their warmest gear dame hilda spake not word till they were all ready then meg saith whither be we bound dameand with whom with my lady dame margaret to southampton i think we all cried out southampton in diverse tones there is news come to her ladyship as she herself may tell you said dame hilda mysteriously arent we to go dame saith blanches little voice dame hilda turned round sharply as if she went about to snap blanches head off and blanche shrank in dismay certainly not dame blanche what should my lady do to be worried with babes like you she has enough else on her mind at this present without a pack of tiresome childrenholy saints be her help eh dear dear this world dame is this world so bad saith jack letting his nose appear above the bedclothes go to sleep the weary lot of you was dame hildas irritable answer because saith jack neer a whit dauntednothing ever cowed jackif it is so bad hadnt you better be off out of it youd be better off i suppose and we shouldnt miss youthat ill promise do go dame jack spake these last words with a full compassionate air as though he were seriously concerned for dame hildas happiness but she marching up to the bed where jack lay dealt him a stinging slap for his impudence ah saith jack in a mumbled voice having disappeared under the bedclothes this is a bad world i warrant you where folks return evil for good o this fashion we heard no more of jack beyond divers awesome snores which i think were not altogether soothfast but before many minutes had passed the door of the antechamber opened and my lady donned in travelling gear entered the nursery dame hildas words had given me the fancy that some sorrowful if not shocking news had come to her and i was therefore much astonished to see a faint flush in her cheeks and a brilliant light in her eyes which looked as though she had heard good news my children said our mother i come to bid you all farewellmay be a long farewell i have heard thatnever mind what that which will take me away meg and joan and ibbot must go with me take me too pleaded little blanche thee too repeated our mother with a loving smile nay sweetheart that cannot be now my children i hope you will all be good and obedient to dame hilda while i am away it was on kate that her glance fell being the next eldest after isabel and kate answered readily we will all be good as gold dame nym and hodge and geoffrey she went on go also with me so thou kate wilt be eldest left here and i look to thee to set a good ensample to thy brethrenespecially my little wilful jack jacks snoring had stopped when she came in and now as she went over and sat her down by the bed wherein jack lay of the outside up came jacks head from under the blue velvet coverlet our mother laid her hand tenderly upon it my dear little jack she said my poor little jack dame im not poor ant like you made answer jack in a tone of considerable astonishment ive got a whole ball of new string and two battledores and a shuttlecock and a ball and a bow and arrows yes my little jack she said tenderly there are lots of lads poorer than me quoth jack nym himself hasnt got a whole ball of string and geoff hasnt a bit i asked him master inge gave it me yesterday im going to make reins with it for annis and maud and lots of cats cradles youre not going to make reins for me said maud from our bed dame it is horrid playing horses with jack he wants you to take the string in your mouth and you dont know where hes had it i dont mind having it tied to my arms but i wont have it in my mouth did you ever see a horse with his reins tied to his arms scornfully demanded jack you do as you are bid my lady maud or ill come and make you children said our mothers soft voice before maud could answer are you going to quarrel this last night when i have come to say farewell for shame maud this was thy blame oh of course it is always me muttered maud too angry for grammar jacks always the favourite i never do any thing right yes you donow and then by accident responded joan who was sitting at the foot of our bed a speech which did not better mauds temper and it was never angelic jack seemed to have forgotten his passageatarms with maud he was always goodtempered enough though he did tease outrageously why am i poor dame quoth jack little jack thou must shortly go into the wars and thou hast no armour but youll get me a suit dame i cannot jack not for these wars neither can i give thee the wealth to make thee rich as i fain would then dame you will petition the king for a grant will you not saith meg true my daughter saith our mother softly i must needs petition the king both for the riches from his treasury and for the arms from his armoury and then she bent down to kiss jack o my boy lay not up treasure for thyself and thus fail to be rich in god i began then to see what she meant but i rather wondered why she said it such talk as that it seemed to me was only fit for sunday and then i remembered that she was going away for a long long time and that therefore sunday talk might be appropriate i do not recollect any thing she said to the others only to jack and me jack and i were always fellows we children had paired ourselves off not altogether according to age but rather according to tastes edmund and meg should have gone together and then hodge and joan and so forth whereas it was always nym and joan and meg and hodge then geoffrey and isabel made the right pair and kate jack and i went in a trio maud was by herself she paired with nobody and nobody wanted her she was so cross blanche was every bodys pet while she was the baby and beatrice came last of all our mother went round and kissed and blessed us all i lay inside with kate and maud and when she said now my little agnesi crept out and travelled over the tawny silk coverlet to those gentle velvet arms and she took me on her lap and lapped me up in a fur mantle that meg bare on her arm and what shall i say to my little agnes mother say you love me it came out before i knew it and when i had said it i was so frightened that i hid my face in the fur it did not encourage me to hear dame hildas exclamation lackaday what next trow but the other voice was very tender and gentle didst thou lack that told thee mine own little annis ay me maybe men are happier lower down who should love thee my floweret if not thine own mother kiss me and say thou wilt be good maid till i see thee again i managed to whisper i will try dame how long will it be cries jack i cannot tell thee jack she saith some months i fear not yearsi do trust not years but god knowethand to him i commit you and as she bent her head low over the mantle wherein i was lapped i heard her sayagnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis jesu i knew that because i always had to repeat it in my evening prayers though i never could tell what it meant only as it seemed to say agnes and monday i supposed it had something to do with me and was to make me good after some fashion but i saw not why it must be only on a monday especially as i had to say it every day now of course i know what it means and i wonder children and ignorant people are not taught what prayers mean instead of being made to say them just like popinjays i wanted to teach my joan what it meant but the lady julian my lords mother commanded me not to do so for it was unlucky i begged her to tell me why and she said the latin was a holy tongue known to god and the saints and so long as they understood our prayers we did not need to understand them but dame said i saving your presence if i say prayers i understand not how can i tell the way to use them i may be asking for a basket of pears when i want a pair of shoes wherefore trouble the blessed saints for either saith she prayers be only for high and holy concernsnot for base worldly matter such as be pears and shoes but i am worldly matter under your leave dame said i and saith not the paternoster somewhat touching daily bread ay the food of the soulpanem supersubstantialem da nobis quoth she it means not a loaf of bread child thats saint matthew said i but saint luke hath it panem quotidianum and saith nought of supersubstantialem and surely common food cometh from god daughter saith she somewhat severely thou shouldst do a deal better to leave thy fantasies and the workings of thine own brain and listen with meek submission to the holy doctors that can teach thee with authority dame i cry you mercy said i but surely our lord teacheth with more authority than they all and if i have his words what need i of theirs ha chetife she would not listen to meonly bade me yet again to beware of pride and presumption lest i should fall into heresy from the which saint agnes preserve me but it doth seem strange that folks should fall into heresy by studying our lords words i had thought they should rather thereby keep them out of it welldear heart here again am i got away from my story this it is to have too quick a witour mother blessed us and kissed us all and set forth the six eldest with her for southampton i know now though i heard not then that she was on her way to join our father news had come that he was safe over seas in france with the sieurs de fienles the lady margarets kin and no sooner had she learned it than she set forth to join him i doubt greatly if he sent for her nay i should rather say he would scarce have blessed her for coming but she got not thus far on her way as shall be seen his tarrying with the sieurs de fienles was in truth but a blind to hide his true proceedings he stayed in normandy but a few weeks until the hue and cry was over and folks in england should all have got well in their heads that he was there then or ever harm should befall him by tarrying there too long he made quiet departure and ere any knew of it he was safe in the king of frances dominions at this time the king of france was king charles le bel youngest brother of our queen i suppose he was too much taken up with the study of his own perfections to see the perfections or imperfections of any body else otherwise had he scarce been so stoneblind to all that went on but just afore his nose there be folks that can see a mouse a mile off and there be others that cannot see an elephant a yard in front of them but there be a third sort and to my honest belief king charles was of them that can see the mouse as clear as sunlight when it is their own interest to detect him but have not a notion of the elephant being there when they do not choose to look at him when he wanted to be rid of his first wife queen blanche he could see her well enough and all her failings too as black as midnight but when his sister behaved herself as ill as ever his wife did or could have done he only shut his eyes and took a comfortable nap now king charles had himself expelled my father from his dominions for some old grudge that i never rightly understood yet never a word said he when he came back without licence marry but our old king edward should not have treated thus the unlicenced return of a banished man he would have been hung within the week with him on the throne but king charles was not cut from that stuff he let my father alone till the queen came overour queen isabel his sister i mean and then who but he in all the french court howbeit they kept things pretty quiet for that time nought came to king edwards ears and she did her work and went home forsooth it was sweet work for she treated with her brother as the sister of france and not as the wife of england king charles had taken guienne and she sent to demand restitution concluded a treaty of peace on his bare word that it should be restored with no pledge nor security whatever but bitter complaints she laid of the king her husband and the way in which he treated her well it is true he did not treat her as i should have done in his place for he gave in to all her whims a deal too much where a good buffet on her ear should have been ever so much more for her goodand his too i will warrant deary me but if some folks were drowned the world would get along without them i mention no names only that weary nichola that is for ever mashing my favourite things so the queen came home and all went on for a while but halt my goosequill thou marchest too fast have back a season note this is the probable order of birth the date assigned to the birth of agnes is fictitious but that of her husband is taken from his probatio aetatis note july th this is about the probable time the countess is supposed to be writing in the spring of note this word was then used of both sexes and was the proper designation of the son of a prince or peer not yet arrived at the age of knighthood part two chapter the lady of ludlow toilworn and very weary for the waitingtime is long leaning upon the promise for the promiser is strong so were we children left alone in the castle of ludlow and two weary months we had of it wearier were they by far than the six that ran afore them when our mother was there and our elder brethren that she had now carried away lessons dragged and play had no interest it had been meg that devised all our games and nym that made boats and wooden horses for us and joan that wove wreaths and tied cowslip ballsand they were all away there was not a bit of life nor fun anywhere except in jack and if jack were shut in a coalhole by himself he would make the coals play with him o some fashion but even jack could fetch no fun out of amo amas amat and i grew sore weary of pulling my neeld needle in and out and being banged oer the head with the fiddlestick when i played the wrong string if we could swallow learning as we do meat what a lessening of human misery should it be no news came all this whileat least none that we heard winter grew into spring and may came with her flowers ay and with something else the day rose like the long dreary days that had come before it and nobody guessed that any thing was likely to happen we ate eggs and butter and said our verbs and the commandments of god and the church to sir philip and played some weary dreary exercises on the spinnet to dame hilda and dined i mind it was on lamb finches and flaunes custards and then kate i and maud were set down to our needles blanche was something too young for needlework saving to pull coloured silks in and out of a bit of rag for practice we had scarce taken twenty stitches when far in the distance we heard a horn sounded is that my lady acoming home said i to kate eh would it were quoth she i reckon it is some hunters in the neighbourhood i looked to and fro and no dame hilda could i seeonly margery and she was easy enough with us for little things so i crept out on tiptoe into the long gallery and looked through the great oriel which i could well reach by climbing on the windowseat i remember what a sweet peaceful scene lay before methe fields and cottages lighted up with the may sunshine which glinted on the teme as it wound here and there amid the trees i looked right and left but saw no huntersnothing at all i thought at first and then as i was going to leave the oriel i saw the sun glance on something that moved and looked like a dark square and i heard the horn ring out again a little nearer i watched the square thing growfrom dark to red from an indistinct mass to a compact body of marching men with mounted officers at their head and then forgetting dame hilda and every thing else except the startling news i brought i rushed back into the nursery crying out the kings troops jack kate the kings troops are coming come and see dame hilda was there but she did not scold me she turned as white as the sindon in her hand and stood up dame agnes what mean you surely tis never thus holy mary shield us and she hurried forth to the oriel window where jack was already perched the square had grown larger and plainer now it was evident they were marching straight for the castle dame hilda hastened awayi guessed to confer with master ingeand having so done she came back to the nursery bade us put aside our sewing and wash our hands and come down with her to hall we all trooped after beatrice led by her hand and she ranged us afore her in the great hall on the dais standing after our ageskate at the head then i maud and jack and so we awaited our fate i scarce think i was frighted i knew too little what was likely to happen to feel so that something was going to happen i had uncertain fantasy but our life had been colourless for so long that the idea of any thing to happen which would make a change was rather agreeable than otherwise we heard the last loud summons of the trumpet which in our ignorance we had mistaken for a huntinghorn and the trumpeters cry of open to the kings troops we heard the portcullis lifted and the steady tramp of the soldiers as they marched into the courtyard there was a little parleying outside and then two officers in the kings livery note came forward into the hall bowing low to us and dame hilda the dame spoke first sir thomas gobioun if i err not he and your servant dame answered one of the officers then i must needs do you to wit sir that in this castle is neither lord nor lady and i trust our lord the king wars not with little children such as you see here stale news good dame answered sir thomas with as methought a rather grim smile we know something more i reckon than you touching your lord and lady sir roger de mortimer is oer seas in normandy and the lady joan at skipton castle at southampton you surely mean said master inge who stood at the other end of the line whereof i made the midmost link the knight laughed out nay worthy master inge i mean not southampton but skipton tis true both begin with an s and end with a p and a ton but there is a mile or twain betwixt the places what should my lady do at skipton saith dame hilda verily i conceive not this saith master inge knitting his brows it was to southampton my lady wentat least so she told us your lady told you truth master castellan she set forth for southampton and reached it but ere a fair wind blew for her voyage came a somewhat rougher gale in the shape of a command from the kings grace to the sheriff to take her into keeping and send her into ward at skipton castle whither she set forth a fortnight past now methinks master inge you are something wiser than you were a minute gone and our young damsels cries dame hilda be they also gone to skipton i felt kates hand close tighter upon mine soft you now good dame saith sir thomaswho or i thought so took it all as a very good joke your damsels be parted in so many as they be and sent to separate conventsone to shuldham one to sempringham and one to chicksandand their brothers be had likewise into ward to my unspeakable amazement dame hilda burst into tears and catched up beatrice in her arms i had never seen her weep in my life and a most new and strange idea was taking possession of medid dame hilda actually care something for us sir she sobbed you will never have the heart to part these babes from all familiar faces and send them amongst strangers that may use them hardly to break their baby hearts surely the king that is father of his people hath never commanded such a thing as that at the least leave me this little oneor put me in ward with her i was beginning to feel frightened now i looked at kate and read in her face that she was as terrified as i was tut tut dame saith the other officer sir thomas it seemed to me enjoyed the scene and rather wished to prolong it but this other was of softer metal take not on where is no cause i pray you the little ones bide here under your good care only as you may guess we be commanded to take to the kings use this castle of ludlow and all therein and we charge you and he bowed to dame hilda and then to master ingeand you in the kings name that you thwart not nor hinder us in the execution of his pleasure have here our commission master inge took the parchment and scrutinised it most carefully while dame hilda wiped her eyes and put beatrice down with a fervent bless thee my jewel now out bursts jack with a big sob that he could contain no longer does the king want my new ball of string and my battledores certes answered sir thomas but i saw a twinkle in his eye though his mouth was as grave as might be jack fell ablubbering no nononsense saith the other officer dont spoil the fun man quoth sir thomas fun it is no fun to these babes answered the other ive a little lad at home and this mindeth me of him i cannot bear to see a child cryand for no causenay my little one saith he to jack all in this castle now belongs to the king as aforetime to thy father but thy father took not thy balls and battledores from thee nor will he cheer up for thou hast nought to fear please sir saith kate shall all our brothers and sisters be made monks and nuns whether they like or no sir thomas roared with laughter his comrade saith gently nay my little damsel the kings will is not so it is but that they shall be kept safe there during his pleasure and will they get any dinner and supper saith maud plenty he answered and right good learning and play in the convent garden at recreationtime with such other young damsels as shall be bred up there they will be merry as crickets i warrant kate fetched a great sigh of relief she told me afterwards that she had felt quite sure we should every one of us be had to separate convents and never see each other any more so matters dropped down again into their wonted course for over two years our mother tarried at skipton and then she was moved into straiter ward at pomfret about six weeks only note before queen isabel landed with her alien troops under sir john of ostrevant and drave king edward first from his throne and finally from this life our father came with her and this will i say that our mother might have been set free something earlier note if every body had done his duty but folks are not much given to doing their duties so far as i can see they are as ready as you please to contend for their rightswhich generally seems to mean let me have somebody elses rights ay they will get up a battle for that at short notice but who ever heard of a man petitioning much less fighting for the right to do his duty and yet is not that really and verily the only right a man has it was a gala day for us when our mother returned home and our brothers and sisters were gathered and sent back to us nym always a little given to romance drew heartrending pictures of his utter misery while in ward but roger said it was not so bad setting aside that it was prison and we were parted from one another and geoffrey the sensible boy of the family said that while he would not like a monks life on the whole being idle and useless yet he did like the quiet and peacefulness of it but i am not secure said our mother that such quiet is what god would for us saving some few soldiers be not bred by lying of a bed of roseleaves beside scented waters and i think the soldiers of christ will scarce be taught o that fashion diverse likewise were the maids fantasies meg said she would not have bidden at shuldham one day longer than she was forced joan said she liked not ill at sempringham only for being alone but isabel as she sat afore the fire with me on her lap the even of her coming home isabel had ever petted meand dame hilda asked her touching her life at chicksandisabel said gazing with a faraway look into the red ashes i shall go back to chicksand some day if i may win leave of mine elders why dame isabel quoth dame hilda in some surprise liked you so well as that ay i liked well she said in that dreamy fashion not that i did not miss you all dame and in especial my babe herewho is no longer a babeand she smiled down at me and verily i could see that sins be not shut out by convent walls but rather shut in yet ay said dame hilda when she stayed i think she wanted to make her talk i scarce know how to say it quoth she but it seemed to me that for those who would have it so satan was shut in with them and pleasure was shut out and also for those who would have it so god was shut in with them and snares and temptationssome of themwere shut out only some but it was something to be rid of them if it were possible to have only those who wanted to shut out the world and to shut themselves in with god that is the theory and that would be heaven on earth but it does not work in practice yet you would fain return thither said dame hilda isabel looked into the fire and answered not until she said all suddenly dame hilda be there two of you or but one truly dame isabel i take not your meaning ah saith she then is there but one of you if so you cannot conceive me thou dost ellen ay dame isabel that do i but too well they have easier lives methinks that are but one you look on me dame hilda as who should say what nonsense doth this maid talk but if you knew what it was to have two natures within you pulling you diverse ways sometimes the one uppermost and at times the other and which of the twain be you that cannot you telli will tell you i have noted this many timesisabels voice sank as if she feared to be overheardin them whose father and mother have been of divers dispositions some of the children may take after the one and some after the other but there will be one at least who partaketh both and then they pull him divers ways that he knoweth no peace isabels audience had been larger than she supposed as she ended with a weary sigh a soft hand fell upon her head and i who sat upon her knees could better see than she looked up into my ladys face sit still daughter said she as isabel strove to rise nay sweet heart i am not angered at thy fantasy though truly i being but one like dame hilda conceive not thy meaning it may be so i have not all the wit upon earth that i should scorn or set down the words of them that speak out of other knowledge than mine but my isabel there is another way than this wherein thou mayest have two natures how so dame an it like you the nature of sinful man and the nature of god almighty they must be marvellous saints that so have said dame hilda crossing herself some of them said my lady gently were once marvellous sinners why you should have to strive a very lifetime for that quoth dame hilda i should think no man could rise thereto that dwelt not in anchorites cell and scourged him on the bare back every morrow and ate but of black ryebread and drank of ditchwater deary me but i would not like that id put up with a bit less saintliness i would you are all out there dame my lady made answer this fashion of saintliness may be along with such matters but it cometh not by their help how comes it then dame ant like you by asking for it saith our mother quietly good lack but which of the saints must i ask for it quoth she ill give him all the wax candles in ludlow a week afore i die id rather not have it sooner when go you about to die dame our lady love us that cannot i say then you shall scarce know the week before i think oh no but the saint shall know look you dame to be too much of a saint should stand sore in mans way i could not sing nor dance nor lake me a bit if i were a saint and that fashion of saintliness you speak of must needs be sorest of all if i do but just get it to go to heaven with that shall serve me the best i thought they sang in heaven saith isabel bless you damselnought but church music dame hilda i marvel if you would be happy in heaven oh i should be like when i got there my lady shook her head for that quoth she you must be partaker of the divine nature which means not doing good works contrary to your liking but having the nature which delights in doing them oh ay that will come when we be there on the contrary part they that have it not here on earth shall not win there they only that be partakers of christ may look to enter heaven and no man that partaketh christs merits can miss to partake christs nature marry then but few shall win there so do i fear saith my lady dame under your good pleasure saith dame hilda looking her earnestly in the face where gat you such notions they be something new at the least never heard i your ladyship so to speak aforetime my ladys cheek faintly flushed may god forgive me saith she all these years to have locked up his word which was burning in mine own heart yet in good sooth dame you are partly right ere i went to skipton i was like one that seeth a veiled face or that gazeth through smoked glass but now mine eyes have beheld the face of him that was veiled and i have spoken with him as man speaketh with his friend and if you would know who helped me thereto it was an holy hermit by name richard rolle that did divers times visit me in my prison at skipton and he knows him full well dame saith dame hilda looking somewhat anxiously on my mother i do trust you go not about to die nor to hie in cloister and leave all these poor babes do bethink you i pray ere you do either my lady smiled nay good my dame saith she how can i go in cloister that am wedded wife eh but you might get your lords consent theretosome wedded women doth i was looking on my lady and i saw a terrible change in her face when dame hilda spoke those words i felt too isabels sudden nervous shiver and i guessed what they both thoughtthat assent would be easy enough to win for in all those months since queen isabel came over he had never come near us he was ever at the court waiting upon her and though his dutiesif he had them but what they were we knew not might keep him at the court in general yet surely had he been very desirous to see us he might have won leave to run over when the queen was at hereford were it only for an hour or twain our mother did not answer for a moment when she did it was to saynay vows may not be thus lightly done away till death scarce means till one have opportunity to undo then pray you go not and die dame i am immortal till god bids me die she made answer but why should man die because he loveth jesu christ better than he was wont oh folks always do when they get marvellous good it were ill for the world an they so did saith my lady that is bad enough to lack good folks it is bad enough to lack you saith dame hilda my lady gave a little laugh and so the converse ended the next thing that i can remember after that was the visit of our father he only came that once and tarried scarce ten days but he took nym and geoffrey back with him i heard dame hilda whisper somewhat to tamzine as though he had desired to have also one or two of the elder damsels and that my lady had so earnestly begged and prayed to the contrary that for once he gave way to her it was not often i think that he did that it was four years good ere we saw either of our brothers againnot till all was overand then geoff told us a sorry tale indeed of all that had happed it was at the time when our father paid us this visit that my marriage and that of beatrice were covenanted king edward of caernarvon had contracted my lord that now is to the lady alianora la despenser daughter of my sometime lord of gloucester hugh le despenser the younger who was put to death at hereford by queen isabel but shei mean the queenwho hated him and all his sent the lady alianora to sempringham with command to veil her instantly and gave the marriage of my lord to my lord prince the king that now is edward the third so my father being then at top of the tree begged the marriage for one of his daughters and it was settled that should be me i liked it well enough to feel myself the most important person in the pageant and to be beautifully donned and all that and as i was not to leave home for some years to come it was but a show and cost me nothing i dare say it cost somebody a pretty penny beatrice was higher mated with my lord of norfolks son who was the kings cousin but he died a lad poor soul so her grandeur came to nought and she wedded at last a much lesser noble thus dwelt we maids with our mother in the castle of ludlow seeing nought of the fine doings that were at court save just for the time of our marriages which were at wynchecombe on the day of saint lazarus that is the morrow of o sapientia note the king was present himself and the young lady philippa who the next month became our queen and his sisters the ladies alianora and joan and more earls and countesses than i can count all donned their finest welladay but there must have been many a yard of velvet in that chapel and an whole army of beasts ermines must have laid their lives down to purfile trim with fur the same i was donned myself of blue velvet guarded of miniver and wore all my ladys jewels on mine head and corsage and marry but i queened it who but i for that morrow in very sooth ay and somebody else queen isabelle the young kings mother was there whom i have not named somebody robed in snowwhite velvet with close hood and wimple so that all that showed of her face was from the eyebrows to the lipsall pure unstained mourning white little i knew of the horrible stains on that black heart beneath and i thought her so sweet so fair come i have spoken too plainly to add a name so all passed away like a dream and we won back to ludlow and matters fell back to the old ways as if nought had ever happenedthe only real difference being that instead of damsel agnes i was my lady of pembroke and our baby beatrice instead of damsel beattie was my lady beatrice of norfolk and about a year after that came letters from nym addressed to my lady countess of march in which he writ that the king had made divers earls and our father amongst them dame hilda told us the news in the nursery and jack turned a somersault and stood on his hands with his heels up in the air call me jack any more if you dare cries he i am my lord john of march and i shall expect to be addressed so properly do you hear children i hear one of the children in good sooth said meg comically and maud saith prithee jack take no airs for they beseem thee but very ill whereon jack fell amoaning and acrying out that dame hilda thought he was rare sick and ordered emelina to get ready a dose of violet oil but before emelina could so much as fetch a spoon there was jack dancing a hornpipe and singing or rather screaming at the top of his voice till dame hilda put her hands over her ears and cried for mercy i never did see such another lad as jack we heard but little and being children we cared less for the events that followedthe beheading of my lord of kent and the rising under my lord of lancaster and the next thing after that was the last thing of all it was in october we had no more idea of such a blow falling on us than we had of the visitation of an angel i remember we were all gatheredexcept the little onesin my ladys closet for after my marriage i was no longer kept in the nursery though beattie on account of her much youth was made an exception to that rule my lady was spinning and her damsel aveline carding and joan and i our arms round each others waists sat in the corner joan having on her lap a piece of finished broidery and i having nothing what the others were doing i forget then came the familiar sound of the horn and my lady turned white i never felt sure why she always turned white when a horn sounded whether she expected bad news or whether she expected our father she was exceeding afraid of him and yet she loved him i know i cannot tell how she managed it after the horn we heard the tramp of troops entering the courtyard and i think we all felt that once more something was going to happen aveline glanced at my lady who returned the look but did not speak and then lettice one of the other maidens rose and went forth at a look from aveline but she could scarcely have got beyond the door when master inge came in dame said he my news is best told quickly the castle and all therein is confiscate to the crown but the king hath sent strict command that the wardrobe jewels and all goods of your ladyship and of all ladies and children dwelling with you shall be free from seizure and no hand shall be laid on you nor any thing belonging to you my lady rose up resting her hand on the chair from which she rose i think it was to support her i return humble thanks to the lord king said she in a trembling voice what hath happened master inge dame quoth he how shall i tell you my lord is a prisoner of the tower and sir edmund and sir geoffrey with him if my lady could turn whiter i think she did i felt joans handclasp tighten upon mine till i could almost have cried out and dame isabel the queen is herself under ward in the castle of berkhamsted and all matters turned upside down man saith that the great men with the king be now sir william de montacute and sir edward de bohun and divers more of like sort and my lord of lancaster man saith flung up his cap and thanked god that he had lived to see that day my lady had stood as still and silent as an image all the while master inge was speaking only that when he said the queen was in ward she gave a sort of gasp when he had done she clasped her hands and looked up to heaven dost thou come she said in a strange voice that did not sound like hers dost thou come to judge the earth we have waited long for thee yetoh if it be possibleif it be possible spare my boys to me and spare a strange kind of sob seemed to come up in her throat and she held out her hands as if she could not see i believe if master inge and lettice had not been quick to spring forward and catch her by the arms she would have fallen to the floor they bore her into her bedchamber close by and we children saw her not for some time dame hilda was in and out but when we asked her how my lady fared she did nought save shake her head from which we learned little except that things went ill in some way when we asked lettice she said there now dont hinder me poor children you will know soon enough aveline was the best for she sat down and gathered us into her arms and comforted us but even she gave us no real answer only she kept saying poor maids poor little maids so above a month passed away master john de melbourne was sent down from the king as supervisor of the lands and goods of my lady and her children but he came with the menatarms so he brought no fresh news and it was after christmas before we knew the rest then one winter morrow came a warrant of the chancery granting to my lady all the lands of her own inheritance by reason of the execution of her husband and then she knew that all had come that would come we children meg except had not yet been allowed to see our mother who had never stirred from her bedchamber one evening early in january we were sitting in her closet clad in our new doole raiment how i hated it talking to one another in low voices for i think we all had a sort of instinct that things were going wrong somehow even the babies who understood least about it when all at once for none of us saw her enter a lady stood before us a lady whom we did not know clad in white widowdoole tall and stately with a white white face so that her weeds were scarcely whiter and a kind of fixed unalterable expression of intense pain yet unchangeable peace it seemed to me such a strange look whether the pain or the peace were the greater i knew not nor could i tell which was the newer we girls sat and looked at her with puzzled faces then a faint smile broke through the pain on the white face like the sun breaking through clouds and a voice we knew asked of us dont you know me my children and that was how our mother came back to us she did not leave us again ever since he died she has lived for us that white face full of peace and yet of pain abides with her her colour has never returned but i think the pain grows less with years and the peace grows more she smiles freely but it is faintly as if smiles hardly belonged to her and were only a borrowed thing that might not be kept and her eyes never light up as of oldonly that once when some months after our fathers end nym and geoff came back to us then just for one moment her old face came again for i think she had given them upnot to king edward but to christ our lord who is her king ay i never knew woman like her in that there are many that will say prayers and there are some that will pray which is another thing from saying prayers but never saw i one like her that seemed to do all her work and to live all her living in the very light of the throne of god just as an impassioned musician turns every thing into music and a true painter longs to paint every lovely thing he sees so with her all things turn to jesu christ i should think she will be canonised some day i am sure she deserves it better than many an one whom i have heard man name as meriting to be a saint perhaps it is possible to be a saint and not be canonised must man not have been a saint before he can be declared one i know the lady julian would chide me for saying that and bid me remember that the church only can declare man to be saint but i wonder myself if the lord never makes saints without waiting for the church to do it for him the church may never call my lady saint joan but that will she be whether she be socalled or no and at times i think too that they who shall be privileged to dwell in heaven will find there a great company of saints of whom they never heard and perchance some of them that sit highest there will not be those most accounted of in the calendar and on festival days but i do not supposeas an ancestress of my mother did in a chronicle she wrote which i once read it is in the possession of her french relatives and was written by the lady elaine de lusignan daughter of geoffroy count de la marche who was a son of that house note i do not suppose that the saints who were nobles in this world will sit nearest the throne and those who were peasants furthest off nay i think it will be another order of nobility that will obtain there those who have served our lord the best and done the most for their fellowmen these i think will be the nobles of that world for does not our lord say himself that the first shall be last there and the last first and i can guess that joan de mortimer my lady and mother will not stand low on that list it is true she was a countess in this life but it was little to her comfort and she was beside that early orphaned and a cruelly illused wife and a bereaved mother life brought her little good heaven will bring her more but i wonder where one agnes de hastings will stand in that company nay rather will she be there at all it would be well that i should think about it note a word which then included uniform and all lands of official garb note on august rd she left skipton arriving at pomfret on the th note i find no indication of the date only that she was at ludlow on october note the precise date and place are not recorded but it was about this time and the king who was present was in the west only from december th to the st it is asserted by walsingham that beatrice was married about note the lady elaines chronicle is lady sybils choice part three chapter wherein sister alianora la despenser maketh moan caged but of all sad words by tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been whittier i marvel if the sun is never weary thus spoke my sister margaret note as she stood gazing from the window of the recreationroom and sister roberga looked up and laughed nay what next saith she heard i ever such strange fancies as thine thou wilt be marvelling next if the stars be never athirst and if rain be the moon weeping quoth sister philippa who seemed as much amused as roberga no the moon weepeth not said margaret she is too cold to weep she is like mother ada eh dear what fancies hast thou saith sister roberga who but thou would ever have thought of putting the moon and mother ada into one stall what didst thou mean sister margaret saith the quiet voice of mother alianora as she sat by the chimney corner mother alianora is our fathers sistermargarets and mine but i ought not to think of it since a recluse should have no kindred out of her order and the blessed saints and there are three sisters in the priory named alianora wherefore to make diversity the eldest professed is called alianora and the second that is myself annora and the youngest only last year professed nora we had likewise in this convent an aunt joan but she deceased over twenty years gone margaret was professed in the order when i was but not at this house and she hath been transferred hither but a few weeks note so that her mind and heart are untravelled ground to me she was a sister at watton and since i can but just remember her before our profession it seems marvellous strange that we should now come to know one another after nearly fifty years cloistered life there is yet another sister named margaret but being younger in profession we call her sister magota when mother alianora spoke margaret turned back from the window as she ought when addressed by a superior i mean mother that he never hath any change of work she said every morrow he has to rise and every night must he set and always the one in east and the other in west i think he must be sore sore weary for he hath been at it over five thousand years sister roberga and sister philippa laughed mother alianora did not laugh a soft rather sorrowful sort of smile came on her aged face art thou so weary my daughter that the thought grew therefore saith she something came into margarets eyes for a moment but it was out again almost before i could see it i knew not what it was margarets eyes are yet a puzzle to me they are very dark eyes but they are different in their look from all the other dark eyes in the house sister olive has eyes quite as dark but they say nothing margarets eyes talk so much that she might do very well without her tongue not that i always understand what they say the language in which they speak is generally a foreign one to me i fancy mother alianora can read it better i listened for margarets reply dear mother is not weariness the lot of all humanity and more especially of women mary love us cries philippa what gibberish you talk sister margaret sister philippa will come here and ask sister margarets forgiveness at once saith mother gaillarde the subprioress sister philippa banged down her battledore on the table and marching up knelt before margaret and asked forgiveness making a face behind her back as soon as she had turned sister philippa will take no cheese at supper added the subprioress sister philippa pulled another facea very ugly one it reminded me somewhat too much of the carved figure of the devil with his mouth gaping on the priors stall in our abbey church that and sister philippas faces are the ugliest things i ever saw except the cellarer and he looks so goodtempered that one forgets his ugliness sister philippa is not weary as it should seem saith mother alianora again with her quiet smile otherwise to speak thereof should scarcely seem gibberish to her i spoke not but i thought it was in no wise gibberish to me for i never had that vocation which alone should make nuns not god but man forced this veil upon me for ah me i was meant for another life and that other life that should have been mine i never cease to long for and to mourn over only six years old was ifor though my seventh birthday was near it was not pastwhen i was thrust into this house of religion my vocation and my will were never asked wemargaret and iwere in queen isabels way and she plucked us and flung us over the hedge like weeds that cumbered her garden it was all by reason she hated our father but what he had done to make her thus hate him that i never knew and i was an affianced bride when i was torn away from all that should have made life glad and prisoned here for ever more how my heart keeps whispering to me it might have been there is a woman who comes for doles to the convent gate and at times she hath with her the loveliest little child i ever saw and they smile on each other mother and child and look so happy when they smile why was i cut off thus from all that makes other women happy nobody belongs to me nobody loves me the very thought of being loved the very wish to be so is sin in me who am a veiled nun but why was it made sin it was not sin aforetime he might have loved me he whom i never saw after i was flung over the convent wallhe who was mine and not hers to whom i suppose they will have wedded him but i know nothing i shall never know and they say it is sin to think of him every thing seems to be sin and loving people more especially mother ada told me one day that she saw in me an inclination to be too much drawn to mother alianora and warned me to mortify it because she was my fathers sister and therefore there was cause to fear it might be an indulgence of the flesh and now these weeks past my poor dry withered heart seems to have a little faint pulsation in it and goes out to margaret my sister margaret with the strange dark eyes my own sister who is an utter stranger to me must i crush the poor dry thing back and hurt all that is left to hurt of it oh will no saint in heaven tell me why it is that god who loveth men will not have monks and nuns to love each other the lord prior saith he is a jealous god and demands that we give all our love to him yet i may love the blessed saints without any derogation to himbut i must not love mine own sister it is very perplexing do earthly fathers forbid their children to love one another lest they should not be loved themselves sufficiently i should have thought that love like other things increased by exercise and that loving my sister would rather help me to love god but they say not i suppose they know ah me if i should find out at last that they mistook gods meaning that i might have had his love and margarets toonay even that i might have had his love and that other of which it is so wicked in me to think and yet something is in me that will keep ever thinking o holy and immaculate virgin o saint margaret saint agnes and all ye blessed maidens that dwell in heaven have mercy on me miserable sinner my soul is earthbound and i cannot rise i am the bride of christ and i cannot cease lamenting my lost earthly bridal but hath christ a thousand brides they say holy church is his bride and she is one then how can all the vestals in all the convents be each of them his bride i suppose i cannot understand as i ought to do perhaps i should have understood better if that might have been had beenif i had not stood withering all these years taught to crush down this poor dried heart of mine they will not let me have any thing to love when mother ada thought i was growing too fond of little erneburg she took her away from me and gave her to sister roberga to teach yet the child seemed to soften my heart and do it good are the holy mother and the blessed saints not enough for thee she said but the blessed saints do not look at me and smile as erneburg did she doth it even now across the schoolroomthough i have never been permitted to speak word to her since mother ada took her from me and i must smile back againay however many times i have to lick a cross on the oratory floor for doing it why ought i not did not our lord himself take the little children into his arms i am sure he must have smiled on themthey would have been frightened if he had not done so they say i have but a poor wit and am fit to teach only babes and not fit to teach them saith mother adain a tone which i am sure people would call cross and snappish if she were an externfor her fancy all runs to playing with them rather than teaching them any thing worth knowing ah mother ada but is not love worth knowing or must they have that only from their happy mothers who not being holy women are permitted to love and not from a poor crushed hopeless heart like mine there is nothing in our life to look forward to till death is the vow of the sisterhood and death seems a poor hope i know of course what mother ada would say that i have no vocation and my heart is in the world and of the world but god sent me to the world and manor rather womanthrust me against my will into this sisterhood not a bit better than lots wife says mother ada she was struck to a pillar of salt for looking back and so shalt thou be sister annora with thy worldly fancies and carnal longings well if i were i am not sure i should feel much different sometimes i seem to myself to be hardening into stone body and soul soul ah that is the worst of it now and then in the dead of night when i lie awakeand for an hour or more after lauds i can seldom sleepone awful thought harrieth and weareth me at times almost to madness i never knew till a year ago when i heard the lord prior speaking to mother gaillarde thereanent that holy church held the contract of marriage for the true canonical tie and if it be thus and we were never divorcedand i never heard word thereofwhat then am i his true wifei not she is he happy with her who is she and what is she doth she care for him and make him her first thought and give all her heart to him as i would have done if how the convent bell startled me miserable me i am vowed to god and i am his for ever but the vow that came first if it were never undonemater purissima sancta virgo virginum ora pro me is there some tale some sad strange story lying behind those dark eyes in that shutup heart of my sister margaret not like mine she was never betrothed but her eyes seem to me to tell a story margaret never speaks to me unless i do it first and i dare not except about some work when mother gaillarde or mother ada is present yet once or twice i have caught those dark eyes scanning my face with a wistful look maybe she too is trying to crush down her heart as i have done but i cannot help thinking that the heart behind those eyes will take a great deal of crushing mother alianora is so different from the two i named just now i am sure there is not a better nor holier woman in all the order but she is always gentle and tender never cold like mother ada nor hard and sarcastic like mother gaillarde i am glad my lady prioress rules with an easy handsadly too slack saith mother gaillardeso that dear mother alianora doth not get chidden for what is the best part of her i should not be afraid of speaking to margaret if only she were present of our superiors at recreationtime this afternoon sister amphyllis asked mother alianora how long she had been professed fortynine years saith she with her gentle smile i was surprised to hear it she hath then been in the order only five years longer than i have and how old were you mother saith sister amphyllis nineteen years saith she there must many an one have died since you came here mother ay quoth mother alianora with a faraway look at the trees without the oldest nun in all the abbey sister margery de burgh died the month after i came hither she remembered a sister that was nearly an hundred years old and that had received the holy veil from the hand of saint gilbert himself sister amphyllis crossed herself annora saith mother alianora canst thou remember mother guendolen what did i know about mother guendolen some faint vague misty memories seemed to awake within mean odd incongruous mixture like a dreamdark eyes like margarets which told a tale but this seemed a tale of terror and an enamelled cross which had somewhat to do with a battle and a queen i scarcely know mother said i somewhat do i recall yet what it is i hardly know were her eyes dark with an affrighted look in them they were dark said mother alianora but the very peace of god was in them ah thou art mixing up two personsherself and her cousin mother gladys they were near of an age and mother guendolen only outlived mother gladys by one year but they were full diverse manner of women thou shouldst remember her annora thou wert a maiden of fifteen when she died all at once she seemed to flash up before me i do remember her mother if it please you she was tall and had very black hair and dark flashing eyes and she moved like a queen i think of her saith mother alianora rather as she was in her last days when those flashing eyes flashed no longer and the queen was lost in the saint if it please you mother i said had she not an enamelled cross that she wore i recollect something about it mother alianora smiled somewhat amusedly she had and perchance thy memory runneth back to a battle over that cross betwixt her and sister sayena who laid plaint afore my lady prioress that mother guendolen kept to herself an article of private property which should have gone into the treasury it had been her mothers a marriagegift from the queen that then was well i remember mother guendolens wordsi sware to part from this cross alone with life and the master granted me to keep it when i entered the order then the fire died out of her eyes and her voice fell low and she addedah my sister dost thou envy me christs cross ay she had carried more of that cross than most she came here about the age thou didst annoraa little child of six years who was she in the world mother quoth sister nora i was surprised to see mother alianora glance round the room as if to see who was there afore she answered nor did she answer for a moment she was sister guendolen of sempringham let that satisfy thee maybe in the world above she is that which she should have been in this world and was not and i could not but wonder if mother guendolens life had held a might have been like mine i want to know what carnal and worldly mean they are words which i hear very often and always with condemnation but they seem to mean quite different things in the lips of different speakers when mother ada uses them they mean having affection in ones heart for any thing or any person that is not part of holy church when mother gaillarde speaks them they mean caring for any thing that she does not care for and that includes everything except power and grandeur and the order of saint gilbert and when mother alianora says them they fall softly on the ear as if they meant not love nor happiness nor any thing good and innocent but simply all that could grieve our lord and hurt a soul that loved him they are with her just the opposite of jesus christ oh if only our blessed lord had been on earth now and i might have gone on pilgrimage to the place where he was if i could have asked him all the questions that perplex me and laid at his feet all the sorrows that trouble me for i do not think he would have commanded the saints to chase me away because i maybe have poorer wits than other womenhe who let the mothers bring the babes to him i fancy he would have been patient and gentle even with me i scarce think he would have treated sorroweven wrong or mistaken sorrow if only it were realas some do with cold looks and hard words and gibes that take so much bearing i suppose he would have told me wherein i sinned but i think he would have done it gently so as not to hurt more than could be helpednot like some who seem to think that nothing they say or do can possibly hurt any one but it is no use saying such things to people once i did say about a tenth part of what i felt when mother ada was present and she turned on me almost angrily sister annora you are scarce better than an idiot know you not that confession to the priest is the same thing as to our lord himself well it may be so though it never feels like it but i am sure the priest is not the same thing if i were a young mother with little babes i could never bring them to any priest i have known save one and that was a stranger who confessed us but for a week some five years gone when the lord prior was ill he was quite different from the others there was a soul behind his eyessomething human not merely a sort of metallic box which sounded when you rang it with another bit of metal i never know why margarets eyes make me think of that man but i suppose it may be that there was the same sort of look in his i am not sure that i can put it into words it makes me think not of a dry bough like my heart feels to be but rather of a walled recluse something alive very much alive inside thick hard impenetrable walls which you cannot enter and it can never leave but itself soft and tender and sweet and i fancy that people who look like that must have had histories another person troubles me beside that man and margaret and that is saint peters wifes mother because if the holy apostle had a wifes mother he must have had a wife and what could a holy apostle be doing with a wife i ventured once to ask mother ada how it was to be explained and she said that of course saint peter must have been married before his conversion and calling by our lord and i dare be bound added mother gaillarde that she was a shocking vixen or something bad so as to serve for a thorn in the flesh to the holy apostle hed a deal better have been an unwedded man well some folks relations are thorns in the flesh i can quite suppose i should think mother gaillarde was and that her being a nun was a mercy to some man so that she was told off to prick us and not him but is every body so and are we all called to be thorns in the flesh to somebody i should not fancy being looked on by my relations if i were in the world as nothing but a means of grace it might be good for them but i doubt if it would for me i wonder if margaret ever knew that priest whose eyes looked like hers i should like to ask her but mother ada always forbids us to ask each other questions about our past lives she says curiosity is a sin it was curiosity which led eve to listen to the serpent but i do not think mother adas soul has any wings and i always feel as if mine hadsomething that if only i were at liberty would spread itself and carry me away far far from here right up into the very stars for aught i know poor caged bird as i am how can my wings unfold themselves i fancy margaret has wingsvery likely stronger than mine she seems to have altogether a stronger nature mother alianora will let us ask questions she sometimes asks them herself well so does mother gaillarde more than any body but in such a different way mother alianora asks as if she were comforting and helping you mother gaillarde as though you were a piece of embroidery that had been done wrong and she were looking to see where the stitches had begun to go crooked if i were a piece of lawn i should not at all like mother gaillarde to pull the crooked stitches out of me she pounces on them so eagerly and pulls so savagely at them i marvel what margarets history has been last evening as we were putting the orphans to bedtwo of the sisters do it by turns every weeklittle damia saith to me sister annora what is the matter with our new sister who dost thou mean my child i asked sister marian for sister marian was our last professed no said the child i mean sister margaret who has such curious eyeseyes that say every thing and dont tell any thingit is so funny so other folks than i had seen those eyes but what was the matter with her yesterday morning at the holy sacrament i know not damia for i saw nothing a religious as thou knowest should not lift her eyes save for adoration o sister annora how many nice things she must lose but i will tell you about sister margaret it was just when the holy mass began father hamon had said judica me and then you know the people had to reply quia tu es and when they began the response sister margarets head went up and her eyes ran up the aisle to the altar damia my child i said indeed sister i am not talking nonsense it looked exactly like that then in another minute they came back looking so sorry and so so tired if you will look at her you will see how tired she looks and has done ever since i thought her soul had been to look for something which it could not find and that made her so sorry had ever child such odd fancies as thou said i as i tucked her up now say thy hail mary and go to sleep i thought it but right to check damia who has a very lively imagination and would make up stories by the yard about all she sees if any one encouraged her but when i sat down again to the loom instead of the holy meditations which ought to come to me and i suppose would do so if i were perfect i kept wondering if damia had seen rightly and if margarets soul had been to look for something and was disappointed in not finding it i looked at hershe was just across the roomand as damia said there was a very sorrowful weary look on her facea look as if some thought or memory or hope had been awakened in her only to be sent back sorely disappointed and disheartened somebody else noticed it too my lady prioress was rather late last night in dismissing us sister roberga said she was sure there had been some altercation between her and mother gaillarde and certainly mother gaillarde as she stood at the top of the room by my lady did not look exactly an incarnation of sweetness but my lady gave the word at last and as she saidpax vobiscum sorores every sister went up to her knelt to kiss her hand took her own lamp from the lampstand and glided softly from the recreationroom halfway down stood mother alianora and at the door mother ada margaret was just behind me and as i passed mother alianora i heard her ask sister margaret art thou suffering in some wise i listened for margarets answer there was a moments hesitation before it came no mother i thank you save from a malady which only one can heal may he heal thee my child was the gentle answer i was surprised at margarets answering with anything but thanks mother you little know for what you pray that is often the case said mother alianora but he knoweth who hath to answer and he doeth all things well he will give thee maybe not the physic thou lookest for yet the right remedy i heard margaret answer as we passed on in a low voice as if she scarce desired to be heardfor some diseases there is no remedy but death there are two dormitories in our house and margaret is in the west one while i sleep in the eastern at the head of the stairs we part to our places that i should speak a word to her in the night is impossible and in the day i can never see her without a score of eyes upon us especially mother gaillardes and she seems to have eyes not in the back of her head only but all over her veil i suppose if we had lived like real sisters and not makebelieve ones margaret and i would have had a little chamber to ourselves in our fathers castle and we could have talked to each other and told our secrets if we wished and have comforted one another when our hearts were sad and i do not understand why it should please our lord so much more to have us shut up here making believe to be one family with thirty other women who are not our sisters except in the sense that all christian women are children of god i wonder where it is in the gospels that our lord commanded it to be done i cannot find it in my evangelisterium i dare say the holy apostles ordered it afterwards or perhaps it is in some gospel i have never seen there are only four in my book if that strange priest would come again to confess us i should like very much to ask him several questions of that sort i never saw any other priest that i could speak to freely as i could to him father hamon would not understand me i am sure and father benedict would rebuke me sharply whether he understood or not telling me for the fiftieth time that i ought to humble myself to the dust because my vocation is so imperfect well i know i have no vocation but why then was i shut up here when god had not called me i had no choice allowed me or why seeing things are thus cannot the master or some one else loose me from my vow and let me go back to the world which they keep blaming me because they say i love yet what should i do in the world my mother has been dead many years for her name is in the obituary of the house as to my brothers and sisters i no more know how many of them are living nor where they are than if they dwelt in the stars i remember my brother hugh because he used to take my part when the others teased me but as to my younger brothers i only know there were some i forget even their names i think one was hubert or robert or something that ended in bert and my sistersi remember isabel she was three years elder than i and was one elizabeth i think so but wherever they are i suppose they would feel me a stranger among theman intruder who was not wanted and who had no business to be there i am unfit both for heaven and earth nobody wants meleast of all god i do not imagine that is margarets history how far she may or may not have a vocationthat i leave i know nothing about it but i cannot help fancying that somebody did want her and that it might be to put her out of somebodys wayfoolish woman what am i saying why margaret was not five years old when she was professed how can she have had any history of the kind i simply do not understand it poor little damia i think mother gaillarde has given her rather hard measure i found the child crying bitterly when she came into the childrens south dormitory where i serve this week why whatever is the matter little one said i o sister annora was all she could sob out well weep not thus brokenheartedly said i tell me what it is and let us see if it cannot be amended its erneburg sobbed little damia erneburg but erneburg and thou art friends oh yes were friends enough only mother gaillarde wont let me give her the tig and little damia indulged in a fresh burst of tears give her what i said my tig the tig she gave me and now i must carry it all night long she might have let me just give it her i thought i saw how matters stood you have been playing yes playing at carry my tig to poynton brig and erneburg gave me a tig and i cant give it back moother gaillarde wont leet me with a fresh burst of sobs now whatever is all this fuss asked mother gaillarde from the other end of the room sister do keep these children quiet but mother ada came to us what is the matter she said in her icicle voice little damia was crying too much to speak and i had to tell her that the children had been playing at a game in which they touched one another if they could and it was deemed a terrible disgrace to be touched without being able to return it what nonsense said mother ada they had better not be allowed to play at such silly games go to sleep immediately damia do you hear give over crying this minute i wondered whether mother ada thought that joy and sorrow could as easily be stopped as a tap could be turned to stop water little damia could not stop crying so instantly as this and mother ada told her if she did not she should have no fruit tomorrow which made her cry all the more mother gaillarde then marched up and gave the poor child an angry shake and that produced screams instead of sobbing blessed saints these children said mother gaillarde i wish there never were any with all reverence i say it i do think if the almighty could have created men and women grownup it would have saved a world of trouble but i suppose he knows bestdamia stop that noise if not ill give thee another shake little damia burrowed down beneath the bedclothes from which longdrawn sobs shook the bed at intervals but she did contrive to stop screaming mother gaillard left the dormitory with another sarcastic remark on the dear delight of looking after children and the minute after mother alianora entered it from the other end she came up to where i stood by damias bed not all peace here she said with her tranquil smile little damia what aileth thee as soon as her voice was heard little damias head came up and in a voice broken by sobs she told her tale come i think that can be put right saith the mother kindly lie still my child till i come to thee again she went away and in a few minutes returned with erneburg of course mother alianora can go where the sisters cannot little damia she said smiling as she laid her hand on the childs head i bring erneburg to return thee thy tig now canst thou go to sleep in peace yes thank you mother you are good said little damia gratefully looking quite relieved as erneburg kissed her such a little thing said mother alianora with a smile yet thou art but a little thing thyself they went away and i tarried a moment to light the blessed mothers lamp and to say the hail mary with the children when i came downstairs the first voice i heard in the recreationroom was mother gaillardes well if ever i did hear such a story sister you ruin those children nay saith mother alianoras gentle voice surely not my sister by a little kindness such as that kindness indeed before id have given in to such nonsense sister gaillarde maybe some matters that you and i would weep over may seem full as foolish to the angels and to god and to him it may be of more import to comfort a little child in its trouble than to pass a statute of parliament ah me if god waited to comfort us till we were wise little comforting should any of us have but it is written like whom his mother blandisheth thus i will comfort youand mothers do not wait for children to be discreet before they comfort them at least my mother did not such a soft sweet tender light came into her eyes as made my heart ache my mother might have comforted me so just then i caught margarets look i do not know what it was like but quite different from mother alianoras something strained and stretched as it were like a piece of canvas when you strain it on a frame for tapestrywork then all at once the strain gave way and broke up and calm holy peace came instead if i might talk with margaret mother alianora is ill in the infirmary and i may not go to her i pleaded hard with mother ada to appoint me nurse for this week why she said in her coldest voice i could not answer either thou deceivest thyself sister she added which is ill enough or thou wouldst fain deceive me knowest thou not that to attempt to deceive thy superiors is to lie to the holy ghost as ananias and sapphira did how then dost thou dare to do it i see plainly enough what motive prompts thee not holy obediencethat is thoroughly inconsistent with such fervent entreatiesnor a desire to mortify thy will but simply a wish for the carnal indulgence of the flesh thou knowest full well that particular friendships are not permitted to the religious it is only the lust of the flesh which prompts a fancy for one above another if not every sister would have an equal share in thy regard it is a carnal worldly heart in which such thoughts dwell as even a wish for the company of any sister in especial and hast thou forgotten that the very purpose for which we were sent here was to mortify our wills i thought i was not likely to forget it so long as nothing was allowed me save opportunities for mortifying mine but one more word did i dare to utter is obedience so much better than love mother what hast thou to do with love save the love of god and the blessed mother and the holy saints the very word savoureth of the world all the love thou givest to the creature is love taken from god is love then a thing that can be measured and cut in lengths mother the more you tend a plant the better it flourishes if i am to love none save god will not my heart dry and wither so that i shall not be able to love him sometimes i think it is doing so you think she said what right have you to think leave your superiors to think for you and you cultivate holy obedience as you ought all the heresies and schisms that ever vexed the church have arisen from men setting themselves up to think when they should simply have obeyed but mother forgive me i cannot help thinking that shows how far you are from perfection sister a religious who aims at perfection should never allow herself to think except only how she can best obey beware of pride and presumption the instant you allow yourself to depart from the perfection of obedience but mother that is the perfection of a thing and i am a woman sister annora you are reasoning when your duty is to obey if holy obedience means to obey without thinking i am afraid i shall never be perfect in it i do not know how people manage to compress themselves into stones like that i tried mother gaillarde next since i had only found an icicle clad in mother adas habit i was afraid of her i confess for i knew she would bite and she did so i begged yet harder for i had heard that mother alianora was worse was i not even to see her before she died what on earth does it matter said mother gaillarde arent you both going to heaven you can talk therewithout fear of disobedience my lord prior said mother in his last charge that a convent ought to be a little heaven if that be so why should we not talk now mother gaillardes laugh positively frightened me it was the hardest driest most metallic sound i ever heard sister annora you must be a baby you have lived in a convent nearly fifty years and you ask if it be a little heaven i cry you mercy mother i asked if it should not be so thats another matter said she with a second laugh but it did not startle me like the first we should all be perfect of course pity we arent as she worked away at the plums she was stoning without saying either yes or no i ventured to repeat my question you may do as you are told was mother gaillardes answer cant you let things alone snappishly as she spoke yeti hardly know whyi did not feel the appeal to her as hopeless as to mother ada to entreat the latter was like beseeching a stone wall mother gaillardes very peevishness if i dare call it so showed that she was a woman and not an image mother gaillarde i said suddenlyfor something seemed to bid me speak outbe not angry with me i pray you i am afraid of letting things alone my heart seems to be like a dry bough and my soul withering up and i want to keep them alive and warm surely death is not perfection i was going on but something which i saw made me stop suddenly two warriors were fighting together in mother gaillardes face all at once she dropped the knife and hiding her face in her veil she sobbed for a minute as if her heart were breaking then all at once she brushed away her tears and stood up again child she said in a voice very unlike her usual one you are too young for your years do not think that driedup hearts are the same thing as no hearts women who seem as though they could not love any thing may have loved once too well and when they awoke from the dream may never have been able to dream again ay thou art right death is not perfection some of us maybe are very far off perfectionfurther than others think us furthest of all from what we think ourselves there have been times when i seemed to see for a moment what perfection isand it was far far from all we call it here god forgive us all go to the infirmary and if any chide thee for being there say thou earnest in obedience to me she turned back to her plumstoning with a resolute face which might have been a mask of iron and i after offering lowly thanks took the way to the infirmary i fear i have been unjust to mother gaillarde and i am sorry for it i seem to see now that her hard snappish speeches for she does snap sometimes are not from absence of heart but are simply a veil to hide the heart ah me how little we human creatures know of each others hidden feelings but i shall never think mother gaillarde without heart again note the rule of silence varied considerably in different orders but in all except the very strict nuns were at liberty to converse during some period of the day note this transferring of margaret from watton is purely imaginary part three chapter sister margaret do i not know the life of woman is full of woe toiling on and on and on with breaking heart and tearful eyes and silent lipsand in the soul the secret longings that arise which this world never satisfies longfellow mother alianora was lying in her bed when i entered the infirmary just under the window where the soft light of the low autumn sun came in and lit up her pillow and her dear old face she smiled when she saw me there was another sister in the room who was stirring a pan over the fire and at first i scarcely noticed her i went up to the dear mother and asked her how she was well my child she said tenderly nearly at home something came up in my throat that would not let me speak hast thou been sent to relieve sister marian she asked i know not said i after a moments struggle with myself then remembering what i had been bidden i added mother gaillarde bade me come we sat silent for a few moments sister marian poured out the broth and brought it to the mother and i supported her while she drank a little of it she could not take much just before the bell rang for compline mother ada came in i bring an order from my lady said she sister marian will be relieved after compline by another sister who will be sent up sister annora is to stay with the sick mother during compline and both she and the sister who then comes will keep watch during the night i was surprised i never knew any case of sickness unless it were something very severe and urgent allowed to interfere with a sisters attendance at compline but i was glad enough to stay mother ada went away again after her orders were given and sister marian followed her when the bell rang as soon as the little sounds of the sisters footsteps had died away and we knew they were all shut in the oratory mother alianora in a faint voice bade me bring a stool beside her bed and sit down annora said she in that feeble voice my child thou art fifty years old yet i think of thee as a child still and in many respects thou art so it has been thy lot whether for good or evilwhich who knoweth save godto be safe sheltered from very much of the ill that is in the world but i doubt not at times questionings will arise in thy heart whether the good may not have been shut out too is it so my child i suppose mother ada would say i was exceedingly carnal but something in the touch of that soft wrinkled hand in whose veins i knew ran mine own blood seemed to break down all my defences i laid my head down on the coverlet my cheek upon her hand and in answer i poured forth all that had been so long shut close in mine own heartthat longing cry within me for some real warm human love that ceaseless regret for the lost happiness which was meant to have been mine o mother mother is it wicked in me i cried you who are so near god you should see with clearer eyes than we lost in the tangled wilderness of this world is it wicked of me to dream of that lost love and of all that it might have been to me am i his true wife or is shewhoever that she may be am i robbing god when i love any other creature must i only love any one in heaven and am i to prepare for that by loving nobody here on earth the door opened softly and the sister who was to share my watch came in she must have heard my closing words my child said the faint voice of the dear mother who had always felt to me more like what i supposed mothers to be than any other i had knownmy child it is impossible that scandals should not come but woe unto them through whom they come it seems to me probable that one sin may be written in many books that the actor and the inciter and the abettoray and those who might have prevented and did notmay all have their share thy coming hither and thy religious life having received no vocation of god was not thy fault poor helpless oppressed child and such temptations as distress thee therefrom arising will not be laid to thy charge as sins but if thou let a temptation slide into a sin by consenting thereto by cherishing and pursuing it with delight then art thou not guiltless that thou shouldst feel thyself unhappy here in an unsuitable place and that thou mightest have been a happier woman in the wedded life of the worldthat is no marvel truly i think it of thee myself to know it is no sin to repine and murmur thereat these are forbidden thy lot is appointed of god himselfgod thy father who loveth thee who hath given himself for thee who pleased not himself when he came down to die for thee are there not here drops of honey to sweeten the bitter cup and if thou want another yet then remember how short this life is and that after it they that have done his will shall be together with him for ever dear hearts it is only a little while the sister who was to watch with me had come forward to the foot of the bed and was standing silent there when mother alianora thus spoke i fancied that i heard a little sob wondering who she was i looked up looked up to my great astonishment into those dark strange eyes of my own sister margaret margaret and i alone to keep the watch all night long what could my lady prioress mean here was an opportunity to indulge my will not to mortify it to make my love grow instead of repressing it i had actually put into my hand the chance that i had so earnestly desired to speak to margaret alone but now that the first difficulty was removed another rose up before me would margaret speak to me was she perhaps searching for opportunities of mortification and would refuse the indulgence permitted i knew as much of the kings court as much of a knightly tournament as i knew of that sealedup heart of hers should i be allowed to know any more annora said our aunt again there is one thine in my life that i regret sorely and it is that i was not more of a mother to thee when thou earnest as a little child of course i was under discipline but i feel now that i did not search for opportunities as i might have done that i let little chances pass which i might have seized my child forgive me dearest mother i said you were ever far kinder to me than any one else in all the world thank god i have heard that saith she ah childrenfor we are children to an aged woman like melife looks different indeed seen from a deathbed to what it does viewed from the little mounds of our human wisdom as we pass along it here there is nothing great but god there is nothing fair save christ and heaven there is nothing else true nor desirable nor of import every thing is of consequence if and just so far as it bears on these and all other things are as the dust of the floor which ye sweep off and forth of the doors into the outward life is the way upward to god or the way down to satan what does it matter whether the road were smooth or rough when ye come to the end thereof the more weary and footsore the more chilled and hungered ye are the sweeter shall be the marriagesupper and the rest of the fathers house aywhen we are there it was margaret who spoke and before let us look forward my child easy enough said margaret when the sun gleameth out fair and ye see the domes of the city stand up bravely afore but in the dark night when neither sun nor star appeareth and ye are out on a wild moor and thick mist closeth you in so that ye go it may be around thinking it be forward till ye know not whether your face is toward the city or no let thy face be toward the lord of the city said mother alianora he shall lead thee forth by the right way that thou mayest come to his city and to his holy hill the right way daughter is sometimes the way over the moor and through the mist who of you walketh in darkness and there is no light to him let him trust in the name of the lord and lean upon his god why my child it is only when man cannot see that it is possible for him to trust faith is not called in exercise so long as thou walkest by sight but when thou art utterly alone said my sister in a low voice with not one footstep on the road beside thee that art thou never child so thou be christs his footsteps are alway there in suffering ay but in perplexity daughter when thou losest his steps thou yet hast himself if any lack wisdom let him ask of god and god is never from home neither is satan greater is he that is in you than he in the world mother alianora seemed weary when she had said this and lay still a while and margaret did not answer i think the mother dropped asleep i sat beside her and watched but margaret stood still at the foot of the bed not sitting down and in the dim light of our one little lamp i could scarcely see her face as she stood only that it was turned toward the casement where a faint halfmoon rode in the heavens and the calm ancient stars looked down on us oh how small a world is ours in the great heavens yet for one soul of one little babe in this small world the son of god hath died my heart went out to margaret as she stood there yet my lips were sealed i felt strangely as if i could not speak something held me back and i knew not if it were god or satan or only mine own want of sense and bravery the long hours wore on the church bell tolled for lauds and we heard the soft tramp of the sisters feet as they passed and returned then the doors closed and mother adas voice said laus deo and sister ismanias replied deo gratias then mother adas footsteps passed the door as she went to her cell and once more all was silence on rolled the hours slowly and still mother alianora seemed to sleep still margaret stood as if she had been cut in stone without so much as moving and still i sat feeling much as if i were stone too and had no power to move or speak it might be about halfway between lauds and prime when the spell was at last broken and it was broken to my astonishment by margarets asking me a question that fairly took my breath away annora art thou a saint these were the first words margaret had ever spoken to me except from necessity that weary driedup thing that i call mine heart seemed to give a little bit of throb our lady love us no said i i never was nor never could be i am glad to hear it she said why margaret oh how my heart wanted to call her something sweeter it said my darling my beloved mine own little sister but my tongue was all so unwonted to utter such words that i could not persuade it to say them yet more to my surprise margaret came out of the windowcame and knelt at my feet and laid her clasped hands on my knee hadst thou said ay i should have spoken no more as thou art not annora is it true that we twain had one mother something in margarets tone helped me i took the clasped hands in mine own it is true mine own sister i said sister and mother she said they are words that mean nothing at all to me i wonder if god meant them to mean nothing to us could we not have been as good women and have served him as well if we had dwelt with our own blood as other maidens do or even if her voice died away margaret i said mother ada would say it was wicked but mine heart is for ever asking the same questions is it she said eagerly o annora then thou knowest i thought maybe thou shouldst count it wicked and chide me for indulging such thoughts how could i chide any one sinner as i am said i nay margaret i doubt not my thoughts have been far unholier than thine thou rememberest not i am sure but ere we were professed i was trothplight unto a young noble and always that life that i have lost flitteth afore me as a bird that held a jewel in his beak might lure me on from flower to flower ever following never grasping the sweet illusion margaret sister despise me not for my confession but thou wilt see i am no saint nor like to be despise thee she said dear heart wert thou to know how much further i have gone i looked on her with some alarm margaret we are professed religious women note religious women she answered if thou gild a piece of wood doth it become gold religious women are not women that wear black and white cut in a certain fashion they are women that set god above all things and have i not done that have i not laid mine heart upon his altar a living sacrifice because i believed he called me to break that poor quivering thing in twain and will he judge me that did his will to the best of my power and knowledge because now and then a human sob breaks from my womanheart by reason that i am not yet an angel and that he did not make me a stone i do not believe it i will not believe it he that gave his own son to die for man can be no moloch delighting in human sufferingcaring not how many hearts be crushed so long as there be flowers upon his altar how many lives be made desolate so long as there be choirs to sing antiphons annora it is not god who does such things but men i was doubtful how to answer seeing i could not understand what she meant i only said yet god permits men to do them ay but he never bids them to make others sufferfar less to take pleasure in doing so margaret said i may i know thy story i have told thee mine truly it is not much to tell no she said as if dreamilynot much only such an one as will be told out by the mile rather than the yard from thousands of convents on the day when the great doom shall be only the story of a crushed hearthow much does that matter to the fathers of the order there be somewhat too many in these cells for them to take any note of one i remembered what mother gaillarde had said it is terrible if that be true i answered i thought i was the only one and that made me unhappy because i must be so wicked at times in meditation i have looked round the chamber and thoughthere be all these blessed women wrapped in holy meditations and only i tempted by wicked thoughts of the world outside like lots wife at sodom margaret fairly laughed verily said she if it were given to us to lift the veil from the hearts of all these blessed women and scan their holy meditations i reckon thine amaze would not be small annora i think thou art a saint impossible said i why i fell asleep in the midst of the rosary a sennight backhaving been awake half the night beforeand father benedict said i must do penance for it saints are not such as i annora if the angels that write in mens books have no worse to set down in thine than what thou hast told me i count they shall reckon their work full light o humble and meek of heart thinking all other better than thyselftrust me they be at best like such as thou margaret left her station at my feet and coming round knelt down beside me and laid her head on my shoulder kiss me sister she said so did i at once without thought and then perceiving what i had done i was affrighted o margaret have we not sinned is it not an indulgence of the flesh wert thou made without flesh asked margaret with a short dry laugh no but it must be mortified sin must be mortified she answered more gravely why should we mortify love not spiritual love but natural love surely we renounce why should we renounce it does god make men sons and brothers husbands and fathers only that they may have somewhat to renounce can he train us only in the wilderness of sinai and not in the land flowing with milk and honey but we renounce them for him we renounce for him that which he demandeth of us margarets voice was low and sorrowful now ay there be times when he holdeth out his hand for the one dearest earthly thing and calls us to resign either it or him blessed are they that then howsoever they shrink and faint yet love him more than it and brace their will to give it up to him to them that so do annora he giveth himself and he is better than any earthly thing quid enim mihi est in caelo et a te quid volui super terram psalm verse but it seems to me that we ought to beware of renouncing what he does not ask of us if we are in doubt then let us draw the line on the safe sideon his side not on the side of our inclinations yet of one thing am i surethat many a woman mortifies her graces instead of her sins and resigns to god that which he asks not keeping that which he would have mortify graces i cried o margaret how could we i think thou wouldst sister if thou hadst refused to kiss me she replied with an amused smile but kisses are such very carnal things said i mother ada always says so she saith we read of none of the holy apostles kissing any body save only judas iscariot who told her so doth she find it written that they did not kiss any body annora i marvel if our lord kissed not the little children and i am sure the holy patriarchs kissed each other i do not believe in trying to be better than god i have noted that when man endeavours to purify himself above our lords example he commonly ends in being considerably less good than other men i wish we might love each other i said with a sigh and i am very much afraid i kissed her again i do not know what mother ada would have said i do not wish we might said margaret sturdily i do and i will but if we should make idols of each other said i i shall not make an idol of thee answered my sister again in that low sad tone i set up one idol and he came to me and held out his pierced hands and i tore it down from over the altar and gave it to him he is keeping it for me and he will give it back one day in the world where we need fear no idolmaking nor any sin at all annora thou shalt hear my story at that moment i looked up and saw mother alianoras eyes wide open do you lack aught dear mother i asked no my children she answered gently go on with thy tale margaret the ears of one that will soon hear the harps of the angels will not harm thee i was somewhat surprised she could say that what of the dread fires of purgatory that must come first did she count herself so great a saint as to escape them then i thought perhaps she might have had the same revealed to her in vision the thought did not appear to trouble margaret who took it as matter of course not truly that i should be surprised if mother alianora were good enough to escape purgatory for i am sure she is the best woman ever i knew but it was strange she should reckon it of herself mother ada always says they are no saints that think themselves such whereto mother gaillarde once added in her dry sharp way that they were not much better who tried to make other folk think so i do not know of whom she was thinking but i fancied mother ada did from her face then margaret began her story you know she saith it is this year fortyseven years since annora and i were professed and wherefore we were so used mere babes as we were knew i never then that i can tell thee i made answer for it was queen isabel that thrust us in hither our father did somewhat to her misliking what indeed i know not and she pounced on us poor little maids and made us to suffer for his deed was that how it was done said margaret then may god pardon her more readily than i have done for long years i hated with all the force of my soul him or her that had been the cause thereof it is past now the priests say that man sinneth when having no call of god he shall take cowl upon him what then of those which thrust it on him whether he will or no i never chose this habit for years i hated it as fervently as it lay in me to hate had the choice been given me any moment of those years i would have gone back to the world that instant the world her voice changed suddenly what is the world it is the enemy of god true but will bolts and bars walls and gates keep it out is it a thing to be found in one city which man can escape by journeying to another is it not rather in his own bosom and ever with him they say much of carnal affections that are evil and creep not into religious houses as if man should essay to keep satan and his angels out of his house by painting gods name over the door but all love of whatsoever sort say they is a filthiness of the flesh ah me how about the filthiness of the spirit is there no pride and jealousy in a religious house no strife and envying no murmuring and rebellion of heart and are these fairer things in gods sight than the natural love of our own blood doth he call us to give up that and not these may it not be rather that if there were more true love there were less envy and jealousy if there were more harmless liberty there were less murmuring when man takes gods scourge into his hands it seems to me he is apt to wield it ill but margaret said i so shouldst thou make satan cast out satan forbidden love were as ill as strife and murmuring forbidden of whom saith she god never forbade me to love my brethren and sisters he told me to do it he never forbade me to honour my father and motherto dwell with them to tend and cherish them in their old age he told me to do it ay and he spake of certain that did vainly worship him seeing they taught learning and commandments of men matthew verse vulgate o margaret what art thou saying holy church enjoins vows of religion tell me then annora what is holy church it is a word that fills mans mouth full comely that i know but what it is is simply the souls of all righteous menall the redeemed of christ our lord which is his body and is filled with his spirit when did he enjoin such vows or when did all righteous men thus band together to make men and women unrighteous by binding commands upon them that were of men not of god margaret my sister i cried in terror whence drewest thou such shocking thoughts what will father benedict say when thou confessest them it is not to father benedict i confess them she said with a little curl of her lips i confess to him what he expects to hearthat i loved not to sweep the gallery this morrow or that i ate a lettuce last night and forgot to sign the cross over it toys are meet for babes and babes for toys they cannot understand the realities of life such matters i confess toanother priest and he can understand them well said i i always thought father hamon something less wise than father benedict at least father benedict chides me and father hamon gives me neither blame nor commendation but margaret i do not understand thy strange sayings in any wise surely thou knowest what is the church i know what it is not saith she and that is father hamon or father benedict or father anythingelse christ and they that are christs the head and the body the bridegroom and the bride behold the church and behold her priest and confessor margaret saith mother alianora who taught thee that where didst thou hear such learning she did not speak chidingly but only as if she desired information i was surprised she was not more severe for truly i never heard such talk and i was sorely afraid for my poor margaret lest some evil thing had got hold of hermaybe the devil himself in the likeness of some sister in her old convent a wave of pain swept over margarets eyes when mother alianora said that and a dreamy look of calm came and chased it thence where she said in the burning fiery furnace heated seven times hotter than its wont of whom verily i think of that fourth that walked there who was the son of god he walks oftener methinks in the fiery furnace with his martyrs than in the gilded galleries with the king nebuchadnezzar and his princes at least i have oftener found him there she seemed as if she lost herself in thought until mother alianora saith in her soft faint voicego on my child margaret roused up as if she were awoke from sleep well she said nothing happened to me as you may well guess for the years of childhood that followed when i was learning to read write and illuminate to sew embroider cook and serve in various ways my lady prioress found that i had a wit at devising patterns and such like so i was kept mainly to the embroidery and painting being first reminded that it was not for mine own enjoyment but that i should so best serve the order i took the words and let them drop and i took the work and delighted in it so matters went until i was a maid of seventeen years and then something else came into my life i asked what was it for she had paused but her next words were not an answer i marvel she saith of what metal saint gilbert was made that founded our order was it out of pity or out of bitter hardness or out of simple want of understanding that he framed our rule and gave us more liberty than other sisters is it more or less happy for a lark that thou let him out of his cage once in the year in a small cell whence he cannot escape into the free air of heaven had i been his mother or his sister when the saint writ his rule i had said to him keep thy brethren and sisters apart at the blessed sacrament or else bandage their eyes o margaret i cried out for it was awful to hear such words as if the blessed saint gilbert could have made a mistake dost thou think thyself wiser than the holy saints yes she answered simply i am sure i know more about women than saint gilbert did that he did not know much about them was shown by such a rule he might as well have set the door of the larks cage open and have said to the bird now stay in well i did not stay in one morrow at mass i was all suddenly aware of a pair of dark eyes scanning my face across the nave from the brethrens side of the church o margaret well annora i am human so perchance was he he had been thrust into this life as i had had we both been free we might have loved each other without a voice saying it is sin why was it sin because we wore black and white habits but the vows margaret the vows what vows i made none worthy to be called vows i was bidden a little babe of four years to say ay and nay at certain times and i am willing and so forth what knew i of the import attaching to such words i do ensure thee i knew nothing at all save that when i had been good and done as i was told i should have a pretty little habit like the sisters and be called sister as these grown women were is that what god calls a vowa vow of lifelong celibacy dragged from a babe that knew not what vow nor celibacy were doth god lack your lie saith job job verse yea the psalmist crieth numquid adhaeret tibi sedes iniquitatis psalm verse wala wa the only thing i marvel is that he thundereth not down with his great wrath and delivereth not him that is in misery out of the hand of him that despoileth if it had been any other sister i think i should have been horribly shocked but do what i would i could not speak angrily to my own sister i wonder if it were very wicked in me but it surprised me much that mother alianora lay and hearkened and said nought neither was she asleep for i glanced at her from time to time and always saw her awake and listening truly she had little need of nurses for it was no set malady that ailed heronly a gentle general decay from old age why two of us were set to watch her i could not tell had i thought it possible that mother gaillarde could do a thing so foreign to her nature i might have fancied that she sent us two there that night just in order that we might talk and comfort each other if mother alianora had been the one to do it i might have thought such a thing or if my lady had sent us herself i should have supposed she had never considered the matter but mother gaillarde well whatever reason she had i am thankful for that talk with margaret so i kept silence and my sister pursued her tale he was not a brother she said but a young man training for the priesthood under the master but not yet had he taken the holy vows therefore i suppose thou wilt think him less wicked than me she looked up into my face with a halfsmile o margaret i wis not what to think it all sounds so strange and shockingonly that i have not the heart to find fault with thee as i suppose i should do margaret answered by a little laugh in short said she thou canst be wicked sometimes like other folk be it done i ensure thee annora it comforts me to know the same because it is not real wickedness only painted and i fear not painted sin any more than i hold in honour painted holiness for real sin is not paint it is devilishness and real holiness is not paint it is dwelling in god and god is love but not that sort of love i cried is there any sort but one she made answer love is an angel annora it is selflove that is of the devil when man helps man to sin that is not love how can it be when god is love and god and sin are opposites tarry until my tale be ended and then shalt thou be judge thyself how far rolands love and mine were sin go on said i well she said for many a week it went no further than looks then it came to words in the church no not in the church my scrupulous sister we should have felt that as wrong as thou through the wall between the gardens where was a little chink that i dare be bound we were not the first to find would that no sinfuller words than ours may ever pass athwart it we found out that both of us had been thrust into the religious life without our own consent i thou savest by the queens wrath which i knew not then he by a cousin that coveted his inheritance and we talked much and at last came to agreement that as neither he nor i had any vocation it would be more wrong in us to continue in this life than to escape and be wed but what priest should ever have wedded a sister to man training for holy orders none we were young annora we thought not of such things as for what should come after we were escaped we left that to chance nay chide me not for my poor broken dream for it was a dream alone the prioress found us out that night i was in solitary cell barred in my prison with no companions save a discipline that i was bidden to use and a great stone crucifix that looked down upon me ay i had one other but at first i saw him not nay nor for eight years afterwards cold silent stony that crucifix looked down and i thought he was like that the living christ that had died for me and i turned away from him my heart seemed that night as if it froze to ice it was hard and icebound for eight years during that time there were many changes at watton our prioress died and a time of sore sickness removed many of our sisters at the end of the eight years only three sisters were left who could remember my punishmentit was more than i have toldah poor soul lightly as she passed it thus i dare be bound it wasand these i imagine knew not why it was and at last our confessor died i thought i had utterly outlived my youthful dream roland had disappeared as entirely as if he had never been what had become of him i knew notnot even if he were alive i went about my duties in a dull wooden way as an image might do if it could be made to move so as to sew or paint without a soul life was worth nothing to meonly to get it over my love was dead or it was my heart which i knew not either came to the same thing there were duties i disliked and one of these was confession but i went through with them in the cold dull way of which i spake it had to be what did it matter one morrow about a week after our confessors death my lady prioress that then was told us at recreationtime that our new confessor had come we were commanded to go to him ten in the day and to make a full confession from our infancy my turn came on the second day so many of our elder sisters had died or been transferred that i was at twentyfive years one of the eldest beside the mothers left in the house i knelt down in the confessional and repeated the confiteor then in that stony way i went on with my lifeconfession the falsehood that i had told when a child of eight the obstinacy that i had shown at ten the general sins whereof i had since been guilty the weariness of divine things which ever oppressed me the want of vocation that i had always felt i finished and paused he would ask me some questions of course let him get them over there was silence for a moment and then i heard myself askedis that all thou hast to confessin the voice i had loved best of all the world my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth i only whispered roland in tones which i could not have told for mine own i scarce thought to find thee yet here margaret he said i wellnigh feared to do it but after thy confession i see wherefore god hath sent methat i may pour out into the dry and thirsty cup of thine heart a little of that spiced wine of the kingdom which he hath given to me mine heart sank down very low thou hast received thy vocation then i said and i felt the poor broken thing ache so that i knew it must be yet alive roland would care no more for me if he had received a vocation i must go on yet alone till death freed me alone for evermore i have received the blessedest of all vocations he answered the call to god himself margaret art thou thinking that if this be so i shall love thee no more nay for i shall love thee more than ever beloved god is not stone and ice he is not indifference nor hatred nay he is love and whoso dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us open thy heart to that love and then this little little life will soon be over and we shall dwell together beside the river of his pleasures unto the ages of the ages it sounds fair roland i said but it is far away my soul is hard and dry i cannot tell how to open the door then said he ask jesus to lift the latch and to come in thou wilt never desire him to go forth again i have much to say but it hath been long enough now every time thou prayest say also lord jesu come into mine heart and make it soft he will come if thou desire him and if thou carest not to do this for his sake do it for thine own i care not for mine own nor for any thing i answered drearily then saith he and the old tenderness came into his tone for a moment then margaret do it for mine i believe he forgot to absolve me but i did not miss it it is four and twenty years since that day and during all these years i have been learning to know christ our lord and the fellowship of his sufferings for as time passed on roland told me much of saintly men from whom he had learned and of many a lesson direct from our lord himself now he has taken rolands place not that i love roland less but i love him differently he is not first now and all the bitterness has gone out of my love not all the pain for we came to the certainty after a time when he had taught me much that we had better bide asunder for this life and in that which is to come we shall dwell together for evermore he was about to resign his post as confessor when the lord disposed of us otherwise for the master thought fit to draft me into the house at shuldham and after eighteen years there was i sent hither so roland i suppose bides at watton i know not the lord knows we gave up for his sake the sweet converse wherein our hearts delighted that we might serve him more fully and with less distraction i do not believe it was sinful that it is sin in me to love roland shall i never own but lest we should love each other better than we love him we journey apart for this lower life and i do not think our lord is angry with me when at times the longing pain and the aching loneliness seem to overcome me for a little while i think he is sorry for me for since i learnedfrom rolandthat he is not dead but the living onethat he is not darkness but the lightthat he is not cold and hard but the incarnate lovesince then i can never feel afraid of him and i believe that he has not only made satisfaction for my sins but also that he can carry my burdens and can forgive my blunders and if we cannot speak to one another we can both speak to him and entrust him with our messages for each other he will give them if it be good and before giving he will change the words if needful so that we shall be sure to get the right message sometimes when i have felt very lonely and he comes near me and sends his peace into my heart i wonder whether roland was asking him to do it and i pray him to comfort and rest roland whenever he too feels weary so you see we send each other many more letters round by heaven than we could possibly do by earth it was the last word roland said to methe road upward is alway open and et de hierosolymis et de britannia aequaliter patet aula caelestis note margaret was silent then said mother alianora child thou hast said strange things if they be good or ill god wot i dare not have uttered some of them thus boldly yet neither dare i condemn thee we all know so little but one thing have i learned methinksthat god will not despise a gift because men cast it at his feet as having no value for them i say not he will not despise such givers verily they shall have their reward but if the gift be a living thing that can feel and smart under the manner of its usage then methinks he shall stoop to lift it with very tender hands so as to let it feel that it hath value in his eyesits own value that nought save itself can have my children we are not mere figures to himso many dwellers in so many houses before him we are living men and real womeneach with his separate heart and every separate pang that rends it the church of god is one but it is his body and made of many members we know when we feel pain in what member it is is he less wise less tender less sensitive than we there are many margaret who would feel nought but horror at thy story i advise thee not to tell it to any other lest thou suffer in so doing but i condemn thee not for i think christ would not if he stood now among us dear child keep at his feet it is the only safe place and it is the happy place heaven will be wide enough to hold us all and before long we shall be there note to the mind of a roman catholic a religious person is only a priest monk or nun note from jerusalem or from england the way to heaven is equally nearjerome part three chapter annora finds it out peace peace poor heart go back and thrill not thus are not the vows of the lord god upon me it would really be a convenience if one could buy common sense people seem to have so little and i am sure i have not more than other people that story of margarets puzzles me sorely i sit and think and think and i never seem to come any nearer the end of my thinking and some never seem to have any trouble with their thoughts i suppose they either have more of them and more sense altogether so that they can see things where i cannot or elsewell i do not know what else but margarets thoughts are something so entirely new it is as if i were looking out of the window at one end of the corridor which looks towards grantham and she were looking from the window at the other end which faces towards spalding of course we should not see the same things how could we and if the glass in one window were blue and the other red it would make the difference still greater i think that must be rather the distinction for it does not seem to lie in the things themselves but in the eyes with which margaret looks on them dear mother alianora yet lives but she is sinking peacefully neither margaret nor i have been called to watch by her again i begged of mother gaillarde that i might see her once more and say farewell and all i got for it was mind your broidery sister i should not wonder if she let me go i do not know why it is but for all her rough manner and sharp words i can ask a favour of mother gaillarde easier than of mother ada there seems to be nothing in mother ada to get hold of it is like trying to grip a lump of ice mother gaillarde is like a nut with a rough outside burr there is plenty to lay hold of though as likely as not you get pricked when you try and if she is rough when you ask her anything yet she often gives it after all i have not exchanged a word with margaret since that night when we watched together she sits on the other side of the workroom and even in the recreationroom she rather avoids coming near me or i fancy so whatever i begin with i always get back to margaret such strange ideas she has i keep thinking of things that i wish i had said to her or asked her and now i have lost the opportunity i thought of it this morning when the two mothers were conversing with sister ismania about the christmas decorations in our own little oratory sister ismania is the eldest of all our sisters i thought said she if it were approved i could mould a little waxen image of our lord for the altar and wreathe it round with evergreens as an infant asked mother gaillarde wellyes said sister ismania but i could see that had not been her idea oh of course answered mother ada it would be most highly indecorous for us to see him as a man was it my fancy or did i see a little curl of margarets lips he will be a man at the second advent i suppose observed mother gaillarde mother ada did not answer but she looked rather scandalised and must we not have some angels said sister ismania there are the angels we had for easter sister suggested sister roberga sister roberga oblige me by speaking when you are spoken to said mother ada in her icicle manner there is only one will do again answered mother gaillarde saint raphael is tolerable he might serve but i know the archangel michael had one of his wings broken and the apostle saint peter lost a leg we had a lovely satan among those easter figures said sister ismania and saint john was so charming i never saw his equal satan may do again if he gets a new tail said mother gaillarde but pontius pilate wont that careless sister jacoba let him drop and he was mashed all to pieces your pardon mother but that was judas iscariot it wasnt it was pontius pilate i am sure it was judas i tell you it wasnt but mother i hold your tongue said mother gaillarde curtly and being bidden by her superior of course sister ismania had to obey i looked across at margaret and met her eyes and as margarets eyes always do they spoke these are holy women and this is spiritual love said margarets eyes ironically we might have spoken thus to our own brethren without going into a convent to do it i wonder if margaret be not right and we bring the world in with us that it is something inside ourselves but then i suppose outside there are more temptations yet do we not each of us make a world for herself is it not ourselves that we ought to renouncethe earthliness and covetousness of our own desires rather than the mere outside things oh i do get so tired when i keep thinking yesterday when erneburg and damia were playing at seesaw in the garden with a long plank balanced on the saddlingstone i could not help wondering how it is that ones thoughts play in that way each end seems sometimes up and then the other end comes up and that goes down i wish i were wiser and understood more perchance it was better for me that i was sent here for i never should have been wise or brilliant and suppose he were and that he had looked down upon me and disliked me for it that would have been harder to bear than this ha chetife have all religious women such stories as we two did mother ada ever feel a heart in her mother gaillarde does at times i believe as to my lady i doubt any such thing of her she seems to live but to eat and sleep and if mother gaillarde had not more care to govern the house than she i domother of mercy but this is evil speaking and of my superiors too miserere me domine as we filed out of the oratory last night as usual mother gaillarde stayed me at the door sister annora thou art appointed to the infirmary tonight and in a lower tone she addedit will be the last time i knew well what last time she meant never again in life should i see our dear mother alianora i looked up thankfully well said mother gaillarde in her curt way are you a stone image or do you think im one i kissed her hand made the holy sign and passed on no dear mother thou art not a stone in the infirmary i found sister philippa on duty o sister annora i am so glad thou art come i hate this sort of work and mother gaillarde will keep me at it i believe it is because she knows i detest it thou art not just to mother gaillarde sister i said and went on to the bed by the window annora dear child said the feeble voice ay she was weaker far than when i last beheld her thank god i have seen thee yet once more i could do little for heronly now and then give her to drink or raise her a little and she could not speak much a few words occasionally appeared to be all she had strength for towards morning i thought she seemed to wander and grow lightheaded she called once isabel and once aveline we have at present no sister in the house named aveline and when i asked if i should seek permission to call sister isabel if she wished for her she said no she will be gone to marlborough and what she meant i know not note then after she had lain still a while she said guendolenis it thou no dearest mother it is sister annora said i guendolen was here saith she where is she perhaps she will come again i answered for i saw that she scarcely had her wits clear she will come again she saith softly ay he will come againwith cloudsand his saints with him and guendolen will be theremy sister guendolen the princess note whom men cast forthchrist shall crown her in his kingdom the last of the royal line there are no princes of wales any more then i think she dropped asleep for a time and when she woke she knew me at first though she soon grew confused again christs blessing and mine be on thee mine own annora saith she tenderly margaret toopoor magot tell hertell her but her voice died away in indistinct murmurs they will soon be here who dearest mother joan and guendolen gladys perchance i dont know about gladys whiteall in white no black in that habit and they singno she never sang on earth i should like to hear guendolen sing in heaven the soft toll of the bell for prime came to her dulled ear are they ringing in heaven she said is it guendolen that rings the bells never rang for her below they have fairer music up there the door opened and mother ada looked in sister annora you are released come to prime oh to have tarried only a minute for a light which never was from sun or moon had broken over the dying face and she vainly tried to stretch her hands forth with a rapturous cry ofguendolen did the master send thee for me sister you forget yourself said mother ada when i lingered remember the rule of holy obedience i suppose it was very wicked of mei am always doing wicked thingsbut i did wish that holy obedience had been at the bottom of the red sea i kissed the trembling hand of the dear old mother and signed the holy cross upon her brow to protect her when she was left alone and then i followed mother ada after prime i was ordered to the workroom i looked round and saw that sister roberga and margaret were missing i did hope margaret and not sister roberga had been sent up to the infirmary of course i could not ask for two hours i sewed with my heart in the infirmary if the rule of holy obedience had been at the bottom of the red sea i am sure i should not have tarried in that workroom another minute and then i heard the passing bell it struck so cold to my heart that i had hard work to keep my broidering in a straight line a few minutes later margaret appeared at the door she knelt down in the doorway and made the sign of the cross saying peace eternal grant to us o lord and we all responded led by mother adalord grant to thy servant our sister everlasting peace so then i knew that mother alianora had been sent for by the master of us all sister margaret said mother ada margaret rose went up to mother ada and knelt again how comes it thou art the messenger i sent sister roberga to the infirmary this morning mother gaillarde bade me go to the infirmary said margaret in a low voice and sent sister roberga down to the laundry art thou speaking truth asked mother ada margarets head went up proudly king alfred the truthteller was my forefather she said well perhaps thou dost answered mother ada as if unwilling to admit it but it is very strange i shall speak to sister gaillarde what about said mother gaillarde appearing suddenly from the passage to my ladys rooms sister gaillarde this is very strange conduct of you said mother ada i ordered sister roberga to the infirmary you did sister and i altered your order i am your superior i believe mother ada who is usually very pale went red and murmured something which i could not hear nonsense said mother gaillarde to my unspeakable astonishment mother ada burst into tears she has so many times told the children and not seldom the sisters that tears were a sign of weakness and unworthy of reasonable not to say religious womenthat they ought to be shed in penitence alone or in grief at a slight offered to holy church that i could only suppose mother gaillarde had been guilty of some profanity it is very hard sobbed mother ada that you should set yourself up in that way when i was professed on the very same day as you what has that to do with it asked mother gaillarde and my lady shows you much more favour than she does me only today you have been in her rooms twice i wish she would send for you said mother gaillarde for it is commonly to waste time over some sort of fiddlefaddle that i despise you are heartily welcome to it i can tell you now come sister ada dont be silly and set a bad example it is all nonsense and you know it off marched mother gaillarde with a firm step mother ada continued to sob nobody could bear such treatment said she the blessed virgin herself would not have stood it i am sure sister gaillarde is not a bit better than i amof course i do not speak on my own account but for the honour of the order that is what i am anxious about it does not matter in the least how people tread me downi am the humblestminded sister in the house but i am a mother of the order and i feel sister gaillardes words exceedingly pride is one of the seven deadly sins and i do marvel where sister gaillarde thinks she is going i shall offer my next communion for her that she may be more humbleminded i am sure she needs it mother ada bit off her thread as she said this with a determined snap as if it had cruelly provoked her i was lost in amazement for mother ada has always seemed so calm and icy that i thought nothing could move her and here she was making a fuss about nothing like one of the children she had not finished when mother gaillarde came back what not over it yet said she in her usual style dear me what a storm in a porringer mother ada gave a bursting sob and a long wail to end it but mother gaillarde took no more notice of her only telling us all that mother alianora would be buried tomorrow and that after the funeral we were to assemble in conclave to elect a new mother it will be sister ismania i doubt not for she is eldest of the sisters and the one most generally held in respect in the evening at recreationtime sister philippa came up to me so we are to meet to elect a new mother said she with much satisfaction in her tone i always like meeting in conclave there is something grand about it for whom will you vote sister annora i have not thought much about it said i except that i suppose every body will vote for sister ismania i shall not said mother joan i see so little of mother joan that i think i have rarely mentioned her she is mistress of the novices and seldom comes where i am you will not mother for whom then said sister philippa if you should be appointed to collect the votes sister you will know was mother joans reply now is that not too bad said sister philippa when mother joan had passed on of course the mothers will collect the votes i fancy mother joan meant we sisters ought not to ask i said o sister did you not enjoy that quarrel between the mothers this morning cried she certainly not i answered i could not enjoy seeing any one either distressed or angry oh but it was so delightful to see mother ada let herself down cried philippa so proud and stuckup and like an icicle as she always is ha jolife and she calls herself the humblest sister in the house margaret had come up and stood listening to us who think you is the humblest sister philippa i dont know said sister philippa if you asked me who was the proudest maybe i could tellonly that i should have to name so many well i should need to name but one said i i would fain be the humblest but that surely am i not and i find so many wicked motions of pride in mine heart that i cannot believe any of us can be worse than myself i think i know who is the lowliest of us and the holiest said margaret as she turned away and i shall vote for her who can she mean asked sister philippa i do not know at all said i and indeed i do not dear mother alianora was buried this afternoon the mass for the dead was very very solemn we laid her down in the sisters graveyard till the resurrection morn shall come when we shall all meet without spot of sin in the presencechamber of heaven till then o holy and merciful saviour suffer us not now and at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee we passed directly from the funeral into conclave my lady sent word to the master that we were about to elect a mother and he sent us his benediction on our labour we all filed into our oratory and sat down in our various stalls then after singing the litany of the holy ghost mother gaillarde passed down the choir on the gospel side and mother ada on the epistle side collecting the votes when all were collected the two mothers went up to my lady and she then came out of her stall and headed them to the altar steps where they all three knelt for a short space then my lady turning round to us and coming forward announced the numbers thirtyfour votes for sister roberga one for sister isabel two for sister ismania eleven for sister annora twenty our sister annora is chosen it was a minute before i was able to understand that such an unintelligible and astounding thing had happened as that our community had actually chosen meme of all peopleto execute the highest office in the house next to my lady prioress herself mother gaillarde and mother ada came up to me to lead me up to the altar but it cannot be said i i felt completely confused thou art our sister annora i believe saith mother gaillarde looking rather amused and i marvel the less at the choice since i helped to make it i i said again feeling more amazed than ever at what she said but im not a bit fit for such a place as that oh do choose again and fix on somebody more worthy than i am the choice of the community guided by the holy spirit has fallen on you sister said mother ada in a cold hollow voice come along and dont be silly whispered mother gaillarde taking my right arm i really think mother gaillardes words helped to rouse me from my stupor of astonishment better than any thing else of course if god called me to a certain work he could put grace and wisdom into me as easily as into any one else and i had only to bow to his will but i did so wish it had been another who was chosen sister ismania would have made a far better officer than i and to think of such a poor stupid confused thing as i am being put over her head but if it were gods willthat settled the matter it all felt so dreamy that i can scarcely tell what happened afterwards i remember that i knelt before my lady and before the altarbut i felt too confused for prayer and could only say domine miserere me for no other words would come and then the master came and blessed me and made a short address to me of which i believe i hardly took in a word and appointed the next day for the service of ordination i am an ordained mother of the order of saint gilbert and i do not feel any difference i thought i should have done the master himself sang the holy mass and we sang veni creator spiritus and he said in his address afterwards that when his hands were laid on my head the holy ghost came down and filled me with his presenceand i did not feel that he did of course it was all very solemn and i did most earnestly desire the influences of the blessed spirit for i shall never be able to do any thing without them but really i felt our lord nearer me in the evening when i knelt by my bed for a minute and asked him in my own poor words to keep me in the right way and teach me to do his will i think i shall try that again now that i have a cell to myself i can do it and i sleep in dear mother alianoras cell where i am sure the blessed lord has been wont to come oh i hope he will not tarry away because i am come into iti who am so worthless and so weak and need his gracious aid so much more than she did i do wish if so great a favour could possibly be vouchsafed to me that i might speak to our lord just once he has ere this held converse with the holy saints of course i am not holy nor a saint nor in the least merit any such grace from him but i need it more than those who merit it oh if i could knowonce certainly and for everwhether it is earthly and carnal and wicked as people say it is for me to grieve over that lost love of mine sister ismania says it is all folly and imagination on my part because having been parted when we were only six years old i cannot possibly she says feel any real womanly love for him but i do not see why it must be grownup to be real and i never knew any thing better or more real it may not be like what others have but it was all i had i wish sometimes that i knew if he still lives and whether that other wife lives to whom i suppose somebody must have married him after i was thrust in here i cannot feel as if he did not still somehow belong to me if i only knew whether it was wrong i have been appointed mistress of the workroom and i ought to keep it in order how i can ever do it i cannot think i shall never be able to chide the sisters like the other mothers and to have them coming up to me when they are chidden and kissing the floor at my feeti do not know how i can stand it i am sure it will give me a dreadful feeling however i hope nothing will ever happen of that kind for a long long while what is the good of hoping any thing mother gaillarde says that hopes promises and piecrust are made to be broken certainly hopes seem to be after all my wishes if something did not happen the very first day when i got down to the workroom what should i find but sisters roberga and philippa having a violent quarrel they were not only breaking the rule of silence which in itself was bad enough but they were calling each other all manner of names i was astonished those two should quarrel for they have always been such friends that they had to be constantly reminded of the prohibition of particular friendships among the religious but when they did it reminded me of the adage that vernage makes the best vinegar sister isabel cast an imploring look at me as i entered which seemed to say do stop them and i had not a notion how to set about it except by saying my dear sisters our rule enjoins silence on my saying this which i did with much reluctance and some trembling both of them turned round and appealed to me she promised to vote for me and she did not cried sister roberga i did said sister philippa i kept my word there was only one vote for me answered sister roberga well and i gave it replied sister philippa you couldnt have done there must have been more than one why should there i know there was how do you know i do know you must have voted for yourself then you cant know otherwise said sister philippa scornfully sister roberga fairly screamed i didnt you vile wretch and went exceedingly red in the face sister roberga said i dont you interfere shrieked sister roberga turning fiercely on me you want a chance to show your power of course you poor whitefaced sanctimonious creature only just promoted and that because every body voted for you thinking you would be easily managed just like a bit of putty in any bodys fingers and making such a fuss as if you were so humble and holy professing not to wish for it faugh how i hate a hypocrite i stood silent feeling as if my breath were taken away yes isnt she cried sister philippa wanting sister ismania to be preferred instead of her after all her plotting with mother gaillarde and sister margaret i cant bear folks who look one way and walk another as she does i shouldnt wonder if the election were vitiatednot a bitand then where will you be mother annora where you will be sister philippa until compline said a voice behind me is prostrate on the chapel floor and after compline you will kiss the floor at mother annoras feet and ask her to forgive you sister roberta go to the laundrythere is nobody thereand do not come forth till i fetch you you also after compline will ask the mothers forgiveness oh how thankful i felt to mother gaillarde for coming in just then she said no more at that time but at night she came to my cell sister annora said she you must not let those saucy girls ride roughshod over you you should let them see you mean it but said i i am afraid i dont mean it mother gaillarde laughed then make haste and do said she youll have a beargarden in the workroom if you dont pull your curb a little tighter you may always rely on sister ismania sister isabel and sister margaret to uphold your authority it is those silly young things that have to be kept in order i wish you joy of your new post it is not all flowers and music i can tell you oh dear i feel so unfit for it i sighed mother gaillarde smiled sister i am a bad hand at paying compliments she said but one thing i will sayyou are the fittest of us all for the office if you will only stand firm give your orders promptly and stick to them pax tibi i have put mother gaillardes advice into actionor rather i have tried to put itand have brought a storm on my head oh dear why cannot folks do right without all this trouble sisters amie and catherine began to cast black looks at one another yesterday evening in the workroom and when recreationtime came the looks blossomed into words i told them both to be silent at once this morning i was sent for by my lady who said that she had not expected me to prove a tyrant i do not think tyrants feel their hearts go pitterpatter as mine did both last night and this morning of course i knelt and kissed her hand and said how sorry i was to have displeased her but indeed my lady said i i spoke as i did because i was afraid i had not been sufficiently firm before oh i dare say it was all right said my lady closing her eyes as if she felt worried with the whole affair only sister ada thoughti think somebody spoke to herdo as you think best sister i dare say it will all come right i wish things would all come right but it seems rather as if they all went wrong and i do not quite see what business it is of mother adas but i ought not to be censorious just as i was leaving the room my lady called me back it does feel so new and strange to me to have to go to my lady herself about things instead of to one of the mothers and it is not nearly so satisfactory for where mother gaillarde used to say do so of coursemy lady says do as you like i cannot even get accustomed to calling them sister gaillarde and sister ada as being a mother myself i ought to do now oh how i miss our dear mother alianora it frightens me to think of being in her place well my lady called me back to tell me that the lady joan de greystoke desired to make retreat with us and that we must prepare to receive her next saturday she is to have the little chamber next to the linenwardrobe my lady says she is of good lineage but she did not say of what family she came she commanded me to tell the mothers miserere said motherno sister ada what an annoyance it is to be sure when externs come for retreat she will unsettle half the young sisters and turn the heads of half the others i know what a worry they are humph said sister gaillarde of good lineage is she that means i suppose that shell think herself a princess and look on all of us as her maidservants she may clean her own shoes so far as im concerned do her good ill be bound she never touched a brush before some idle young baggage ive no doubt said sister ada marry she may be a grandmother said mosister gaillarde if shes eighty shell think she has a right to lecture us and if shes only eighteen shell think so ten times more you may depend upon it she will reckon we know nought of the world and that all the wisdom in it has got into her brains these externs do amuse me it is all very well for you to make fun of it sister gaillarde said sister ada peevishly but i can tell you it will be any thing but fun for you and me if she set half the young sisters not to speak of the novices and pupils coveting all manner of worldly pomps and dainties and she will as sure as my name is ada thanks for your warning said mother gaillarde ill put a rod or two in pickle the lady joans chamber is ready at last and i am dad such a business i have had of it i had no idea sister philippa was so difficult to manage and as to sister roberga i pity any one who tries to do it you see sister annora said sister gaillarde smiling rather grimly official life is not all flowers and sunshine i dont pity my lady just because she shirks her duties she merely reigns and leaves us to govern but i can tell you no prioress of this convent would have an easy life if she did her duty i remember once when i was in the world i saw a mountebank driving ten horses at once i dare say he hadnt an easy time of it but lackaday we have to drive thirty and skittish fillies some of them are i dont know what sister roberga has done with her vocation but i never saw the corner of it since she came well i said with a sigh i suppose i never had one stuff and nonsense said sister gaillarde if you mean you never had a liking for the life that may be trueyou know more about that than i but if you mean you do not fill your place well and do your duty as well as you know how and a deal better than most folkswhy again i say stuff and nonsense you are not perfect i suppose if you ever see any body who is i should like to know her name it wont be gaillardethat i know i wonder whose daughter the lady joan is something in her eyes puzzles me so as if she reminded me of somebody whom i had known long long agosome sister when i was novice or perchance even some one whom i knew in my early childhood before i was professed at all they are dark eyes but not at all like margarets margarets are brown but these are dark grey with long black lashes and they do not talkthey only look as if they could if one knew how to make them the lady joan is very quiet and attentive to her religious duties i think sister adas fears may sleep she is not at all likely to unsettle any body she talks very little except when necessary two months i hear she will remain and i do not think she will be any trouble to one of us even sister gaillarde says she is a decent woman shell do and that means a good dealfrom sister gaillarde i have the chance to speak to margaret now of course a mother can call any sister to her cell if needful and no one may ask why except another mother i must be careful not to seem to prefer margaret above the rest and all the more because she is my own sister but last night i really had some directions to give her and i summoned her to my cell when i had told her what i wanted i was about to dismiss her with pax tibi as usual but margarets talking eyes told me she had something to say i saidwell what is it margaret may i speak to my sister annora for a moment and not to the mother she asked with a look half amused and half sad thou mayest always do that dear heart said i i hope it was not wicked thenannora for whom is the lady joan looking looking i understand thee not margaret i think it is either thou or i she replied sister anne told me that she asked her if there were not some sisters of the despenser family here and wished to have them pointed out to her and she said to sister anne she whom i seek was professed as a very little child that must be either thou or i annora what can she want with us verily margaret i cannot tell i wondered if she might be a niece of ours she may said i i never thought of that there is something about her eyes that reminds me of some one but who it is i know not thou couldst ask her suggested margaret i scarcely like to do that said i but i will think about it margaret i was wicked enough to kiss her when i let her go this morning sister ada told me that the lady joan had asked leave to learn illuminating so she would spend her mornings henceforth in the illumination chamber that will bring her with margaret who is much there perchance she may tell her something it would be strange to see a niece or cousin of ones very own i marvel if she be akin to us somehow since i had that night watch with margaret my heart does not feel exactly the dry dead thing it used to do in times past i fancy i could love a kinswoman if i had one sister gaillarde said such a strange thing to me today i was remarking that the talk in the recreationroom was so often vapid and foolishall about such little matters we never seemed to take an interest in any great or serious subject sister annora said she with one of her grim smiles i always looked to see you turn out a reformer me cried i you said she but a reformer is a great grand man with a hard head and a keen wit and a ready tongue said i why should it not be a woman with a soft heart quoth sister gaillarde ha jolife cried i sister gaillarde you may be cut out for a reformer but i am sure i am not i looked up as i spoke and saw the lady joans dark grey eyes upon me what is to be reformed mother said she why if each of us would reform herself i suppose the whole house would be reformed i answered capital said sister gaillarde lets set to work who will begin said sister ismania every body will be the second replied sister gaillarde except those who have begun already thats very plain i expect every body will be the last said margaret sister gaillarde nodded as if she meant amen well thank goodness i want no reforms said sister ada nor any reforming said sister gaillarde certainly not she answered i always do my dutyalways nobody can lay any thing else to my charge and she looked round with an air that seemed to say deny it if you can it is manifest observed sister gaillarde gravely that our sister ada is the only perfect being among us i am not perfect by any means and really i feel oppressed by the company of a seraph im not nearly good enough perchance sister ada you would not mind my sitting a little further off and actually she rose and went over to the other side of the room sister ada tossed her headnot as i should expect a seraph to do then she too rose and walked out of the room sister ismania had laughingly followed sister gaillarde so that the lady joan margaret and i were alone in that corner my mother had a book of evangels said the lady joan in which i have sometimes read and i remember it said be ye perfect the priests say only religious persons can be perfect yet our lord when he said it was not speaking to them but just to the common people who were his disciples on the hillside is it the case that we could all be perfect if only we tried and entreated the grace of our lord to enable us to be so did your ladyship ever know any who was asked margaret the lady joan shook her head nevernot perfect my mother was a good woman enough but there were flaws in her she was cleverer than my father and she let him feel it he was nearer perfection than she for he was humbler and gentlergod rest his sweet soul yet she was a good woman for all that butno not perfect suddenly she ceased and a light came in her eyes you two she said looking on us are the despenser ladies i believe we assented do you mind telling mepardon me if i should not askwhich of you was affianced long years ago to the lord lawrence de hastings sometime earl of pembroke sometime ah me then my lost love is no more i felt as though my tongue refused to speak something was coming what i did not know margaret answered for me and the lady joans hand fell softly on mine did you love each other she said when you were little children if so we ought to love each other for he was very dear to me mother annora he was my father you i just managed to say ah you did i think she said quietly he died a young man in the first great visitation of the black death over twenty years ago and my mother survived him twenty years she married again and died three years since margaret asked what i wanted to hear i was very glad for i felt as if i could ask nothing it was strange how margaret seemed to know just what i wished who was your mother my lady the lady joan coloured and did not answer for a moment then she saidi fear you will not like to know it yet it was not her fault nor his queen isabel arranged it all and she hath answered for her own sins at the judgment bar my mother was agnes de mortimer daughter of the earl of march why not said margaret ah then you know not i scarce expected a despenser to hear his name with patience but i suppose you were so youngsisters he was the great enemy of your father so they wedded my lost love to the daughter of my enemy almost before the indignation rose up within me there came to counteract it a vision of the cross of calvary and of him who said father forgive them the momentary feeling of anger died away another feeling took its place the thought that the afterbond was dissolved now and death had made him mine again mother annora said the lady joans soft voice will you reject me and look coldly on me if i ask whether you can love me a little he used to love to talk to me of you whom he remembered tenderly as he might have remembered a little sister that god had taken he often wondered where you were and whether you were happy and when i was a little child i always wanted to hear of that other childyou lived eternal a little child for me many a time i have fancied that i would make retreat here and try to find you out if you were still alive do you think it sinful to love any thingsome nuns do but if not i should like you to love the favourite child of your lost love methinks said margaret quietly it is true in earthly as in heavenly things and to carnal no less than spiritual persons major horum est caritas first corinthians verse i hardly know what i said but i think joan was satisfied note her thoughts wandered to her married sister isabel lady hastings and monthermer who lived at marlborough castle note the last native princess of wales being the only certainly proved child of the last prince llywelyn and alianora de montfort she was thrust into the convent at sempringham with her cousin gladys part three chapter mortifying the will lorgueil nest jamais mieux deguise et plus capable de tromper que lorsquil se cache sous la figure de lhumilite rochefoucauld oh you have no idea how happy we are here said sister ada to joan i often pity the people who live in the world their time is filled with such poor mean things and their thoughts must be so frivolous now our time is all taken up with holy duties and we have no room for frivolous thoughts the world is shut out it cannot creep in here we are the happiest of women i happened to look at sister gaillarde and i saw the beginning of one of her grim smiles but she did not speak some of you do seem happy and peaceful said joan she says i am to call her joan but is it so with all sister gaillarde gave her little amen nod oh dear yes answered sister ada of course where the will is not perfectly mortified there is not such unbroken bliss as where it is but when the rule of holy obedience is fully followed out so that we have no will whatever except that of our superiors you cannot imagine what sweet peace flows into the soul now if father benedict were to command me any thing i should be positively delighted to do it because it was a command from my superior it would not in the least matter what it was nay the more repugnant it was to my natural inclinations the more it would delight me joans eyes wandered to two or three other faces with a look which said do you agree to this dont look at me said sister gaillarde im no seraph it wouldnt please me a bit better to have dirty work to do because father benedict ordered it i cant reach those heights of perfectionnever understood them if sister ada do im glad to hear it she must have learned it lately i do not understand it as sister ada puts it said i as joans eyes came to me i understand what it is to give up ones will in any thing when it seems to be contrary to the will of god and to have more real pleasure in trying to please him than in pleasing ones self i understand too that there may be more true peace in bearing a sorrow wherein god helps and comforts you than in having no sorrow and no comfort but sister ada seems to mean something differentas if one were to be absolutely without any will about any thing and yet to delight in the crossing of ones will now if i have not any wall i do not see how it is to be crossed and to have none whatever would surely make me something different from a woman and a sinner i should be like a harp that could be played onnot like a living creature at all two or three little nods came from sister gaillarde people who have no wills are very trying to deal with said margaret people who have wills are said sister philippa nay said margaret if i am to be governed let it be by one that has a will do this and go there may be vexatious at times but far worse is it to ask for direction and hear only as you like i dont know dont ask me now that is just what i should like said sister philippa i never get it worse luck did you mean me sister margaret said sister ada stiffly i cry you mercy mother i was not thinking of you at all answered margaret it sounded very much as if you were said sister ada in her iciest fashion i think if you had been anxious for perfection you would not have answered me in that proud manner but would have come here and entreated my pardon in a proper way but i am too humbleminded to insist on it seeing i am myself the person affronted had it been any one else i should have required it at once i said margaret got so far then her brow flushed and i could see there was an inward struggle then she rose from the form and laying down her work knelt and kissed the ground at mother adas feet i could hear sister roberga whisper to sister philippa that meanspirited fool sister gaillarde said in a softer tone than is her wontbeati pauperes spiritu quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum matthew verse thank you sister gaillarde said sister ada quickly i scarcely expected recognition from you you got as much as you expected then said sister gaillarde drily with a look across at me which almost made me laugh i told you i got more than i expected was sister adas answer did you mean it for her asked joan in so low a voice that only those on each side of her could hear i meant it for whoever deserved it was sister gaillardes reply just then mother joan came in and sat down sister ada she said sister marian tells me that my lady has given orders for that rough black rug that nobody likes to be put on your bed this week no has she cried sister ada in tones which if she were delighted very much belied her feelings how exceedingly annoying what could my lady be thinking of she knows how i detest that rug i shall not be able to sleep a wink well i suppose i must submit it is my duty but i do feel it hard that all the disagreeable things should come to me surely one of the novices might have had that it would have been good for somebody whose will was not properly mortified really i do thinkoh well i had better not say any more nor did she but that night as i was going round the childrens dormitory little damia looked up at me mother dear whats the matter with mother ada what did she say my child oh she didnt say any thing but she has looked all day long as if she would like to hit somebody somebody vexed her a little perhaps said i very likely she will be all right tomorrow i dont knowshe takes a long while to come right when any body has put her wrongever so much longer than you or sister margaret the lightning comes into sister margarets eyes and then away it runs and she looks so sorry that she let it come and you only look sorry without any lightning but mother ada looks i dont know howas if shed like to pull all the hair off your head and all your teeth out of your mouth and wouldnt feel any better till shed done it i laughed and told the child to go to sleep and not trouble her little head about mother ada but when i came into my cell i began to wonder if sister adas will is perfectly mortified it does not look exactly like it before i had done more than think of undressing sister gaillarde rapped at my door sister annora may i have a little chat with you do come in sister and sit down said i this worlds a very queer place said sister gaillarde sitting down on my bed it would not be a bad place but for the folks in it and they are as queer as can be i thought id just give you a hint sister that you might feel less taken by surprisei expect youll have a lecture given you tomorrow what have i done i asked rather blankly sister gaillarde laughed till the tears came into her eyes oh dear the comicality of folks in this world saith she sister annora do you know that you are a very carnal person indeed i have always feared so said i sorrowfully rubbish said sister gaillarde in her most emphatic style dont for mercys sake be taken in by such nonsense it is a wonder what folks can get into their heads when they have nothing else in them sister ada is very much concerned about the low tone of spirituality which she sees in youstupid baggage she is miserably afraid you are a long way off perfection im more concerned a deal about her but sister gaillarde it is true said i i am very very far from being perfect and i fear i never shall be well saith she if i had to go into the next world holding on to somebodys skirts id a sight rather they were yours than sister adas i do think some folks were born just to be means of grace and nothing else maybe it is as well some of them should get into nunneries some are rather trying i must admit said i sister roberga oh sister roberga shes just a butterfly and no better brush her offshes good for no more but she isnt one that tries me like some other folks you did not hear what happened yesterday between sisters ada and margaret no what was it some of the sisters were talking about hymns in recreation sister margaret said she admired the dies irae sister ada wanted to know what she admired she could not see any thing to admire it was just a jingle of words and nothing else the rhymes might be good to remember bythat was all i saw the look on sister margarets face of course she did not answer the mother but i did i told her that i believed if any one showed her a beautiful rose she would call it a red vegetable well quoth she and what is it else i never smell a rose or any other flower we were put here to mortify our senses sister ada said i the lord took a deal of pains for nothing so far as you were concerned well she said that was profane but i dont believe it the truth is shes just one of those dull souls that cannot see beauty nor smell fragrance nor hear music and so she assumes her dulness as virtue and tries to make it out that those who have their senses are carnal and worldly but just touch her pride and doesnt it fly up in arms depend upon it sister annora men are quite as often taken for fools because they can see what other folks cant as because they cant see what other folks can i dare say that is true said i butforgive me sister gaillarde ought we to be talking over our sisters sister annora you are too good for this world she answered rather impatiently if one may not let out a bit just now and then what is one to do but said i we were put here to mortify ourselves we were put here to mortify our sins said she and wala wa some of us dont do it i dare say old gaillardes as bad as any body but i cannot stand sister adas talk when she wants to make every creature of us into stones and stocks she just inveighs against loving one another because she loves nobody but ada mansell and never did oh i knew her well enough when we were young maids in the world she was an only child and desperately spoiled and her father joined in the lancaster insurrection long ago and it ruined his fortunes so she came into a convent thats her story ada mansell is the pivot of her thoughts and actionsalways will be nay said i let us hope god will give her grace to change if it be as you say itll take a precious deal of grace to change some folks said sister gaillarde satirically hope many of them wont want it at once or therell be such a run upon the treasury therell be none left for you and me well thats foolish talk my tongue runs away with me now and then dont get quite out of patience with your silly old sister gaillarde ah perhaps i should have been a wiser woman and a better too if something had not happened to me that curdled the milk of my human kindness and sent me in here just because i could not bear outside any longercould not bear to see what had been mine given to anotherwell well we are all poor old sinners we sisters and as to perfectionmy belief is that any woman may be perfect in any life so far as that means having a true heart towards god and an honest wish to do his will rather than our ownand i dont believe in perfection of any other sort as to all that rubbish men talk about having no will at all and being delighted to mortify your will and so forthmy service to the lot of it why what you like to have crossed isnt your will what you delight in cant be mortification it is just like playing at being good eh dear me there are some simpletons in this world well goodnight sister pax tibi sister gaillardes hand was on the latch when she looked back there now im forgetting half of what i had to tell you father hamons going away is hewhither cant say i hope our next confessor will be a bit more alive father benedict is alive i am sure father benedicts a draught of vinegar and father hamons been a bowl of curds i should like somebody betwixt and sister gaillarde left me she guessed not ill for i had my lecture in due course sister ada came into my cellhad she bidden me to hers i should have had a chance to leave but of course i could not turn her forthand told me she had been for long time deeply concerned at my want of spiritual discernment truly sister no more than i am said i now sister you reckon me unkindly i cast no doubt saith she but verily i must be faithful with you you take too much upon youyou who are but just promoted to your officeand are not ready enough to learn of those who have had more experience in short sister annora you are very much wanting in true humility indeed sister ada it is too true said i i beseech you sister to pray that you may have your eyes opened to the discerning of your faults saith she you are much too partial and prejudiced in your governance of the sisters and likewise with the children some you keep not under as you should and to others you grant too little freedom indeed sister i am afraid it may be so though i have tried hard to avoid it well sister i hope you will think of these things and that our lord may give you more of the grace of humility you lack it very much i can assure you i would you would try to copy such of us as are really humble and meek that i earnestly desire sister said i but is it not better to copy our lord himself than any earthly example i thank you for your reproof and i will try harder to be humble you know sister said she as she was going forth i have no wish but to be faithful i cannot bear telling others of their faults only i must be faithful i thank you sister ada said i so away she went sister gaillarde said when she saw me with one of her grim smiles well is the lecture over did she bite very hard she saith i am greatly lacking in meekness and humility and take too much on myself said i and i dare say it is true humph said sister gaillarde it would be a mercy if some folks werent and if one or two of us had a trifle more selfassertion perhaps some others would have less have i too much selfassertion sister i said feeling sorry it should be thus plain to all my sisters i will really sister gaillarde patted me on the shoulder with her grimmest smile you will really spoil every body you come near said she go your ways sister annora and leave the wasps in the garden abe why i do said i without they sting me exactly said sister gaillarde laughing and away i know not what she meant mother joan is something troubled with her eyes and the leech thinks it best she should no longer be over the illuminationroom but be set to some manner of work that will try the sight less so i am appointed thereto in her stead i cannot say i am sorry for i shall see more of joan since in this chamber she passes three mornings of a week i mean my child joan for verily she is the child of mine heart and my very soul yearns over her for sister though i be i cannot help the thought that had it not been for queen isabels unjust dealing i should have been her mother may the good lord forgive me if it be sin i know now that those deep grey eyes of hers with the long black lashes which stirred mine heart so strangely when she first came hither are the eyes of my lost love i knew in myself that i had known such eyes aforetime but it seemed to be long long ago as though in another world much hath joan told me of him and all i hear sets him before me as man worthy of the best love of a good womans heart and whom mine heart did no wrong to in its enduring love and i am coming to think seeing as it were dimly through a mistthat such love is not sin neither disgrace even in the heart of a maid devoted unto god for he knoweth that i put him first and take his ordering of my life as being his not only as just and holy but as the best lot for me and that which shall be most to his glory and mine own true welfare i say not this openly nor unto such as should be likely to misconceive me there are some to whose pure and devoted souls all things indifferent are pure and they are they that shall see god and man saith that in the world there are some also unto whose vile and corrupt hearts all things indifferent are impure and maybe not in the world only but by times even in the cloister so i feel that some might misread my meaning and take ill advantage thereof and i keep my thoughts to myself and to god i never ask joan one question touching him of whom i treasure every byenote that she uttereth yet i know not how it is but she seems to love to tell me of him is it by reason she hath loved that her heart hath eyes to see into mine not much doth joan say of her mother to me i think she names her more to others methinks i see what she wasa good woman as women go and some of them go ill with a little surface cleverness that she reckoned to run deeper than it did and inclined to despise her lord by reason his wit lay further down and came not up in glittering bubbles to the top i dare reckon she looked well to his bodily comforts and such and was a better wife than he might have had very likely a better than poor alianora la despenser would have made had god ordered it thus methinks from all i hear that he hath passed behind the jasper walls and i pray god i may meet him there they wed not nor be given in marriage being equal unto the angels but surely the angels love strange talk it was that joan held with me yesterday i marvel what it may portend she says of late years many priests have put forth writings wherein they say that the church is greatly fallen away from the verity of scripture and that all through the ages good men have said the same as was the case with the blessed robert de grosteste bishop of lincoln over two hundred years gone and with the holy thomas de bradwardine archbishop of canterbury and with richard rolle the hermit of hampole whose holy meditations on the psalter are in our library and i have oft read therein but now is there further stir as though some reforming of the church should arise such as bishop grosteste did earnestly desire joan says her lord is earnest for these new opinions and eager to promote them and that he saith that both in the church and in matters politic men sleep and nap for a season during which slow decay goes on apace and then all at once do they wake up and set to work to mend matters during the reign of this present king saith he the world and the church have had a long nap and now are they just awake and looking round to see how matters are all over dust and ivy which lack cleansing away divers both clerks and laymen are thus bestirring themselves the foremost of whom is my lord of lancaster the kings son john of gaunt among the lay folk and among the clergy one father wycliffe note that was head of a college at oxenford and is now rector of lutterworth in leicestershire he saith that is father wycliffe that all things are thus gone to corruption by reason of lack of the salt preservative to be found in holy scripture many years back did king alfred our forefather set forth much of the said scriptures in the english tongue as much indeed as he had time for his death hindered it else had all the holy hooks been rendered into our english tongue but now by reason of years the english that was in his day is gone clean out of mind and man cannot understand the same so there is great need for another rendering that man may understand now and this father wycliffe hopes to effect if god grant him grace but truly some marvellous strange notions hath he joan says he would fain do away with all endowing of the church saying that our lord and the apostles had no such provision but was that by reason it was right or because of the hardness of mens hearts surely the holy women that ministered to him of their substance did well not ill moreover he would have all monkery done away yea clean out of the realm and he hath mighty hard names for monks especially the mendicant friars yet of nuns was he never heard to speak an unkindly word strange matter in good sooth it nearly takes away my breath but to hear tell of it but when he saith that the pope should have no right nor power in this realm of england that is but what the church of england hath alway held bishop grosteste did as fervently abhor the popes poweregyptian bondage was his word for it much has this father also to say against simony and he would have no private confession to a priest verily this would i gladly see abolished nor indulgences nor letters of fraternity nor pilgrimages nor guilds and he sets his face against the new fashion of singing mass intoning then a new invention and the use of incense in the churches but strangest of all is it to hear of his inveighing against the doctrine of the church that the sacred host is gods body it is so saith he in figure and christs body is not eaten of men save ghostly and morally and to eat christ ghostly is to have mind of him how kindly he suffered for man which is ghostly meat to the soul arnolds english works of wycliffe volume pages here is new doctrine yet father wycliffe i hear saith this is the old doctrine of the apostles themselves and that the contrary is the new having never saith he been heard of before the time of one radbert who did first set it forth five hundred years ago in and after that it slumberedbeing then condemned of the holy doctorstill the year of our lord god when the pope that then was forced it on the church strange matter this i know not what to think joan says some of these new doctrine priests go further than father wycliffe himself and even cast doubt on purgatory and the worship this word then merely meant honour of our lady ah me if they can prove from gods word that purgatory is not i would chant many thanksgivings thereon all these years when i knew not if my lost love were dead or alive have i thought with dread of that awful land of darkness and sorrow yet not knowing i could have no masses sung for him and had i been so able i could never have told for whom they were but only have asked for them for my father and mother and all christian souls and have offered mine own communion with intention thereto ay and many a timedare i confess iti have offered the same with that intent if he should be to god commanded deadknowing that god knew and humbly trusting in his mercy if i did ill but for the worship of our lady that is passing strange specially to me that am religious woman for we were always taught what a blessing it was that we had a woman to whom we might carry our griefs and sorrows seeing god is a man and not so like to enter into a womans feelings but these priests sayi am almost afraid to write itthis is dishonouring christ who died for us and who therefore must needs be full of tenderness for them for whom he died and cannot need man nor womannot even his own motherto stand betwixt them and him o my lord have i been all these years dishonouring thee and setting up another even though it be thy blessed mother between thee and me yet surely he regardeth her honour full diligently said he not to saint john behold thy motherand doth not that apostle represent the whole church who are thereby commanded to regard her each righteous man as his own very mother this is the teaching of the church of rome i remember the blessed hermit of hampole scarcely makes mention of her it is all christ in his book and if it be soof which joan ensures mein the word of god whereof she hath read books that i have missedverily i know not what to think lord thou wist what is error save me therefrom thou wist what is truth guide me therein it would seem that i have erred in offering my communions at all for if to eat christs body be only to have mind of himand this is according to his own word hoc facite in meam commemorationemhow then can there be at all any offering of sacrifice in the holy mass joan says that saint pauls epistle to the hebrews saith that we be hallowed by the oblation of the body of jesus christ once and that where remission is there is no more oblation for sin truly we have need to pray lord guide us into thy truth and yet more lord keep us therein i must think hereon in sooth this i do and then up rises some great barrier to the new doctrine which i lay before joan and as quickly as the sun can break forth and melt a spoonful of snow does she clear all away with some word of saint paul she has his epistles right at her tongues end for instance quoth ichrist said he should bestow the holy spirit to lead the church into all truth how then can the church err what church said she boldly the church is all righteous men that hold christs words not the pope and cardinals and such like these last have no right to hold the first in bondage but said i father benedict told me saint paul bade the religious to obey their superiors how much more all men to obey the church i marvel saith she where father benedict found that never a word says paul touching religious persons there were none in his day no religious in pauls day cried i never so much as one saith she not a monk not a nun friar pareshull himself told me so much he is a great man among us saint peter bids the clergy not to dominate over inferiors saint paul says to the ephesians that out of themselves he was speaking to the clergy should arise heretics speaking perversely and saint john says believe not every spirit but prove the spirits if they be of god dear mother annora we are nowhere bidden in scripture to obey the church save only once and that concerns the settling of a dispute betwixt two members of it obey the church why we are ourselves the church has not father rolle taught you so much holy kirk quoth hethat is ilk righteous mans soul verily all churches be empowered of christ to make laws for their own people but why then must the church of england obey laws made by the bishop of rome therein said i can i fully hold with thee and for all things she said earnestly let us hold to gods law and take our interpretation of it not from men but straight from god himself lo here is the promise of the holy ghost assured unto the churchto you to me to each one that followeth christ they that keep his words and are indwelt of his spiritthese dear mother are the church of god and to them is the truth promised i said nought for i knew not what to answer there is yet another thing saith joan dropping her voice low can that be gods church which contradicts gods word david saith over all things thou hast magnified thy name note but i have heard of a most wise man that could read ancient volumes and dead tongues that saint hierome set not down the true words namely over all thy name thou hast magnified thy word now if this be soif god hath set up his word over all his namethe very highest part of himselfhow dare any assemblage of men to gainsay it what then of these indulgences and licences to sin which the popes set forth what of their suffering them to wed whom god has forbidden and forbidding it to priests to whom god has suffered it surely this is the very thing which god points at teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but joan said i my dear heart did not our lord say whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven surely that authorises the church to do as she will contrary unto gods word it may give her leave to do her will within the limits of the word i trow not contrary thereto when the king giveth plenipotentiary powers to his keeper of the great seal his own deposing and superseding i reckon are not among them all things are subject unto christ saith paul doubtless excepting him which did subject all things unto him so if god give power of loosing and binding to his church it cannot be meant that she shall bind himself who thus endowed her contrary to his own will and law i answered nought again for a little while at last i said joan there is a word that troubles me and religious folks are always quoting it if a man hate not his father and his motherand so forthhe cannot be our lords disciple i think i have heard it from one or another every week since i came here what say these new doctrine folks that it means ours are old doctrines mother dear saith she as old as the apostles of christ what means it why go forth to the end and you will see what it means he is to hate his own soul also is he then to kill himself or to go wilfully into perdition nay what can it mean but only that even these dearest and worthiest loves are to be set below the worthier than them all the love of the glory of god that our lord never meant a religious person should neglect his father and mother is plainly to be seen by another word of his wherein he rebukes the priests of his day because they taught that a man might bestow in oblation to god what his fathers or his mothers need demanded of him here again he reproves them because they rejected the command of god in order to keep their own tradition you see therefore that when the church doth this it is not ratified in heaven then said i after a minutes thought i am not bidden to hate myself any more than my relations why should we hate one whom god loveth she answered to hate our selfishness is not to hate ourselves i sat a while silent setting red eyes and golden claws to my green wyvern and joan ran the white dots along her griffins tail when she came to the fork of the tail she laid down her brush mother she saiththe dear grey eyes looking up into my faceshall we read together the holy scripture and beseech god to lead us into all truth dear child we will do so said i joan didst thou ever read in holy scripture that it was wicked to kiss folks she smiled i have read there of one saith she who stole up behind the holiest of all men that ever breathed and kissed his feet and the rebuke she won from him was no more than this her many sins are forgiven her and she loved much so if a full sinful woman might kiss christ without rebuke methinks if it please you mother dear you might kiss me well i knew all my life of that woman but i never thought of it that way before and it is marvellous comforting unto me my lady sent this morning for all the mothers together mine heart went pitterpatter as it always doth when i am summoned to her chamber it is only because of her office for if she were no more than a common sister i am sorely afraid i should reckon her a selfish lazy woman but being lady prioress i cannot presume to sit in judgment on my superiors thus far we found that she had sent for us to introduce us to the new confessor whose name is father mortimer he is tall and goodlooking so far as i a sister can understand what is thought to be so in the world and has dark flashing eyes which remind me of margarets and i should say also of that priest that once confessed us did i not feel certain that this is the same priest himself he will begin his duties this evening at compline sister gaillarde said to me as we came forth from my ladyhad i been a heathen greek and lived at the right time methinks i should have wed democritus democritus who was he said i he was named the laughing philosopher said she because he was ever laughing at men and things and methinks he did well what is there to laugh at sister gaillarde nothing you saw saint annora now you are laughing at me said i with a smile my laugh will never hurt you answered she but truly betwixt sister ada and the peacockthey both spread their plumes to be looked at i wonder which father mortimer will admire most you surely never mean said i much shocked that sister ada expects father mortimer to admire her oh she means nothing ill said sister gaillarde she only admires ada mansell so thoroughly herself that she cannot conceive it possible that any one can do otherwise let her spread her feathersit wont hurt any way it will not hurt him he isnt that sort of animal indeed i hope he is not when my lady dismissed us i went to my work in the illuminationroom where joan with sister annot and sister josia awaited my coming i bade sister josia finish the holy family she was painting yesterday for a missal which we are preparing for my lords grace of york i told sister annot to lay the gold leaf on the book of hours writing for my lady of suffolk and as margaret who commonly works with her was not yet come i began myself to show joan how to coil up the tail of a griffinshe said to put a yard of tail into an inch of parchment it appeared to amuse her very much to see how i twisted and interlaced the tracery so as to fill up every little corner of the parallelogram when the outline was drawn and she began to fill it with cobalt as i sat by she said suddenly yet softly mother annora i have been considering whether i should tell you something tell me what dear child quoth i i am afraid said she i shocked you yesterday making you think i was scarcely sound in the faith yet where can lie the verity of the faith if not in holy writ and i marvelled if it should aggrieve you less if you knew one thingyet that might give you pain let me hear it joan did you know said she dropping her voice low that it was in part for heresy that your own father suffered death my father cried i joan i know nothing of my father save only that he angered queen isabel and for what cause wis i not for two causes first because the king her husband loved him and she was of that fashion that looked on all love borne by him as so much robbed from herself but the other was that very thingthat she was orthodox and he waswhat the priests called an heretic there might be other causes some men say he was proud and covetous and unpitiful i know not if it be true or no but that they writ him down an heretic as also they did his father and archdeacon baldokso much i know i felt afraid to ask more and yet i had great longing to hear it and my mother said i i think i was like one that passes round and round a matter each time a little nearer than beforewishing and yet fearing to come to the kernel of it i have heard somewhat of her said joan from the lady julian my grandmother she was a leybourne born and she wedded my grandfather sir john de hastings whose stepmother was the lady isabel la despenser your fathers sister i think from what she told me your mother was a little likesister roberga i am sorely afraid i ought not to have answered as i did for it wasthe blessed saints forfend not altogether said joan with a little laugh i never heard that she was illtempered on the contrary i imagine she was somewhat too easy but i meant a little like what mother gaillarde calls a butterflywith no concern for realitiesfrivolous and lacking in due thought was your grandmother the lady julian an admirer of these new doctrines said i they were scarcely known in her day as they have been since said joan only the first leaves so to speak were above the soil but so far as i can judge from what i know i should say not so she was a great stickler for old ways and the authority of the church and your mother i was coming near delicate ground i felt now oh she i should say would have liked our doctrines better mother annora is there blue enough here or shall i put on another coat joan looked up at me as she spoke i said i thought it was deep enough and she might now begin the shading her head went down again to her work my mother said she was no bigot nor did she much love priests i dare venture to say had father wycliffe written then as he has now she would somewhat have supported him so far as lay in her power but my father i think would have loved these doctrines best of all i have heard say he spoke against the ill lives of the clergy and the idle doings of the mendicant friars and little as i was when he departed to god i can myself remember that he used to tell me stories of our lord and the ancient saints and patriarchs which i know now that i can read it to have come out of gods word ay methinks had he lived he would have helped forward this new reformation of doctrine and manners reformation cries mother ada entering the chamber i would we could have a reformation in this house what my lady would be at passeth me to conceive she must think i have two pairs of eyes and six pairs of hands if no more do but guess sister annora what she wants to have done nay that i cannot said i i foresaw some hard work for my lady is one who leaves things to go as they list for ever so long and then suddenly waking up would fain turn the house out o windows ere one can shut ones eyes why if she did not send for me an hour after we came out and said the condition of the chapel was shameful how could we have let it get into such a state father mortimer was completely scandalised at the sight of it all the holy images were all oer cobwebs and all and all of a bakers dozen of blessed times said sister gaillarde entering behind have i been at her for new pails and brushes never speak of soap i told her a spider as big as a silver penny had spun a line from saint peters key to saint katherines nose and as to the dustwhy you could make soup of it ive dusted saint katherine many a time with my hands for i had them if id nought else and trust me the poor saint looked so forlorn i fairly wondered she did not speak had i been the image of a saint somebody would have heard of it i warrant you when that spider began scuttering up and down my nose and now she bids us drop every thing and go and clean out the chapel this very morningto have done by vesper time did you ever hear such a thing said sister ada from the bench whereon she had sunk mother ada said sister josia would you show me mercy on us child harry not me cried sister ada but i do not know whether a lily should be in this corner by the blessed mary said sister josia or if the ass should stand here the lily by all means said sister gaillarde prithee paint not an ass theres too many in this world already i do wish father mortimer would attend to his own business cried sister ada or that we had old father hamon back again i do hate these new officers they always find fault with every thing ay new brooms be apt to sweep a bit too clean replied sister gaillarde mary love us but i would we had a new broom i dont believe there are twenty bristles left of the old one joan looked up from her griffins tail to laugh well what is to be done oh i suppose we must do as we are bid saith sister ada in a mournful voice but dear heart to think of it how many pails have you sister ada theres the large bouget and the little one the middlesized one is broken but it will hold some water two and a half then answered sister gaillarde well fetch them sister and i will go and see to the mops i think we have a mop left perhaps now if we din our needs well into my ladys ears we may get one or two more but sweet saint felicitas is there any soap half a firkin came in last week responded sister ada you forget sister gaillarde the rule forbids us to ask more than once for anything the rule should forbid prioresses to have short memories then come sister annot leave that minikin fiddlefaddle and come and help with the real work if it is to be done by vespers we want all the hands we can get i will fetch sister margaret to it she always puts her heart into what she has to do well you look sorely disappointed child i am sorry for it but i cannot help it i have no fancy for such vanities but i dare say you like better sticking bits of gold leaf upon vellum than scrubbing and sweeping sister annot i am ashamed of you said sister ada your perfection must be very incomplete if you can look disappointed on receiving an order from your superior you ought to rejoice at such an opportunity of mortifying your will thats more than ive done said sister gaillarde well sister ada as you dont offer to move i suppose we had better leave you here till you have finished rejoicing over the opportunity i hope youll get done in time to take advantage of it come sister annot i thought i had better follow so having given joan a few directions to enable her to go on for a time without superintendence i went to see after the waterbougets which should have been sister adas work she called after mesister annora ill follow you in a moment i have not quite finished my rosary i left her there telling her last few beads and went to fetch the bougets which i carried to the chapel just as sister gaillarde came in with her arms full followed by margaret and annot ive found two mops she cried mine was all right but where sister ada keeps hers i cannot tell howbeit sister joan has one now sister annora if you will bring yoursand see here these brushes have a few bristles leftthis is a poor setout though itll do to knock off spiders now sister margaret fetch that long ladder by the garden door sister annot you had better go upyou are the lightest of us and i am not altogether clear about that ladder but it is the only one we have welladay if i were prcatch hold of saint james by the head sister annot to steady yourself puff faugh what a dust we were all over dust in a few minutes i should think it was months since it had been disturbed for my lady never would order the chapel to be cleaned we worked away with a will and got things in order for vespers sister annot just escaped a bad fall for a rung of the ladder gave way and if she had not clutched saint peter by the arm down she would have come howbeit saint peter held happily and she escaped with a bruise just as things were getting into order and we had finished all the dirty work sister ada sauntered in well really said sister gaillarde i did not believe you could truly rejoice in the mortification of your will till i saw how long it took you thank you the mortification is done you will have to wait till next time i only hope you will let this rejoicing count theres nothing left for you but to empty the slops and wipe out the pails joan told me afterwards in a tone of great amusement that mother ada finished her beads very slowly and then said she would go after you but she stopped to look at sister annots work and at once discovered that if left in that state it would suffer damage before she came back so she sat down and wrought at that for above an hour then she was just going again but she found that an end of the fringe was coming off my robe and she fetched needle and thread of silk and sewed it on the third time she was just going when she saw the fire wanted wood so she kept just going all day till about half an hour before vespers and then at last she contrived to go note i may here ask pardon for an anachronism in having brought wycliffe forward as a reformer some years before he really began to be so the state of mens minds in general was as i have described it the uneasy stir of coming reformation was in the air the pamphlet which is so often but wrongly attributed to wycliffe the last age of the church had been written some fifteen years before this time but wycliffe himself though then a political reformer did not come forward as a religious reformer until about six years later note psalm verse vulgate the authorised version correctly follows the hebrewthou hast magnified thy word above all thy name part three chapter waiting if we could push ajar the gates of life and stand within and all gods workings see we could interpret all this doubt and strife and for each mystery could find a key but not today then be content poor heart gods plans like lilies pure and white unfold we must not tear the closeshut leaves apart time will reveal the calyxes of gold and if through patient toil we reach the land where tired feet with sandals loose may rest when we shall clearly see and understand i think that we shall saygod knew the best when we came out from the chapel after vespers my lady commanded sister gaillarde to follow her the rest of us went of course to the workroom where sister gaillarde joined us in about half an hour i saw that she looked as though she had heard something that greatly amused her but we could know nothing till we reached the recreationroom the minute our tongues were loosed sister ada attacked sister gaillarde as to what my lady wanted with her with one of her grim smiles sister gaillarde replied my lady is about to resign her office a storm of exclamations greeted the news why sister do tell us why she finds said sister gaillarde gravely the burden of her official duties too heavy i marvel what she reckons them to be quoth sister joan who though not sarcastic in the style of sister gaillarde can now and then say a biting thing so far as i ever made out her duties are to sit on cushions and bid other folks work exactly and that is too much labour for her which of us will be chosen in her stead i marvel said sister ada briskly i trust it may be one who will look better to her house than the present lady has done amen said sister gaillarde with a mischievous air i hope it will be sister joan truly i hope not answered the sister for if any such honour came my way which i expect not i should feel it my duty to decline it on account of my failing sight then you see my sisters quoth sister ada quickly to vote for mother joan would be to no good it would be little good to vote for mother ada i heard a voice whisper behind me and another replied she thinks we all shall i warrant i feel little doubt that sister gaillarde will be the one chosen one of us four it is most likely to be and the subprioress is oftener chosen than the rest sister gaillarde methinks would make a good prioress we had scarcely recovered from our surprise and had not half finished our talk when the bell rang for compline and silence fell on all the busy tongues all the young sisters and the postulants were eager to catch a glimpse of father mortimer and i saw a good deal of talk pass from eyes to eyes in the few minutes before the service began he sings full well and is most seemly in his ordering of matters if he be as discreet in the confessional as in his outer ministrations methinks i shall like him well howbeit he made a deal less impression than he would have done before my ladys intention was announced when we filed out of the chapel and assembled again in the recreationroom the tongues were set loose and i could see that the main stream of talk ran on my lady only one here and there diverging to father mortimer i sought out joan and asked if our new confessor were any kin to her she could not tell me beyond saying that she has three uncles and several cousins in the priesthood but since saving her uncle walter she has never seen any of them she could not speak certainly without asking himself i marvel i have not seen margaret all this even now i come to think i was so taken up with the news concerning my lady that i never thought to look for her and in chapel she sits on the epistle side as i do so that i see her not this morrow my lady called us into conclave and made known her resignation which she has already tendered to the master and bade us all farewell she will not tarry with us but goes into the daughter house at cambridge this somewhat surprises me though i see it does not sister gaillarde therell be more stir there said she think you my lady likes stir said i i have always reckoned her one that loved not to be stirred soothly said sister gaillarde yet she loveth well to sit on her cushions and gaze on the stir as a peepshow a few hours later we were all again assembled in conclave and the master himself with us for election of a new prioress and after the mass of the holy ghost we mothers went round to gather up the votes it fell as i looked and sister gaillarde is elected in all the house there were only nine that voted otherwise and of these four were for sister joan two for sister ismania and one each for sisters ada isabel and myself i feel sure that mine was margarets and joan says she is certain sister adas was her own i voted as before for sister gaillarde for truly i think her fittest of all for the place her ordination fallows next week verily said sister ada the next time we were at recreation i do marvel at sister gaillardes manner of taking her election not one word of humility or obedience but just took it as if it were her right and she were the most suitable person why that was obedience was it not responded sister ismania obedience it might be but it was not lowliness said sister ada tartly if i had been electof course i do not mean that i expected such a thing not for a momenti should have knelt down and kissed the chapel floor and protested my sense of utter unworthiness and incapacity for such an office sister isabel who sat by me said in a low voicemaybe some of your sisters would have agreed with you and though i felt constrained to give her a look of remonstrance i must say i thought with her sister ada as prioress would have been a sore infliction but now sister gaillarde herself came forward i do not think sister ada had known she was there to judge from her change of colour sister ada said she you are one of those surface observers who always fancy people do not feel what they do not say let me answer you once for all and any who think with you as a sinner before god i do feel mine unworthiness even to the lowest depth and i am bound to humble myself for all my sins and not least for the pride which would fain think them few and small but as for incapacity i do not feel that and i shall not say what i do not feel i think myself quite capable of governing this housei do not say as well as some might do it but as well as most would do and it would be falsehood and affectation to pretend otherwise i suppose in condemning hypocrisy our lord did not mean that while we must not profess to be better than we are we may make any number of professions and tell any number of falsehoods in order to appear worse than we are that may be your notion of holiness but suffer me to say it is not my notion of honesty i mean to try and do my duty and if any of my sisters thinks i am not doing it she will confer a favour on me if she will not talk it over with the other sisters but come straight to my rooms and tell me so i promise to consider any such rebukes honestly as before god and if on meditation and prayer i find that i have been wrong i will confess it to you but if i think that it was simply done out of spite or impertinence that sister will have a penance set her i hope now we understand each other and i beg the prayers of you all that i may rule in the fear of god showing neither partiality nor want of sympathy but walking in the right way and keeping this house pure from sin sister ada made no answer whatever sister ismania said with much feeling suffer me mother to answer for the younger sisters and i trust the mothers will pardon me if i am over ready sure am i that the majority of my sisters will consent to my reply we will indeed pray that you may have the grace of perseverance in good works and will strive to obey your holy directions in the right path i ask every sister who will promise the same to say placet there was a storm of placets in response but unless i was mistaken sister ada and sister roberga were silent it was while she was answering placet that i caught sight of margarets face what had happened to make her look thus white and wan with the expressive eyes so full of tears behind them which she could not or would not shed i sat in pain the whole day until evening and the more because she seemed rather to avoid me but at night when we had parted and all was quiet in the dormitories a very faint rap came at the door of my cell i bade the applicant enter in peace and margaret presented herself annora she said hesitating timidly i knew what that meant come to me little sister i said she came forward at once closing the door behind her and knelt down at my feet then she buried her face in her hands and laid face and hands upon my knee let me weep she sobbed oh let me weep for a few moments in silence and do not speak to me i kept silence and she wept till her heart was relieved when at last her sobs grew quiet she brushed her tears away and looked up bless thee annora that has done me good it is something to have somebody who will say little sister and give one leave to weep in peace dost thou know what troubles me not in the least dear margaret that something was troubling thee i had seen but i cannot guess what it was i shall get over it now she said it is only the reopening of the old wound thou hast not guessed then who father mortimer is margaret ay god has given my roland back to meyet has not given him it is twenty years since we parted and we are no longer youngnor i hope foolish we can venture now to journey on on opposite sides of the way without being afraid of loving each other more than god there can hardly be much of the road left now and when it is over the children will meet in the safe fellowship of the fathers home for ever dost thou know annora dear i am almost surprised to find myself quite so childish i thought i should have borne such a meeting as calmly as any one elseas calmly as he did there was a little break in her voice he always had more selfcontrol than i only i dare not confess to him for his own sake he would be tempted either to partiality or to too much severity in order to avoid it i must content myself with father benedict and when i want rolands teachingthose blessed words which none ever gave to me but himselfwilt thou give me leave to tell thee so that thou mayest submit the matter to him in thine own confession i willingly agreed to this but i am sorry for my poor child father benedict is terribly particular and severe i think father mortimer could scarcely be more so however hard he was trying not to be partial and i cannot help a little doubt whether his love has lasted like hers sweet saint mary what am i saying do i not know that every sister every priest in this house would be awfully shocked to know that such a thing could be it is better it should not and yetmy poor child this house no longer holds a sister or mother gaillarde she is now lady prioress having been ordained and enthroned this afternoon i must say the ceremony of vowing obedience felt to me less not more than that simple placet the other day which seemed to come redhot from the hearts that spake it the sister chosen to succeed her as mother is sister ismania i am glad of it for she is certainly fittest for the place mother joan becomes the senior mother our new prioress does not let the grass grow under her feet and is very different from her predecessor during the first week after her appointment such quantities of household articles began to pour in whereof in sooth we stood in grievous needthat we mothers were at our wits end where to put them i thought the stewards man would never have done coming to the grating with such announcements asfive hundredweight of wax if you please ladies a hundred pounds of candles ladies twenty oaks for firewood ladies two sacks of seacoal ladies ten pieces of nuns cloth ladies a hundred ells of cloth of linen ladies six firkins of speckled bristol soap ladiescloth of sarges serge cloth of blanket note cloth of rennes mops bougets knives beds cups jugs and amphoras baskets by the dozen quarters of wheat barley oats beans peas and lentils stockfish and ling ginger and almonds pipes of wine and quarts of oilnay i cannot tell what there was not sister ada lost her temper early and sorely bewailed her hard lot in having first to carry and find room for all these things and secondly to use them the old ways had suited her well enough she could not think what my lady wanted with all this mopping and scouring even sister joan said a little sarcastically that she thought my lady must be preparing for the possibility of our having to stand a siege my lady who heard both behind their backs smiled her grim smile and went on she does not keep in her own rooms like the last prioress but is here there and every where those of the sisters who are indolently inclined dislike her rule exceedingly for myself i think in truth we have been going along too easily and am glad to see the reins tightened and the horse admonished to be somewhat brisker yet i cannot say that i can always keep pace with my lady and at times i am aware of a feeling of being driven on faster than i can go without being out of breath and perhaps risking a fall a little occasional rest would certainly be a relief howbeit life is our workingday and there will be time to rest in heaven joan tells me that she has had some talk with father mortimer and finds that her mother and he were cousins he being the only son of her grandfathers brother sir john de mortimer who died young in the tiltyard note it is strange passing strange that he and margaret should have been drawn to one anotherhe the nephew and she the daughter of men who were deadly enemies from what joan saith i can gather that this grandfather of hers must have been a very evil man in many ways i love not to hear of evil things and men and i do somewhat check her when she speaks on that head was it not for eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil that our first fathers were turned out of paradise yet the psalmist speaks of god as he that teacheth man knowledge i will ask father mortimer to explain it when i confess the time is not far off now when my child joan must leave us and i shrink from it as it draws near i would either that she were one of us or that i could go back to the world yet neither can be seeing she is wedded wife and mother and for me is not this the very carnal affection which religious persons are bidden to root out of their hearts yet the apostle saint john saith we are to love our brethren how can i do both is it lawful to love only so long as we love not one above another but our lord himself had his beloved disciple and surely ones own mother must ever be more to her daughter than some other womans mother this also i will ask father mortimer lackaday this world is full of puzzles or rather it is this life i would one might see the way a little clearermight have as it were a thread put into ones hand to guide one out of the labyrinth like that old grecian story which we teach the children some folks seem to lose their way easier than others and some scarcely seem to behold any labyrinth at allthey walk right through those matters which are walls and hedges to others and look as though they never perceived that any such things were there is it because of recklessness of right or of singleheartedness and sincerity there are three matters to lay before father mortimer i shall think long till the time come and i hope he will be patient with me so soon as i stepped forth of my cell this morrow i was aware of a kind of soft sobbing at no great distance i went towards it and as i turned the corner of the corridor i came on a young novice by name denise who sat on the ground with a pail before her and a flannel and piece of soap on one side of it what is the matter child said i mother ismania bade me scrub the boards said she well wherefore no denise fell asobbing yet more for a minute or two might i not come at the reason but at the last i didshe was a kinswoman of sir michael de la pole and thought it so degrading to be set to scrub boards why dear heart said i we all do work of this fashion oh yes common sisters may quoth she well said i we cannot be all uncommon i ensure thee denise there are here many daughters of better houses than thine mother ismania herself is daughter of an offshoot of the percys and sister isabel is a neville by her mother my lady is a fitzhugh of ravenswath well sisters came from behind us in my ladys most sarcastic voice you choose a nice time for comparing your pedigrees maybe it were as well to leave that interesting amusement for recreationtime and scrub the corridor just now sister denise melted again into tears and i turned to explain your pail looks pretty full sister said my lady grimly much more water will make it overflow may it please you madam said i sister denise is thus distressed because she being a de la pole is set to scrubbing and such like menial work oh is she indeed laughed my lady sister do you know what mother annora is sister denise could only shake her head her mother was granddaughter to king edward of westminster said my lady if we three were in the world i should be scantly fit to bear her train and you would be little better than her washerwoman but i never heard her grumble to scour the corridor and she has done it more times than ever you thought about it foolish child to suppose there was any degradation in honest work was not our blessed lord himself a carpenter i warrant the holy virgin kept her boards clean and did not say she was too good to scrub no woman alive is too good to do her duty sister denise brake forth into fresh sobs a wawawasherwoman to be called a washerwoman note me kinswoman of sir michael de la pole and sir richard to boota washerwowoman dont be a goose said my lady de la pole indeed who be these de la poles why no more than merchants of lombard street selling towelling at fivepence the ell and coverchiefs of cambray note at seven shillings the piece truly a goodly pedigree to boast of thus loudly but madam cries sister deniseher tears methinks burned up by her vexationbethink you sir michael my cousin is a knight and his wife the lady katherine heiress of wingfield and the lady katherine his mother longeth to the knights de norwich and look you his sister is my lady scrope and his cousin wedded the heir of the lord cobham of kent nay tarry not there said my lady do go a bit further while thou art about it was not my lady joan cobhams mother daughter to my lady of devon whose mother was daughter unto king edward of westminsterso thou art akin to the king himself i cry thee mercy my lady princess that i set thee to scrub boardssister annora prithee let this princely damsel go to school for a bitshes short of heraldry the heiress of wingfield the lady katherine forsooth and the daughter of sir john de norwich a lady at all why child we only call the kings kinswomen the lord and lady as to thy cousin sir michael he is a woolmonger and lindraper linen draper the en is a corruption that the king thought fit to advance because it pleased him and maybe he had parts talents of some sort sure thou hast no need to stick up thy back o that count tomorrow sister denise thou wilt please to clean the firedogs and carry forth the ashes to the lyeheapcome sister annora i lack you elsewhere poor little denise broke into bitterer tears than ever but i could not stay to comfort her for i had to follow my lady i do vow this world is full of fools said she as we went along the corridor we shall have sister parnel next protesting that she knows not how much oats be a bushel and denying to rub in the salt to a bacon lest it should make her fingers sore and tis always those who have small reason that make fusses like this a kings daughter when she takes the veil looks for no different treatment from the rest but a squires daughter expects to have a round dozen of her sisters told off to wait upon hersister egeline feathers for stuffing are threefarthings a pound prithee strew not all the floors therewith sister egeline had dropped no more than one but my lady is lynxeyed truly it was time some one took this house in hand had my sometime lady ruled it another twelvemonth there would have been never a bit of discipline left theres none so much now sister roberga had better look out if she gives me many more pert answers shell find herself barred into the penitential cell on bread and water by this time we had reached the kitchen sister philippa was just coming out of it carrying one hand covered with her veil my lady came to a sudden halt what have you there sister sister philippa looked red and confused i have cut my finger she said my ladys hand went into her pocket hold it forth said she and i will bind it up i always carry linen and emplasture sister philippa made half a dozen lame excuses but at last held out her left hand having if i saw rightly passed something into the other under cover of her veil which finger said my lady who to my surprise took no notice of her action this said sister philippa holding out the first my lady studied it closely it must have healed quick said she for i see never a scratch upon it oh then it is that quoth sister philippa holding forth the second finder i rather think sister it is the other hand said my lady let me look at that as my lady was holding sister philippas left hand she had no chance to pass her hidden treasure into it she held forth her right handfull unwillingly as i sawand something rustled down her gown and dropped with a flop at her feet pick that up sister annora said my lady i obeyed and unfolding a german coverchief found therein a flampoynt and three placentae a pork pie and three cheesecakes what were you going to do with these said my lady its always my luck cried sister philippa nothing ever prospers if i do it saint elizabeths loaves turned into roses but no saint that liveth ever wrought a miracle for me it is quite as well sister that evil deeds should not prosper was my ladys answer saint elizabeth was carrying loaves to feed the poor was that your object if so you shall be forgiven but next time ask leave first sister philippa grew redder was that your intention my lady persisted i am sure i am as poor as any body sobbed the sister we never get any thing good all the nice things we make go to the poor or to guests i cant see why one might not have a bite ones self were you going to eat them yourself one of them i was the others were for sister roberga sister roberga shall answer for herself i will have no taletelling in my house this evening at supper sister you will stand at the end of the refectory with that placenta in your hand and say in the hearing of all the sistersi stole this placenta from the kitchen and i ask pardon of god and the saints for that theft then you may eat it if you choose to do so my lady confiscated the remainder leaving the placenta in sister philippas hand she looked for a minute as if she would heartily like to throw it down and stamp on it but either she feared to bring on herself a heavier punishment or she did not wish to lose the dainty she wrapped it in her coverchief and went upstairs sobbing as she went my lady despatched sister marian at once to fetch sister roberga she came looking defiant enough and confessed brazenly that she knew of sister philippas theft and had incited her to it i thought as much said my lady sternly and therefore i dealt the more lightly with your poor dupe over whom i have suspected your influence for evil a long while sister annora do you and sister isabel take this sinner to the penitential cell and i will take counsel how to use her we tried to obey but sister roberga proved so unmanageable that we had to call in three more sisters ere we could lodge her in the cell at long last we did it but my arms ached for some time after sister philippa performed her penance looking very shamefaced but she left the placenta on the table of the refectory and i liked her all the better for doing so i think my lady did the same sister roberga abode in the penitential cell till evening when my lady sent for the four mothers and we found there the master himself father benedict and father mortimer the case was talked over and it was agreed that sister roberga should be transferred to shuldham where as is reported the prioress is very strict and knows how to hold her curb this is practically a sentence of expulsion we four all agreed that she was the black sheep in the abbey and that several of the younger sistersin especial sister philippawould conduct themselves far better if she were removed sister ismania was sent to tell her the sentence she tossed her head and pretended not to care but i cannot believe she will not feel the terrible disgrace oh why do women enter into the cloister who have no vocation and ah me why is it forced upon them at last i have been to confession to father mortimer and i think i understand better what margaret means when she speaks of confessing to father benedict such things as he expects to hear i never could see why it must be a sin to eat a lettuce without making the holy sign over it surely if one thanks god for all he gives us he will not be angered because one does not repeat the thanksgiving for every little separate thing such thoughts of god seem to me to be bringing him down and making him seem full of little foolish details like menand like the poorestminded sort of men too i see that people of high intellect while they take much care of details that go to make perfectionas every atom of a flower is beautifully finishedtake no care at all for mere trivialitieswhat my lady calls fadssuch as is i think making the sign of the cross over every mouthful one eats well i made my confession and was absolved and i told the priest that i much wished to ask his explanation of various matters that perplexed me he bade me say on freely father said i i pray you tell me first is knowledge good or evil solomon saith my daughter that a wise man is strong and the prophet osee laments that gods people are destroyed for lack of knowledge our lord chideth the lawyers of the jews because they took away the key of knowledge and paul counted all things but loss for the knowledge of jesu christ here is wisdom why was adam forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge seeing it was knowledge of good no less than evil partly doubtless to test his obedience yet partly also i think because though the knowledge might be good in itself it was not good for him god never satisfies mere curiosity he will tell thee how to come to heaven but what thou wilt find there that he will not tell thee save that he is there and sin suffering and sathanas are not there he will aid thee to overcome thy sins but how sin first entered into the fair creation which he made so good thou mayest ask but he gives no answer many things there are which perhaps we may know with safety and profit in heaven that would not be good for us to know here on earth knowledge of god thou mayest haveyea to the full so far as thine earthen vessel can hold it even here yet beware being but an earthen vessel that thy knowledge puff thee not up then shall it work thee ill instead of good moreover have nought to do with knowledge of evil for that is ill altogether then how is it father said i that some folks see their way so much plainer than others and never become tangled in labyrinths they seem to see in a moment one thing to be done and that only not as though they walked along a road which parted in twain and knew not which turn to take there may be many reasons some have more wit than others and thus perceive the best way some are less readily turned aside by minor considerations some let their will conflict with gods will and some desire to perceive his only and to follow it those last are perfect men said i ay he made answer or rather they are sinners whom christ first loved and taught to love him back my daughter love is the great clue to lead thee out of labyrinths whom lovest thoujesu christ or sister alianora now father you land me in my last puzzle i have always been taught ever since i came hither a little child that love of god and the holy saints is the only love allowed to a religious woman all other love is worldly carnal and wicked tell me is this true no the word came quick and curt truly said i it would give me great relief to be assured of that the love of our kindred then is permitted whoso loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen and this mandate we have from god that he who loveth god love his brother also father said i fairly enchanted to hear such words are those words of some holy doctor such as saint austin they are the words saith he softly of the disciple that jesu loved he seems to have caught a glimmer of his master but said i doth it mean my mothers son or only my brother in religion it can scarcely exclude thy mothers son saith he somewhat drily daughter see thou put god first and love all other as much as ever thou canst ha jolife cried i if the church will but allow it what god commandeth said he can not his church disallow methought i heard a faint stress on the pronoun father said i are there more churches than one there is one bride of christ there is also a synagogue of satan ah that i count is the eastern church that man saith hath departed from the faith they that depart from the faith make that church i fear they may so do in the west as well as the east well in the most holy universal church are counted both the holy roman church and our own mother the church of england said i i know not if it include the eastern schism or no all these saith he are names of men and shall perish all that is of man must come to nought the church catholic true and holy is not of man but of god in her is gathered every saved soul whether he come from the east or from the west from the north or from the south she is not pauline nor petrine nor johannine but christian the heavenly bridegroom cannot have two brides one is my dove my perfect one there are many counties in england there is but one realm so there are many socalled churches there is but one holy church but to find her commands i answered we must i suppose hearken each to his own branch of the church her lords commands are hers hear thou him the day is coming daughter when the scriptures of gods word shall be all rendered into english tongue and i firmly trust shall be accessible to every man that chooses to know them pray thou heartily for that day and meanwhile keep thou close following christs steps to the best of thy knowledge and entreat him for pardon of all unknown sins and when the light of day is fully come and the blessed lamp of holy writ placed in the hands of the people then come to the light that thou mayest clearly see for then woe woe upon him that tarrieth in the shadow if the light that is in thee be darkness what darkness can equal it father said i i thank you for you have much comforted me all this while have i been trying not to love folks and i find it full hard to do battle with thy sins daughter and let thy love alone i counsel thee to beware of one thing of which many need no warning to beware i think thou dost a thing is not sin because it is comfortable and pleasant it is not good because it is hard or distasteful why mortify thy will when it would do good it is the will to sin which must be mortified when christ bade his disciples to love their enemies he did not mean them to hate their friends true love must needs be true concern for the true welfare of the beloved how can that be sin it is not love which will help man to sin that love cometh of sathanas and is earthly sensual devilish but the love which would fain keep man from sinthis is gods love to man and man cannot err in bestowing it on his brother but is it sin father to prefer one in love above another it is sin to love man more than god short of that love any one and any how that ever thou wilt the day may come he brake off suddenly i looked up there were wedded priests in england not an hundred years ago note he said in a low voice and there were no monks nor nuns in the days of the apostles the time may comefiat voluntas tua filia pax tibi thus gently dismissed i rose up and came back into the illuminatingroom where i found joan gathering together her brushes and other gear the last time she said sadlyfor she returns to her home tomorrow why is it that last times are always something sorrowful i am going home to my ralph and the children and am right glad to do it and yet i feel very mournful at the thought of leaving you dear mother annora must it ever be so in this life till we come to that last time of all when setting forth on the voyage to meet christ our lord we yet say farewell with a pang to them we leave behind i reckon so dear heart said i sighing a little but father mortimer hath comforted me by words that he saith are from holy writto wit that he which loveth god should love his brother likewise i always wanted to love folks and always did it dear mother said joan with a laugh casting her arms around my neck for all those chains of old rules and dusty superstitions which are ever clanking about you and i am going to love you whatever rules be to the contrary and of whomsoever made oh why did ill folks push you into this convent when you might have come and dwelt with ralph and me and been such a darling grandmother to my little ones there now i did not mean to make you look sorrowful i will come and see you every year if it be only for an hours talk at the grating and my lady who is softhearted as she is roughtongued will never forbid it i know never forbid what thou losenger flatterer joan turned round laughing dear my lady you are ever where man looketh not for you but i am sure you heard no ill of yourself you will never forbid me to visit my dear mother annora you love her and you love me truly a pretty tale saith my lady pretending as i could see to look angry now dont try to be angered with me said joan for i know you cannot now i must go and pack my saddlebags and mails trunks she went thence with her light foot and my lady looked somewhat sadly after her i love thee do i child saith she in another tone ah if i do thou owest it less to anything in thee than to the name they wed thee in help us mother of mercy time was when i thought i too should one day have been a greystoke well well god be merciful to us poor dreamers and poor sinners too then with slower step than she is wont she went after joan my child is gone and i feel like a bereaved mother i shall see her again if it please god but what a blank she has left she says when next lent comes if god will she will visit us and maybe bring with her her little laurentia that she named after my lost love because she had eyes like his god bless her my child joan sister roberga set forth for shuldham the same day in company with father benedict who desired to travel that road and in charge of two of the brethren and of sister willa i trust she may some day see her errors and amend her ways but i cannot felicitate the community at shuldham on receiving her so now we shall slip back into our old ways so far as can be under a prioress who assuredly will let none of us suffer the moss to grow upon her body or soul so far as she can hinder it i hear her voice now beneath in the lower corridor crying to sister sigred who is in the kitchen today did ever man or woman see the like burning seacoal on the kitchenfire dost thou mean to poison us all with that ill smoke note and wood in the woodhouse more than we shall use in half a year forty logs came in from the king only yesterday and ten from my lord of lisle the week gone sister sigred when shall i put any sense in you i dont know madam im sure was poor sister sigreds rather hopeless answer i have found out at last what the world is i am so glad i asked father mortimer and i told him how puzzled i was about it my daughter said he thou didst renounce three things at thy baptismthe world the flesh and the devil the works of the flesh thou wilt find enumerated in saint pauls epistle to the galatians galatians verses and they are not love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance these are the fruits of the spirit what the devil is thou knowest let us then see what is the world it lies saith saint john in three things the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life what are these the lust of the flesh is not love for that is a fruit of the spirit it is selflove worshipping thyself comforting thyself advantaging thyself and regarding all others as either toys or slaves for that great idol thyself the lust of the eye is not innocent enjoyment of the gifts of god doth a father give gifts to his child in order that she may not use and delight in them it lies in valuing his gifts above his will taking the gift and forgetting the giver robbing the altar of god in order to deck thine idol and that idol thyself covetousness love of gain pursuit of profit to thyselfthese are idolatry and the lust of the eye the pride of lifewhat is this once more decking thyself with the property of god show and grandeur pomp and vanity revelling and follyall to show thee to aggrandise thee to delight thee the danger of abiding in the world is lest the world get into thee and abide in thee beware of the thought that there is no such danger in the cloister the world may be in thee howsoever thou art out of the world a queen may wear her velvet robes with a single eye to the glory of god and a nun may wear her habit with a single eye to the glory of self fill thine heart with christ and there will be no room left for the world fill thine heart with the world and no room will be left for christ they cannot abide together they are contrary the one to the other thou canst not saunter along the path of life arminarm with the world in pleasant intercourse her face is not toward the city of god if thine be ye must go contrary ways how can two walk together except they be agreed what direction to pursue and remember thou art one and the world is many she is strong enough to pull thee round thou art not at all likely to change her course and the peril of such intercourse is that the pulling round is so gradually effected that thou wilt never see it but how am i to help it father by keeping thine eye fixed on god set the lord alway before thee so long as he is at thy right hand thou shalt not be moved father mortimer was silent for a moment and when he spoke again it was rather to himself or to god than to me alas for the church of god he said the time was when her baptismal robes were white and spotless when she came out and was separate and touched not the unclean thing hath god repealed his command thus to do in no wise hath the world become holy harmless undefiledno longer selfish frivolous carnal earthbound nay for it waxeth worse and worse as the end draws nearer woe is me has the church stepped down from her high position as the elect and select company of the sons of god because these daughters of men are so fair and bewitching is she slipping back sliding down dipping low her once high standard of holiness to the lord bringing down her aim to the level of her practice because it suits not with her easy selfishness to gird up her loins and elevate her practice to what her standard was and ought to be and she gilds her unfaithfulness forsooth with the name of divine charity saying peace peace when there is no peace what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many they cry speak unto us smooth thingsand the lord hath put none such in our lips the word that he giveth us that must we speak and it is come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues ye cannot remain and not partake the sins and if ye partake the sins then shall ye receive the plagues what god hath joined together let not man put asunder note thank god for this light upon my path for coming from his word it must be light from heaven o my lord thou art love incarnate and thou hast bidden us to love each other thou hast set us in families and chosen our relatives our neighbours our surroundings from thine hand we take them all and use them and love them in thee for thee to thee we are taught of god to love each other we only love too much when we love ourselves or when we love others above thee and the command we have of thee is that he who loveth thee love his brother alsothe last word we hear from thee is a promise that thou wilt come again and take ustogether allnot to separate stars but to be with thee for ever amen lord jesu christ so let it be it is several weeks since i have seen margaret otherwise than in community but tonight i heard the timid little rap on my door and the equally timid annora which came after when margaret says that word in that tone she wants a chat with me and she means to inquire deprecatingly if she may have it come in darling i said since father mortimer gave me leave to love any one any how so long as i put god first i thought i might say darling to margaret she smiledi fancied she looked a little surprisedand coming forward she knelt down at my feet in her favourite attitude and laid her clasped hands in my lap is there some trouble margaret no dear annora only little worries which make one feel tired out nothing to be properly called trouble i am working under mother ada this week andwell you know what she is i do not wish to speak evil of any one onlysometimes one feels tired so i thought it would help me to have a little talk with my sister annora art thou weary too i think i am rested dear said i father mortimer has given me a word of counsel from holy writ and it hath done me good he hath given me many an one she saith with a smile that seemed half pleasure and half pain and i am trying to live by the light of the last i hadi know not if the words were holy writ or no but i think the substance wasif christ possess thee then shalt thou inherit all things she was silent for a moment with a look of faraway thought and i was thinking that a hundred little worries might be as wearying and wearing as one greater trouble suddenly margaret looked up with a laugh for which her eyes apologised i could not help thinking she said that i hope all things have a limit to inherit mother adas temper would scarcely be a boon all good things said i yes all good things she answered that must mean all things that our lord sees good for uswhich may not be those that we see good for ourselves but one thing we knowthat if we be his that must be first of all himselfhe with us here we with him hereafter and next to that comes the promise that they which are christs with whom we have to part here will be brought home with us when he cometh there is no restriction on the companying of the fathers children when they are gathered together in the fathers house i knew what she saw and i saw the dear grey eyes of my child joan but behind them other eyes that mine have not beheld for fifty years and that i shall see nextand then for everin the light of the golden city softly i saidnote hic breve vivitur hic breve plangitur hic breve fletur non breve vivitur non breve

queen but she corresponds with her motherinlaw and they exchange gifts the most frequent guests are joan countess of surrey and the countess of pembroke there were then three ladies living who bore this title but as letters are sent to her at dennyher pet convent where she often resided and finally diedit is evident that this was the countess marie the fair chatillon who not on her bridal morn but at least two years after mourned her bleeding love both these ladies were of french birth and were very old friends of isabelle the countess of surrey was with her when she died her youngest daughter joan queen of scotsan admirable but unhappy woman who had to forgive that mother for being the cause of all her misery and loveless lifespent much of this last year with isabel her most frequent male guests are the earl of tankerville and marshal daudenham both of whom were probably her own countrymen and sir john de wynewyk treasurer of york the captive king of france visits her once and she sends him two romances of which one at least was from the morte arthur oblations are as numerousand sometimes more costlyas in her earlier accounts she gives shillings pence to the head of the eleven thousand virgins and shillings to minstrels to play before the image of the blessed mary in the crypt of canterbury cathedral friars who preach before her are usually rewarded with shillings pence her easter robes are of blue cloth her summer ones of red mixed cloth two of isabelles ruling passions went with her to the graveher extravagance and her love of making gifts her purchases of jewellery are vast and costly during this year up to the very month in which she died two of the latest being a gold chaplet set with precious stones price pounds the most expensive i ever yet saw in a royal account and a gold crown set with sapphires alexandrian rubies and pearls pounds expressly stated to be for her own wearing two ruby rings she purchased exactly a fortnight before her death she was probably ill for some weeks since a messenger was sent in haste to canterbury to bid master lawrence the physician repair to hertford to see the state of the queen and he remained there for a month medicines were brought from london judging from the slight indications as to remedies employed among which were herbal baths she died of some cutaneous malady her inquisition states that her death took place at hertford august rd but the household book twice records that it was on the nd fourteen poor men watched the corpse in the chapel at hertford for three months and in december the coffin the entire cost of which was pounds shillings pence was brought to london guarded by torches and buried in the church of the grey friars it may be stated with tolerable certainty that the queen was not confined for life at rising castle though she passed most of her time either at rising or hertford that she never became a nun as asserted by some modern writers the nonseclusion the coloured robes and the crown being totally inconsistent with this supposition that if it be true as is said that she was seized with madness while mortimer hung on the gallows and passed most of her subsequent life in this state probably with lucid intervalsa story which various facts tend to confirmthis was quite sufficient to account for her retirement from public life and ordinary restriction to a few country residences yet that the incidents chronicled in the household book seem to indicate that she was generally if not fully sane at the time of her death

his queen from september to the december following are sadly at variance with fact the dates of death of the despensers as well as various minor matters depend on the accurate fixing of these points the popular account generally accepted states that the queen landed at orwell in septemberthe exact day being disputedthat the king on hearing of it hastened to the west and shut himself up in bristol castle with his daughters and the younger despenser that the queen hanged the elder despenser and the earl of arundel before their eyes on the th of october whereupon the king and the younger despenser escaped by night in a boat some add that they were overtaken and brought back others that they landed in wales and were taken in a wood near llantrissan much of this is pure romance the kings household roll which names his locality for every day and is extant up to october th the wardrobe accounts supplying the subsequent facts distinctly shows that he never came nearer bristol on that occasion than the road from gloucester to chepstow that on the th of october he was yet at cirencester that he left gloucester on the th reaching chepstow on the th whence he departed on the th versus aquam de weye and therefore in the contrary direction from bristol on the th and th he dates mandates from cardiff on the th and th from caerphilly on november nd he left caerphilly this we are distinctly told in the wardrobe accounts on the rd and th he was at margan abbey and on the th he reached neath where he remained up to the th he now appears to have paid a short visit to swansea whence he returned to neath where on the th his cousin lancaster and his party found him and took him into their custody with hugh le despenser and archdeacon baldok they took him first to monmouth where he was found by the bishop of hereford sent to demand the great seal probably about the rd thence he was conveyed to ledbury which he reached on or about the th and on the th of december he was at kenilworth where he remained for the rest of his reign the queen landed at orwell in september speed says on the th robert of avesbury the th most authorities incline to the nd which seems as probable a date as any the king at any rate had heard of her arrival on the th and issued a proclamation offering to all volunteers shilling per day for a manatarms and pence for an archer to resist the invading force all past offenders were offered pardon if they joined his standard the murderers of sir roger de belers alone excepted and roger mortimer with the kings other enemies was to be arrested and destroyed only three exceptions were made the queen her son his father omits the usual formula of our dearest and firstborn son and even the title of earl of chester and the earl of kent queux nous volons que soent sauuez si auant come home poet according to froissart the queens company could not make the port they intended and landed on the sands whence after four days they marched ignorant of their whereabouts till they sighted bury saint edmunds where they remained three days miss strickland tells a rather striking tale of the tempestuous night passed by the queen under a shed of driftwood run up hastily by her knights whence she marched the next morning at daybreak this lady rarely gives an authority and still more seldom an exact reference on the th she adds the queen reached harwich robert de avesbury polydore vergil and speed say that she landed at orwell which the chronicle of flanders calls norwell if froissart is to be credited this certainly was not the place for he says that the tempest prevented the queen from landing at the port where she intended and that this was a mercy of providence because there her enemies awaited her the port where her enemies awaited her meaning thereby the husband whom she was persecuting was certainly orwell for on the second of september the king had ordered all ships of thirty tuns weight to assemble there moreover the queen could not possibly march from orwell at once to bury and harwich since to face the one she must have turned her back on the other the probability seems to be that she came ashore somewhere in orwell haven but whether she first visited harwich or bury it is difficult to judge the natural supposition would be that she remained quiet for a time at bury until she was satisfied that her allies would be sufficient to effect her object and then showed herself openly at harwich were it not that bury is so distant and harwich is so near that the supposition seems to be negatived by the facts from harwich or bury whichever it were she marched towards london which according to some writers she reached but the other account seems to be better authenticated which states that on hearing that the king had left the capital for the west she altered her course for oxford she certainly was not in london when the tower was captured by the citizens october th compotus willielmi de culpho wardrobe accounts edward the second since she dates a mandate from wallingford on the th unless bishop orleton falsified the date in quoting it in his apology thence she marched to cirencester and

bristolwhy did she go there at all if the king were at bristol but we know he was not he had then set sail for wales her object in going to bristol was probably twofold to capture le despenser and arundel and to stop the kings supplies for bristol was his commissariatcentre a cartload of provisions reached that city from london for him on the th note rot magne gard edward the second and his butler john pyrie went thither for wine even so late as november st ibidem is it possible that pyrie perhaps unconsciously betrayed to some adherent of the queen the fact that his master was in wales the informer we are told by the chroniclers was sir thomas le blount the kings seneschal of the household but that suspicious embassage of the abbot of neath and several of the kings corefugees noted on november th in terms which though ostensibly spoken by the king and dated from neath are unmistakably the queens diction and not his cannot be left out of the account in estimating his betrayers

october th which is given probably with truth by harl ms as the day of the judicial murder of hugh le despenser the elder our information concerning the queens movements is absolutely nil until we

and allerton she reached westminster on the th of january ibidem i have examined all the wardrobe accounts and rolls likely to cast light on this period but i can find no mention of the whereabouts of the two princesses during this time froissart says that they and prince john were delivered into the queens care by the citizens of bristol which is certainly a mistake so far as concerns the prince whose compotus just quoted distinctly states that he left the tower on october th which fixes the day of its capture quitted london on december st and reached wallingford on the th he therefore was no more at bristol than his father and only rejoined his mother as she returned thence the position of the royal sisters remains doubtful as even mrs everett greenusually a most faithful and accurate writerhas accepted froissarts narrative and apparently did not discover its complete discrepancy with the wardrobe accounts if the princesses were the companions of their royal father in his flight and were delivered to their mother when she entered bristolwhich may be the factthe probability is that he sent them there when he left gloucester on or about the th of october vi the order of sempringham the gilbertine order also called the order of sempringham was that of the reformed cistercians its founder was gilbert son of sir josceline de sempringham he was rector of saint andrews church in that village and died in the chief peculiarity of this order was that monks and nuns dwelt under the same roof but their apartments were entered by separate doors from without and had no communication from within they attended the priory church together but never mixed among each other except on the administration of the sacrament the monks followed the rule of saint austin the nuns the cistercian rule with saint benedicts emendations to which some special statutes were added by the founder the habit was for monks a black cassock white cloak and hood lined with lambskin for nuns a white habit black mantle and black hood lined with white fur there was a master over the entire order who lived at sempringham the mother abbey also a prior and a prioress over each community the prior of sempringham was a baron of parliament the site of the abbey three miles southeast from folkingham lincolnshire may still be traced by its moated area the abbey church of saint andrew alone now remains entire it is norman with an early english tower and a fine norman north door but few houses of the gilbertine order existed in england and those were mainly in yorkshire and lincolnshire

daughters alice and vivien and her damsels margaret and fina meliora the queens subdamsel hilda la vileyne and her relatives of all others the name and position at least are historical facts the fictitious persons in part two are more numerous being all the household of the countess of march except john inge the castellan and nichola damsel of the countess agnes the three despenser nuns mother alianora and the sisters annora and margaret and lady joan de greystoke are the only characters in part three which are not fictitious a difference in the diction will be noticed between part three and the earlier parts the last portion being more modern than the rest sister alianora must not be supposed to write her narrative which she could not do except by order from her superiors but rather to be uttering her reflections to herself since to her the natural language would be french there was no need to follow the contemporary diction further than by a quaint expression now and then to remind the reader of the period in which the scene is laid it may be remarked that the diction of parts one and two is not strictly correct this is true because to make it perfectly accurate would be to make it also unintelligible to nine out of ten readers and this not so much on account of obsolete words which might be explained in a note as of the entirely different turn of the phraseology an imaginary diary of the reign of elizabeth can be written in pure elizabethan language and with an occasional explanatory note it will be understood by modern readers but a narrative prior to at the earliest cannot be so treated the remaining possibilities are either to use as much of the correct diction of the period as is intelligible employing modern terms where it is not or else to write in ordinary modern english tastes no doubt differ on this point i prefer the former since i extremely dislike to read a mediaeval story where modern expressions alone are used in the dialogue the reader if himself acquainted with the true language finds it impossible to realise or enter into the story being constantly reminded that he is reading a modern fiction what i object to read therefore i object to write for the reading of others where circumstances as in this case make perfect accuracy impossible it seems to me the next best thing is to come as near it as they will permit the biographical details given in this appendix with few exceptions have not i believe been previously published for such information as may readily be found in dugdales baronage extinct peerages etcetera i refer my readers to those works the end note this document is mistakenly headed and catalogued as a compotus of leonor queen of edward the first it certainly belongs to queen philippa the internal
